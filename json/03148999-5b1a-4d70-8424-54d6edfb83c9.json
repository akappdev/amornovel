At the very least, she should be completely outraged, so totally ashamed of herself that she couldn\u2019t look away, and fleeing in fear of her endangered virginity.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be standing there, eyes wide, her senses so dazed she couldn\u2019t force herself to move, as she watched her half-brother\u2019s half-brother in the act of what appeared to be a very complicated sex position.</p><p>A m\u00e9nage.</p><p>She knew what it was called. She knew what it involved. But, Paige had to admit, she hadn\u2019t expected to see the object of her own fantasies involved with one.</p><p>She recognized the third, a cousin to the Mustafa family, Tariq. But her entire attention was focused on Abram Mustafa as he lay back on the bed, the woman he was fucking stretched out on top of him, her thighs straddling his hips, her head thrown back to rest against the shoulder of the other male behind her.</p><p>The dual penetration was obviously incredibly pleasurable for her. She was moaning, crying out.</p><p>Paige dared to allow her gaze to slip down once again, where she could glimpse the glistening, thick erections of the two men penetrating their lover. She swallowed tightly, her heart racing, her senses overloading with the sight, the sounds, the sheer implications of what she was seeing.</p><p>The total eroticism of the act drove the breath from her body, and she was still attempting to catch it, even as she fought to find the strength to look away.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t decide which she wanted to see more, Abram\u2019s face, twisted into a grimace of sublime pleasure, or the sight of his cock, glistening and slick with his lover\u2019s arousal as he pushed the heavy length home with hard, fierce thrusts.</p><p>Paige\u2019s pussy clenched, her thighs tightened. She wanted to moan herself at the sensations suddenly building in her body. She could feel her own juices building between her thighs, easing from her spasming vagina. Her breasts were swollen, her nipples hard and aching, her flesh sensitized as her buttocks tightened at the sight of the engorged cock working itself into the woman\u2019s rear.</p><p>She\u2019d never thought of allowing a man to take her there. She\u2019d heard about threesomes. There were rumorsf a certain sect of men in Alexandria and its neighbor, Squire Point, who shared their lovers, their wives\u2014and she\u2019d even heard rumors that her half-brother, Khalid, who she thought of as her brother, was involved with this sect. But, she had never really believed it, until now.</p><p>No, Abram wasn\u2019t her brother, and the man sharing the lover he was possessing wasn\u2019t her brother. But, she had also heard that Khalid and Abram had often shared their women after the death of Abram\u2019s first wife, Lessa.</p><p>Had Abram and Khalid shared Lessa? No one seemed to know for certain. Now, Paige believed that they had.</p><p>Abram shared his lovers.</p><p>And he did it so well.</p><p>As she watched, his fingers curved around the woman\u2019s breast, lifting it as his head ducked to the hardened, straining tip of her nipple.</p><p>He brushed aside a heavy swath of long, rich blond hair with his nose before his tongue reached out, curled around the hard tip, then covered it with his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Abram. Yes, fuck me. Fuck me harder.\u201d The woman reached back, one hand clamping to the hip of the male behind her as she cried out for more.</p><p>Abram\u2019s cheeks hollowed as he sucked at her nipple, his hands gripped her hips, his hips moved harder, faster, thrusting inside her with hard, even strokes as he began to do just as the girl asked. To fuck her harder, to fuck her deeper.</p><p>And she could have imagined much more to say, to cry out, if she were the one sandwiched between the two men.</p><p>If she were with Abram. If she was the one causing that look of intense and utter pleasure.</p> <p>Paige would do anything. She would give whatever he asked to see that look on his face for her.</p><p>Biting her lip, she had to fight to hold back a moan as she heard the broken male groan that left his lips as he pulled back from the woman\u2019s breast.</p><p>Pulling her head to him, he whispered something in her ear, something that had her crying out his name, her body tightening, a wild cry leaving her lips as she seemed to tense to a point that Paige wondered if she would break.</p><p>Her head jerked back as the two men thrust inside her harder, faster. She knew the second they began finding their release.</p><p>Or at least, the second Abram found his.</p><p>His head tipped back against the pillow, lips tightening, his face contorting into lines of pleasure and pain as he arched tighter into her.</p><p>Paige almost orgasmed herself. In the years she had been discovering her own body, she\u2019d never known anything as erotic, as sensual as seeing Abram, imagining he was touching her, filling her with his pleasure.</p><p>Her thighs clenched, her fingers balled into fists, and she bit off the need to cry out in feminine fury that she wasn\u2019t the one taking the pleasure Abram was giving.</p><p>And if she didn\u2019t get the hell out of there, there would be no way to hide her presence.</p><p>She was stepping back, her knees trembling, when his head suddenly turned, his black eyes opening.</p><p>As though he knew, or somehow sensed her presence, his gaze zeroed in on her. As she slipped out of the bedroom she saw them narrow as his expression turned sensual once again.</p><p>A purely primal, feminine part of her psyche raised its head, previously hidden, unaware, that part of her was suddenly certain that look had been for her, and for her alone.</p><p>Rushing into her bedroom Paige closed the door, her hand pressing into the panel as she drew in several hard, deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cAbram.\u201d She closed her eyes, his name slipping past her lips in what she recognized was a moment of pure sensual agony.</p><p>She was going to have to change her panties. She could feel her juices soaking the thin silk she wore beneath her jeans. Her clit was swollen, demanding attention and the clench of her thighs did nothing to help the pulsing ache centered there.</p><p>Paige was tempted to use the toy she had been given by one of her best friends.</p><p>It would ease, perhaps, the sensual pain flooding her, but she had been saving that last veil of innocence.</p><p>For Abram.</p><p>Her hands slipped beneath her white silk oversized blouse to find the hard tips of her nipples beneath the thin lace of her bra.</p><p>The touch of her own fingers had a gasp passing her lips. The pleasure was incredible, but still she knew, not as intense as the pleasure Abram would give her.</p><p>She cupped the mound and let her thumb stroke against the sensitive tip.</p><p>She was aching. So desperate for his touch.</p><p>She closed her eyes as a moan whispered past her lips.</p><p>Within seconds she had her jeans off and her panties sliding over her legs. She lay back on the bed she kept at Abram\u2019s apartment. Her fingernails raked through the silken curls between her thighs as she spread her legs further and fought to pretend it was Abram. To pretend that it had been her laying in that bed with him and Tariq, that it was her body accepting such pleasure.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t touch her gently. She had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t touch her lightly. Each touch would be firm, determined, dominant. It would border erotic pain, and agonizing pleasure.</p><p>He would control her body.</p><p>Her fingers returned to her breast, nails rasping her nipples before gripping it and pumping it erotically. Her head thrashed against the bed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>She needed more.</p><p>Parting the folds of her pussy she ran her fingers over her heavily juiced slit, moved upwards, circled her clit and ran a trail of pleasure around the bundle of nerves.</p><p>And still, it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>Desperate, muffled breathy cries were stopped in her throat, the sounds almost silent as she caressed her flesh, sliding downward, circling the entrance and dipping shallowly inside.</p><p>And once again, it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>The need was growing worse with each visit Abram made to Virginia, and now, she would never be able to forget the sight of him sharing his lover, or the pleasure that had contorted her face, as well as his.</p><p>She wanted it.</p><p>She wanted the extreme eroticism she had witnessed between Abram, his lover, and his cousin. She wanted Abram until she felt as though she were burning up inside. Perspiration dotted her body, it felt as though flames were licking over her flesh. Her pussy clenched, her juices spilling to her fingers as she pressed two together, uncaring of the veil of her virginity as she tucked them against the snug entrance.</p><p>Wood cracked against wood hard enough to cause her to pull her fingers free of her body and to jerk her upright in shock.</p><p>Eyes wide she stared across the room at the vision of pure male outrage, black eyes burning, his hair sensually tousled and laying around his face and shoulders like course midnight.</p><p>He moved across the room, stalking, predatory, the loose white pants he wore laying low on his hips, his cock jutting beneath it, thick and long, as he moved to the bed.</p><p>Paige stared back at him, her breathing harsh, the need so spike sharp now that fingers of hunger struck at her pussy with daggerlike intensity.</p><p>Abram\u2019s jaw clenched as he stopped at the side of the bed.</p><p>His fingers tightened, released, tightened again.</p><p>\u201cLie back.\u201d His voice was like an animal\u2019s growl.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d she tried to snap, but her voice weakened, the anger, pain, and desperation mixing to create a sound between a plea and a hoarse, broken demand.</p><p>\u201cI return there soon enough,\u201d he shot back, his voice sharp. \u201cFor this moment though, I will touch paradise no matter the curse to my soul for the trespass.\u201d</p><p>And before she could move, protest, or whimper an objection he gripped her legs, pulled her down along the bed and within a breath, he was stretching his long, powerful frame between her legs</p><p>There was no time to argue, to protest, or to push him away. There was no will to reject whatever touch, whatever pleasure he would give her.</p><p>His arms looped around her legs, pulling her thighs apart as his head lowered and his lips buried in her pussy.</p><p>\u201cAbram.\u201d Shocked, uncertain, the hard, burning waves of arousal began to pour over her and pleasure struck with fiery bursts through her system.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes,\u201d he whispered against the sensitive folds.</p><p>\u201cOh God, yes. Lick me!\u201d The words were torn from her lips. \u201cAbram. Abram please, make me come. Just make me come.\u201d</p><p>His lips surrounded her clit, sucking it into the liquid heat of his mouth with a firm, almost hard pressure that had her entire sensory system overloading.</p><p>Her knees bent, lifting, her heels digging into the mattress as waves of burning sensation began to tear through her. It was a pleasure that bordered pain, pouring through her body with a strength and a speed that she had no hope of depending her heart against.</p><p>Abram didn\u2019t ease her into it. He wasn\u2019t gentle and seductive. He wasn\u2019t teasing and tender. It was almost angry, an uncontrolled hunger that imprinted itself on the act with an eroticism that had her fighting for breath. His tongue flicking at the tiny bud, his mouth sucking it, wet heat and shocking, sharp pleasure tearing through the ultrasensitive bud until the rapture of it ripped through her with an explosion of such ecstatic pleasure Paige was certain somehow, she was lost. A part of her was no longer hers alone. A part of her now belonged to Abram, and that wouldn\u2019t be a good thing, because that part of her would now never be content with another man\u2019s touch.</p><p>As she drifted back to earth her lashes opened slowly, warily as she felt him drag himself from the bed.</p><p>He was still hard, his cock straining against the cloth of his pants, the tip damp, the flared crest clearly outlined.</p><p>His expression was enflamed, with anger or lust, she wasn\u2019t entirely certain.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me.\u201d He came down, his hands going on each side of her shoulders as his face came within inches of her, the pure fury lighting his gaze unmistakable now.</p><p>Paige flinched, her breath catching.</p><p>\u201cAbram,\u201d she whispered his name. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay the fuck away from me,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI don\u2019t care that you didn\u2019t mean to. I don\u2019t care that you burn with the same fucking hunger that\u2019s ripping my guts to shreds, stay the fuck away from me, Paige. If you care for your brother, if you have so much as a moment\u2019s drop of affection for me, then I beg of you, never tempt me to this length again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was such fury, such rage in his face that Paige could only stare back at him in bemusement.</p><p>There was no fear. She knew in the deepest recesses of her soul that Abram would never hurt her. He would never lift a hand to threaten her. But there was something in his gaze that warned her to beware, that there were far worse things to be frightened of than his anger.</p><p>But she also heard, felt, and saw the hunger in his gaze that assured her that he hadn\u2019t been lying about burning just as she did. He wanted her. He was aching for her.</p><p>\u201cDo the other women make the need any less sharp?\u201d she whispered painfully. \u201cTell me, Abram. Does taking another lover ease that hunger?\u201d</p><p>Would it ease hers? Would it stop the fantasies and make the restless need go away. Would finding her own lover help to stop each impulse of hunger that had her teasing him at every opportunity.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d There was no lessening of the anger, or the iron-hard determination in his expression. But what did change was the addition of painful knowledge that crossed his expression.</p><p>He knew exactly what she was asking. Just as he knew exactly why she had asked it.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d She forced him to move back or risk touching her as she came up, kneeling in the bed to stare back at him with her own anger now. \u201cDoes fucking those other women make it easier to bear the pain? Will acquiring a lover rather than saving my virginity for someone who doesn\u2019t want it, make it easier to bear?\u201d</p><p>For a second, for just a second, shock gleamed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cA virgin?\u201d he seemed to choke on the words before he gave his head a hard shake and moved away from her. \u201cSave your virginity for someone who deserves it.\u020d Self-disgust competed with the anger in his expression as he straightened and stared down at her, his jaw flexing, the muscle working furiously as he obviously fought whatever he was forcing himself not to say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d she said, her throat tight with the knowledge that it was something he may want, but he had no intentions of accepting.</p><p>She could want him until hell froze over. She could ache, she could need. And at this moment she might even hate him. Because it didn\u2019t matter how much she needed him, or how much he needed her, and she could see that need in his eyes, but he would walk away no matter what she said. No matter what she felt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right about what?\u201d he seemed to bite the words out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you don\u2019t deserve it,\u201d she said bitterly as she forced herself from the bed, found her panties and clothes and dressed hurriedly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell Khalid I was here. He\u2019ll only worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come to see Khalid?\u201d he questioned, his arms going over his chest as a glare settled on his face.</p><p>\u201cActually, I did.\u201d Buttoning the snug jeans she pushed her feet into her sandals before lifting her head and staring back at him, refusing to feel any shame or embarrassment. \u201cI came, because he hadn\u2019t told me you were here, and I just wanted to see you.\u201d The pain in her chest was overwhelming as emotion clogged her throat. \u201cHow insane was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsane,\u201d he snapped, his expression like stone.</p><p>She nodded to the response. \u201cExactly. So I\u2019ll just return to the house and pack. We\u2019re returning to Greece tonight.\u201d Regret welled inside her when his expression didn\u2019t even shift. No regret, nothing. \u201cI guess I won\u2019t be staying in Virginia this year after all.\u201d She let her gaze flick over him scathingly. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason whatsoever to stay.\u201d</p><p>She had to get out of there before she lost control of the tears that tightened her throat and threatened to fill her eyes. Turning on her heel she quickly unlocked the door before rushing out of the room and heading for the door and the hall that led to the elevator, and below, back to the safety her parents\u2019 home represented.</p><p>Her body still hummed with pleasure.</p><p>Her clit was still so sensitive and swollen that each step was an agony of sensation as it rubbed against the silk of her panties.</p><p>One more year. She would stay away from Virginia, her brother, and her dream of working in America for one more year. And pray it was enough time to rid herself of the emotional and the physical complications Abram Mustafa caused within her.</p> <p>Because if she didn\u2019t, then he just may well end up breaking her heart.</p><p>Abram watched her leave.</p><p>Staring from the window of the bedroom Khalid had given Paige for her visits, he watched as she appeared on the sidewalk, her white silk oversized blouse flattening against her slender body as the breeze whipped around it.</p><p>Flame-red hair whipped around her, like strands of burning silk, it blazed around her face, adding a splash of color to the otherwise dull reality that existed around him.</p><p>And with each step she took he could feel the bitterness growing inside him as he braced his palms flat on the high windowsill and buried the insane impulse to follow after her. If he did, he would drag her back to this bed and fuck her until nothing else existed for either one of them.</p><p>But reality would return. He couldn\u2019t delay it long enough to sate himself with his need for her, or to ensure her safety.</p><p>How much more was he to lose? How much more could one man bear to see broken in his life before he finally ceased to exist?</p><p>Paige was his last weakness, he thought, answering the question for himself. She was as bright as the sun that rose in the desert, warming those who existed around her, becoming the very essence of their lives if they gave her the chance. To allow his life to break her would be a far greater sin than any he may have committed so far.</p><p>To allow his sexuality to break her\u2014her innocence and her dreams\u2014would be the killing stroke. Because the need that would rise inside him to see her beneath a third, one Abram knew he could depend upon to protect her, to pleasure her, to ease her should he ever cease to be, would destroy the romantic dreams he knew Paige had. How could a woman accept that he never wanted to see another man fuck her with the same hunger that he felt to have her beneath him himself? How could a virgin accept the desires he fantasized of fulfilling with her?</p><p>Of seeing her beneath Tariq, watching as his dick buried in the sweet, fist-tight grip of her pussy. Of being inside her himself, filling her little cunt, experiencing the ripples of response in the too-tight muscles as Tariq filled her ass with his cock.</p><p>His entire body tightened with the thought of it. Of feeling her pussy pulse and flex and milk his dick until he couldn\u2019t hold back his release any longer. Until he came with the vicious, pounding spurts of seed that incited a pleasure so deep, so all-consuming it could never be forgotten. And he wanted nothing with any woman, especially with Paige, that could be forgotten.</p><p>She may have been aroused, she may be curious, but he couldn\u2019t see her craving that pleasure as he would crave giving her the pleasure, had he not gone as far as he had.</p><p>There was also the knowledge that the dark sexuality that was so much a part of him would accept nothing less. It was his own personal torment, that need that drove at him like an addiction he couldn\u2019t kick.</p><p>How could he tell her, explain to her, that to see her pleasure, to watch her as she slipped into that realm of sensuality that he had only seen a woman find when she was overwhelmed by two lovers, was more than he could deny himself. It was more than he could deny his lover.</p><p>That as long as there was a third, one as strong, as determined to protect her as he was, then what had happened to Lessa wouldn\u2019t have as great a chance of happening to her.</p><p>It was the mistake he and Khalid had made with Lessa. Abram had fought that side of him, fearing Lessa gave into his brother\u2019s touch because she knew it was what Abram wished. He had refused Khalid the privileges he would have given a third as well as the responsibilities of one. He hadn\u2019t told Khalid that he would be away from the province the day his brother had been caught unaware, beaten and left for dead, before Ayid and Aman had gone after Lessa.</p><p>But, as Khalid had warned him the day he realized Abram had seen Paige as a woman, she deserved more. She deserved a man who knew possessive love, who understood it. But even more importantly, a man who did not bring with him the shadow of death.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>Tariq stepped into the room behind him, his voice somber as he posed the question.</p><p>He, too, had seen her standing at the door, her eyes wide, face flushed, that look of drowning sensuality filling her expression the moment they had spilled their release into another woman\u2019s body.</p><p>In that expression he had seen the knowledge that it didn\u2019t matter the woman they were with, it didn\u2019t matter how he fought it, how he strove to deny it, each time he stepped foot in the U.S., there was only one face he searched for now. There was only one gaze he avoided with everything inside him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d he stated, wondering if he had effectively hid the regret that surged through him.</p><p>\u201cShe was angry?\u201d Tariq probed.</p><p>Abram gave a quick shake of his head. \u201cSurprisingly, no.\u201d</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t been angry. It had been disillusionment. It had been bitterness. It had been the knowledge that girlish dreams never came true no matter how desperately she fought to bring them to fruition.</p><p>They died. Painfully. Hurtfully. They were tromped beneath uncaring feet and left to wither by a world that didn\u2019t know true warmth.</p><p>And he had done no more than contibute to the cold that filled her gaze now, the disillusionment.</p><p>She was a woman searching for the dreams that filled her soul, and he couldn\u2019t be the man to fulfill those dreams, no matter his own wishes.</p><p>\u201cHas our companion left?\u201d he turned to Tariq, seeing the intent look on his cousin\u2019s expression.</p><p>Tariq had been watching him too closely of late whenever they were in Virginia, especially whenever Paige was present. As though he were searching for something, some affirmation of a suspicion.</p><p>Abram refused to give into the question in his third\u2019s gaze. They both desired her, and yet, he refused to act on that desire, or in Abram\u2019s case, that hunger.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s showering.\u201d Tariq shrugged his shoulders beneath the expensive cotton shirt he wore. \u201cShe seems discontent with your lack of attention now that your pleasure has been attained.\u201d</p><p>Now that his pleasure had been attained? His cock was still as hard as it had been the moment he stepped off the fucking plane. And it was still as hard as the moment he had stepped into Paige\u2019s bedroom to see her fingers preparing to thrust inside the heated depths of her pussy.</p><p>He had never imagined she was a virgin. Never imagined it, and now, had no idea how he could force himself to forget it.</p><p>\u201cSee her home, Tariq,\u201d Abram ordered. \u201cI\u2019ll await your return before leaving to meet with Director Jennings and Senator Mathews. I\u2019d like to give them the information we\u2019ve attained on Ayid and Aman quickly, before Azir realizes we have left Saudi entirely.\u201d</p><p>His brothers, Ayid and Aman. Younger half-brothers. Twins who shared a rabid rage and intellectual cruelty that never ceased to amaze him. And Azir, his father. How had he ever believed his father could have the smallest iota of kindness inside his blackened soul? Now, six months after the death of the wife Azir had forced him to marry, and the child she had carried, Abram found it almost impossible to keep from killing the old bastard. Especially after he learned exactly how involved his father had been in ensuring there were no heirs other than Abram before he turned thirty-six.</p><p>If there were other heirs, then Abram\u2019s death would not result in allowing Azir to turn the province over to the sons he preferred. The sons who shared his warped vision of the future of the world.</p><p>That vision had seen to the death of Abram\u2019s first wife, when he had been no more than twenty. It had seen to the death of his second wife, and his unborn child, two years later. And it would destroy any other woman Abram ever allowed himself to care for.</p><p>Just as Ayid and Aman would see to the death of any woman Khalid could love, other than his sister, Paige. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were cursed. The eldest sons of Azir bore the hatred and the fruits of malice that sprang from not just Azir, but also his youngest sons.</p><p>As Paige stepped into the back of the car in which she\u2019d ridden into the city, the driver closing the door solicitously behind her, Abram turned and met Tariq\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant the words to pass his lips, or the thought to torment him as it did.</p> <p>Watching her leave, watching that innocence, that hunger and zest for life, and for him, disappear, had driven home the fact that she could be taken forever if he weren\u2019t very very careful.</p><p>Tariq\u2019s lips quirked in amusement though, the bitterness and realization that tormented Abram wasn\u2019t a part of the other man\u2019s present thoughts.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be for long,\u201d Tariq assured him. \u201cIf that mark on your shoulder is any indication, you\u2019ve given her a taste of what you both hunger for. I have a feeling, Abram, Miss Galbraithe will return sooner than you think.\u201d</p><p>The mark?</p><p>His gaze jerked to his shoulder before he moved to the mirror atop the dresser next to him.</p> <p>There, on his shoulder, just as Tariq had stated, a love bite that marred his flesh deeper than he would have imagined she could have given without his knowledge.</p><p>It marked him far deeper than flesh alone.</p><p>He forced himself to turn away.</p><p>He forced himself to leave her bedroom.</p><p>He forced himself to forget those few, precious moments when his lips had caressed the softest flesh he had ever known, when his tongue had tasted pure, fiery ecstasy.</p><p>A taste that would linger in his senses forever.</p> <p>And a regret he knew he would never outrun.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected this, he thought, it had caught him unaware the day he had arrived to help her and her family celebrate her eighteenth birthday. When he had seen her in that simple sundress on the sunny Greek island where she and her family lived part of the year. With the tops of her breasts rising above the bodice of the dress, the tiny straps stretching over slender, graceful shoulders, and the red gold of her hair hanging to the middle of her back.</p><p>\u201cAbram,\u201d she had whispered his name with a breathy little sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Stars had gleaed in the emerald green of her eyes. Her face had flushed beneath the soft hint of the Mediterranean-bronzed flesh. Her skin wasn\u2019t as dark as her father\u2019s, but neither was it as light as her mother\u2019s. When combined with the silken flames of her hair, the combination was enough to daze a lesser man.</p><p>It was that day he had seen the woman she was. It was that day his cock had swelled, becoming so engorged, so torturously hot and tight he swore he\u2019d been on the edge of dizziness.</p><p>He almost grinned at that thought.</p><p>Almost. Because, he knew the fate that would await her.</p><p>He knew the hell he would revisit and this time never escape.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t have her, he couldn\u2019t allow his need to corrupt her, or his legacy to endanger her.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t keep his hunger for her from raging ...</p><p>1</p><p>EIGHT YEARS LATER</p><p>He was home. Finally.</p><p>Paige Galbraithe moved from the chaise positioned next to the balcony doors of her bedroom and stared at the lights that swept over the lawn.</p><p>The limousine moved with an almost stealthy slowness along the curved, oak-bordered drive. The lights swept over the landscaping like a cat burglar\u2019s penlight as the car neared the garage. The bright gleam disappeared into the three-story mansion Khalid owned in the heart of the exclusive section of Alexandria, Virginia, designed as Squire Point.</p><p>After ten days captivity in her brother\u2019s home, the rat had finally shown up. It was about time. She was rather sick of cooling her heels in the luxurious comfort of her brother\u2019s home rather than in her own apartment.</p><p>Collecting the silk robe she had left lying on the back of the chaise, Paige pulled it on quickly, covering the ankle-length, matching deep-violet gown she wore. Anger and determination made her movements jerky.</p><p>Ten days. She had waited ten days to confront him.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t answer his cell phone\u2014his fianc\u00e9e Marty was running interference\u2014but still, her brother wasn\u2019t talking to her. Marty assured her daily that she would get to tear a strip off his hide in person, and each day, he was a no-show.</p><p>\u201cRelax for a while, Paige...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKhalid will call soon...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have explanations when Khalid arrives...\u201d Even her parents refused to tell her what she needed to know, what she demanded each time they called to see how she was doing.</p><p>She was fed up with it. She was twenty-five years old; she wasn\u2019t a teenager. She was Khalid\u2019s sister, not some damned prisoner he could control. She was easy to work with, and she considered herself a very understanding person. But her patience had begun wearing thin a week ago.</p><p>Belting the robe furiously as she turned on her heel, Paige stalked across the bedroom and eased open the door before stepping into the hall. Moving to the stairs she stopped and waited, listening carefully.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to let him think that she was still awake and waiting on him. He\u2019d been slipping into the house after he was certain she was asleep, doing whatever he did, then slipping back out before she awoke.</p><p>The damned coward.</p><p>Abdul, or Abbie as she called him, his Saudi manservant, was always abjectly apologetic that he hadn\u2019t awakened her before Khalid left, as she had asked him to do. He had a million excuses, but she knew the truth. Khalid was his boss, and Khalid wasn\u2019t about to face her until she simply left him no choice.</p><p>They were working together\u2014Abbie, Marty, Khalid\u2019s security team, and even Khalid himself\u2014to keep her in place and completely in the dark as to why she was suddenly being held in what her brother called \u201cprotective custody.\u201d Even the U.S. marshal service wasn\u2019t this damned diligent.</p><p>Even her parents were refusing to help her. Her mother\u2019s fear for her only daughter, her \u201cbaby\u201d as she called her, had Marilyn Galbraithe going along with whatever her son had cooked up this time.</p><p>And that son hadn\u2019t even given his sister the courtesy of facing her and giving her a clue as to how long this would last, if there was an end in sight, or the details involving the danger she was facing.</p><p>She had a good idea. After all, she was well aware of the fact that his brother, Ayid, had finally played his final hand and attempted to murder Khalid and his fianc\u00e9e, Marty, less than a month before. Just as Ayid\u2019s twin, Aman, had gone after Abram in D.C. as he waited in a hotel to meet with FBI Director Zack Jennings and the Homeland Security Director to declare his U.S. citizenship based on his mother\u2019s status as an American citizen.</p><p>Instead, Khalid had killed Ayid, and Abram had killed his youngest brother, Aman. Though, to keep Abram\u2019s defection to the U.S. a secret, Khalid had taken the blame for both deaths.</p><p>She suspected this was why she was placed in isolation in the monstrous mansion her brother now owned. The mansion that shadather, Azir Mustafa, had bought for him.</p><p>She wanted to hear it from him, though. She wanted to know exactly why Azir Mustafa thought threatening her was going to gain him anything. And she wanted to know why the hell Khalid thought that destroying the life she was building for herself was going to help.</p><p>She\u2019d been all but imprisoned by her overprotective parents for far too many years. Her mother had been so terrified Paige would be kidnapped or taken, that she would disappear as had once happened to her, that she had kept Paige always in sight.</p><p>Bodyguards. Security-enhanced private schools. Private tutors. She\u2019d been so overprotected she had nearly smothered to death.</p><p>Escaping had taken every ounce of strength she had, because she loved her parents. Because even in their attempts to ensure her safety, she had always been aware of their love for her. Just as she had been of the nightmares they suffered from a past haunted by the horror of her mother\u2019s kidnapping, forced marriage and rapes at the hands of a monster. That monster had been the father of her half-brother\u2019s and the father of the man she couldn\u2019t push out of her mind or her fantasies.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me.\u201d His eyes blazing with black fury and none of the sexual satisfaction he should have felt after spilling himself only moments before into the lover he had shared with his cousin, Tariq. Only moments before he came to her. \u201cFor both our sakes, Paige, stay the fuck away from me!\u201d</p><p>That had been eight years ago. Eight years since he had buried his lips and tongue between her thighs and threw her into an ecstasy she still hadn\u2019t felt again. Not before and not since. Eight years since he had fucked her with his tongue yet, he had never even kissed her.</p><p>In those years she had taken a lover, she had finished college, and she had begun a career that she enjoyed. But still, there was a regret that lay inside her like a weight. The regret that came with so many \u201cwhat might have been\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Moving from her room to the stairs, she waited. Standing back from the steps just far enough that he couldn\u2019t see her, Paige peeked into the shadows below as he moved to the second floor, turned, and a few seconds later, she heard the door to his suite close.</p><p>Her lips tightened into a hard smile.</p><p>Ten days. It was ten days too long and she was damned tired of waiting, of being patient and fighting to understand why her parents and her brother had to live in fear of the day that Azir Mustafa or one of his family members would come after her.</p><p>Moving quietly, swiftly, she made her way to the second floor and the door of the master suite.</p><p>No lights shone from beneath the door, but that didn\u2019t mean anything. She\u2019d seen Khalid move in the dark as though he were born to itt&gt;</p><p>His brother, Abram navigated it as though he owned it though.</p><p>She shook that thought away. She was not going to think about Abram tonight. She was not going to allow the rest of her night to be as restless as her days had been with the fantasies and the memory of those stolen moments in her bedroom all those years ago.</p><p>This was the reason she refused to settle back and relax while she was here. It was the reason why she pushed herself to the point of exhaustion each night after work. To keep low the fires of arousal from building any higher.</p><p>Thinking of Abram was always a mistake. And desiring him showed a complete lack of judgment and had nothing to do with why she was here or why she was getting ready to skin her brother alive.</p><p>The worst thing she could do at the moment was allow thoughts of Abram to interfere with her determination to get the answers she needed, and to find a way to balance her family\u2019s fears with her own determination to have a life.</p><p>She needed a life. Without it, all she could think about, dream about and remember, was Abram and the feel of his lips sucking hard and tight at her clit as his tongue\u2014</p><p>She shook away the thought again.</p><p>Gripping the doorknob she checked it slowly, quietly. It wasn\u2019t locked. He wasn\u2019t busy with his fianc\u00e9e, or having wild monkey sex with her. He was obviously there alone, because she couldn\u2019t hear him talking and Marty didn\u2019t move as quietly in the dark as Khalid did. Besides, the door to his suite was always locked when they were in it together.</p><p>Easing the door forward stealthily, she all but tiptoed as she began to enter the room. Inside was dark, shadows lengthening through the narrow slits between the curtains, providing the barest hint of moonlight. Determination clenched her teeth a second before the door was jerked out of her hand, a manacle wrapped around her wrist, and in the next second she found herself flat against the wall as the door slammed closed.</p><p>Fight or flight.</p><p>Flight wasn\u2019t possible, and for the briefest, shocked second, she had no idea the identity behind the hard, masculine body pressing her into the wall. Calloused and rough, a broad hand covered her lips, muffling her cry as her knee slammed upward, almost but not quite managing to connect and slam her attacker\u2019s balls straight to his throat.</p><p>Instead, she found her knee blocked by a hard, extremely muscular thigh as it shoved its way between hers, pressed into the juncture and lifted her to her tiptoes. In the same breath she felt her attacker\u2019s head bend, strong teeth nipping her ear and drawing a shocked gasp from her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello to you too, hellcat.\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>It had been so long since she had heard his voice. The rich, dark, foreign flavor of it wrapping around her senses and sending a heavy, heated lethargy to settle in the depths of her sex.</p> <p>Memories washed over her.</p><p>His hands, calloused and strong, so dark against her thighs as his black hair, like roughened silk falling over her flesh as his lips moved over her clit. They had surrounded it, sucked it, lit a fire to it that had exploded through her system into an ecstasy she longed to revisit every second of her life.</p><p>Abram.</p><p>Beneath his palm her lips parted to drag in a hard, heavy breath as her body began to soften, to shape to the harder, stronger contours of his masculine body.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be doing this. He had avoided her for years, slipping in and out of Khalid\u2019s home and her life, and she had seen him only briefly, and always in the company of others.</p> <p>Without volition her hips relaxed, the mound of her pussy pressing against the hard upper leg shoved between her thighs as she felt her breasts harden, her nipples so sensitive they actually ached.</p><p>Pleasure skated through her system as her tongue peeked out to touch her lips, to touch his palm. Slightly salty, male, the taste of him exploded against her tongue as he jerked back from her just as suddenly.</p><p>Staring up at the darkened shadow of his face, seeing the glitter of his gaze, feeling the heat of his body, Paige found herself, probably for the first time in her life, unable to speak. She couldn\u2019t find the words, she couldn\u2019t fight past the emotions or the tightening of her throat as she stared back at him.</p><p>The need for his touch was a craving she couldn\u2019t resist. She couldn\u2019t deny it. It was like a drug and she had gone far too long without a fix.</p><p>Her lips parted, but no words came out. She couldn\u2019t let them, because she was terribly afraid those words would be a plea. That she would beg for things she wasn\u2019t certain how to ask for with this man. Things she knew she was probably better off without.</p><p>Her body sure as hell knew how to ask though. She was shocked, flushed with heat and had to forcibly keep her hips from rubbing against the hard flesh pressed into the mound of her pussy.</p> <p>And he knew it. His leg was tense, but each time her hips shifted against the firm muscle she swore he tightened further against her.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t letting her go. If anything, he was holding her tighter, perhaps, if she weren\u2019t mistaken, his leg was pressing more firmly against the suddenly heated, swollen folds between her thighs. And oh yes, it felt so damned good. That heated, slow rub against her, stroking her clit, sending bursts of incredible sensation ratcheting through her.</p><p>She had known over the years that this was coming. At the first opportunity. The moment he touched her, the very second they found themselves hidden from curious gazes. She had known this would happen. That the need and the hunger would rage out of control.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d squeaky, weak, her voice was nothing as it should have been. It didn\u2019t sound determined or confident as it usually did. And it sure as hell didn\u2019t sound independent and strong.</p><p>Swallowing tightly she tried again.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here? Where\u2019s Khalid?\u201d</p><p>She tightened her fingers against the hold he had on her wrists, though she found herself stopping short of actually straining against his hold. After all, if she protested too loudly, or struggled too much, he might actually let her go.</p><p>\u201cKhalid and Marty are with her parents.\u201d Deep, dark, she swore she actually trembled as he spoke. \u201cThey are completing the plans for your protection.\u201d</p> <p>Her protection? Right now, all she needed protection from was the brilliant heat she was helpless against.</p><p>\u201cHe should be here.\u201d Oh man, she was dying here. She could feel her blood racing, her flesh heating, her clit throbbing harder in demand with each second.</p><p>The longer she lay there beneath him, the more she wanted him. The more she wanted the sensations, the pleasure she had only had the briefest taste of eight years before.</p><p>\u201cShould he be?\u201d His fingers tightened, then relaxed against her hip a second before his palm cupped it, shifting her, moving her against his thigh. \u201cI think at this moment, it\u2019s a very good thing that he isn\u2019t here. Wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>A flash of fire streaked through her pussy, clenched the tightened muscles and almost stole her breath. Pleasure raged through her body, but it was a painful pleasure, an achy, needing-so-much-more sensation type of pleasure that it weakened her knees and had her breathing in roughly.</p><p>\u201cHe kidnapped me,\u201d she breathed out roughly. \u201cI\u2019m going to kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhen he arrives. Until then, I believe it might be time to see if your lips are as soft and as sweet as they appear to be. If they are anywhere as sweet as that hot, luscious little pussy I cannot forget the taste of.\u201d</p><p>Her entire body clenched in excitement at the declaration.</p><p>Then his head lowered.</p><p>Paige felt her lashes drift close, lips remaining parted, breath suspended as his lips brushed against the edge of her face, sending a rush of exquisite pleasure washing through her again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me,\u201d she accused him roughly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you do it. Khalid owes me explanations, Abram.\u201d</p><p>He owed her. She owed herself. She couldn\u2019t let him do this to her or once he was gone, there would be nothing left of her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s protecting you,\u201d he stated, though his voice sounded rougher, more strained as his lips moved to her ear, his breath stroking across the shell as he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re in danger, Paige, you should have guessed that by now.\u201d</p><p>In danger of screaming in need. Of begging for his touch. Of whimpering with the painful hunger she couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>\u201cGuessed what?\u201d She hoped he didn\u2019t actually expect her to be able to think at the moment, because it wasn\u2019t happening. But she couldn\u2019t imagine a single reason why she would be in danger.</p><p>Unless it was in danger of dying of arousal. As of this moment, that was definitely a consideration. In all her adult years she had never felt this way with another man, had never ached or lost her breath, or felt on fire as she did now. And never had she been so certain she may lose herself in another person.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re in danger.\u201d There was a thread of amusement in his voice now, the knowledge of it sweeping through her with the same force the hunger had swept through her moments before.</p><p>Amusement was the last thing she could have felt as he held her, as the thrill of touching him, of being touched by him, held her captivated.</p><p>Clenching her teeth she tensed, trying to pull back, to put just a breath between their bodies as she attempted to find her control somewhere in the morass of aching hunger and need assailing her.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it just her luck to be so aroused by a man while his own arousal, his own needs, were so obviously distant, just as they had been before. It was the story of her life where Abram was concerned. From the time she\u2019d realized she wanted those devilish, sexy lips of his on her, he\u2019d been either furious or amused by her.</p><p>\u201cIn danger of killing Khalid perhaps,\u201d she forced out. \u201cWould you please let me go now? Get off me, Abram. I\u2019m not in the mood for your games.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his cheek against her hair as though considering her request for long moments. \u201cPerhaps, I like you fine as you are,\u201d he finally stated. \u201cI like how you feel against me, Paige Eleanora Galbraithe. Do you know how the memory of those very few stolen moments have tormented me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd perhaps I think by now I know better,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. \u201cStop playing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, Paige, love, this is far beyond playing. This is the reason why I have fought against your touch. Because I can feel my control going straight to hell just from the simple act of holding you against me. How can I convince you how much I enjoy the feel of you against me?\u201d</p><p>How she felt against him? Or the fact that for the barest few moments, she\u2019d been unable to tell him what an ass he was being?</p><p>At the moment, he wasn\u2019t being his normal, mocking self, but she could sense that beast ready to spring forth. And once it did, their confrontations could turn brutal. His mocking, hers loud. They\u2019d been known to rip at each other for hours, like little children poking at each other to gain dominance.</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re on the verge of laughing your ass off, Abram. Let me go.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened on her wrists for a second as she felt tension hardening his body further. Against her lower stomach his cock felt harder, hotter, his body more insistent as he seemed closer, blanketing her like a sensual, muscular beast.</p><p>\u201cNot at you.\u201d His voice was suddenly lower, the feel of his heart racing at her breast as he pulled her closer against him with the hand at her hip. \u201cAt myself, hellcat. Because no matter how hard I try to pull away from you, I want nothing more than to sink inside you.\u201d</p><p>The second the words passed his lips they were covering hers. His body shifted, his free hand pulling her farther up his thigh, working it against the swollen folds as her gown pooled around his leg. The silk of her panties saturating with her juices as she strained closer to him. Her clit heated with a fiery intensity. Her pussy clenched, tightened, the muscles ached with a desperation to be filled and every cell in her body sizzled with the need to be touched.</p><p>Pleasure rose fast and hard inside her. Heart racing, blood pounding through her system as her lips parted, her head falling back as he possessed her with his kiss.</p><p>Every thought of protest flew out the window. Past angers, conflicts, and confrontations were gone. With her wrists secured to the wall, his thigh pressed between hers, and his lips and tongue caressing and owning every pulse of sensuality, he was drowning her. Paige could feel herself weakening into the promise of the remembered ecstasy.</p><p>Dominance swirled from him. It was a wave of heat wrapping around her and sinking into her flesh as his lips rubbed and caressed hers. His tongue licked at hers, dipping in, tasting and caressing until Paige found herself arching up to him, moaning for more.</p><p>The only place his hands touched her were at her wrists, and again at her hip. The rest of his body stroked her though. His rd chest against her breasts, his thigh pressed between hers.</p><p>Each flex of his leg stroked the hard muscle against her pussy, her clit, sending incredible pleasure racing through each nerve ending as she arched to be closer.</p><p>She had to get closer to him.</p><p>The need for the heat, for the pleasure was rushing through her like a tornado. She was dying for more of him. For another taste of him. His kiss was like an aphrodisiac, spicy and addictive as his lips slanted over hers and he kissed her with a pure, sensual hunger that she couldn\u2019t have dreamed existed.</p><p>The restraint at her wrists should have made her nervous. No man had ever restrained her. She would have never allowed it until now.</p><p>Until Abram.</p><p>Until the feel of him against her, until his hands restrained her and his kiss made her like it.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean she was submitting easily. Even amidst the incredible starbursts of pleasure. On a primitive, primal level, Paige could sense the battle that could brew between them. The one that had been shaping for years now.</p><p>How dominant he could be.</p><p>How submissive she would never allow herself to be.</p><p>She nipped at his tongue as he licked over hers again, causing his head to jerk back, his gaze to narrow in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire.\u201d There was a growl in his voice that sent a shiver racing up her spine.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you playing with?\u201d It was all she could do to keep the tremors from her voice, from her fingers as he held them above her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t start this, Abram, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started this eight years ago, Paige,\u201d he rasped. \u201cEight years and the taste of the sweetest pussy I\u2019ve had touched my tongue to. You torment me. And now, there is no choice but to anger you in our attempt to ensure your security.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you think you and Khalid can just kidnap me and get the hell away with it? That you can kiss good enough to make up for it?\u201d</p><p>She had to force herself not to let a shiver of pleasure race through her body as his fingers moved over her hip before inching closer to her thigh. To where the silk of her gown fell away from her flesh at the point that her knee had bent, lifting to clasp his thigh, to rub herself against him.</p><p>She had to fight to maintain her senses, to control the need to sink back into his kiss, to allow him to sink into her, however she could convince him to do it.</p> <p>But she knew this man. Dominant. Powerful. A force to be reckoned with in a world so different from her own that it may as well be an alien planet.</p><p>\u201cKidnapped you? I?\u201d Amazement filled his voice, and perhaps just a hint of anger. \u201cHad I kidnapped you, hellcat, you would well know it,\u201d he finally scoffed, and the anger was readily apparent just as his accent became stronger.</p><p>Thankfully, his fingers relaxed. He stepped back slowly before reaching to the side and flipping the lights on as he released her.</p><p>For a second, she was blinded. Her eyes snapped closed and when she opened them again a second later, he was halfway across the room and heading for the bar.</p><p>For a drink. She was tempted to join him.</p> <p>He moved like a predator.</p><p>Paige watched as he stalked almost lazily across the expensive, pearlesent carpeting to the bar on the other side of the room.</p><p>Without turning back, he poured a whiskey from the looks of it, and if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, it was Khalid\u2019s finest.</p><p>His head tilted back as he took a hard drink. Thick, heavy black hair fell nearly to his shoulders, the blue-black strands silky and glistening in the bright overhead light.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here before I insult Khalid by fucking you in his bed,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cTalk about a mood change.\u201d Her eyes rolled as he shot her a hard, half angry look from the corner of his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cNot nearly enough of a change to keep from fucking my brother\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Paige blinked back at him. \u201cDamn, that sounded almost depraved, Abram. Would you like to rephrase?\u201d</p><p>He turned. Male grace and predatory strength. And pulsing, blazing, male lust.</p><p>She could feel her pussy creaming, saturating her panties further and sensitizing her clit to the point of painful need.</p><p>Just the sight of him was enough to make her ache, to make her crave with a strength and a power that made her knees weak.</p><p>He was tall, broad, and muscular. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of fat on his six-four frame, or beneath the exceptionally soft white shirt and well-worn jeans.</p><p>Finishing the whiskey he sat the glass on the bar behind him, his gaze never leaving hers. She could feel that look through every inch of her body. Sensitized and aching for his touch, her sk felt too tight, constricting as she tried to still the rapid rise and fall of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cRephrasing isn\u2019t the only thing I\u2019d like to do, or may attempt to do.\u201d The heavy warning in his voice was followed by a heavy-lidded glance along her body.</p> <p>Hell, she may as well have been naked. Unfortunately, there was a part of her that wished she was naked.</p><p>Paige didn\u2019t have to look down to see that her nipples were trying to burrow their way through the silk of her gown.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to tug the robe over the swollen curves or even pretend a shame she didn\u2019t feel. And it wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d been forced to face Abram as an independent woman rather than the submissive child he often expected her to portray.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was rarely shocked by her anymore.</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes now any different from the past years? There was a time when I would have welcomed your touch, Abram, but now I can\u2019t help but be suspicious. What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides your determination to acquire that spanking I keep promising you with?\u201d He spoke as though he were serious.</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises. My ass stopped tingling in anticipation years ago.\u201d She waved the comment away. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that unless you tell Khalid\u2019s goons out there to get out of my face and let me go home, I\u2019m going to have every one of you brought up on charges. That wouldn\u2019t please your daddy, Abram. Last I heard old man Azir was already pissed because you were refusing to remarry for the sake of a child.\u201d</p><p>Her ass had stopped tingling in anticipation? Abram nearly came in his damned jeans with that comment. His cock hardened to pure iron, the head throbbed, and if there wasn\u2019t pre-cum in his jeans, then he wasn\u2019t iron hard.</p><p>Paige watched his black eyes flare with renewed lust. A perfectly arched, perfectly male black brow rose lazily. \u201cAre the phones in the house not working?\u201d He all but smirked as he ignored her last comment.</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be nice about this, Abram. Don\u2019t make me call the authorities.\u201d</p><p>He waved his hand toward the phone on a nearby desk in invitation. \u201cI didn\u2019t kidnap you, Paige. Daniel Conover and his security team did so, at your brother\u2019s orders and with FBI Director Zachary Jennings\u2019s approval. Would you like to call the authorities now, hellcat?\u201d</p><p>She glared back at him irritably. \u201cStop calling me that.... And it would likely do just as much good to call the cops now as it would to call Khalid,\u201d she snapped. \u201cGet me out of herethis, Ab#x201D;</p><p>She was desperate. If she had to stay locked up even one day longer she was going to go crazy. There was nothing to do here. No way to focus her energy or to stop fantasizing about this man who seemed intent on dancing through her mind at all hours of the day and night.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t find a way to return home, to get back to her job\u2014knowing now that Abram was the one slipping into the house at night\u2014then she might end up making the biggest mistake of her life.... begging him to take her to his bed and to finish what he had started eight years before.</p><p>\u201cTake me home.\u201d She crossed her arms over her breast and stared back at him firmly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d He shook his head, his expression suddenly somber. \u201cRelax, Paige. Enjoy a nice vacation for a few more weeks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeeks!\u201d Her eyes widened as amazed disbelief flashed through her and rejection instantly snapped through her mind. \u201cHell no!\u201d Her hands went to her hips as she confronted him furiously now. \u201cI have a job, Abram. I have a life...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you leave here.\u201d His tone was suddenly ominous, his expression hardening as though he knew the danger she would face, whatever it may be.</p><p>She was damned glad someone knew what was going on, because she sure didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>She could feel a premonition of danger then, even stronger than what she had felt in the past ten days.</p><p>Khalid wouldn\u2019t just kidnap her without a reason. A part of her had known that whatever was going on was more than simply a suspicion of danger. It was more than a threat against Khalid and Abram.</p><p>Abram moved back to her slowly, his expression flashing with frustration, irritation, before slowly smoothing out to an icy calm that sent a chill of dread racing up her spine.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I leave, Abram?\u201d she whispered as she fought the edge of fear threatening to spread through her now. She knew her brother had been having some problems with his and Abram\u2019s two younger half-brothers, but surely those problems didn\u2019t extend to a threat to her? Besides, weren\u2019t they dead now?</p><p>\u201cBecause your name was found among papers of a certain terrorist, Paige. Until we learn why\u2014\u201d His voice lowered, his expression becoming heavy, sensual, and filled with hunger. \u201cUntil we know for certain, you are too precious to risk.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed in his eyes, something dark and dangerous as his hand lifted, his fingers sliding beneath the shoulder of her robe, the callouse, heated pads of his fingers caressing beneath the silken material.</p><p>\u201cAbram.\u201d Too precious to risk? He\u2019d said it as though he meant it, as though she were actually precious to him.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t let herself believe that. She and Abram had had far too many confrontations over the years to ever believe she was anything more than an irritant, and for the moment, perhaps, a desire.</p><p>Focusing on the intimate touch, on the pleasure, was something she eagerly embraced now as she fought to distance herself from the information he had just given her. The knowledge that a terrorist had somehow focused on her.</p><p>The question of why raged in the back of her mind as she deliberately forced herself to focus on the desire instead.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think she wanted to know why. Not yet. Not until she could still the horrible foreboding, the fear threatening to overtake her.</p><p>Throughout the years she had teased, irritated, and deliberately provoked him. She winked at him when he was somber, blew kisses at him when he was angry, and that was just when she had been little more than a child and he an eighteen-year-old man of the world in her eyes. And now, he was the man she couldn\u2019t get out of her dreams, or out of her fantasies.</p><p>Paige stood still, silent, as Abram\u2019s fingers caressed from her shoulder to her neck, stroking her flesh as though he enjoyed the feel of it. His gaze locked with hers, his eyes somber, intent, and a flash of fiery hunger filled them as he pushed his fingers into her hair.</p><p>He cupped the back of her head, holding her in place as his head lowered slowly. Paige felt her lips part, her heart striking harder against her chest as it raced out of control.</p><p>\u201cLet me taste you again, Paige,\u201d he whispered, his lips nearly touching hers. \u201cI see you staring at me with such innocence, and with such hunger. All that\u2019s saved you these past years has been Khalid\u2019s diligence in keeping us apart.\u201d His lips touched hers. \u201cKhalid isn\u2019t here now to save you, precious.\u201d</p><p>Paige felt her lips part helplessly.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t there eight years ago,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd you took another woman instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, all I remember of that day was how wet and sweet you were,\u201d he retorted sensually. \u201cAre you still as sweet?\u201d His lips brushed against hers. \u201cAre you still as wet?\u201d</p><p>She should be questioning him. She should be outraged. She should be frightened and trying to figure out a way to stay safe without remaining a prisoner in her brother\u2019s home and for the moment in Abram\u2019s arms.</p><p>Instead of questioning him, though, her lips were parting for him, a shaky moan leaving them as he pulled her to him firmly and deepened the intimate possession. A kiss that lacked the dominance of moments before, as well as the demand. This kiss seduced, it cajoled. His lips and tongue rubbed against hers, tasted hers and within seconds her hands were gripping his shoulders, nails biting into his flesh as she fought to get closer to him.</p><p>This was a side of Abram that he had never allowed her to see. This gentle, seductive side. The dangerous eroticism that existed just beneath the surface and was now flowing free as his lips, tongue, and hands began to stoke the searing flames of need through her entire body.</p><p>His hands slid to her shoulders, gently sliding the sleeves of her robe down her arms until the silk caught at her elbows.</p><p>His lips slid from hers, his tongue peeking out to taste the sensitive skin of her neck and sending shivers racing through her body. Paige gasped for breath, a low moan escaping her lips. She swore there was an electric current beneath her skin, brought alive by the touch of his lips as they stroked and kissed their way to her shoulder.</p><p>The calloused tips of his fingers moved to the thin strap of her gown, easing it over the curve of her shoulder as his lips continued to play, and to melt her resistance like butter. If there had been any resistance, which Paige was certain she couldn\u2019t have even attempted to fake.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted him for far too long, ached for him for too many years to even consider rejecting this touch.</p><p>She had never had a man\u2019s touch burn through her as Abram\u2019s did now. She\u2019d never known such abandoned pleasure, or ached to the very core of her body as she did now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbram.\u201d The moaning whisper seemed torn from her as she felt the gown slide down her arms, then past the swollen, heavy flesh of her breasts. \u201cYou make my head spin.\u201d</p><p>The silk rasped over the tender tips, the sensation surging through her with a wicked rush of ecstatic pleasure as she allowed the words to escape her lips. She knew better. She should hold them back, hold a part of herself back. There was no strength to do so, though.</p><p>Her nipples peaked and hardened, rising and falling erratically with her heavy breaths as Abram stared down at them. Paige swore she could feel the very air stroking against her, the invisible currents touching her like a ghostly caress.</p> <p>\u201cHow pretty.\u201d The dark, accented stroke of his voice against her senses had her arching to get closer to him, to feel him touching her breasts in some way, in any way, to ease the ache radiating through her flesh.</p><p>She\u2019d fantasized about this. She had dreamed of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, little hellcat?\u201d His hand moved, his fingers moving over the curveast as her lips parted to drag in air. \u201cWhat touch do you wish against such pretty flesh?\u201d</p><p>Oh God, how was she supposed to deal with this? To handle the sensations that were tearing through her, and the pleasure that made it impossible for her to consider anything but the culmination of the hunger raging through her.</p><p>Paige stared up at him, her gaze heavy-lidded as a sense of sensual bravado overcame her.</p> <p>Her hand smoothed between them, up her stomach to the mound of her breast. Cupping it, she lifted it to him in invitation as his gaze flared in overwhelming hunger. His lips parted, his tongue touching the tip of the tortured flesh.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Shock. Horror.</p><p>Paige\u2019s head jerked to the side as Abram\u2019s lifted quickly, turning even as he jerked the gowns straps and her robe back over her shoulders to cover her naked breasts.</p><p>Khalid.</p><p>Her brother stood just inside the doorway, his black eyes almost bulging in shock, his expression, for the briefest moment, slack with complete amazement before it morphed to complete fury.</p> <p>God, he would show up at the most inopportune time and catch her doing the one thing he\u2019d forbidden her to do years ago.</p><p>Don\u2019t mess with Abram, he\u2019d ordered her. Don\u2019t cause such trouble with the only brother he accepted, the only true friend he had ever known. Because it would make enemies of them if Abram took her to his bed.</p><p>And what had she done? What had she plotted to do for years? To find herself in Abram\u2019s arms, his lips and hands caressing her. To find herself in his bed, his moving over her, inside her.</p><p>Oh hell, Khalid was so pissed.</p><p>Slowly, Abram backed away.</p><p>Her head turned back and she stared up at him as his gaze turned back to her, his black eyes, darker, more intense than Khalid\u2019s were enigmatic, as Abram straightened her robe over her breasts then began distancing himself fully.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said softly, his tone suddenly remarkably gentle. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be here for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige, what the hell is going on?\u201d Khalid\u2019s tone was coldly furious and striking across Abram\u2019s whispered, though gentle command.</p> <p>Paige rolled her eyes, stepped back, and finished fixing her gown and robe herself as she turned back to her brother. She couldn\u2019t let herself look at Abram, couldn\u2019t afford to show any weakness now.</p><p>Brothers were like wild animals. Show that first hint of weakness and they could be merciless. Rather like an animal at that first scent of blood.</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself,\u201d she told him as though unconcerned as she looked behind him and watched as Marty fought to hold back her grin. Khalid\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was nothing if not laid back and more or less amused by all of them. \u201cWhat happened Marty? Did aliens kidnap my nice brother again and leave the asshole in its place?\u201d</p><p>The \u201cnice brother\u201d referred to his general good mood in the past weeks since he and Marty had become engaged. She\u2019d rather hoped it would last a while.</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018nice brother,\u2019 as you call me, was doing exceptionally well until I walked in here,\u201d he snapped, his arms going across his chest in the classic, arrogant pose.</p><p>Just how many times had she seen that pose in the past ten years? Possibly every time Khalid caught her so much as looking at Abram.</p><p>Paige glanced between the two men.</p><p>It was incredibly easy to tell they were related, to tell they were brothers actually. If she didn\u2019t know better, she would have sworn they were twins rather than half-brothers. But she did know better. Abram was five minutes older than Khalid, and his mother had delicate blond hair rather than the vibrant red hair of Khalid and Paige\u2019s mother. Khalid and Abram\u2019s father, Azir Mustafa preferred American wives. Kidnapped, terrified American wives.</p><p>Abram wasn\u2019t her brother though. He wasn\u2019t even her half-brother. But Khalid refused to see the distinction.</p><p>\u201cNeither of you have answered me.\u201d Khalid stared between them, his nostrils flaring in anger.</p><p>\u201cI would have thought it was pretty self-evident,\u201d Paige replied archly. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly a virgin, Khalid, so unless that question was simply an exercise in arrogance, then you\u2019re well aware of exactly what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Abram said then, the shock of the statement ripping through her consciousness.</p><p>Paige swung around to stare at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d he repeated as he turned back to Khalid. \u201cIt will not happen again.\u201d</p><p>She could only stare at him. Disbelief warred with a sense of betrayal as he turned back to her, his expression cool and composed, no hint of the hunger, or need, he\u2019d shn only moments before.</p><p>\u201cA mistake?\u201d she whispered, feeling her throat tighten as she felt both Marty and Khalid watching.</p><p>How shameful. To have them witness such a rejection. How impossibly stupid of her not to have realized exactly what was coming though. He hadn\u2019t stayed away from her, ensured they were never alone together over the past years for no reason.</p><p>\u201cA regrettable one,\u201d he answered. \u201cI apologize to you as well, Paige...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it.\u201d Flipping her hand out to him dismissively she turned on her heel and headed for the door.</p><p>Once reaching the exit she turned back, her gaze meeting Khalid\u2019s as anger burned bright and hot inside her. \u201cIf I don\u2019t see you in the morning, then you better tell your hired goons to watch their damned backs because I won\u2019t stay here any longer. And you damned well better have an alternative method of protection because I\u2019m not a child to be locked away. Nor am I too damned stupid to understand what the hell is going on when the situation is eventually explained to me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give him time to speak. She didn\u2019t want to hear his damned explanations at the moment and she sure as hell didn\u2019t want to see the pity in his and Marty\u2019s eyes. She wanted to get the hell away from all of them.</p><p>She was a mistake. A regrettable one.</p><p>Her teeth clenched furiously as humiliation washed through her.</p><p>He could excuse himself until hell froze over but it wouldn\u2019t change the fact that he wanted her. He had wanted her with almost the same destructive hunger that burned inside her whenever he was around.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to admit it? He wanted to ignore it?</p><p>That was just damned fine, because it wasn\u2019t over. She\u2019d seen his gaze. She\u2019d seen what he\u2019d wanted to hide behind that deceptively calm, unemotional mask.</p><p>She\u2019d seen the hunger burning so hot, so deep that it possibly went even deeper than her own did. She\u2019d felt it. She\u2019d tasted it in his kiss. He wanted to devour her.</p><p>She knew herself that denying it simply didn\u2019t work. When he was done with the denials, when he was finished pretending he didn\u2019t want her to keep Khalid\u2019s little protective instincts calmed, then he\u2019d better be damned careful.</p><p>She just might show him exactly how rejection felt.</p><p>he door closed quietly behind her, Abram almost flinched. The near silence of the action spoke volumes. Had she slammed the door, it wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as effective.</p><p>It had been the pain he\u2019d seen in her eyes though, that sense of betrayal that had driven home to him exactly how deeply he had hurt her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Touching her had been the worst mistake he could have made, because it showed her to be a weakness he could ill afford.</p><p>And responding to him eight years before, when his lips had buried between her thighs, had been the worst mistake she could have made.</p><p>Even now, Abram couldn\u2019t get the taste of her out of his mind. He couldn\u2019t get her pure, uninhibited response to him out of his system.</p><p>Her eyes had been filled with such hunger. The long swath of pretty fire-reddened hair cascading around her. Her pale flesh flushed with her need, and those perfect breasts. Those sweet, firm mounds had risen to him, the pale innocently pinkened nipples tight and hard, and responsive to his touch.</p><p>Taking her would be like immersing himself in fire. He could see it, feel it.</p><p>Iron hard and throbbing in fury at his refusal to take her, his cock had swelled to painful readiness, his balls drawn tight and painful. He couldn\u2019t remember ever having ached with such desperation for a woman\u2019s touch, or needing to touch one as he needed to touch Paige.</p><p>\u201cHave you fucking lost your mind, Abram?\u201d Khalid rasped behind him, his voice hoarse with fury.</p><p>\u201cEvidently.\u201d Abram turned to him, careful to keep his expression composed, without emotion. \u201cI won\u2019t be berated like a child, Khalid. You\u2019ve known for years the desire that burns between us. You should have only been surprised it took this long to risk my control.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled slowly, evenly. Paige hadn\u2019t just risked his control, she had fucking destroyed it.</p><p>Yet, he couldn\u2019t blame his brother for his anger either. Paige was Khalid\u2019s little sister; a treasured child that none in her family could see had been a woman for a good many years now.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Khalid snapped. \u201cYou have enough women, Abram. Stay the hell away from Paige.\u201d</p><p>Abram glanced at Marty and allowed a somber smile to touch his lips. He well remembered the years Khalid had been tortured and tempted by this woman. The nights his brother had spent simply talking about the delicate little FBI agent trailing him.</p><p>\u201cMarty and I are an entirely different matterght=\"0em\"D; Khalid growled as he followed his brother\u2019s look. \u201cMarty isn\u2019t related to me by blood.\u201d</p><p>To that Abram simply had to laugh. \u201cAnd what blood do I share with Paige, Khalid?\u201d he questioned him. \u201cShe is the daughter of your mother, while I am the son of your father. Where do you believe we share blood?\u201d</p><p>Khalid could be amazingly stubborn, and attempted to arrange reality to suit him rather than arranging himself to suit reality. It was a fault of his, and one Abram had learned over the years to ignore. Because no matter how Khalid tried, he had yet to force the winds of fate to turn to his hand.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you need to stop arguing over this. Your main audience has left, so there\u2019s no longer anyone to impress or posture to.\u201d Marty shot them both a disgusted look. She was definitely a woman that believed in speaking her mind.</p><p>And she was right. In ways, they had been playing to a perfect audience for years. But as Abram realized now, Paige rarely stayed to listen to the arguments or paid any attention to the undercurrents of tension that existed between himself and Khalid whenever she was around.</p><p>Paige had grown tired of the game, though he and Khalid still played it. It gave Abram something to focus on rather than his desire for Paige during those odd times when he could no longer avoid her.</p><p>Abram finally sighed wearily. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to lose my control with Paige, or to argue with you,\u201d he told his brother. \u201cI\u2019m returning in a few hours for Saudi.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The shock was palpable. Marty\u2019s gaze widened and Khalid\u2019s expression suddenly turned icy. He understood the quick anger, the disbelief. They had planned his move from Saudi Arabia for years. To have Abram back out now, at the last moment so to speak, was little more than an insult.</p><p>\u201cYou only just arrived,\u201d Khalid finally stated. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving Immigration enough time to examine your mother\u2019s birth records as well as your own. Give it time.\u201d</p><p>Abram gave his head a quick shake. \u201cThere is something I must do first, Khalid.\u201d</p> <p>He had known his brother would never understand this move he was being forced to make.</p><p>\u201cAnd what the fuck could be more important than your life?\u201d Khalid suddenly snarled, the fury cracking past the ice. \u201cAzir Mustafa will never let you live now. Goddammit, Abram, we just killed two of his sons. The black-hearted little bastards he risked everything to protect over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbram, my father is certain that your citizenship will be accepted within days,\u201d Marty stated from her fianc\u00e9\u2019s side. \u201cThere\u2019s no question of it. But if you return, there\u2019s nothing he can do.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head quickly, tightly. \u201cI have to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, damned you?!\u201d Khalid yelled back at him furiously as rage lit his black gaze once again.</p> <p>\u201cBecause Paige\u2019s picture was found in the possession of a dead terrorist known to be a part of the cell Ayid and Aman commanded, just hours ago as he attempted to board a plane in Jordan. Your suspicions were right. She\u2019s in danger. And I\u2019m going back to stop it, Khalid, one way or another. I\u2019ve already lost two wives to those bastards. I won\u2019t lose my soul to their ghosts.\u201d</p><p>Paige. His soul. He\u2019d lost his youth and his heart when his first wife, Lessa had been murdered. His second wife had been forced on him, and losing her and their child had taken the last bit of hope inside him. Their deaths had nearly finished him off. The thought of that innocent life, not yet born, taken so cruelly, had nearly cost him his sanity.</p><p>That child had been his daughter. The daughter he had planned to secretly smuggle out of Saudi Arabia after her birth and send to his brother\u2019s parents. Pavlos and Marilyn Galbraithe would have raised and protected his child as they had their own precious daughter.</p><p>But Paige, God help him, there was no way he would survive her death. It would destroy him. For some reason she had begun to represent something wild and innocent inside him eight years ago. When the future had appeared to be nothing but bleak, furious pain, it was always the image of her that brought him comfort. Her laughter, the sweet warmth that burned in her emerald eyes.</p><p>And from the looks of Khalid\u2019s expression, the complete disbelief and horror burning in his gaze assured Abram that it would destroy him as well. They had both schemed, plotted, and run interference with Azir Mustafa since the day the red-haired little beauty had been born. The birth of the child to his escaped forced bride had sent Azir into a rage that had torn through the Mustafa stronghold like a demon.</p><p>That day, two servants had died, and a third had fled into the desert in fear. The insanity that had begun infecting Azir had only grown since that day, as though it were a trigger of some sort that he had been unable to fight.</p> <p>\u201cI was going to send her home in the morning,\u201d Khalid finally stated, his voice a low, rough rasp. \u201cGod help me, Abram. I was going to allow her to leave when Abdul\u2019s cousin was unable to learn anything else.\u201d</p><p>Abdul, Khalid\u2019s manservant, had several cousins that worked within the castle and managed to send along information whenever they heard it. The threats against Paige, in retaliation for Khalid\u2019s killing of Ayid and Aman Mustafa, had begun the moment Azir learned of their deaths.</p><p>He knew Khalid\u2019s weakness, just as he knew those of his other sons. Somehow, Azir had learned years before that Abram had formed a soft spot for Khalid\u2019s little sister. A place inside his heart thathe\u2019d believed was hidden from even the most astute gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t allow her to go.\u201d He\u2019d kidnap her and have her locked up somewhere safe himself if Khalid dared to allow her to leave. \u201cI\u2019ve fought to stay away from her, Khalid, as you ordered. But if you allow her to return to her home, then I promise you, all bets will be off.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait to argue. He turned and walked away. His control was too shaky, he was too frightened for her, too certain that if she was unprotected for even a second, then his father, Azir el Hamid Mustafa would exact his vengeance in the worst way.</p><p>Abram now had no choice but to return. No one yet knew he\u2019d left Saudi to defect from his homeland and to refuse the legacy so tainted by blood, death, and nightmares. Azir Mustafa had become a scourge that even the Saudi government wanted to be rid of. Unfortunately, until Azir revealed the blood on his hands, there was nothing they could do to step in and deflect the misery he created.</p><p>Abram had given up on saving his father light years before. The day he found his wife in a desert shack, bloody, tortured, her face frozen into an expression of such abject pain and horror that it had taken him to his knees. He had known the rapists, the inhuman scourge that had taken her life were the half-brothers he had taught to ride horseback when they were boys. The same that had been such sweet, laughter-filled children before Azir had taken them to his wing of the castle to raise them himself.</p><p>From that day, the change had been overwhelming. As though Azir had known what to do to release the soulless cruelty that existed within them.</p> <p>Entering the garage Abram strode for the limo as Tariq, his cousin and coconspirator, stepped from the shadows to open the door for him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to go now, Tariq,\u201d he stated as he stepped into the back of the limo. \u201cHe\u2019ll make certain she\u2019s protected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzir has called the Saudi ambassador several times and he\u2019s demanding they search Khalid\u2019s home for you immediately.\u201d Disgust filled the man\u2019s voice. \u201cI contacted him after the ambassador contacted me, just after you entered the house. I\u2019ve assured him you\u2019re here to investigate the reasons for your brothers\u2019 deaths and that you are returning soon. He\u2019s certain you\u2019re here to help Khalid escape justice instead.\u201d</p><p>Tariq didn\u2019t give Abram a chance to comment. He slammed the door shut with latent violence then stalked around the limo to the driver\u2019s side door.</p><p>Abram watched as he slid behind the wheel, his gaze meeting Tariq\u2019s dark tobacco brown eyes in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cAnd did he buy it?\u201d Abram had no doubt Azir had. In his mind, no matter what he did, or who he killed, Abram wouldn\u2019t have the strength to walk away from the deserted, blood-drencertain snd of his birth.</p><p>Unfortunately for Azir Mustafa, his son shared few of his beliefs and none of his love for the land that had destroyed so many he loved. Abram had been all too aware that he was the last hope those he loved had of escaping Azir\u2019s cruelty. But only if Abram always remembered to never show his weakness, to never reveal he cared for anyone or anything outside the Mustafa fortress. Showing that affection was guaranteed to ensure, if not their deaths, then the ever-present risk of it.</p><p>\u201cShall we say he was a bit more than irate?\u201d Tariq said with chilling calm.</p><p>Irate? Azir Mustafa was deranged. The fact that he had allowed his youngest sons\u2019 terrorist partners to take up residence in the Mustafa fortress proved it.</p><p>Jafar Mustafa, son of Azir\u2019s youngest brother, and cousin to both Abram and Tariq, was surprisingly one of the lieutenants within the terrorist cell Ayid and Aman had commanded.</p><p>Abram\u2019s disappointment to learn Jafar was as corrupt as Ayid and Aman had been, went deeper than he\u2019d expected. Once, he\u2019d had high hopes for Jafar. Abram had fought for him to attend college in America, to work with the oil companies rather than joining the insanity Azir was breeding.</p><p>Azir Mustafa hadn\u2019t escaped it. As a matter of fact, he had helped exacerbate the insanity within his sons, and now, he couldn\u2019t accept that they were dead. He couldn\u2019t accept that Abram, his eldest son and heir could have defected as Jafar had informed him, or that Khalid, the son he\u2019d given Ayid and Aman permission to murder, had actually survived.</p><p>His sanity seemed to be coming more into question by the day, but the one thing the old bastard hadn\u2019t forgotten was that in less then a month, Abram would turn thirty-six. Then the Saudi king would send his emissary to the Mustafa lands and take Abram\u2019s vow to guide the people and the land to prosperity.</p><p>Azir had, with his determination to protect his youngest sons, managed to force the royal house to cut off all funds and aid to the boundary lands until his legal heir was thirty-six. Those funds had been funneled into the coffers of the very terrorists they were fighting against.</p><p>The king\u2019s punishment had come with one ray of hope for Azir. If Abram would vow to protect and preserve the people in accordance with the law as well as pledge his loyalty to the throne on his thirty-sixth birthday, then money would flow into the Mustafa lands once more.</p><p>In all his crazed determination Azir thought he could then see the dreams of his dead sons completed once that was accomplished.</p><p>It was a vow Abram couldn\u2019t make. But, until he learned why Paige was a target, and how pervasive the terrorists now were in the city he had once called home, he had no choice but to return.</p><p>The fact that his cousin Jafar was ported to have moved into the fortress in the past days to console Azir, greatly concerned Abram.</p><p>Jafar had, until now, managed to fool Abram. He\u2019d gone to college in America, vacationed with the rich and notorious in their playgrounds, and had once, years before, even spoken to Abram about defection himself. That same man had returned to Saudi Arabia three years before, disappeared from the public, and was rumored to have joined one of the newly formed terrorist organizations protesting Western modernization in the Middle East.</p><p>Jafar\u2019s belief that the ills of the Middle East stemmed from America was something that Abram hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>\u201cI called several contacts and they\u2019ve reported Jafar has brought several more of his men into the castle,\u201d Abram began. \u201cThe terrorist who was supposedly killed in Jordan was seen at the fortress two nights ago. He slipped across the border, met with Jafar, and collected a file from Azir. It\u2019s reported to name the target he\u2019s chosen to exact his punishment for his sons\u2019 deaths on.\u201d</p><p>He had to give it to Jafar. So far, he was a damned sight smarter than Ayid and Aman had been. He did nothing over e-mail, and rarely used the same courier twice when sending out reports or orders to soldiers. There was no way to gather the evidence needed to arrest him, and no way to figure out whatever plans were in the works.</p><p>And that was why Abram was returning. To protect Paige. To protect the last bit of innocence left in his life, the woman he couldn\u2019t get out of his fantasies.</p><p>\u201cContact Anwar,\u201d Abram ordered him. \u201cInform him of our arrival time at the landing area and tell him to be prepared to give me a thorough oral report.\u201d</p><p>Nothing was put on paper. Like Jafar, Abram knew the danger of ever leaving evidence.</p><p>Returning was killing him, but he knew if he didn\u2019t, Azir would strike against Paige, ensuring Abram suffered for it. And if it wasn\u2019t Azir, then it would be the terrorists he had given his allegiance to. Before he left, Abram knew he would have to commit to memory the face of every threat that could return to haunt him, Paige, or Khalid.</p><p>The prediction Khalid had made when he had been no more than eighteen seemed to be coming true.</p><p>Khalid had stated Azir would force his eldest son, his heir, to kill him to escape the Mustafa lands. Khalid had stared into the hot desert sun as he and Abram had been returning to the forest from a hunt and spoken the damning words.</p><p>Abram was finally realizing just how right his brother had been. And God help him, if Paige was harmed he\u2019d also lose what was left of his own sanity.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t touched her until tonight, but in his fantasies, in his dreams, he touched her nightly. He touched her, and he watched as his third touched her. He psessed her, and he watched as his third possessed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He heard her screams of pleasure, watched her emerald eyes darken in ecstasy, and heard her beg him for release. And he woke with his dick so painfully hard, the need to possess her so strong, that no amount of masturbation could ease the hunger.</p><p>\u201cAbram, are you sure about this?\u201d Tariq asked as he turned the limo from Khalid\u2019s drive and headed for the private airport. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to change your mind. Go back, convince Khalid to allow us to protect Paige ourselves. If Azir and Jafar refuse to give us peace, then we\u2019ll kill them ourselves.\u201d</p><p>As a plan, it was simple, perfect, and it would complete the dark stain spreading across his soul.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll always know we were the ones that killed him,\u201d Abram reminded him. \u201cHis murder would unleash secrets both of us would prefer were never known, Tariq. We return, learn of their plans against the throne and Paige, take them to the emissary before he arrives in Mustafa lands, and allow the government to take care of him from there.</p><p>\u201cThe lands will be repossessed by the government. Azir will either be beheaded for treason or placed in a facility for the insane until his death. Either way, our secrets remain secret, and we\u2019ll have a much better chance of safety when we return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat or certain death,\u201d Tariq stated tightly. \u201cMustafa lands are drenched in as much blood as their hands. They\u2019re saturated in it. The name is synonymous with nothing but death, greed, and such cruelty against our women that neither of us have known anything but shame since the day our mothers committed suicide. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ve refrained from killing that old bastard before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ve always known that we would have only one chance at happiness, Tariq. I won\u2019t allow him to win by taking that from me.\u201d Abram stared out the limo\u2019s darkened windows to the sliver of light beginning to filter through as dawn edged in.</p><p>This was how he felt. Hope was there, edging into the shadows when he\u2019d learned he would have to return to ensure Paige\u2019s safety. She was his. Since the death of his first wife so long ago, Abram had known very little hope. He couldn\u2019t turn away from it, he couldn\u2019t allow Azir to risk it.</p> <p>\u201cThere are very few of our men left,\u201d Tariq reminded him. \u201cOnly those who hadn\u2019t yet been able to slip over the borders. I managed to contact four, and they\u2019ll see if they can find the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make do.\u201d Abram glanced at the mirror and met Tariq\u2019s gaze again. \u201cWe have no other choice, Tariq. We will have to make do, and we will have to succeed.\u201d</p><p>Because defeat meant not just his death, but Khalid\u2019s, Marty\u2019s, and Paige\u2019swould kill Azir himself before he would allow that to happen.</p><p>2</p><p>THREE DAYS LATER</p><p>\u201cPaige, you\u2019re more than welcome to come to the party with us tonight,\u201d Marty said as she stood in the open doorway of Paige\u2019s suite, resplendent in her amber evening gown and topaz jewelry.</p> <p>Shoulder-length blond hair was swept up to the top of her head with artfully arranged wisps falling from the topaz combs. It lent a charming disarray to the effect.</p><p>Paige set her book aside before uncurling from the chair and faced her brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. She was still amazed that her dark, cynical brother had managed to capture Marty\u2019s heart. She had hoped the woman would help him chill out just a little bit. So far, though, it wasn\u2019t happening that she could see.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not in the mood for a party, even one of Tally\u2019s.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>Tally Conover was becoming known as a premier hostess and seemed to enjoy it. The fact that Tally found the patience for it managed to surprise all her friends.</p><p>\u201cTally throws a damned good party,\u201d Marty reminded her. \u201cShe also somehow managed to secure a promise from Anger Thornton to be there. I want to see if he actually arrives.\u201d</p><p>Anger Thornton, CEO of Thornton Holdings and Acquisitions rarely attended anyone\u2019s parties but his own. And even those, he was known to be absent from.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s almost tempting,\u201d Paige agreed. \u201cI think I\u2019ll finish my book instead.\u201d</p><p>Attending the party meant being civil to Khalid. She just didn\u2019t think she had it in her at the moment. They had existed in a state of warfare for the past three days, and Paige didn\u2019t see that changing anytime soon.</p> <p>\u201cFinish the book or continue to ignore Khalid?\u201d Marty finally asked.</p><p>Paige stared back at her. Her lips pursed and her teeth clenched for one angry second.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better that Khalid and I have the least amount to do with each other as possible, Marty,\u201d she finally stated.</p><p>The other woman shook her head, the wisps of silken hair brushing about her face as she chuckled lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou two are just too much alike,\u201d she accused. \u201cAnd as I understand it, Abram Mustafa is just as bad. Khalid, Abram, and their cousins, Tariq and Jafar are all cut from the same cloth, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Paige rolled her eyes. She knew all four men. They were so much alike they all could have been brothers rather than cousins. Hell, they could probably be clones\u2014at times they were so equally arrogant and conceited.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all four equal pains in the ass,\u201d Paige stated.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d Marty nodded. \u201cBut there are still other pretty interesting men in the world. Abram isn\u2019t the only one out there, Paige.\u201d</p><p>Paige pulled her legs up, knees bending, her feet pressing into the cushions as she looped her arms around her knees.</p><p>\u201cThere are many interesting men in the world, and if I were sexually interested in them I\u2019d be out there looking for them.\u201d</p><p>Marty glanced behind her, making sure no one was close enough to hear what was being said. Most likely ensuring Khalid wasn\u2019t there. As though their conversation was any of his business, still, they were both aware he would make it his business.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t rational and you know it,\u201d Paige informed her, the irritation she was feeling impossible to keep hidden. \u201cDo you know he\u2019s lectured me every time he\u2019s seen me since Abram was here? Talked to me as though I were a child and didn\u2019t know how to run my own life. It\u2019s damned insulting.\u201d</p><p>Marty grimaced, as her hand rubbed her temple. Her expression was amusingly sympathetic and only exacerbated the aggravation Paige couldn\u2019t fight or hide anymore.</p><p>\u201cHe worries, Paige,\u201d she finally stated softly. \u201cHe\u2019s terrified that perhaps you\u2019re not fully aware of what you\u2019re getting into sexually with Abram. Besides, you\u2019re his sister, his baby sister, and Abram is his brother. The dynamics of that are making him crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDynamics are always making Khalid insane.\u201d Paige waved the explanation away. She didn\u2019t even bother hiding the fact that there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell she was going to fall for that one. \u201cI\u2019m amazed the dynamics of being in love hasn\u2019t had him pulling his hair out. Or causing you to pull yours out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been getting a little thinner.\u201d Marty laughed, her gray eyes sparkling with pure happiness. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change the fact that he does have reason to worry at the moment. Be a little patient with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been patient with him my entire life,\u201d Paige scoffed. \u201cDo you realize he\u2019s lectured me twice today already? He\u2019s treating me as though I\u2019m not well aware of the fact that Abram and Khalid both share a penchant for having a third in their sexual relationships. Or that I don\u2019t know damned good and well that Abram Mustafa can be a complete dominant asshole.\u201d</p><p>There was a look of genuine shock on Marty\u2019s face before complete laughter filled her eyes and a throaty chuckle left her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou surprise me, Paige,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd here I thought a sweet little innocent like you wouldn\u2019t notice the signs or understand the rumors if you heard them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does innocence have to do with anything?\u201d Paige rose from the chair and paced back and forth across the room. \u201cWould that exclude me from understanding what a threesome is or how it works? Come on, Marty, remember Courtney Sinclair is one of my best friends. I knew what a threesome was when she called me sobbing about the inexhaustible Ian Sinclair having sex with her maids and calling them by her name. Do you know she would spy on him when he visited her parents\u2019 home?\u201d</p><p>Marty wasn\u2019t having an easy time holding back her laughter. Courtney Sinclair and her husband Ian had one of those fiery, wonderful relationships most women dreamed of having.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Paige, you have to admit with everything that\u2019s happened, Khalid has a right to worry. Abram is ten years older than you, and on top of that, he does often have a third as I understand it. But while Khalid doesn\u2019t want your heart broken, he also helped raise you. Accepting that you have sex is probably something he\u2019s never going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to worry about something other than whether or not I intend to fuck his brother and if I let his cousin join in.\u201d</p><p>Marty howled with laughter. Paige was about to join in but Khalid chose that moment to step into the room.</p><p>The laughter broke off immediately.</p><p>His expression was dark with anger, his black gaze snapping with it.</p><p>\u201cDo you even have a clue what a man like Abram could be like?\u201d he growled. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s going to be a gentleman? Be sweet and ask nicely to make love to you as his third pets you sweetly and whispers sweet nothings in your ear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use that tone with me, Khalid,\u201d she warned him calmly. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you into this conversation, so if you don\u2019t like it, then you can leave and keep your opinion to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Marty turned to him, her expression concerned now. \u201cKhalid, we were just joking, darling. You two enjoy poking at each other a little too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking,\u201d Paige informed them both as she crossed her arms over her breasts and glared at her brother. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m not trying to slip into his bed right now is because he\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Khalid\u2019s lips thinned. #x201C;I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll argue with you over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you won\u2019t,\u201d Paige agreed mockingly. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to have a little man-to-man chat with Abram.\u201d She let her eyes widen. \u201cOh but wait, that didn\u2019t work so well either, did it? The first chance he had, he ignored that too.\u201d</p><p>She could feel years of anger rising inside her now. For as long as she could remember her parents had deferred to Khalid regarding her protection, and in any choices that they had to make in her life.</p><p>Khalid had chosen the schools she attended, the bodyguards she had as a child, her first ugly car, and was behind her father\u2019s refusal to allow her to date her first boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a child anymore, Khalid,\u201d Marty reminded him softly. But Paige knew her brother, and he wasn\u2019t about to listen to anyone but himself. She was simply at the end of her patience.</p><p>\u201cDo you even care how much it hurts or humiliates me to have you step in and play lord of all you survey with my life? I lost my job today, Khalid, because I haven\u2019t been there in two weeks. Now, I can either lose my car or bum money from you or my parents. I\u2019m twenty-five years old, not eighteen, and I enjoy taking care of myself,\u201d she cried out furiously.</p><p>\u201cAnd I enjoy waking up each morning knowing you\u2019re alive and safe,\u201d he bit out, his tone dark with anger. \u201cDo you have any idea of the danger you are in at the moment, or the man you are tempting to take you into his bed? The two are entwined, Paige. Being with Abram draws you front and center into Azir\u2019s attention, if you weren\u2019t already there. And I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that no matter what happens, Abram will break your heart. He will not be an easy lover, Paige, nor will he understand your independence and your determination to do as you wish.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd none of this is your choice to make.\u201d She dropped her arms to her sides and faced him without the anger she knew she should be feeling.</p><p>She was tired of arguing with him. She was tired of the lectures and she was tired of trying to force him to treat her like an adult rather than a child.</p><p>\u201cPaige, would you come between Abram and me?\u201d he finally questioned her harshly.</p> <p>\u201cKhalid!\u201d Marty gasped as she turned on him furiously. \u201cThat\u2019s low, even for you.\u201d</p><p>But Paige wasn\u2019t surprised in the least that he had attempted such emotional blackmail. It was reminiscent of her childhood years when he had used her emotions to get what he wanted every time she attempted to defy him.</p><p>\u201cWould you really lose me over this?\u201d she asked in return. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what will happen if you keep standing me and Abram. Whether or not he wants me, or I want him, shouldn\u2019t be tainted by your demands that we stay away from each other. Because honestly, Khalid, there have been times when the very fact that you didn\u2019t want me to do something made it all that more appealing. Do you really want to chance that in this situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m to just stand by and watch him break your heart when he becomes the man he is and he tries to subjugate you as we both know he will? He may have different ideas on sexuality and women\u2019s rights on the surface, Paige, but trust me when I tell you that only in your sexuality will he be more accepting. He is still a product of the culture he was raised within.\u201d</p><p>Paige could only stare back at him incredulously. \u201cHow little you know your brother, or your sister for that matter,\u201d she told him, pity and anger converging together. \u201cDoes he beat his women, Khalid? Does he lock them up, or demand that they have no life outside of him? Does he have six wives and twelve children that I know nothing about?\u201d</p> <p>Khalid\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cYou know he would never do such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your only objection is that you\u2019re worried Abram may try to curb my independence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll forget the meaning of the word independence,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cHas Leyla forgotten the independence you taught her?\u201d Leyla was one of the six young women Khalid had raised after his father sent them to Khalid as teenagers. They were young women Azir had bought and then given to his son to begin his own little harem.</p><p>Leyla was engaged to a young man who had come to America with his parents from Saudi Arabia.</p><p>\u201cLeyla\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is much younger than Abram,\u201d he snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand that, Paige? Abram is a full-grown man who has spent much of his life in the Middle East. A man that will never\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop preaching at me,\u201d she demanded roughly, her head practically ringing with the list of objections he was repeating from earlier. \u201cYou say Abram would attempt to make me live by his rules? What the hell do you believe you\u2019re doing? You\u2019re trying to force me to do what you want, whether it\u2019s what I want or not.\u201d</p><p>And that was beginning to piss her off. She had tried to avoid these confrontations for the past few days. Several times she had simply left the room only to have him follow her and continue the argument.</p><p>\u201cPaige, I\u2019m trying to protect you,\u201d he snarled. His frustration was readily apparent but she couldn\u2019t make herself feel sorry for him, or even suggest they agree to disagree.</p><p>\u201cGo to your party, Khalid. I\u2019m sick of your lectures and I\u2019ve had enough of your judgmental attitude. Now leave my room.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to leave. Paige turned and stomped to the bathroom, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Then, the tears she\u2019d only barely held back filled her eyes and began to fall down her cheeks. She didn\u2019t sob. She remained silent, pressing her hands to her lips and tried to stop the tears as she had so many times in the past.</p><p>She loved her brother. Khalid had always been a mainstay in her life, even if he had frustrated the hell out of her. He\u2019d been amused at her father\u2019s nerves when she rode her bicycle without training wheels, and laughed at her mother\u2019s fears when Paige got her driver\u2019s license.</p><p>He had always acted damned strange about Abram though, despite the fact that Abram had been married the first time Paige had met him and his wife Lessa.</p> <p>Paige had been drawn to Abram from the first moment. She\u2019d been fascinated by this man who looked so much like her brother, who her brother called a brother, yet he wasn\u2019t her brother. She\u2019d only been nine when she first met him, and he\u2019d been nineteen and already married.</p><p>The relationship between him and his brother had at first confused the hell out of her. After all, Khalid was her brother, so why wasn\u2019t Abram?</p><p>That confusion had amused her parents and Abram\u2019s wife Lessa, but Khalid hadn\u2019t seemed nearly so amused by it.</p><p>Paige liked Abram\u2019s wife, Lessa, enjoyed her laughter and her quiet manner the few times she\u2019d been able to spend any time with her. Lessa was murdered several years after Paige met her, and Paige\u2019s heart had broken for Abram.</p><p>He\u2019d loved his wife, there had been no doubt of it. Over the next few years, he\u2019d been a regular in her life. He\u2019d visited when her family vacationed in Cairo, and joined Khalid in Greece when he returned for their mother\u2019s birthday.</p><p>She was eighteen when things suddenly changed, when he had looked at her for the first time and hadn\u2019t seen a child. When his gaze had flicked to her breasts, encased in the bodice of the strapless ball gown she had worn.</p><p>He had danced with her, his hand riding low on her back and pressing her closer to him than any of the younger men she had danced with had done.</p><p>Her heart had raced so hard she had thought it would tear from her chest. He\u2019d stared down at her, somber and intense, holding her eyes as she swore she saw some message swirling in the depths of his own.</p><p>And against her hip, hard and thick, she had felt his erection, proof that he was seeing her as a woman, and that she wasn\u2019t alone in the sensations surging through her.</p><p>It was the first time she had creamed her panties. The first time her clit had become so swollen and sensitive that it only took her seconds to come when she had masturbated in her bed later that night.</p><p>From that night, she hadn\u2019t been able to get him out of her mind, or her fantasies. She hadn\u2019t even tried to keep him from stealing her heart as the years went by.</p><p>Khalid was equally determined to keep anything from happening between them. Even during those first years when Paige had been determined to go to college and get her degree before allowing any relationship to develop too far, still, Khalid had begun arranging Abram\u2019s visits to keep her from seeing him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t always work.</p><p>And nothing had ever stemmed the need that only grew with each year, with each moment spent with him. And with each acknowledgement that her brother was willing to alienate her rather than see her with Abram.</p><p>Sniffling quietly she wiped at the tears and tried to stem them. If she stayed here, then they were going to end up saying things that couldn\u2019t be taken back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want that. She didn\u2019t want to lose her brother. That left only one other option. To leave his house, at least until they could learn to agree to disagree where Abram was concerned.</p><p>It had been almost two weeks since Khalid\u2019s security team had practically kidnapped her and brought her to the mansion.</p><p>Today, she had lost her job. Her savings wasn\u2019t nearly enough to keep her rent and utilities going, along with her car payment, for more than a few months. She would have to find a job, and there was no doubt she would have to ask her parents for money or borrow from her trust fund. A fund she had wanted to save for a time when she really needed it.</p><p>Getting another job wasn\u2019t going to be easy. The advertising firm she had worked for had already informed her that there would be no reference forthcoming.</p><p>Her entire life had been changed because of this and on top of it, she was losing Khalid because she couldn\u2019t get his brother out of her mind, or out of her fantasies.</p><p>She shared no blood with Abram. He was no relation her. He was the man that made her heart beat faster, made her womb clench violently, and her pussy throb in need.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a virgin, despite Khalid and Marty\u2019s obvious beliefs. She\u2019d had a few lovers, two to be exact, in her attempts to forget the one man that fascinated her as nothing or no one ever had.</p><p>And to be with the man she wanted more than anyone, she was going to lose the brother she had always idolized, despite his autocratic attitude.</p><p>That knowledge had her heart clenching in pain again as fresh tears fell from her eyes before she could wipe them away.</p><p>\u201cPaige?\u201d A soft knock at the door followed Marty\u2019s gentle voice.</p><p>A second later the bathroom door opened and the other woman stepped inside. Paige quickly wiped at her tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, Paige.\u201d Sympathy filled Marty\u2019s voice as Paige hurriedly dampened a washcloth with cold water to wash her face. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean to hurt you like this.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Raspy, tear-roughened, her voice sounded like hell. \u201cGo to your party, Marty, and take your fianc\u00e9 with you. Hopefully, if he\u2019s out of my face for a while, I can find a way to remember the brother he used to be, rather than the bastard he\u2019s becoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so worried, Paige,\u201d Marty whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s pacing the floors day and night trying to keep you safe and worrying that Abram won\u2019t return. He\u2019s not a man that\u2019s able to sit back and allow those he loves to fight the battle Abram is fighting, alone. But he can\u2019t join him, he can\u2019t protect you if he isn\u2019t here, and he\u2019s terrified Azir will go after your mother as well. He has to stay while Abram is in danger, and sometimes he feels as though he\u2019s fighting ghosts in trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m not aware of the stress he\u2019s under?\u201d Her breathing hitched as the tears threatened again. \u201cJust take him to the damned party, Marty. I\u2019ll be okay if I can just get away from him for a while.\u201d</p><p>Just long enough to call a cab and go home for a few hours.</p><p>She needed her home for just a little while. The comfort of her surroundings, the soothing warmth of her fireplace.</p><p>It was an electric fireplace, but still, it was hers. It was warm, and it looked close enough to the real thing. Like her vibrator. It did the job, even if it did lack the qualities or the warmth of the real thing.</p><p>She needed it. She needed to get out of here for just a little while.</p><p>\u201cOnce he thinks about it, he\u2019ll realize what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Marty promised. \u201cYou know how he is. He gets overprotective and ends up pissing us off. But he still loves us. He\u2019d still die for us, Paige, and knowing he\u2019s hurting you is killing him. He just doesn\u2019t know how to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this,\u201d she cried out in frustration. \u201cJust give me a little while, Marty. I\u2019m trying to adjust. I swear I am.\u201d</p><p>Marty breathed out heavily. Paige turned away and held the cold washcloth to her face.</p><p>\u201cAll right then,\u201d she said slowly. A second later Paige heard the door close behind her.</p><p>Marty had left, and there hadn\u2019t even been an accepting hug before she departed. God, that sucked. She could have used a hug today.</p><p>Paige shook her head before turning back and tossing the cloth in the sink. Maybe it was just time to accept that she wasn\u2019t the woman or the adult that those she loved really wanted.</p><p>Her mother was upset that she was working, her father was disappointed that she refused to head the charities his companies oversaw. Her brother disagreed with the men she wanted as lovers, and the lovers were pissed because she wanted to be independent and still live with them.</p><p>It was a no-win situation.</p><p>Maybe it was time to stop silently begging them to accept her. She needed to find a way to live and stop hurting like this. Khalid had threatened to either disown his brother, or her. Either one would simply break her heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Moving back to the bedroom she changed out of her comfortable sweats and T-shirt and pulled on a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt. Warm socks, sneakers. As she tied the leather running shoes the lights of the limo lit up the darkness outside her bedroom window.</p><p>Khalid and Marty were going to their party. They were leaving, and they were leaving her alone. Just as she had asked.</p><p>Picking up her cell phone she called a cab, then grabbed her purse and made her way quietly downstairs to wait on the transportation, and hopefully to keep anyone else from turning it away.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have to wait long. The intercom from the front gate pinged at the wall next to the door. Stepping to it, Paige accepted the summons.</p><p>\u201cA Plus Cabs,\u201d the voice on the other end announced.</p><p>\u201cCome on up to the house.\u201d Paige pressed the security lock and before the cab was passing through the open gates Daniel Conover was walking into the foyer from the back wing of the house.</p><p>\u201cYou can follow me, or you can wait for me to return, your choice,\u201d she informed him as he leaned against the wall opposite her, his dark blond head tilting to the side as he regarded her curiously.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t allow you to leave,\u201d he stated.</p> <p>\u201cBut you will,\u201d she told him. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll call the authorities next. I\u2019ll have you charged with kidnapping and imprisonment.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t serious and she had a feeling he suspected it. But She w19;t certain, and that was what mattered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you,\u201d he finally sighed. He flexed his broad shoulders beneath the cotton shirt he wore and straightened from the wall. He looped his thumbs in the back pockets of his well-worn, just-snug-enough jeans and gave her a curious little smile. \u201cYou\u2019re as stubborn as your brother, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everyone says,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cFunny, he always seems to come out the winner though.\u201d</p><p>Paige moved past him as he opened the door for her. She walked outside to the cab.</p><p>Just a few hours, she promised herself. She wasn\u2019t going to worry her family unnecessarily. She wasn\u2019t going to risk her life or her bodyguards. But she needed to go home to recharge away from the too-big, too-empty house she was usually in alone.</p> <p>And she needed the space to figure out how to sit back and accept her brother\u2019s protection, her father\u2019s offer to pay the bills while the situation was being resolved, and to decide which was more important. Following her heart, or obeying the brother she would lose if she didn\u2019t walk away from Abram.</p><p>She had a feeling that decision was going to be impossible to make.</p><p>3</p><p>Her apartment was simple, a kitchen and living area, a bedroom and a bathroom with a large soaking tub. That bathtub had been the selling point for her. The electric fireplace sat in front of the overstuffed couch and was the focal point of the room.</p><p>The kitchen was small, but roomy enough to cook and entertain a few friends in.</p><p>It was hers. She paid the bills, stocked the cabinets, and lived comfortably and happily on the salary she earned at the advertising firm she had gone to work for after graduating from college.</p><p>The floors were hardwood, gleaming around the large area rugs beneath the small kitchen table and the coffee table in the living area.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a television, yet. For entertainment she used her laptop, which she had left at her brother\u2019s. She\u2019d been so busy in the past year that she hadn\u2019t really had time to watch television or enjoy movies as she once had.</p> <p>She\u2019d missed her home while she had been at Khalid\u2019s. Her brother\u2019s home was too big, too private perhaps. The suites were self-contained except for eating, and his house staff was always more than happy to fix a meal and bring it to her room.</p><p>She\u2019d been lost there, and lonely. At first, she\u2019d been sequestered there by herself, then with Khalid\u2019s return it had been one lecture and argument after another until she was ready to go insant&gt;</p><p>As she placed her purse on the small table inside the door, her cell phone rang again. The ring tone was a set of strident cymbals. It reminded her of her brother\u2019s habit of demanding she answer the phone quickly.</p><p>She ignored it.</p><p>Pushing her fingers through her hair she walked through the apartment, checked each room, straightened a pillow on the bed then moved back into the living area where she turned on the electric fireplace and collapsed on the large pillows in front of it.</p><p>She felt exhausted.</p><p>Fighting with Khalid always left her feeling as though she had just run a marathon. It sapped her energy and made her question her own logic.</p><p>At the end of the day, what it came down to was the fact that whether it was logical or not, she was miserable living in that big house, unable to visit friends, unable to feel safe and secure in her own home because Khalid\u2019s father was a crazy bastard.</p><p>He\u2019d kidnapped their mother when she was seventeen, forced her to marry him and immediately raped her and forced her to conceive.</p><p>She\u2019d been locked in a harem, forced to spend her days with only one pursuit, that of pleasing him.</p><p>Her mother had lived in hell while she had been imprisoned in the Mustafa stronghold, and only a stroke of luck had afforded her escape.</p><p>Pavlos Galbraithe, her then-fianc\u00e9 and now Paige\u2019s father, had learned of the meeting between Marilyn and Azir Mustafa while Marilyn was visiting family in Cairo, Egypt. Mustafa, he had been told, had been insistent on meeting Marilyn. He\u2019d been entranced by her flame-red, silky hair and brilliant emerald green eyes.</p><p>He\u2019d made her so uncomfortable with his stares and his disapproval each time she spoke that she had excused herself and returned to her room. Only to have her cousin, upset and concerned by Mustafa\u2019s attitude, convince her to come back down because he was becoming so irate.</p><p>The next day, Marilyn had disappeared.</p><p>But still, Pavlos and his future brother-in-law, Henry Girard, wouldn\u2019t have had a chance of gaining entrance into the fortress or rescuing Marilyn if she hadn\u2019t found her own way out through a secret door in the stronghold\u2019s outer wall. A wall that had surrounded the private gardens of the Mustafa harem.</p><p>Paige\u2019s mother had in essence rescued herself and her newborn son, Khalid Mustafa. The baby Azir had forced on her, yet one she had come to adore.</p><p>Pavlos and Henry had been outside that wall, searching for the same secret door they had heard existed that led into the harem. They had been there as the stones seemed to part, push forward, and a slim, darkened figure had slipped out.</p><p>How her mother had managed to survive her time there, Paige had never understood. She knew Marilyn hated Azir Mustafa with a violence that could erupt into fury if his name was mentioned.</p><p>But she loved the son that had been forced on her. Khalid had been her salvation, she claimed. If it hadn\u2019t been for her baby, and the knowledge of what she feared Azir would turn him into, then she wouldn\u2019t have had the strength to keep searching for a way out.</p><p>To Pavlos\u2019s credit, he had endured Khalid. Paige was always aware of the fact that there was an underlying tension between her brother and her father, but the truce was one that had always stood.</p><p>He\u2019d raised Khalid, looked after him and educated him.</p><p>When Khalid had returned to Saudi Arabia after his high school graduation for the agreed-upon stay with his father, Pavlos had been furious. It had been negotiated years before between Marilyn and the Saudi ambassador who had been sent to negotiate what had become an international incident after Mustafa had attempted to kidnap Khalid. But Paige knew her father had arranged with a CIA asset in the area to watch over Khalid and to ensure he came to no harm.</p><p>Staring into the electric flames of the fireplace, Paige readily admitted that Khalid was as hard as he was for a reason. That he knew the dangers, understood the monster that never seemed to stop haunting him, and worried constantly that Azir would strike out at his family.</p><p>The man was insane.</p><p>But Abram wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Khalid knew Abram, she understood that, just as she understood Khalid\u2019s fears in regards to her broken heart. God knew, she didn\u2019t want to face that pain unless she simply had no other choice. But the risk was one she was willing to take. She simply didn\u2019t believe Abram was going to lock her into a harem and beat her each time she tried to escape.</p><p>Shaking her head at the thought, she got to her feet. She moved back to the bedroom to pack a few things to take back to Khalid\u2019s with her.</p><p>She had only a few things of her own there. The way she had been snatched from work and taken to her brother\u2019s home hadn\u2019t given her time to pack.</p><p>She liked her own clothes, thank you very much. And the few things Marty and Khalid had collected for her hadn\u2019t been enough, nor had they been her favorites.</p><p>It looked as though she would be there for a while, so she pulled out the full set of leather luggage her parents had bought her and packed the things she needed.</p><p>Her overnight bag held her shampoos, conditioner, makeup, and fenine items. Several bars of the soap her father kept her supplied with, the scent created especially for her.</p><p>Clothes were harder to choose. She had only two large bags and one lingerie bag. She packed those, zipped them closed, then hauled them to the door before walking through the small apartment one more time.</p><p>She sighed wearily as she stood at the window, staring out into the darkened park across the street. During the day, it was alive with the sound of children\u2019s laughter. At night, occasionally, she had glimpsed lovers walking hand in hand.</p><p>Damn, she hoped she got to come home soon.</p><p>Moving back to the kitchen she was reaching for her purse to call Daniel when a knock at the door had a grin twitching her lips. He was obviously becoming impatient.</p><p>A friend of Khalid\u2019s impatient? Go figure.</p><p>She moved to the door, unlocked it, and swung the door open.</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>Her lips parted to scream.</p><p>A second later, the world went black around her.</p><p>TWO HOURS LATER</p><p>Khalid stood inside the living area of Paige\u2019s apartment and stared around, his chest feeling as though an open wound had been dug into it.</p><p>It was neat, like his sister was, sparsely decorated. She claimed she hadn\u2019t developed her style quite yet. The electric fireplace was still on, and everything appeared perfectly organized.</p><p>\u201cThe majority of her clothes and toiletries are missing.\u201d Daniel Conover moved from the bedroom, his expression foreboding, his blue eyes burning with rage. \u201cHer bags aren\u2019t in the closet.\u201d</p><p>Khalid shoved his hands into the wool coat he wore, his gaze turning to where his lover sat in a comfortable easy chair, her hands covering her face.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t crying, though he knew she was upset. Marty didn\u2019t cry often, thank God. But at the moment, he wished she would, because he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWould his men have packed her bags?\u201d Daniel asked.</p><p>Khalid shook his head. Azir\u2019s men would not have taken the time.</p><p>\u201cShe would have.\u201d Marty lifted her head. \u201cShe was complaining she had none of her favorite clothes or her makeup. She could have packed herself before they arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the bags had been sitting there, and if they were sympathetic to Abram or to myself, then they would have picked up the luggage,\u201d Khalid answered.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like terrorists,\u201d Daniel commented.</p><p>\u201cMany of the new recruits are men and young boys who have been raised within the Mustafa province.\u201d Khalid sighed. \u201cThey know me, they know Abram. They would have grabbed her luggage along with her if there was more than one. They\u2019re aware this is something Abram would be furious over and they may want to garner leniency by providing her clothes.\u201d</p><p>He felt like howling in rage, in pain. He couldn\u2019t believe he had allowed his sister to be taken by that monster, and there was no doubt it was Azir who had taken her.</p><p>They knew Azir Mustafa had his men in the area, several of which were aligned with the terrorist cell Ayid and Aman had commanded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is my fault,\u201d he whispered as he stared around the apartment again, aware of Marty as she rose quickly to her feet and crossed to him.</p><p>\u201cKhalid, this isn\u2019t your fault any more than it\u2019s Paige\u2019s,\u201d she protested. \u201cYou could only keep her confined for so long. She lasted longer than either of us thought she would. He would have been waiting, no matter the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>His arms went around her, the need for her comfort like a beast raging inside him.</p> <p>He had failed his sister.</p><p>\u201cWhen Mother brought her home from the hospital, I stared at this ugly, red-faced little piece of a thing, and I swore I would protect her.\u201d A dagger was digging into his soul. \u201cI swore she would not know what my mother had known. That she would not face that hell if I lived and breathed. And now, he has her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Abram will have her.\u201d She pulled back just enough to glare up at him. \u201cKhalid, no matter what you believe about your brother, he will protect Paige. You know he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I believe about my brother.\u201d He sighed as he met her gaze. \u201cI believe Abram is a good man, Marty. But even good men have their faults. And his fascination with Paige bothers me. He\u2019ll fight against Azir until hell freezes over, and he\u2019ll walk away from that land without a backward look, but he\u2019s still a product of the desert and how he was raised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKhalid, you know Abram would never do anything to hurt Paige.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cBut he\u2019ll end up hurting her just the same. If he can get to her before Azir kills her.\u201d</p><p>And that was his nightmare.</p><p>The enmity between Khalid and his father was at a breaking point. Khalid had gone to one of the reigning princes and the Saudi ambassador concerning Azir\u2019s sanity and Ayid and Aman\u2019s attack against him. And he knew it was a matter that was being investigated. Azir would know it as well. He had his own spies within the monarchy, and his own ways of gaining information.</p><p>Thank God Abram hadn\u2019t officially defected after Ayid and Aman had been killed. If he had, there would have been no one there to protect Paige.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been about two hours since I found the door open and Paige gone,\u201d Daniel stated. \u201cWe have all the airports covered and we\u2019re checking all the private planes on the ground. There are officers checking out the private landing strips as well.\u201d</p><p>Khalid shook his head. \u201cThey were in the air within thirty minutes or less of having taken her. She\u2019s gone, Daniel.\u201d</p> <p>And it was his fault.</p><p>He looked down at Marty again, misery crawling through his body as guilt raked sharpened talons across his heart.</p><p>\u201cI need to contact Abram.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI can only do that from the house. The satellite link we\u2019ve established can only be made from one location and only at certain times of the day.\u201d He checked his watch as Marty moved back.</p><p>Catching her hand with his he looked around the room once again. \u201cIt will be another two hours before I can send the message to Abram. Until then, I can still get ahold of a few contacts I have in Saudi and see what can be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to tell your mother and Pavlos,\u201d Marty reminded him gently. \u201cThey\u2019re flying into D.C. tonight. We should be there when they arrive.\u201d</p><p>His mother had been worried. She had been certain Azir wouldn\u2019t wait much longer to attempt to take Paige, and she had been right.</p><p>God, this was going to kill her.</p><p>Fragile, gentle, his delicate mother may not survive if her daughter never returned home to her.</p> <p>He breathed out heavily.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet them,\u201d he told her. \u201cAfter I send a message to Abram. Let\u2019s get back to the house.\u201d He turned to Daniel. \u201cLock up the apartment. Check with her neighbors and see if they heard anything. We may not be able to catch them, but hopefully we can track down whoever helped them. They couldn\u2019t have pulled this off without help.\u201d</p><p>Daniel nodded, then paused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Khalid,\u201dhe said, his voice low. \u201cThis happened on my watch, and it shouldn\u2019t have. I take full responsibility for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs Marty said, he would have found an opportunity eventually,\u201d he stated, though a part of him blamed the investigator/security consultant. It had been his job to protect her and to ensure no gaps were open in her security.</p><p>It was a no-win situation though. Sooner or later, it would have happened, Khalid knew. Everyone had to blink eventually.</p><p>Holding Marty\u2019s hand, Khalid turned and headed for the door. He was almost there when something caught his eye. A glimmer of gold on the floor.</p><p>Stopping, he bent and picked up the delicate little hoop with its fragile, dangling chains attached to tiny gold feathers.</p><p>The earrings Abram had sent to her for her twenty-first birthday.</p><p>He grimaced at the thought.</p><p>He\u2019d fought to keep them apart over the years, even knowing it was doing little good, and that the day would come when nothing could stop it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he believed Abram would hurt her, or even that he wouldn\u2019t be good for her. It was simply that Khalid knew his brother, and he knew, after the deaths of his first two wives, any lover he had would suffer the ultraprotective possessiveness Abram would feel.</p><p>Independence would go to hell along with the hearts. Abram wouldn\u2019t be able to control himself, and all that dark, tortured hunger inside him would become a ravening beast in the face of Paige\u2019s determination.</p><p>And this was where Paige would struggle.</p><p>There was no hunger strong enough, no love vital enough and no woman with enough patience or enough understanding to stand against a man determined to lock her away from the world.</p><p>Khalid had always feared that was exactly what Abram would attempt to do with the fiery independence that was so much a part of Paige.</p><p>And there wouldn\u2019t be a damned thing he could do to save her from it.</p><p>4</p><p>She was so screwed.</p><p>That was the first thought that drifted through her mind as Paige\u2019s eyes blinked open and she found herself in an unfamiliar room.</p><p>If she thought her suite at her brother\u2019s home was too expensive and opulent, then it was nothing compared to where she found herself now.</p><p>In000000\"&gt;The room was huge, at least twelve feet tall with several motorized fans turning lazily overhead and creating the slightest breeze.</p><p>She was laying on a huge bed, its comfort unlike anything she had known before. Beneath her naked body she could feel the excellent grade and cool perfection of the silk sheets.</p><p>Laying over her was more silk, the sheet against her flesh airy and cool while the ultra-thin cashmere throw laying on top of her added a measure of warmth.</p><p>Looking around, she saw velvet upholstery on the chairs next to a fireplace, and what appeared to be a silk-covered chaise lounge positioned at the side of the room. There were large pillows tossed in front of the hearth in differing sizes and in different expensive materials.</p><p>The windows were high and arched with wooden shutters pulled closed against the sunlight. The slats in the shutters allowed the fragile, heated rays to slip in and pierce the dim light.</p><p>White stone walls peeked out from behind several large tapestries, reminding her of the ancient castles she\u2019d visited in England.</p><p>Stone floors were covered here and there with matching tapestries, and in front of the fireplace lay what appeared to be a thick, cashmere rug.</p><p>Swallowing tight, Paige felt the gummy, sticky feeling of her mouth. She wondered how long she had been unconscious as she fought to keep her hysteria under control.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t concentrate on something else, then she wouldn\u2019t make it. She collapsed into a heap of pure hysterical fear.</p><p>Because she knew exactly where she was. She\u2019d heard her mother describe this room so many times it was burned into her brain.</p><p>This was the room she had lived in during her stay when she wasn\u2019t locked in Azir\u2019s bedroom. She ate in this room, wept in this room, and plotted her escape from this room.</p><p>She was in the Mustafa stronghold on the Saudi Arabian and Iraqi borders. A wasteland of unproven ground, where even oil didn\u2019t reside.</p><p>Nothing of consequence lived here, as she had heard Abram and Khalid say, except the people who had been born here, worked here, and eeked out their living here.</p><p>The fortress had been built centuries before, the castle a mix of both Middle Eastern and English influence well before the days of the Knights Templars and the holy wars.</p><p>She had seen pictures of it. Khalid and her mother had put together a map of sorts of the castle and the outlying areas around it.</p><p>There were ways to escape; Paige just had to find them.</p><p>Terror was crawling through her now. She hadn\u2019t believed Azir Mustafa would retaliate against Khalid. He\u2019d threatened before. How many times had Paige been locked behind protective walls because Khalid and Azir were feuding again, or because Azir had, in one of his periods of insane fury, threatened to kidnap Paige\u2019s mother and bring her back where he believed she belonged?</p><p>There had been too many times to count. And he\u2019d never done it before. Evidently he had grown tired of simply threatening.</p><p>He had actually managed to kidnap her, and evidently Abram had no idea. If he knew, he would have been there when she awoke, she told herself. He wouldn\u2019t have allowed her to face this alone.</p><p>Now he had her. A monster.</p><p>Her chest tightened, her throat nearly closing with fear and tears as she fought against it. She wasn\u2019t going to allow him to see her cry. It was a sign of weakness, and like any jackal, she couldn\u2019t allow Azir Mustafa to see her weakness. Or her fear.</p><p>Pulling the sheet and throw closer around her nakedness as fear began to send shudders through her body, Paige\u2019s breath hitched as she pushed back her screams.</p><p>She was stronger than this, she assured herself. Azir Mustafa would be looking for fear. And he might have her now, but not once Abram found her, or learned she was there, which would be as soon as Khalid contacted him. If he hadn\u2019t already.</p><p>No. Her hands tightened on the sheet and throw convulsively. If Khalid had contacted Abram then Abram would be here. He would be assuring her everything was going to be okay. He would be finding a way to get her home. And he really needed to get on that. Sometime before her heart burst from terror.</p><p>She was naked, in a bed. Breath hitching, gasping from her lips she began to check her body, to feel between her thighs. Desperation was an oily stain across her mind as she checked her body, praying to God she hadn\u2019t been raped, because she knew Azir Mustafa wasn\u2019t above drugging a woman to rape her.</p><p>There were no signs of it, but the fact that she was naked, that someone had undressed her to bare skin while she was unconscious was a violation as well. It made her feel helpless and out of control and that terrified her.</p><p>She\u2019d always sympathized with her mother for what she\u2019d gone through with Azir. She\u2019d hated the bastard for it. But now, she understood much better exactly how her mother had felt, and she was scared.</p><p>She should have listened to Khalid and not left the house. If she had just stayed in place, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. At least not yet. Not this way.</p><p>Every time she ever refused to listen to him, she had paid for it. That was why she hadn\u2019t fought against him as hard as she could have when he first had her taken to the house by Daniel Conover. Because she knew Khalid wouldn\u2019t have done it without good reason.</p><p>Rising from the bed she moved around the room, searching for the clothes that had been taken from her. Her jeans and shirt, her underclothes. Her shoes. Oh God, she really needed her shoes. How was she supposed to escape without running shoes?</p><p>Se couldn\u2019t bear to be naked as she was. She felt too exposed, despite the sheet and throw she had wrapped around herself. The material didn\u2019t even begin to be protective. Not that clothing would have been.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear to feel this helpless. That was what Khalid didn\u2019t understand, and what she could never tell him. She had only been this helpless once before in her life and the memories of it sent a surge of terror racing through her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tried to shake the memory away. Dealing with the memories of that night right now would shred what little control she had left over the hysteria bubbling inside her.</p><p>She had to clear her head. She had to be able to think and find a way out of this.</p><p>She had to find a way out. She had found a way out the last time she was this helpless and had escaped. She had to do it again. She didn\u2019t think her sanity could survive otherwise.</p> <p>The door was locked. The shutters on the windows were locked. Her mother hadn\u2019t mentioned hidden doors or passageways in this room.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t find her clothes. There were no dressers and the four armoires in the room only held bedding materials. There were no clothes.</p><p>Her breath felt trapped in her lungs. Her heart was racing out of control and panic was beginning to close in.</p><p>She would go crazy in this place.</p><p>Abram sat back in the comfortable leather of the modified Land Rover as Tariq drove into the fortress compound. His gaze narrowed at the men and women milling around in the outer yards. The women were covered from head to toe in the required burka, while the men were dressed in fatigues or combat-ready pants and shirts.</p> <p>The face of the Mustafa province was changing and he hadn\u2019t been able to stop it during the years when stopping it had mattered to him. All he did now was look on in regret.</p><p>Once, this land had thrived, if not from oil then from the small mines outside of town where precious ore was eeked out and sold to the government. It had been a minimal income, but when added to the funds the monarchy had once sent, the lands and mines had been sufficient to keep the small farms pulling precious water from the deep wells and the crops growing.</p><p>The province had held a small but thriving area of trade due to those crops and the ore. Something it no longer held because of Azir\u2019s greed and murderous inclinations.</p><p>\u201cLook who showed up.\u201d Tariq nodded toward the fortress castle where a lone figure stood at the top of the stone steps against the stone wall.</p><p>The tall double doors were his backdrop, emphasizing the slender, muscular form, his dark hair pulled back from a lean, Arabic face.</p><p>The man who had been slowly overtaking the Mustafa fortress even before the deaths of Ayid and Aman Mustafa. No matter how Abram had fought over the years, still, Jafar Mustafa\u2014along with Ayid and Aman\u2014had facilitated the steady introduction of men Abram was certain were no more than soldiers to the terrorist cell Ayid and Aman had commanded. A cell Jafar was now rumored to command.</p> <p>First cousin to both Abram and Tariq, Jafar was the son of the youngest of the three Mustafa brothers who had inherited differing sections of the province from their father.</p><p>Until the two youngest brothers had died under highly suspicious circumstances. Abram had always suspected Azir had had his brothers killed, but he had never been able to prove it.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t want anything good,\u201d Abram assured him as Tariq drew the Land Rover to a stop before the castle. Stepping from the vehicle Abram allowed Tariq to move in behind him and cover his back. They mounted the steps and moved up to the entrance where Jafar awaited them.</p><p>The dark arrogance in the other man\u2019s expression was a forewarning. Abram could feel the tension emanating from him, the animosity that had been brewing between them mixing to create a heavy, barely civil atmosphere.</p><p>The cynical amusement in Jafar\u2019s odd green eyes was a clue to the fact that he wasn\u2019t going to like whatever the other man had to say. Fortunately, there was at least a shred of information in anything Jafar said. He enjoyed the games he played and the fact that Abram couldn\u2019t do a damned thing to stop the steady infiltration of the terrorists moving in.</p><p>Like Abram and Tariq, Jafar\u2019s mother had been American. But unlike them, Jafar had actually inherited some of his mother\u2019s traits. His hair was a deep, dark brown, rather than black, and the celadon green of his eyes was damned off-putting in a land of mostly dark eyes.</p><p>The men of Mustafa seemed to have a particular fondness for pale-haired or redheaded women. Jafar\u2019s mother had been a Scandinavian blonde and like Abram and Tariq, he had taken his height from her ancestors.</p><p>It was a fondness their sons seemed to share as well, Abram thought.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want, Jafar?\u201d he growled as he topped the stone stairs and faced his cousin.</p><p>Jafar chuckled, the amusement in the sound matching that of his eyes as his gaze flicked between Abram and Tariq.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I just want to wish you a good afternoon, cousin. After all, it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve visited. Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t missed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t missed you,\u201d Abram assured him with a sneering lift of his lip. \u201cIs that all you wanted?\u201d</p><p>The smirk on Jafar\u2019s lips assured him otherwise.</p><p>It was too bad they seemed to have gravitated to opposing ends of their own beliefs. There had been a time when he and Jafar had been close. When they had both spoken of the dream of a far different future than the ones they had embraced.</p><p>Abram waited for long, tense moments for Jafar to reveal why he was waiting, but when he didn\u2019t, Abram\u2019s patience began to dissolve.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell, Jafar,\u201d he grunted. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re doing more than fucking off.\u201d</p><p>Jafar\u2019s eyes narrowed at the deliberate vulgarity. He and his cousin had been in more than one battle in the past years over Abram\u2019s language or Jafar\u2019s deliberate disrespect. Many times their disagreements had almost turned violent and nearly resulted in a punch being thrown.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Abram, do you believe your friendship with the son of a prince will save you forever? Or the fact that the unpaid funds owed to the land of Mustafa can only return at your inheritance assures your safety from those who suspect your depravities?\u201d</p><p>His depravities. What a damned joke. He enjoyed a good whiskey, a beautiful woman, and on occasion he was prone to enjoy watching his lover become a willing sensual feast for not just him, but a third as well.</p><p>Those were his depravities.</p><p>\u201cFriendships rarely stand when you need them to, Jafar. I believe we\u2019re both aware of that.\u201d He stared back at his cousin mockingly.</p><p>Jafar\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cI knew nothing of Lessa\u2019s crimes, nor did I know of the plans to punish her.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time he had denied the knowledge, and it wasn\u2019t the last time Abram would accuse him of it. Because he knew his cousin had to have at least suspected.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, I vowed I would never again have to depend upon those I call friends to aid me,\u201d Abram informed him. \u201cThat is a commodity that only a fool can expect.\u201d</p><p>Better Jafar believe to the bone that Abram expected no help from anyone should the religious police decide to actually take action against him for his suspected s, especially the son of a prince, the government contact in charge of investigating the terrorists taking over the Mustafa lands and focusing their attention on Paige Galbraithe.</p><p>Until he learned Azir\u2019s plans for her, he couldn\u2019t rest. And so far, he hadn\u2019t been able to learn anything except that Azir was definitely planning something.</p><p>Abram would take them all down to keep her safe. Jafar, Azir, the son of a prince, he\u2019d see them all laying in the dust if that was what it took to keep the evil infecting his father from touching her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy, Jafar,\u201d he finally stated. He fought to push back his anger as he moved to pass his cousin once again.</p><p>\u201cAbram.\u201d Jafar stopped him again as he moved to enter the castle.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Jafar?\u201d he questioned impatiently, his teeth clenching at the anger he couldn\u2019t seem to stop from surging through him.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when we were sixteen and I caught you and that American student you were friends with at the whore\u2019s apartment?\u201d</p><p>Abram\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cShe was no whore, Jafar.\u201d</p><p>They had been in America visiting with cousins who had lived in D.C. Abram had met up with friends of Khalid\u2019s and from there, had done his best to enjoy the time there rather than involving himself with a family that had escaped years before.</p><p>\u201cShe was taking two men into her body at the same time,\u201d Jafar reminded him mockingly. \u201cIn any culture, she is called a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in this one,\u201d Abram snarled. \u201cNow tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me first,\u201d Jafar told him. \u201cDo you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Abram snapped. \u201cNow what does it have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>Jafar\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cI warned you about bringing your hungers from America to your home,\u201d Jafar reminded him. \u201cAnd you brought them not just to your home, but to your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me kill you, Jafar.\u201d Even now, more than ten years later, the memory of what had happened to Lessa had the power to enrage him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me have to deal with the religious police, Abram,\u201d Jafar warned him in return. \u201cKeep your depravities under control. The battle we are involved in together, I prefer to win fairly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is noattle,\u201d Abram assured him seriously, and as far as he was concerned, there wasn\u2019t one. There would never be one.</p><p>Once Abram had achieved his objectives, then he was gone. If he hadn\u2019t found a way to keep Paige safe from his father before the king\u2019s emissary arrived, then he would simply take her and disappear until the bastard\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cThere is always a battle between us, Abram,\u201d Jafar retorted. \u201cAnd I am impatient. I may refuse to wait until the battle between you and your father has ended before I begin pushing for my own triumph.\u201d</p><p>Abram\u2019s lips thinned as he stared back at his cousin, attempting to figure out just what the hell he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cThere is no battle between us, Jafar,\u201d he told him again.</p><p>Jafar chuckled. \u201cTell that lie to the present your father has acquired for your early birthday present, my friend. Then tell me how you\u2019re going to survive the means he has acquired to win this war that wages between you. And I tell you once again, remember well the warning I gave you when we were sixteen, because I may not give you fair warning in time to save you from the consequences of your own sins.\u201d</p><p>Abram felt ice race up his spine at Jafar\u2019s words as the other man smirked back at him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t possible. God help him, he\u2019d done everything he could, used every contact he had to ensure he had warning before it happened, not after.</p><p>Fury began burning in the back of his head, engulfing his senses as he stared into Jafar\u2019s eyes and read the truth there.</p><p>Tension radiated through his body. His muscles began to tighten as though in preparation for a fight, his fists clenching in rage. A hard, warning sizzle began at the base of his brain as the red at the edges of his vision began to darken and push forward.</p><p>Murderous, all-consuming rage washed over him.</p><p>\u201cWhat has he done?\u201d he snarled back at his cousin.</p><p>Jafar\u2019s gaze flashed with what could have been a momentary regret before hatred filled the pale green orbs once again.</p><p>\u201cWhat he always does,\u201d Jafar answered him. \u201cHe\u2019s plotted your destruction. Though, this time it may well be your final one.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe this.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a single article of clothing to be found in any of the four armoires arranged around the stone room. There were sheets, throws, there were even pillows. But there wasn\u2019t a single shirt, pair of pants, or even a pair of socks ... Would socks have been out of the damned question?</p><p>This was completely ridiculous. The least they could have done was left her something to wear.</p><p>Tucking the silk sheet between her breasts, she propped her hands on her hips and stared around the dim, sun-dappled room with a frown and narrowed eyes.</p><p>Her mother had never really said much about this room, other than it had belonged to Azir\u2019s first wife, Abram\u2019s mother, Shahla, as Azir had named her. Her actual name, as she had told Marilyn, had been Anna Bailey. She\u2019d been on vacation in Saudi Arabia with her family. Her father had been an executive for one of the oil companies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paige\u2019s mother had contacted Anna Bailey\u2019s family as soon as she had been able to, but they seemed reluctant to believe her, or to do anything to rescue their daughter.</p><p>Pavlos had checked into it for the woman he still intended to marry, and learned that when Anna had been kidnapped, her father had received a large deposit to his account to cover excess gambling debts.</p><p>Marilyn had always suspected Anna\u2019s family had sold her, or perhaps accepted the payment to stop searching for their daughter and accusing the Saudi government of covering up her disappearance.</p> <p>Both Anna Bailey and the French-born tourist Marilyn Girard would have been forgotten had it not been for Pavlos Galbraithe\u2019s determination to find his fianc\u00e9e, and Marilyn\u2019s stubbornness in not giving up her plans to escape.</p><p>But, by the time Pavlos had put together a team willing to breech the fortress and rescue Anna and her son, Azir had killed her. According to Abdul at the time, Azir had strangled her to death in her own bedroom, in front of her three-year-old son, after dragging them both back from an escape attempt.</p><p>Abdul had recounted to her parents and to Khalid how the young Abram had screamed and even then, fought to free himself from the wooden crib he had been placed in. How the moment his mother had dropped to the ground, lifeless, he had stopped screaming, stared at her, then slowly sat down in his bed, lifted his eyes to his father, and simply stared back at him.</p><p>Now, more than thirty years later, Abram was still attempting to stand between his father and a woman Azir was trying to kill.</p><p>Where the hell was he now? She could use a little rescuing herself.</p> <p>He had to be here somewhere. There was no doubt in her mind this was the Mustafa fortress on the Iraqi border. She hadn\u2019t been kidnapped and sold, she had simply been kidnapped by a madman. Didn\u2019t that just round out her week.</p><p>Turning, she walked back to the middle of the \" align=where she stood looking around once more, trying to find something that would at least make her feel as though she were trying to escape.</p><p>As she started to move toward one of the armoires again, the wide, heavy wooden door was thrown open, a breeze surging past her. She stared at the apparition that entered with a nightmarish vision of terror.</p><p>The sense that this couldn\u2019t be happening almost overwhelmed her. It had to be a dream.</p><p>Azir Mustafa swept into the room, his black eyes locked on her, his desert-dark face worn and creased with bitter lines. The long white thobe, the loose, ankle-length garment mostly worn in the Middle East seemed to ripple around his broad, overweight body. The ghutra, or keffiyeh, the large white square cloth secured to his head by a black cord, swept out behind him only to reverse direction and swirl around him as he came to an abrupt stop. He stared back at her as though mesmerized.</p><p>His eyes appeared dazed and damp. His expression filled with deepening hope as he watched her carefully, as though frightened she would disappear at any moment.</p> <p>He lifted a shaking hand as though to touch her from a more than ten-foot distance, before he let it fall limply back to his side.</p><p>\u201cMarilyn,\u201d he whispered, his lips trembling as he took a step forward, bemusement and mesmerism slackening his expression. \u201cYou stayed so young, Marilyn. And I have grown so old. What trick is this that you return to me, the same as you left?\u201d</p><p>Paige gripped the sheet between her breasts and stepped back, her eyes narrowing at the proof of Azir\u2019s weakening sanity. He thought she was her mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Marilyn.\u201d Paige informed him cautiously. She didn\u2019t look that much like her mother.</p><p>\u201cMarilyn,\u201d he whispered again. \u201cMy precious Marilyn. Why did you leave? Why did you corrupt my sons?\u201d Pain, bitter and filled with a little boy\u2019s confusion, he watched her with tears in his eyes. \u201cDid I not love you above all others? Did I not whisper my love to you each time I held you?\u201d</p><p>Paige inhaled sharply. Her mother had said Azir was insane, even when he was younger. Paige had always argued that it wasn\u2019t insanity, it was criminal arrogance. Now, she wondered if her mother hadn\u2019t been right all along. It was obvious the man had some serious, delusional issues.</p><p>The crazed belief that filled Azir\u2019s face as he stared at her wasn\u2019t in the least bit comforting. He truly believed that somehow, Marilyn had returned to him.</p><p>Paige moved back another step as Azir came forward the same distance. She felt like a mouse being toyed with by a very large cat, and she had no hole to hide in.</p> <p>\u201cCome to me, Marilyn. His expression tightened in anger as she kept retreating. \u201cDo not test my anger, beloved. You know you will lose and I will feel remorse for the need to punish you. You are my wife. You may not refuse me.\u201d</p><p>He actually thought she was going to let him touch her? If he was playing a game, then he was doing a damned good job of it. And if he wasn\u2019t, then he was far crazier than anyone suspected and she was in a hell of a lot more trouble than she had imagined.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a mistake,\u201d she stated warily. \u201cI\u2019m not Marilyn. I\u2019m her daughter, Paige.\u201d</p><p>Azir stopped and frowned at her, his body poised as though ready to jump on her. He eased back, his eyes narrowing on her before pure, furious hatred snapped into his gaze for a quick second. In the next second, his eyes cleared and he stared around the room as though wondering how he had found himself there.</p><p>He turned back to her slowly.</p><p>\u201cPaige Galbraithe,\u201d he murmured, his rasping voice the sound of a nightmare in her mind. \u201cThe daughter of my faithless, adulterous wife and the whore\u2019s son that stole her from me. A diseased bastard daughter. You should have been stoned to death at birth.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, his voice became louder, harder, and more furious until the enraged tone sounded grating and filled with the very insanity Paige had doubted he suffered from.</p><p>Oh, he was insane all right. There was no doubt in her mind now that he was bat-shit crazy.</p><p>\u201cMother wouldn\u2019t be pleased if you killed me, Azir,\u201d she told him with subtle, flippant mockery, as though he might really give a fuck. \u201cShe might never come visit you before you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mock me,\u201d he rasped. \u201cNo worries, I can have it done whenever I please. It is a matter easily taken care of. The sins of the mother become the responsibility of the daughter.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe this. It was a nightmare. He was past insane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve committed no sin.\u201d Her fingers tightened on the sheet as his gaze flicked to her breasts then back to her eyes. She actually felt dirty from the look.</p><p>\u201cYour mother did, that\u2019s enough.\u201d He smiled almost pleasantly. Pretty much crazily. \u201cI could have you dragged to the courtyard and stones would be battering your weak body within minutes. I could take that very pretty face, so much like your mother\u2019s, and I could crush it.\u201d His hand lifted, his fingers snapping into a fist in emphasis.</p><p>She could see the rage in his eyes and in his face. He was flushed with it, his gaze becoming demented with it. There was a need glittering in his eyes to hurt her, to destroy her. He looked at her and he saw the mother, not the daughter. But he also saw what he called her mother\u2019s sins. Hell, she wasn\u2019t going to win here.</p><p>Strange, her horoscope hadn\u2019t mentioned to beware of crazy kidnappers or demented desert sheikhs this week.</p><p>If Abram didn\u2019t get here, really fast, then she was going to be in a hell of a lot more trouble than she could pull herself out of on her own. Maybe. It was kind of hard to find options that involved being dressed in nothing but a very expensive, very soft sheet.</p><p>It was apparent Azir thought he could punish the daughter because the mother had escaped him. And she didn\u2019t doubt he had all intentions of doing just that.</p><p>Marilyn Girard had escaped and taken his three-month-old son, and she had married another man and had a child by him as well. Paige was that child, and as he stared at her, she realized he could easily choke the life right out of her and never regret it. He could happily throw her to whomever would stone her, and feel nothing but cheerful glee as each heavy blow broke her body further.</p><p>Oh God, where was Abram?</p><p>\u201cYou have her eyes,\u201d Azir said as he stilled once again, his head tilting to the side to stare back at her with an odd smirk. \u201cEyes that mesmerize a man and fill him with the desire to do nothing but possess you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be indigestion. Trust me, possessing me is a very bad idea. It could be considered really irritating I\u2019ve been told,\u201d she suggested brazenly, certain she was going to die at any moment, but she would be damned if she would go down without a fight.</p><p>She would not give this old, vicious monster the satisfaction of seeing her cry, or beg. Unless it hurt too badly. She might beg then, she thought irrationally. Anything was possible.</p><p>The shark\u2019s smile that curled his lips was filled with a pure, cruel menace as his expression turned mocking, threatening.</p><p>\u201cSpeak to me with such disrespect again and I will have your tongue sliced from your mouth before you have the chance to beg my son to aid you,\u201d he warned her, his monstrous voice grating with savage anticipation. \u201cI will ensure he does not endure the disrespect of the daughter as I did the mother.\u201d</p><p>Okay, no more disrespect. She liked her tongue in her mouth, thank you very much.</p><p>She stared back at him silently, certain there had to be a weakness she could exploit to at least survive until she found a way to run.</p><p>Running beat standing here and waiting for him to choke her to death as he had Abram\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cYou know my son don\u2019t you, my dear? Both of my sons, actuen tol One is your brother, and what would the other be to you, I wonder?\u201d He chuckled insidiously. \u201cAre you a whore as your mother is? Do you lie down and spread your legs for any dog that would hump between them as well as the friends he would bring with him? Do you lie between two as easily as you would with one?\u201d</p><p>The vulgarity of the insult had her eyes narrowing as anger began to swirl and tighten into pure fury. She bit her tongue until she thought she might bite through it as easily as the knife he had threatened to slice it off with.</p><p>She really didn\u2019t want to lose her tongue, and she had no doubt he wasn\u2019t dead fucking serious about the threat, but dammit, that was her mother.</p><p>\u201cAnd your brother.\u201d He sneered. \u201cHis perversions infected my heir and my home until Abram gave to him the virtuous wife he had married. She spread her legs for them together and spoke such filth that she desecrated the marriage bed she was given.\u201d</p><p>Khalid was her brother. He pissed her off regularly, but she would die for him. If Azir kept this up, she would be losing her tongue for certain.</p><p>She stepped back cautiously as he took another step forward, his fists clenching and unclenching spasmodically as she breathed in deeply.</p><p>\u201cAzir, this isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d She was wasting her breath and she knew it. \u201cCome on, I know many of your nephews and nieces. Several of your king\u2019s great granddaughters are friends of mine. Protests are already being filed with your government over this, if I know my parents and if Abram finds out you harmed me, he won\u2019t be happy, and you know Khalid will go crazy on you.\u201d</p><p>She could see the hatred in Azir\u2019s face as she said his son\u2019s name. Khalid had killed his two sons, but only to protect himself as well as Marty when they attacked him in his home.</p><p>Paige watched him warily as she tried to maneuver closer to the door, only to have him block her attempt to slide around a chaise and run for the exit.</p><p>He smiled in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cIf you die, then he will not risk God\u2019s displeasure, nor the retaliation of the Matawa for his perversions with you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou were seen, spreading your thighs, speaking the filth and begging for more.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, not in shame or in embarrassment, but in anger. Maybe, if she screamed for Abram, he would hear her? But if he were that close, he would have been here.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Paige, how is my bastard, traitorous son and his whore doing these days?\u201d His lips curled in disgust. \u201cI was actually surprised his brother Abram wasn\u2019t present in the bed with him and his little Jezebel, rather than that ineffective agent to your FBI that was fucking her instead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How in God\u2019s name did Azir know these things? Shane Conner, the FBI agent, was Khalid\u2019s third, that was the truth. He was also working with Daniel Conover\u2019s security firm to upgrade the electronic security on Khalid\u2019s estate.</p><p>But Azir\u2019s men hadn\u2019t managed to kidnap her from Khalid\u2019s estate.</p><p>Oh yeah, that\u2019s right, she was too fucking stupid to stay there. Azir\u2019s men had caught her in her own home.</p> <p>Azir knew things that were going on in that house that no one should have known about. Shane Connor\u2019s role as Khalid\u2019s third wasn\u2019t a well known fact, even among the few friends Paige knew they had, who shared that little sexual taste.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not answering me.\u201d Malice flashed in Azir\u2019s face. \u201cDid your mother not teach you to respect your elders, you little bitch? Or did she only teach you to be the whore she is as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is no whore!\u201d The words jumped from her lips as though they had a mind of her own.</p><p>He could have her tongue at this point. She wouldn\u2019t stand to hear her mother called such names. \u201cI did not ask your opinion on whether or not she was the whore we both know she is. I asked you how that bastard brother and his Jezebel are doing. A simple enough request I thought, or are you too stupid to understand even that much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know a bastard brother or anyone called Jezebel.\u201d Brief. To the point. She had to fight the need to tell the dirty son of a bitch exactly where he could get off at.</p> <p>His lips twisted in satisfaction. \u201cPunishing you will be a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt you\u2019ll find it the highlight of your old and wasted life,\u201d she muttered. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you tell me why I\u2019m here rather than threatening me all day?\u201d</p><p>He grunted at what she considered a very clear order.</p><p>\u201cWhat of the less than charming Mr. Connor? Is he still fucking Khalid\u2019s trash up the ass or has he fulfilled his depravity and Khalid\u2019s, by actually taking Khalid like the animals they both are?\u201d Azir watched her like a hungry wolf.</p><p>Paige could feel a chill of dread race up her spine as her skin crawled with distaste at the lustful interest in his gaze. Each time he mentioned Khalid and Shane sharing Marty, or any reference to their sexual activities, hunger flashed across his face.</p><p>She shook her head warily. \u201cYou must have the Shane Connor I know confused with someone else, not to mention the Khalid andrty I know. Are you sure you haven\u2019t been sniffing the camel glue a little too often?.\u201d</p> <p>Azir snorted sarcastically, his lips curling in disgust. \u201cI should have killed him and his whoring mother when I had the chance. When I realized she was as faithless as the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll women are just whores to you, aren\u2019t they, Azir?\u201d Good common sense was overridden by the continued insults to her gentle, compassionate mother.</p><p>Despite the time she had been locked in these rooms, raped nightly and forced to conceive the child of her rapist, still, she had adored her son and lavished him with love, just as she had her daughter.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is a whore,\u201d he snarled. \u201cShe shares herself as her son shares the diseased flesh of his women. She corrupted my son\u2019s mind and his soul and turned him into a depraved animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you kidnapped and raped her, and forced her to marry you I\u2019d say you\u2019re the monster and the animal, not my mother or my brother,\u201d Paige retorted scathingly. She could practically feel the knife against her tongue now.</p><p>\u201cYour father stole what was mine. He is the kidnapper, the criminal. From my very home he tore my wife from my arms and turned her against me.\u201d He raged, his arms lifting, fingers curling to fists as he brought them to his chest as though in supplication. \u201cDo you not understand what they did to me? To my child? They destroyed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was running for her life when my uncle and my father found her,\u201d she argued desperately. \u201cShe risked death to escape you, Azir. No one had to tear her from your arms because she had already done it for herself. She risked her life and that of her baby to get away from you, Mustafa!\u201d</p><p>Hatred.</p> <p>It was like a disease.</p><p>It overrode terror just enough to keep her from shutting her mouth and being prudent. Her temper was getting the best of her. It was her curse. She was a nice person, she really was, until someone ignorant decided to force that ignorance in her face, and then she just couldn\u2019t hold back.</p><p>\u201cShe belongs to me!\u201d he screamed, his eyes widening, becoming crazed as he surged forward before she could escape him.</p><p>He caught her off guard as he backhanded her with what she was certain had to be the full force he possessed. It was enough force to make her feel as if the blow had disintegrated every bone in her head.</p><p>Lights exploded before her eyes as she felt herself all but fly across the room to collapse against the stone floor. Her head was ringing with a thousand cymbals, her gaze dizzy as she lost her breath. She felt herself trying to pass out from the coppery taste of her own blood.</p><p>The taste filled her mouth, and in a distant, horror-filled part of her mind Paige realized that this was the first time in her life that she had ever been struck.</p><p>\u201cYou are a disrespectful little harlot, just as your mother was. But she learned her place, and you will learn yours. Or you will die as I should have killed her.\u201d</p><p>He stood over her, raging down at her like a maniac.</p><p>\u201cShe escaped you though, didn\u2019t she?\u201d She wheezed as she fought to breathe through the pain, her arms shaking as she tried to brace them under her. \u201cShe hates you, Azir. She hates you so much she\u2019d kill you herself if she could.\u201d</p><p>If she was going to die, then she would be damned if she wouldn\u2019t inflict just as many insults as she could drag out of her ringing, pain-dazed mind.</p><p>\u201cI could break you!\u201d He sounded like a wild animal as she tried to focus on him. \u201cI should show you how easy it is to break a little whore such as yourself. I could make you beg to die. Beg to call your mother a whore to her face just to make the pain cease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kill myself first,\u201d she snarled back at him. She tried to brace herself against the floor, her arm losing strength and giving up on her as she fell to the floor once again.</p><p>A second later vicious fingers were curling into her hair, dragging her to her knees as she screamed.</p><p>Her struggles were weak, ineffective. She hadn\u2019t managed to get her bearings from that blow yet or the agonizing pain still roiling through her senses, and the strength was just slow returning, she told herself.</p><p>She could feel the knotted sheet between her breasts slipping. Suddenly, the knowledge that she would be naked before him seemed as bad as being raped by him. Someone had already undressed her, that violation was enough. She sure as hell had no intention of allowing him to see her again, while she was conscious.</p><p>She struggled to grip the sheet and hold it to her as Azir, gripping her arms, jerked her to her feet and began shaking her viciously. Her head jerked dangerously on her shoulders as she tried to dig her nails into his arms, but she was weak and dizzy.</p><p>\u201cI trained that little bitch, just as I\u2019ll train you.\u201d</p><p>With the last word she felt the strength gather in his arms and a second later he had flung her away from him. Hard.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to be able to break her fall.</p><p>Paige braced herself as she lost her grip on the sheet. This one was really going to hurt and there was no way to stop it.</p><p>Hell, she was going to be naked in front of Azir Mustafa.</p><p>A sob tore from her throat as she felt herself flying. Fear struck every nerve in her body a millisecond before her flight abruptly ended.</p><p>Strong hands caught her, pulling her against a hard, warm body as the sheet was simultaneously straightened around her nakedness.</p><p>Abram!</p><p>Her fingers curled against his arm, feeling the softness of cotton over his flesh as he held her to him, the warmth of his body wrapping around her.</p><p>He was here. Finally. He hadn\u2019t really deserted her. Could he control Azir? How long would it take him to get her a T-shirt and jeans? Panties would be nice. She didn\u2019t like running around without her drawers.</p><p>Fractured thoughts continued to race through her mind as her senses spun violently.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, precious?\u201d He held her against him, his head bending to whisper gently at her ear, his voice rough with rage and regret as she tried to lift her head, which felt as if it were teetering on her shoulders.</p><p>Hysterical amusement threatened to escape in a gale of laughter as she tried to hold her head straight. \u201cMake the room stop moving, Abram.\u201d She blinked back at him. \u201cThis sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby.\u201d His voice was a gentle murmur. \u201cI promise you, everything\u2019s going to be okay. I want you to go with Tariq for now, though. He\u2019ll take care of you until I\u2019m finished here. Will you do that, Paige? Go with Tariq, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I want to go home.\u201d Her fingers curled demandingly into the long, cotton tuniclike shirt he wore as she forced her eyes to focus, forced herself to find whatever little strength was left in her legs. \u201cCall Khalid or Papa. They\u2019ll come for me.\u201d She wasn\u2019t about to stay here a moment longer than she had to. \u201cThis is insane. Get me out of here.\u201d</p><p>Her vision was finally clearing, the dizzying blurriness slowly evaporating to focus on the tormented, tortured expression on his face.</p><p>Black eyes glowed in feral rage as his face seemed curved from stone into lines of brutal disillusionment.</p><p>\u201cGo with Tariq, first, Paige.\u201d He gripped her arms and eased her from him before moving her in Tariq\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t leave you alone with him.\u201d She stared up at him, seeing the pain in his eyes, the grief in his face, and she knew he had to be inconsolable with rage. She couldn\u2019t leave him alone with this madman. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s contagious?\u201d</p><p>His gaze turned back to hers, a subtle glimmer of bemusement glowing in the wicked, night dark depths. \u201cWhat is contagious, hellcat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis insanity,\u201d she whispered back at him, at once hearing the ludicrous suggestion, yet the need to make light of the situation couldn\u2019t be fought. That was her. Take it seriously and she could end up sharing Abram\u2019s fate herself. Azir Mustafa could drive a saint crazy, she guessed. And poor Abram, he lived with the old bat.</p><p>He had to hate this. This place, this room, it wasn\u2019t Abram. The way he was dressed, the expression on his face, it wasn\u2019t the man she knew. He would never countenance abusing a woman, or kidnapping one.</p><p>He was as arrogant as the wind itself, as the very desert that raised him, but he wasn\u2019t the vicious monster his father obviously was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain it\u2019s not contagious,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut go with Tariq for now. I\u2019ll take care of everything and I\u2019ll join you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou beg a whore to do as you ask?\u201d Azir cracked behind her. \u201cHow you have fallen, my son.\u201d</p><p>Paige refused to glance back at him, rather she continued to stare up at Abram, willing him to leave with her, to refuse to risk himself in his father\u2019s demented company.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d his voice was nearly silent, but there was no mistaking the dark command that filled it. \u201cGo with Tariq.\u201d</p><p>Tariq Mustafa. She knew him. There were times he had come to America with Abram and visited with Khalid and her family. He had smiled. He had \u201calmost\u201d flirted a time or two, but Abram and Khalid\u2019s displeasure had been clearly apparent.</p><p>This time though, his expression was hard, cold, as though he had no idea who she was. There wasn\u2019t so much as a glimmer of recognition as he took her from Abram.</p><p>Her lips thinned, her displeasure unable to hide. He had no business lingering here when they needed to make plans. When they needed to get her out of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Tariq wasn\u2019t flirting with her this time as she forced the strength in her legs to walk to the door. He acted as though he didn\u2019t know her, as though he had never met her. And she would find out why the minute Abram joined them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abram watched as Tariq drew Paige from the room, eased her around the doors and led her up the hall to his suite. Dark, emerald green eyes stared back at him, defiance and anger reflecting in her gaze before she disappeared.</p><p>He turned back to Azir, though God knew he didn\u2019t want to. He could feel the killing rage rising inside him, threatening the control it had taken so many years to develop.</p><p>For a moment he wondered if she could be right, if the Mustafa legacy of blood, death, and insanity, wasn\u2019t actually a contagion that infected each generation after the other.</p> <p>Staring at his father, he felt nothing but the overwhelming hatred that he was in danger of allowing to spill from the depths of his soul.</p><p>He stared at his father, and he saw nothing but the ragged, agonizing pain his first wife had felt as she died, the fear of his second wife as she died with their unborn child, and his own fear when he had learned that Paige\u2019s life was in danger.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the very image of her mother, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Azir stated calmly, as though he hadn\u2019t just been throwing that vision across the room with enough strength to kill her if her head were to strike the floor when she fell.</p><p>The calm, almost rational tone of his voice only incited the icy rage burning inside Abram.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she here?\u201d He could only barely force a semblance of calm in his voice.</p> <p>Azir smiled. A mocking, triumphant curve of his lips as he stared back at Abram.</p><p>\u201cShe is my insurance, my son, and the gift I would grant you for your birthday. Tell me, do you think her mother is worried? Perhaps certain who has taken her daughter and imagining the many ways I could make her suffer for her mother\u2019s crimes?\u201d</p><p>The pleasure Azir clearly felt at the thought of the pain only a mother could feel filling Marilyn Galbraithe, sickened Abram.</p><p>\u201cI will be returning her home\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cThen she will die.\u201d Azir\u2019s voice hardened, becoming gravely and tinged with anger. \u201cThe moment you leave the walls of the fortress with her then the guards will haul her back and I\u2019ll have her stoned for her mother\u2019s crimes. She is no virgin. She was checked for such innocence as she lay unconscious. Convincing the Matawa to order the stoning will be no hardship.\u201d</p><p>Abram stared back at his father in shock and disbelief. Surely even Azir wasn\u2019t that insane. To take such an action would only cause the royal family to be forced to take action against them.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d he ground out, his fists clenching, adrenaline surging through him and demanding blood. Azir\u2019s blood. And he would be well within his rights to spill it. He should simply do it. How much better the world would be without Azir Mustafa\u2019s presence. \u201cShe\u2019s done nothing to deserve this.\u201d</p><p>color=\" height=\"0em\" width=\"1em\" align=\"justify\"&gt;\u201cBut her mother has,\u201d Azir snapped back, his grating tone rasping against Abram\u2019s nerve endings. \u201cShe committed adultery against me in her false marriage to another man. She stole my son and turned his heart against me even as she and her American courts ripped from me my right to have him returned to me.\u201d Azir\u2019s expression twisted with fanatical fury. \u201cMy precious Marilyn. She turned Khalid against me, and because of him, you have turned against me. I blame her for the atrocities Khalid has committed against God in his sexual depravity and I blame her for the deaths of your brothers. And her daughter will now pay the price.\u201d He was screaming. Staring back at Abram, the rage infecting not just his sanity, but also his control over himself.</p><p>\u201cThey were no brothers of mine!\u201d As far as Abram was concerned, this was the last straw for Azir. He would never again claim blood relation to Azir or to the bastards who nearly killed him and Khalid. The same two men had created the situation Abram now found himself in. \u201cHad they still lived when I claim the province from the King\u2019s emissary, then I would have ordered their death\u2019s myself.\u201d</p><p>Azir glared back at him, his expression working furiously, his face brick red with fury. The old bastard had never been rational where Ayid and Aman were concerned, no more than he had been rational where Marilyn was concerned. Rational or sane.</p><p>\u201cYou and Khalid were responsible for the deaths of their wives and still you would hate them for their retaliation?\u201d Azir questioned him incredulously, as though he himself had had nothing to do with their vocation or their wrath. \u201cThey lost what they held dearest. Chaste, faithful wives and you bemoan a whore who willingly shared her body between you and Khalid as though she were no more than a bitch dog in heat? I should have turned the two of you over to the Matawa the moment I discovered your perversion instead of believing that you would learn your lesson with your wife\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Abram felt the clawing, black ice he continually fought beginning to build, to overtake him. That dark, inner core freezing over, obliterating honor, morality. He stared at Azir and all he could see was the bastard\u2019s blood on the floor, sinking in, staining the stone and forever marking his sins.</p><p>How easy it would be to kill him, Abram thought without so much as a hint of guilt. But killing him now would only cause more problems than it would fix.</p><p>He was aware of Azir watching nervously now. Abram could only stare, his entire being centered on not killing the evil old bastard.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t trust himself to speak, to move. Not just yet. Not until he could wipe away the image of his hands wrapped around Azir\u2019s throat, his bloated, fanatical expression slowly turning blue.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Abram.\u201d Azir suddenly spoke nervously as though realizing how close to death he was coming. \u201cThat was never an option. Never would I see you turned over to the authoritie\u201d</p><p>Too little. And he would have preferred that if only he could have kept Lessa safe all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cIn three weeks the king\u2019s emissary will arrive to take your vow to oversee the lands and return to our family the payments they froze so many years ago. Before that day, I give you leave to bed the daughter of my faithless wife. Her bastard child is my gift to you until that day. I have spoken with Tariq and given him leave, nay, I have ordered him to assist you however you wish in the enjoyment of her corrupt body. Once you have given the emissary your vow, you may escort her back to her mother, or if you so choose, you may have her as the first addition to your own harem.\u201d</p><p>To his harem?</p><p>Abram could feel his stomach recoiling sickeningly. In what demented fantasy did his father ever believe he would actually give that vow and remain here to allow Ayid and Aman\u2019s legacy to continue to grow?</p><p>\u201cDo not betray me again, Abram.\u201d Azir\u2019s voice was hoarse as he spoke. \u201cBetray your king if you must and leave to join your brother and your whore when it is done. The account is held until your vow is given. It will be mine, or what happened to your precious Lessa will seem a blessing compared to the hell that bastard sister of Khalid\u2019s will know. I beg of you, do not test me in this.\u201d</p><p>If he had to stand here another moment and listen, then he might lose the last hold on his murderous temper.</p><p>Turning, Abram stalked from the room Khalid\u2019s mother had once shared with his own mother for a short time. His own suite was above it with a private entrance to the secured quarters that had once held Azir\u2019s harem.</p><p>Abram moved up the stairs with a deliberately calm pace. His fists clenched and unclenched at his sides while the tightening of his teeth actually had his jaw aching with a hard burn from the stress of the pressure.</p><p>He needed to regain control. He needed to still the rush of adrenaline and come down from the high of the black icy fury that had filled him while he was with Azir.</p><p>He had to do it before he made it to his suite, before he saw Paige.</p><p>Because there was another side of the black ice.</p><p>There were consequences to the thaw of that icy rage.</p><p>And if he didn\u2019t get a handle on it, then it would be Paige that felt the full force of it.</p><p>6</p><p>The other side</p><p>of black ice.</p><p>Abram had been forced to learn to hold back that killing,murderous rage the day he found his mother beaten to death, and knew it had been Azir\u2019s fists that had killed her.</p><p>He remembered feeling it. Freezing, like shoving his entire body into an icy black nothingness and forcing himself to stay there rather than trying to find the man he called father to shove the knife his mother had given him straight into his black heart.</p><p>How many times over the years had he wished he had done exactly that?</p><p>Retribution would have been taken. He would have been punished severely, maybe even killed himself. But had he taken that punishment then so many other lives may have been saved.</p><p>The Mustafa lands would have been saved for Abram as Azir\u2019s legal heir, and Ayid and Aman would have been sent away to be raised by aunts and uncles who would not have pampered their criminal habits nor risked their own families to aid their terrorist proclivities.</p><p>That icy nothingness had enveloped him, allowing him to see past the fiery, brutal pain and into the logic of his actions.</p><p>Punishment for Azir would be so thorough, so perfect, if only he could follow through with it. Abram would be free of the land and the land itself would return to the monarchy and be given back to tribal control.</p><p>But allowing Azir to live was becoming harder by the day. And today. He stopped as he reached the top of the stairs and stared down at the fist his fingers were still formed into.</p><p>Today, he\u2019d almost given in to the impulse.</p><p>Today, he had almost become a murderer and God knew that wasn\u2019t what he wanted. Not now, not this close to freedom. Because if he killed Azir, the monarchy would have no choice but to punish him. Jafar and his men, supposed members of the Mustafa family, would eagerly step forward and demand his punishment.</p><p>Because Abram had plotted and worked against Jafar and Azir, and even though Khalid had taken responsibility for both Ayid\u2019s and Aman\u2019s deaths, there were those that suspected Abram had killed Aman.</p><p>And they would have been right. Fortunately, there were very few who knew the actual truth, but if his half-brother\u2019s co-conspirators had a chance to strike out in such a way, they would eagerly take it.</p><p>There was no doubt that he had run out of time. He would have to find a way to get both Paige and Tariq out of Saudi Arabia and into America and take his chances there.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what the hell Azir thought he could accomplish by kidnapping Paige and gifting him with her, or by \u201cordering\u201d Tariq to aid him in whatever manner Abram required in bedding her. One thing was for damned sure, it wasn\u2019t out of the kindness of his heart.</p><p>More like, the minute he made his vow to the emissary both Jafar and Azir would have the authorities waiting to arrest him, Paige, and Tariq for sexual misconduct. And that was a killing offense.</p><p>Tearing the keffiyeh from his head and bunching it in his hand, he inhaled deeply and moved slowly to the securely locked door of his bedroom suite.</p><p>The electronic security was the only defense he possessed in the fortress now. There were less than half a dozen of the men that had once been loyal to him and Tariq. Those men couldn\u2019t be identified or step forward publicly if anything happened because of their own families.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t trust the guards, and he couldn\u2019t trust the men he had grown up with, or those he had attended college with who had returned to the Mustafa lands after him.</p><p>Throughout his life there had only been Khalid, Tariq, and Paige that he could depend upon to accept him as he was. And two of those, Tariq and Paige, were awaiting him now.</p><p>He was moving closer to the door, closer to the woman he hungered for with an irrational strength.</p><p>Reaching the door to the suite he keyed in the code to the security lock, waited for the click to indicate the locks had disengaged, then stepped inside.</p><p>The other side of black ice.</p><p>The second he closed the door it kicked in.</p><p>The black ice was cracking and burning inside him, heat whipping through his body as fiery, burning lust sizzled through the dark emotionless protective layer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a single, blinding second the adrenaline switched gears. Murder wasn\u2019t an option, but sex was.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t squeeze the life from Azir\u2019s corrupt body, but he could allow Paige\u2019s tight, hot little pussy to squeeze the release from his dick.</p><p>Paige was there.</p><p>Lush.</p><p>Exotic.</p><p>Sensual.</p><p>With the sheet still her only covering, she was curled at the corner of the couch as Tariq sat in the chair opposite her. He leaned forward, his entire demeanor protective.</p><p>Long, silken, red-gold curls cascaded around the bruised side of her face. The abraded, darkening flesh almost had him turning around and completing the murderous act, imagining Azir gasping for air as his eyes began to glaze in death.</p><p>Emerald green eyes stared back at him in defiance, and always, always, in hunger. In that inp height=\"t, just that fast, his cock was brutally hard, the need to fuck thundering through his body with a force nearly double what the drive to kill had been.</p><p>This was the fallout. The other side of the brutal ice-encased fury was this overwhelming, desperate need to push every sexual boundary. To make his lover touch that point between pleasure and pain. To fuck her until none of them could move. And once his third had caught his breath, to begin again.</p><p>And there was Paige. The object of every sexual fantasy he\u2019d had since she had turned eighteen. The one woman he knew he should never touch.</p><p>He was going to touch her.</p><p>He was going to touch her in ways that would shock her, that would send her juices spilling hot and sweet from the swollen folds of her cunt.</p><p>\u201cAbram?\u201d Tariq rose warily to his feet. \u201cIs the situation being resolved?\u201d</p><p>Will Paige be sent home? Abram could see the question in the other man\u2019s gaze. The worry and the concern. Oh yes, they both knew what Azir was doing, and they were going to have to figure out a way to put a stop to it.</p><p>\u201cI may need a third,\u201d Abram answered, his gaze on Paige as her eyes widened in shock.</p><p>She knew what he meant, and she knew exactly what he was going to need.</p><p>She didn\u2019t protest though, and she didn\u2019t argue, she just stared back at him, wide-eyed and silent.</p><p>And hungry.</p><p>Oh hell yes, he glimpsed the sensual, sexual need that darkened her eyes and flushed her face and breasts.</p><p>They had been dancing around this since the day she turned eighteen. He had stayed as far away from her as possible rather than introducing her to a hunger, a passion that he feared she wasn\u2019t ready for. And now, there was simply no way to save her from it.</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d he ordered Tariq, his tone guttural.</p> <p>It was an order Tariq was expecting. Abram was going to need a third, but this first time, this first touch, was all his. He shared his lovers, but still, he was a possessive bastard. He secured their affection as well as their arousal before he ever brought his third into the bed.</p><p>He waited, listening as Tariq strode across the room, opened the door, and stepped out.</p><p>He would be going no farther than his own room across the stone hall in case he was needed.</p><p>Paige\u2019s fingers tightened on the sheet as though she feared he would jerk it from her.</p><p>\u201cAbram?\u201d She questioned when he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>She rose slowly to her feet, facing him, not just with a hint of wariness but also a blaze of need that rivaled his own.</p><p>God help him, he hadn\u2019t wanted it to come to this. Not here, and definitely not now.</p><p>\u201cYou and Khalid shared Lessa, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked when he said nothing for several moments.</p><p>\u201cWe shared Lessa,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd that is a subject we don\u2019t need to discuss tonight, Paige. Tonight, there is only us.\u201d</p><p>And he believed that explanation was all she had to hear? She let her lips curl into a mocking, defiant smile. \u201cYou asked Tariq to be your third, Abram. I\u2019m not a child, and I\u2019m not completely ignorant of your sexual lifestyle. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to just push something like this on me and we won\u2019t be discussing it.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced tightly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the best time to discuss anything, Paige,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd I notice you\u2019re not refusing.\u201d His brow arched. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m not very well aware of the fact that if you weren\u2019t dying for it then you\u2019d put me in my place so fast it would make both our heads spin?\u201d</p><p>At least he knew a few of her incredibly talented abilities.</p><p>She stared back at him warily though. Abram could never be accused of being predictable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to allow anyone to touch you but me,\u201d he stated. \u201cBefore we go further than you and me, we\u2019ll discuss it, I promise. But now isn\u2019t the time to do it. Now is the time to take that damned sheet off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d He was entirely too arrogant for his own good, and if she was going to handle even the most distant relationship with him then she would have to establish her own boundaries quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>She had heard him though. Shock filled her voice. It widened her eyes again, but her response flushed her face and her nipples were just barely detectable beneath the sheet over her chest.</p><p>\u201cDrop the sheet, Paige,\u201d he growled, stepping closer to her, unable to keep any distance between them.</p><p>He expected a fight. He thought she would curse. He was certain she would rage.</p><p>What he didn\u2019t expect?</p><p>or=\"#000000\"&gt;\u201cKiss my ass,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try putting me on a plane home first? Then we\u2019ll discuss the subject.\u201d A graceful shoulder shrugged as she stared back at him challengingly.</p><p>He had known she wouldn\u2019t come easy. But that was just fine. Because he sure as hell never cared much for easy.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll just have to remove it myself.\u201d</p><p>Paige saw the battle raging within the rich black depths of his gaze. The taut expression of his face was primal, sensual. His lips had a more sexual, erotic curve. He suddenly looked like a sex god ready to seduce and ravish.</p><p>A sensual, dark aura seemed to suddenly surround them, washing through her senses and sensitizing her, preparing her for his touch.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt anything like this at any time. She\u2019d been dating for years. She\u2019d dated some of the most arrogant, most dominant men in the world, but Abram had always had them all beat.</p><p>Her hands tightened on the material of the silk sheet between her breasts. His gaze dropped to her fingers as he gripped the clasped ends at the front of his tunic-like robe and pulled at it, parting it to shrug it easily from his powerful shoulders.</p><p>Dark, toughened skin stretched over powerful muscles.</p><p>He kicked his boots off as he reached for her, then stood, simply staring down at her for long, heated moments.</p><p>She expected seduction. Perhaps a bit of teasing. She should have known better.</p><p>She didn\u2019t expect what was coming. Before she realized his intentions he\u2019d jerked her to him, lifting her, his lips coming down on hers with surprising gentleness. The certain, determined lick of his tongue against the seam of her lips surprised her into parting them. A quick indrawn breath, a wealth of pleasure, and he was inside.</p><p>His lips slanted over hers, his head tilting as a moan escaped her throat and Paige knew she was on the losing end of determination this time.</p><p>But this was Abram. She couldn\u2019t say no to him, she had no idea how to do it.</p><p>As his lips and tongue caressed and cajoled, she felt him holding her against him, her feet off the floor as he moved to the huge, silk-covered bed on the other end of the room.</p><p>She had to force her eyes open as he laid her back on the bed, his hands catching her wrists as he forced them above her head. Holding her wrists to the mattress, his knee pushed between her thighs, parting them, the soft cotton of his loose trousers caressing the bare skin of her inner legs as he stared down at her with hungry demand. His knee pressed upward against her pussy, rubbing and grinding against her clit.ht=\"0emiv height=\"0em\"&gt;</p><p>The strong, heavy muscles were heated as she gripped the sides of his leg and arched to him. Each stroke against the swollen bud made her weaker, made her want to sink into the pleasure and never come up for reality.</p><p>She felt her heart racing. Blood thundered through her veins, throbbing in her clit as she struggled against the hold he had on her.</p><p>His head lowered once again, his lips careful in case her lips were sore. Thankfully, Azir had backhanded the side of her face, not her lips.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance to protest or enough breath to say no, and he made certain she was unable to outright reject him.</p><p>Did she want to protest?</p><p>Did she want to reject him?</p><p>How was she supposed to know? He wouldn\u2019t give her a chance to speak or a chance to think. But he let her feel.</p><p>Paige moaned, the sound seeming torn from the depths of her soul as his lips rubbed against hers, possessed hers. Licks and nips and his tongue pumping into her mouth, stroking against her tongue and sparring with it as she strained to get closer and to take control of the sumptuous pleasure.</p><p>The pleasure. She\u2019d always wanted the pleasure of his touch, the exquisite ecstasy of his kiss. She swore pure white-hot flames were licking at her sensitive flesh and the delicate tips of her tight, hard nipples.</p><p>Her clit was swollen, throbbing. She wanted to rub against the power of his heavy thigh, to ease the agony of need pounding at the bundle of nerves.</p><p>His kiss was like a drug. It was addicting. She wanted more and he wasn\u2019t giving it to her.</p><p>Paige struggled against the hold on her wrists. Arching closer to the hard hips settling between hers, she cried out into his kiss as the thick, heavy length of his cock pressed into the folds of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cOh God, yes. Abram, yes, please.\u201d Tearing her mouth from his she gasped for breath, her head arching back as she rubbed her clit against the heavy head pressing into it.</p><p>He was so hard and hot.</p><p>Her pussy creamed heavily, her juices easing along the clenched muscles of her vagina and spilling to the thin, cotton-covered wedge of his cock as his hips rolled against her.</p><p>Curling her fingers in pleasure as he continued to restrain her wrists, Paige lifted one leg, her knee bending to move closer and clasp his hip as he rubbed against her again.</p><p>Her thighs clenched and tightened. The hunger for the rising orgasm was building inside her like a flaming conflagration she couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t want to control it. She wanted it to keep racing out of control, to keep burning through her and leaving every inch of her body so sensitive that each touch was rapture.</p><p>Forcing her eyes open she stared up at him as his free hand caressed up her side to cup the curve of her swollen breast. The touch of his calloused palm had her nipple tingling almost painfully until the pad of his thumb stroked across it.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she moaned as sensation raced straight to her womb where it clenched and sent a surge of electric ecstasy racing through her pussy.</p><p>Each stroke of the roughened flesh against the tight bud of her nipple was an agony of pleasure. Brilliant streaks of fiery sensation tingled and built until she was arching tighter to him, the thought of his lips and tongue surrounding the peak making her crazy for the feel of it.</p><p>\u201cAbram.\u201d She could hear the weak plea in her voice now, but she had no idea how to ask for what she needed. How to beg for it.</p><p>\u201cShould I stop, love?\u201d he crooned as his head lowered to her shoulder and his tongue licked over it.</p><p>Her hips jerked into his, the friction against her clit causing her to moan in building ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, don\u2019t stop,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cThe taste of you is like the finest wine.\u201d The sound of his voice, guttural and rough as his lips moved along her neck, her jaw, had her shivering in pleasure.</p><p>The sensations were so intense she wondered if she would actually manage to orgasm before he even thrust his cock inside her.</p><p>His head moved from her jaw, down her neck again, to the smooth, sensitive flesh above her breasts. She was dying for the touch of his lips against her nipples and he was killing her as he continued to hold that caress from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbram, please,\u201d she begged, her voice raspy.</p><p>\u201cPlease, precious,\u201d he crooned in a dark, black velvet tone. \u201cPlease let me touch you. Just for this moment.\u201d There was no plea in his tone despite the words.</p><p>There was nothing but pure, dominant demand.</p><p>One hand still held her wrists, his fingers locked around them to hold her in place. His lips lifted from her upper chest, his black eyes flaming with heated hunger as he stared down at her.</p><p>The expression on his face had her hips arching involuntarily, desperate for more now. cov height=\"0em\"&gt;</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get enough of him. Each touch had her flesh tingling, aching for more.</p><p>The long, powerful fingers cupping her breast lifted it, his gaze holding hers as his head lowered, lips parting, his tongue peeking out to curl around her nipple as his lips met the flushed, swollen flesh.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed roughly as she watched, mesmerized by his lips closing on the tip and the feel of his mouth suddenly drawing on it, his tongue rubbing and stroking the nerve-laden tip. \u201cThat\u2019s so good.\u201d She arched again, her back bowing as she pressed her pussy into the heavy heat of his cock. \u201cIt\u2019s so good in your mouth, Abram. So hot.\u201d</p><p>She was afraid she was going to come from this alone and she didn\u2019t even care. She just wanted to come. She wanted the explosion tearing through her senses and throwing her into a pleasure she knew was going to leave her aching for more.</p><p>Sensation was racing to her clit, to her pussy. Her womb clenched hard and tight, rippling with nearing ecstasy as she moaned and fought desperately to get closer to him.</p><p>The heated, heavy juices of her arousal were saturating her pussy now, as well as the cotton that covered his leg where it pressed into her.</p><p>A cry tore from her as his teeth pressed against the hard nipple, sensitizing it further. He raked them against it, then drew it back, sucked it inside, and licked over it.</p><p>The different sensations were killing her with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d she gasped. \u201cOh God, Abram, it\u2019s so good. So good.\u201d</p><p>His head lifted to allow his lips to smooth over her nipple. \u201cI\u2019m pleasuring you, baby,\u201d he growled. \u201cAnd how I\u2019ve dreamed of pleasuring you.\u201d</p><p>Paige pushed her head deeper into the pillow behind her as she lifted, trying to get closer.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think,\u201d she cried out. \u201cLet me think.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to scream, but she couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t draw in enough oxygen to push the sound free.</p><p>As she fought for breath, fought to find a way to think, to consider what she was doing, she felt his hand move from the curve of her breast, his fingers stroking, rubbing, easing slowly down her torso, over her lower stomach, then brushing against the light growth of curls at the top of her sex.</p><p>Her fingers curled against his hand as his fingers slid through the slick, saturated slit of her pussy. He parted the swollen folds, the roughened fingertips rubbing and stroking until his fingers found her straining c0\"&gt;Her finrawing another cry from her lips.</p><p>She loved it. Each touch. It was incredible.</p><p>It was like little flares of lightning piercing her clit each time he stroked around it, sending flames to caress her pussy.</p> <p>Her hips jerked, pushing closer, feeling his fingers rake against the opening of her saturated cunt. She could feel her juices, thick and heated as they coated the folds and then his fingers.</p><p>The need for more, the need to have his fingers filling her was making her crazy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Paige?\u201d he groaned, his voice rough. \u201cTell me, baby, and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want,\u201d she protested weakly.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think. She couldn\u2019t make sense of the impulses surging through her system.</p><p>\u201cLet me hear it,\u201d he demanded roughly. \u201cTell me what you want. How should I touch you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, imperatively. So many fantasies. She wanted so much, needed so much. How was she supposed to settle for just one touch?</p><p>\u201cHow sweet and soft your pussy feels, Paige.\u201d His lips moved against her nipples again. \u201cI love the feel of it against my fingers, but I want to feel it on my tongue. The way your juices feel, the tug of your pussy as I fuck my tongue inside you. The feel of you coming on my tongue\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d She was so close.</p><p>She nearly raced over the edge of completion; she was that close, that sensitized.</p><p>She wanted to feel his tongue as she felt his fingers now. Licking over her, stroking her past reason.</p><p>\u201cLet me touch you.\u201d She breathed out roughly. \u201cLet me go, Abram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d His teeth raked against her nipple. \u201cJust take the pleasure, Paige. Just for a minute, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>It was too destructive. Being effectively bound, restrained, and touched with devastating results.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch too,\u201d she demanded roughly.</p><p>His fingers waited at the entrance of her sex, two broad, strong digits tucking against the clenched opening as she stilled. She stared up at him and fought to breathe as he began pushing inside the snug depths of her pussy.</p><p>Her hips surged upward. The feel of his fingers stretching her, pushing inside her, would have had her screaming in violent pleasure if she could have just breathed.</p><p>As his fingers tormented her pussy, thrusting in, stoking an erotic, blazing heat through it, Abram moved his lips to her other breast, found the tight peak of her nipple, and sucked it in.</p><p>The alternating sensations, the flashes of electric pleasure surged from her nipple to her clit with each draw of his mouth, from her pussy to the rest of her body with each stroke of the two fingers inside her.</p><p>\u201cLick it,\u201d she moaned, needing that particular stroke against her nipple. \u201cLick it, Abram, just a second.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to come. She needed to come now.</p><p>Her hips arched and rotated, working her pussy on his thrusting fingers as rapid, desperate cries fell from her lips.</p><p>His tongue licked over her nipple, rubbed it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she moaned, her head thrown back as her hips thrust into his fucking fingers.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it, precious? Do you like my fingers fucking inside you? Filling your tight little pussy?\u201d His head lifted, his lips brushing the peak as his fingers stretched and burned her flesh.</p><p>With powerful, controlled thrusts his fingers reached inside her, stroking against nerve endings never touched, never pleasured before and sending her senses rioting. They scissored, stretched her, worked inside her. Blinding, elemental sensation tore through so many nerve endings it nearly sent her into sensory overload.</p><p>\u201cMore...\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cMore what, Paige?\u201d He whispered against her lips as she dragged her lashes open to stare into the burning depths of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour fingers,\u201d she gasped. \u201cFuck me harder, Abram.\u201d She arched, blinding pleasure searing her as she fought to find release. \u201cPlease. Please let me come.\u201d</p><p>She was so close. The need to come was screaming through her now. Her hips jerked, grinding into each thrust, her thighs tightening on the powerful legs holding hers apart as his fingers tortured her.</p><p>So close.</p><p>She gasped, her breath catching. Whimpers fell from her lips, then a startled, agonizing cry as he pulled back.</p><p>Suddenly her wrists were free and before she could do more than cry out his name his shoulders were between her thighs, his mouth on her pussy.</p><p>His tongue licked through the sensitive folds, the tip flicking and probing at her clit as she gasped, arched, and felt the flames rising inside her tortured pussy.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t come she was going to die from the need.</p><p>As his lips moved over her clit and surrounded it, his fingers slid against her entrance again, probing, rubbing, the two tormenting digits working inside the slick, juice-laden tissue.</p><p>A haze of blinding lust filled Abram\u2019s head as his fingers worked inside the velvety tissue as it clamped tightly on his fingers.</p><p>Ripples washed over his fingers as the muscles tightened and spasmed on his flesh.</p><p>\u201cAbram.\u201d She moaned his name, the need in her voice pushing the blinding haze of lust higher and ripping at the control he was fighting to hold onto. \u201cIt\u2019s so good. Your fingers...\u201d Her hips lifted and flexed into each thrust he worked inside the gripping flesh.</p><p>Damn, she was hot. Her pussy clamped and sucked at his fingers, as he imagined his cock buried inside the snug, fist-tight flesh.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she whispered, desperation filling her voice. \u201cPlease, Abram, fuck me. Make me come.\u201d</p><p>For a second, just a few fragile seconds, he lost his grip on his control.</p><p>He sucked her clit tighter into his mouth, his tongue working it, licking against it as his fingers began to thrust deeper, harder, feeling her tighten, then a second later, feeling her explode.</p><p>It was the most incredible sensation for him.</p><p>Never while pleasuring a woman had he spilled himself to the sheets simply from his lover\u2019s pleasure, but as Paige\u2019s pussy tightened on his fingers with a strength that had him groaning at the thought of it wrapped around his dick, he couldn\u2019t hold back.</p><p>As she came, her flesh rippling and clenching, he let his fingertips stroke a tiny spot deep and high inside her pussy, extending her climax and the shudders of release.</p><p>With each hard jerk of her body he let her ease down. Slowly, because he wanted to relish it. Drawing it out, because the thought of letting her go was suddenly abhorrent.</p><p>Paige\u2019s eyes were open, unseeing, dazed. All she was aware of, all she could process was the hard, brilliant flashes of light and pleasure rippling through her. It burned, exploded in flashing points of ecstasy that had her tightening to the breaking point.</p><p>She could feel every nerve ending in her body sizzling, burning in rapture.</p><p>She gasped, fighting to pull oxygen into her lungs as throaty, ecstatic moans escaped her throat.</p><p>She had never known herself to make such sounds. She had never known such pleasure or that pleasure could be so destructive and yet so filled with satisfaction.</p><p>As the last pulsing wave of release eased through her body, she blinked, feeling his fingers ease from her as he moved up her body, his chest rising hard and fast with his accelerated breathing, perspiration gleaming on his flesh.</p><p>His gaze looked almost satiated, his face flushed. There was a dominant, possessive expression that had her stilling while watching him warily.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re here, until I can get you home, until I can ensure your safety you will stay within this suite. You will sleep in my bed and you will belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Well hell, and here she thought she already did.</p><p>But she kept her lips wisely closed and simply stared back at him defiantly, even if she really didn\u2019t feel that much defiance.</p><p>And her reward?</p><p>His gaze flamed with lust again.</p><p>His expression tightened with it.</p><p>And if she wasn\u2019t mistaken his cock was harder, thicker beneath the damp cotton of the loose trousers he still wore.</p><p>7</p><p>\u201cAre you on birth control?\u201d</p><p>Abram asked as Paige pulled on the long, winter-warm gray thobe he had handed her moments before.</p><p>The loose dresslike garment flowed around her rather shapelessly but it covered her, and it was warm.</p><p>\u201cPaige.\u201d He repeated her name, obviously expecting an answer.</p><p>Lifting her head she stared back at him, still amazed that she had, less than an hour ago, climaxed in his arms as though she were exploding from the inside out, and he still hadn\u2019t fully had sex with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m protected,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m the one that can get pregnant, so I\u2019m the one that makes certain it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to have whatever you take collected quickly,\u201d he told her. \u201cGive me the name and dosage so I can have Tariq acquire it.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him implacably. \u201cYou make it sound as though I\u2019m going to be stuck here indefinite, Abram.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He moved slowly from the other side of the room, his expression brooding as he watched her, intense. \u201cIt may be a while,\u201d he finally told her. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to take chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not staying here a while.\u201d A frown jumped between her brows. \u201cCall someone. Khalid or my father, either one could have a transport here to fly me out within hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Azir will have you killed the moment he learns that a transport is heading in this direction.\u201d</p> <p>Paige stared back at him miserably. She couldn\u2019t risk staying here. God, why had she left Khalid\u2019s home?</p><p>\u201cTell me what I need to know, Paige, then we\u2019ll fight over the rest of it later.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. She knew that expression on his face. The hard, steely-eyed expression that assured her he meant exactly what he said.</p><p>If she wanted to discuss going home, then she would tell him exactly what he wanted to know.</p><p>Once she got home, if he decided to resume whatever started here, then he would have to rethink these stubborn tactics of his.</p> <p>\u201cI only take the medication once every three months,\u201d she finally told him, though she hated the necessity of it. \u201cMy last dose was just before your less-than-sane father had me kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms over her breasts, she all but stomped to the couch positioned in front of the fireplace and plopped into the amazingly comfortable cushions. That comfort didn\u2019t make up for the fact that the Abram she was facing right now was little more than a stranger to her.</p><p>\u201cNow, when am I going home?\u201d she questioned him.</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s convenient to send you home.\u201d He shrugged as though it didn\u2019t matter, as though she were there for a friendly visit rather than being brought there forcibly.</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s convenient?\u201d she asked him carefully. \u201cAnd when do you think it might be convenient to take care of that little matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I\u2019ve satisfied my hunger for you?\u201d He tilted his head to the side as he answered her with a question rather than allowing her to know exactly what was going on.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t like the Abram she knew. Of course, there was always the chance she hadn\u2019t known him as well as she thought she had.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a satisfactory answer, Abram.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were cool and hard. She hated that look, that impassive, emotionless look so similar to Khalid\u2019s. A look that had been honed in the hellish existence where they had fought to survive, here in this foreign desert.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only answer I have for you at the moment. But I will have some answers from you. How did Azir\u2019s men manage to kidnap you?\u201d</p><p>Paige crossed her arms over her breasts as she leaned back in the couch and glanced away from him.</p><p>\u201cI went home,\u201d she finally answered, knowing it was the wrong time to become stubborn.</p><p>His expression tightened further, this time in anger.</p><p>\u201cAre Khalid and Marty safe?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded jerkily. \u201cThey were at the Conovers\u2019. Tally\u2019s party.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes in frustration before wiping his hand over his face and giving his head a brief, hard shake. When he looked at her again, he didn\u2019t bother to hide the anger heating inside him.</p><p>\u201cYou were told to stay safe.\u201d He growled as the irritation rose. \u201cWhat happened, Paige? Don\u2019t try to tell me Khalid attempted to throw you out either.\u201d</p><p>Paige wanted to laugh at the comment, but the expression on his face didn\u2019t exactly invite amusement.</p><p>Instead, she dropped her arms, her hands clenching into the the couch cushions as she leaned forward, her own anger surging inside her.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize I\u2019ve lost my job because of this mess?\u201d she snapped back at him. One hand lifted to wave at his room to emphasize the situation. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked in over two weeks now, I have bills to pay and responsibilities to meet. Do you think I was meeting those responsibilities by playing the cowering puppy at my brother\u2019s home? Do you think my landlord is going to just nicely wait for me to pay my rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did your parents refuse access to your trust fund, Paige?\u201d His tone was chillingly uncompromising and unforgiving.</p><p>It was her own fault she had been taken and she knew it; she wasn\u2019t trying to claim otherwise. But he made her feel about two inches tall and responsible for the fall of the modern world with that look and tone.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was the smartest idea I\u2019d ever had,\u201d she burst out furiously. \u201cBut for God\u2019s sake, Abram, it had been two weeks. Khalid and I were at each other\u2019s throats and starting to go for blood. I just wanted to go home long enough to figure out how to handle him and his insistence unning my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that did you how much good?\u201d He grunted irritably as he shot her a look of complete male frustration. \u201cYou were being protected and you insisted on leaving that protection. Now you can settle in here for the next three weeks and twiddle your thumbs until I can send you home.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him in shock. \u201cAbram, I can\u2019t stay here for three weeks,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI have to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKhalid will take care of your bills and any problems that arise, and I\u2019m certain he\u2019ll have a nice little discussion with the owner of the company you worked for so you can return. You have no choice but to cooperate here, Paige. Attempting to make me feel guilty for your situation will do you no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could send me home,\u201d she retorted angrily.</p><p>\u201cIf I could send you home I\u2019d have you on a transport now,\u201d he snapped back as anger flashed across his face. \u201cUnfortunately, that isn\u2019t possible at the moment, trust me on this.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned as she glared back at him. \u201cThen let me call Papa. He\u2019ll come get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s a good idea.\u201d His smile was tight and hard. \u201cLet\u2019s call Pavlos Galbraithe and have him arrive to antagonize Azir further.\u201d His bark of laughter was filled with sarcasm. \u201cI can see that one working out well.\u201d</p><p>So, maybe that wasn\u2019t the wisest course of action, but staying here for three weeks wasn\u2019t acceptable either, not when old man Mustafa was bouncing around the place trying to find his little lost Marilyn.</p><p>The thought of it was sickening.</p><p>It sickened her and God only knew how her mother was feeling at the moment.</p><p>Raking her fingers through her hair she stared back at Abram in frustration, wondering where the heated, hungry lover of earlier had gone.</p><p>With that thought came another. Why, once she\u2019d come until she thought she was going to die, hadn\u2019t he taken her fully and achieved his own release?</p><p>\u201cDo I have your agreement to behave?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI agree to follow the rules I know about.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut I think you know this is going to suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucking or not, that\u2019s the way it is,\u201d he informed her, his voice as hard as the black onyx of his gaze. \u201cAnd sucking beats dying, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>She had to look away from him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine how he had survived within this world. He was a man who enjoyed tastes, textures, touch, and laughter. She couldn\u2019t imagine there was much of a chance of those things existing in the cold, stone confines of this fortress.</p><p>Crossing her arms she rubbed at them, trying to bring a little warmth back to her body as a chill raced through her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he do this?\u201d she finally asked, wondering why his father would take a vendetta to this extreme.</p><p>\u201cTo punish Khalid for killing Ayid and Aman, no matter how they deserved it.\u201d Regret and guilt flashed across his gaze. \u201cTo punish your mother for escaping and in an attempt to find something or someone that he believes is my weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd of course, I\u2019m no weakness of yours, am I, Abram?\u201d The tone of his voice, the remoteness of his gaze as he spoke sent a spike of aching need tearing into her chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford a weakness.\u201d He sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, you can be used as one, simply because your presence here will be more of a temptation than I can resist. We learned that earlier, didn\u2019t we?\u201d He nodded to the disheveled bed where she had lain gasping for air as she orgasmed violently in his arms.</p><p>A flush washed over her face and she shot him a hateful look. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though I tempted you too far,\u201d she shot back. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t...\u201d She ran out of words, flushing heavier. It was much harder to say as she faced the distance he was placing between them.</p><p>His brow arched. \u201cI still haven\u2019t fucked you?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her pussy just had to respond. It just had to clench and ripple and spill her juices, again, to saturate the bare, swollen folds.</p><p>She needed panties before the dampness began easing down her thighs. But at this rate, she would end up using all she had within hours.</p><p>She stared back at him though, holding his gaze despite the response that flooded through her and the anger beginning to build.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get around to it,\u201d he promised her. \u201cI first wanted to make sure you were on birth control, and secondly\u2014\u201d His lips twisted ruefully. \u201cI may not have come, Paige, but you had me so fucking hot I spilled myself in my pants. Something I promise you will not happen again.\u201d His gaze flickered over her, heated now, aroused. \u201cThe next time, I\u2019ll spill in that sweet tight pussy, or buried in the snug clench of your ass. Either way, I promise you\u2019ll not doubt the fact that I\u2019ve definitely taken you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She had to draw in a hard, tight breath to push those words past her lips, because it truly was hard to deny what her body so wanted.</p><p>A single, black brow arched with an arrogance that set her teeth on edge.</p><p>\u201cNot while we\u2019re here, and not while you\u2019re acting like my jailer rather than my lover,\u201d she explained tightly, nerves trembling in her voice as she fought to keep it firm, strong.</p><p>The smile he gave her was triumphant, dominant. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d He held his hand up as her lips parted to deliver a blasting retort. \u201cBefore we get into this argument, Tariq will be bringing in our dinner any minute and I know your appetite is affected when you\u2019re angry. Let\u2019s enjoy our meal, Paige, then you can tell me the ways you\u2019re going to resist my touch while you\u2019re lying in the bed with me nightly.\u201d He leaned forward then, his expression no longer distanced but suffused with sensual hunger. \u201cTell me, Paige, how will you resist when you\u2019re lying not just with me, but with Tariq as well? And the one thing I can promise you can have while you\u2019re here is all the pleasure we can give you in that bed. More pleasure than you could ever imagine.\u201d</p><p>Abram watched her face, her eyes. No matter the anger that could spike through Paige, it was her eyes that always told the truth of her emotions. The fear that had filled them as he forced himself to remain distant, to lay out the situation for her, had tightened his chest until he wondered that he could breathe for it.</p><p>But the minute he\u2019d allowed his hunger to show, the only emotion, the only response he could give her, that fear had slid away and a matching, feminine need had blazed in her emerald eyes.</p><p>Sensual and warm, she was a woman willing to explore her hunger, but even more, she would be willing to explore his.</p><p>And before Tariq arrived with the meal he had prepared, he wanted her primed and ready for the hungers that raged through him. Knowing the situation, knowing from where the pleasure may well come later, would keep her off balance and hopefully, keep her too involved to attempt to escape before he and Tariq had a plan in place.</p><p>Until then, he had to be certain that the line he was forced to teeter on didn\u2019t shift on him. He had to ensure it didn\u2019t throw him to the ground, broken and lost, again.</p><p>He\u2019d been there once. He\u2019d been at the precipice where nothing mattered but the blood of his enemies and the future was a vision he didn\u2019t want to face. He\u2019d already lost one woman whose life meant more to him than any of his brothers, his compatriots, and the men and women who had died, and would die, for the future they dreamed of. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t let it happen again, because he might not manage to pull himself back again.</p><p>Azir had known that once Paige was here that she would become his main priority. Sometimes, Abram thought, the old bastard knew him better than he knew himself.</p><p>Azir suspected Abram\u2019s plans for defection, but he didn\u2019t know the plan he and Tariq were laying in to escape with the information they had amassed since Jafar\u2019s arrival at the fortress.</p> <p>As though his cousin\u2019s presence was all it had taken, the roaches were coming out of the woodwork. Suspected militants and terrorist organizers were roaming the streets and discussing in public in small groups what should only be discussed behind closed doors and in secure bunkers.</p><p>But even more, Azir was braver, more confident and more secure now in acquiring the funds that had been frozen more than twenty years before.</p><p>As dinner was finished and Tariq cleared away the dishes and prepared coffee behind a screen at the small kitchenette Abram had had installed, he leaned back in his chair and watched as Paige wandered back to the fire.</p><p>She was nervous. Not frightened, and definitely not really wary, but she was nervous, her senses hyped and adrenaline coursing through her body.</p><p>She was trying to ignore both of them and to ignore the declaration he had made earlier.</p> <p>He almost grinned as he considered the night ahead. He had no intentions of taking her yet, not yet. There were a few matters that had to be taken care of first, and precautions established to ensure their safety before he and Tariq took her together.</p><p>The hunger for it was beginning to build in him though, and he could see it building in Tariq. They\u2019d shared enough women, seduced enough to know each other\u2019s responses as well as their woman\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAzir and Jafar have made plans to take a ride in the morning,\u201d Tariq told him as he carried the coffee back to the table. \u201cThey believe you and I will be too distracted to know that they\u2019ve left.\u201d Tariq nodded to Paige.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where they\u2019re going?\u201d Abram lifted the cup to his lips as he murmured the question.</p><p>Tariq gave a quick shake of his head. \u201cThe equipment in Jafar\u2019s room is just as good as ours, but I wasn\u2019t close enough to the door to hear everything being said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who to contact.\u201d Abram dropped his voice as he spoke. The room was equipped with audio detection scramblers but he didn\u2019t like taking chances. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to follow them, then he can figure it out.\u201d</p> <p>Abram frowned thoughtfully. Azir and Jafar had been bitter enemies until the months before Ayid and Aman had attempted to murder Khalid and Abram. Now, less than three months after the deaths of his youngest sons, Azir was conspiring with his nephew. The nephew whose father Azir had murdered more than twenty years ago.</p><p>\u201cHe definitely kidnapped her just to distract you,\u201d Tariq stated as he nodded to Paige. \u201cIf we\u2019re trying to protect her then we\u2019re not following him. And he knows you\u2019d never leave her here alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust her safety to just one of us either,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNot this close.\u201d</p><p>That was the catch. They were a team, and they had been working efficiently together for several years. But now, with Paige here, it would be impossible for Abram to be confident that either of them could protect her alone if Azir conspired against them.</p><p>If his cruelty extended to having Paige taken and circumcised as Ayid had had his manservant\u2019s wife circumcised several years before. Or if the authorities arrived to have her\u2014or all three of them\u2014arrested for depraved or indecent sexual acts.</p><p>Azir wasn\u2019t above either of those, or any other number of extreme acts to keep Abram from leaving Saudi Arabia.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know we have help. At least in following him,\u201d Tariq murmured as he leaned closer.</p><p>Eyes in the sky were what they had. A little help from their friendly neighborhood CIA asset. In the event of an extreme emergency, that asset could get them out of the fortress and to an extraction point, but it wouldn\u2019t be easy. It would compromise positions and covers and that was something no one wanted to do unless they simply had no other choice.</p> <p>If Azir moved in a direction that would compromise Paige\u2019s safety, or her life, then he would call them in, and it was that simple.</p><p>If he had time.</p><p>Abram glanced at her again, the fiery red-gold of her hair as it spilled around her shoulders, the relaxed position of her body indicating she was at the least, dozing.</p><p>As the day had worn on, Paige had become worn out. The drug used on her, the confrontation and abuse inflicted by Azir, and the stress of the day had culminated into complete exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cAzir timed this personally,\u201d Tariq stated as he followed Abram\u2019s look. \u201cAnd the perfect weapon to strike against you. How did he know?\u201d</p><p>Tariq watched Abram, seeing the normally hardened expression as it softened almost imperceptibly. For the first time in far too many years, he was watching a woman affect Abram, and that scared the hell out of him. Because now just wasn\u2019t the time for this.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell knows how he found out.\u201d Abram breathed out roughly. \u201cBut he did, and now we have to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a pt her\u201d Tariq asked, nodding toward Paige as her head slipped deeper into the cushion behind her.</p><p>\u201cKeep her safe and alive,\u201d Abram stated roughly as he turned back to his coffee and sipped at the brew. His expression remained savagely intense. \u201cStay one step ahead of Azir where she\u2019s concerned and make certain he doesn\u2019t get the jump on us. Until we can get her out without compromising our contacts, then we have no other choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we can\u2019t?\u201d Tariq had a feeling he knew the answer to that question.</p><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t then all bets are off.\u201d The look Abram turned on him was more than savage now, it was primal, murderous.</p><p>Tariq barely controlled a flinch as he stared back into pure black icy rage. And he couldn\u2019t say he blamed Abram. He\u2019d lost too much in the years past, had watched too many hopes and dreams fall at his feet and buried too many friends, as well as two too many wives, one of which had owned him as much as any young man could be owned.</p><p>Abram wasn\u2019t a young man anymore though. He was an adult in his prime, and the heart he possessed was a man\u2019s heart, with all its scars and driving hungers.</p><p>It was one Tariq understood, because he too possessed such a heart.</p><p>Glancing at the young woman Azir had ordered him to aid Abram in pleasing, he wondered if sharing a woman with another man would always tempt him. Would the day come when he would come to crave his own woman, his own life? Or would his own scarred soul refuse to give the world enough trust to love again?</p><p>\u201cWhen she turned eighteen she asked me if I\u2019d ever love again.\u201d Abram drew his attention back.</p><p>The look on his cousin\u2019s face was remote, but his eyes were alive with the memories of the pain he had suffered. \u201cAleya had just died with our child.\u201d He shook his head with a quick, rough movement. \u201cI told her only if hell froze over.\u201d</p><p>But Abram loved the girl now sleeping in his room, Tariq thought. He wouldn\u2019t admit it, not yet, but it was there in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you tell her now?\u201d Tariq asked, suddenly wishing he could have slipped some of Khalid\u2019s fine whiskey into the fortress.</p><p>If ever a man needed a drink, it was now.</p><p>Abram finished his coffee and rose to his feet before answering. \u201cI would tell her I wouldn\u2019t dare tempt fate a third time,\u201d he whispered, his voice as tortured as Tariq knew his soul was. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could survive it again.\u201d</p><p>Abram moved to the couch then, picked his delicate lover up in his arms, and ied her to the huge, custom-made bed at the other end of the room. It was conveniently situated close to the hidden door that led beneath the harem and into an underground cavern at the base of the mountains beyond.</p><p>A tunnel they both prayed no one else had found in the years since Abram had. They suspected not, or else Azir would have had it filled in and destroyed like the others that had been discovered.</p><p>His harem had once been sacred to him. Until he had lost the funds the government once paid him and no longer had the gold or American cash to pay for the kidnappings or the American women occasionally auctioned off in the slave markets.</p><p>\u201cStay, Tariq,\u201d Abram told him as he lay his burden in the large bed before undressing and laying down beside her.</p><p>Silk sheets and the thin cashmere blanket was pulled over them as Paige turned and curled into the warmth of Abram\u2019s chest.</p><p>Such trust, Tariq thought as he turned out the lights, set the secondary security, and moved to the bed himself.</p><p>Undressing as well, he crawled in beneath the blankets, rolled onto his stomach, and settled into the comfort of the bed.</p><p>He was aroused, there was no doubt. Merely the thought of what was to come with the woman he had always been so curious about was enough to make him harder than hell.</p><p>But, like Abram, he was damn worried.</p><p>Azir was striking hard and fast and now moving in ways neither Tariq, nor Abram could anticipate.</p><p>If he continued in this vein, then they could easily end up on the losing end of the war they were now involved in. A war centering around one delicate, red-haired, green-eyed woman that Tariq knew he would have to guard his heart against.</p><p>8</p><p>Paige stood at the high windows of the bedroom and</p><p>stared through the crack of the partially opened shutters to where Jafar and Azir stood on the other side of the fortress wall, barely visible.</p><p>The two men had their heads close together as they stared at the ground as though looking for something, the metal detector Jafar carried so shadowed that at first it had been hard to tell exactly what it was.</p><p>Their dark thobes, the loose, long-sleeved, ankle-length garments, unadorned and plain, rippled at their legs from the winds sweeping from the mountains. On their heads, the ghutra, a large square cloth of cotton, dark in color to match the thobe, was wrapped around their faces to protect them from the cold wind and secured with the thick, double, black cord.</p><p>Azir seemed to teeter ever so often, and in the two hours she had watched them surveying the natu bank that split the land along the length of the fortress, she\u2019d seen the old man almost topple over more than once.</p><p>Jafar kept close to him, catching him whenever he stumbled and staying close to him whenever the crazy old goat seemed to wander from whatever they were doing.</p><p>They were searching for something as far as she could tell, and evidently having little success in finding it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they looking for?\u201d she asked Tariq as he worked on a piece of electronics at the small table across the room.</p><p>A muttered sound resembling a male grunt met her question. \u201cAzir has spent years trying to find all the hidden tunnels coming in and out of the castle,\u201d he told her. \u201cEach time he finds one he has it dynamited or filled in in some way to make it impossible.\u201d</p><p>She stared back down at the men with a frown. Why would they worry about hidden tunnels?</p><p>\u201cTo keep Abram from escaping,\u201d she murmured almost to herself.</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Tariq agreed. \u201cAzir is fanatical about keeping him here until the king releases the funds he had frozen over twenty years ago. If Azir can get them returned, then the government has to pay out, no matter what, for the next ten years or risk breaking a treaty with several of the tribes that were a part of the original pact. They\u2019ll go to any lengths to keep from doing that, and Azir knows that.\u201d</p><p>Greed. Power. That was what it all came down to, one way or the other. Azir was hungry for it, just as his sons had been. Those who didn\u2019t hunger for it tried peaceful means at all costs, and kept their demands clearly stated.</p><p>Azir wanted nothing more than to fund whatever fanatical regime he was supporting, and nothing mattered but his wants. Not even the heir who seemed to be his last hope of a comfortable life in his old age. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She continued to stare out the window, watching as they began to track the ground with the metal detector once again.</p><p>\u201cHow does a metal detector help them find underground tunnels?\u201d she asked without turning back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a metal detector,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt\u2019s specially modified to pick up pockets beneath the ground, vacancies that would indicate a cave, a cavern, or a tunnel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there a tunnel where he\u2019s looking?\u201d She glanced back, but rather than searching for his eyes her gaze moved to his naked back once again.</p><p>\u201cNot that we\u2019ve found,\u201d he told her with a quick shake of his head. \u201cAbram and I have searched high and low for tunnels that haven\u2019t yet been found. So far, we hnnels thatx2019;t found anything.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the scene below to see Jafar gesture angrily to Azir with a frown. She would have never believed he was as deceitful as it appeared he was, or that he could have been a risk to her. Learning he had helped conspire to kidnap her had been a disillusioning blow.</p><p>There had been a lot of surprises in the past four days though, things she had truly never expected. She\u2019d known Khalid\u2019s cousins most of her life. At one time or another she had been introduced to them under various circumstances outside the Saudi regime. Until perhaps five or six years before, his Saudi cousins had been regulars at many of the vacation spots her parents had visited, for either business or pleasure.</p><p>Then, the positions they had held within the Saudi government had been dissolved, Paige had learned.</p> <p>Because of Ayid and Aman, Khalid had told her. Once the king had received proof they were still involved with terrorist activities, all the males working in the Riyadh government had been asked to return to their own province. Ayid and Aman had destroyed the regime\u2019s trust for the entire family.</p><p>Jafar and Tariq had actually held very lucrative positions within imports and exports, allowing them to travel all over the world. Several of Jafar\u2019s family members were still in the U.S. attending college on student visas he had arranged while they were still very young.</p><p>But Tariq and Jafar were here now, rather than jet-setting and representing their country financially.</p><p>Turning, she stared at Tariq once again, her gaze straying to his smooth, bare shoulders. He was dressed only in the ankle-length loose trousers that he and Abram wore beneath their thobes.</p><p>Once the two men entered the rooms, the first thing they did was strip off the thobes. She\u2019d seen Abram pull on well-worn, lovingly faded denim the night before like a man pulling on a favorite lover. She swore his lashes almost fluttered in pleasure for a second.</p><p>Tariq\u2019s bare shoulders were the only part of his back that was smooth though. Unlike her mother\u2019s description of Azir with his heavy pelt of body hair, Tariq actually sported very little, as did Abram.</p> <p>But his back was crisscrossed with what had to be hundreds of very fine, thin scars that went from his shoulder blades to beneath the drawstring waist of the trousers.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She cleared her throat uneasily as she moved toward him.</p><p>He\u2019d been working on that piece of equipment for two days now.</p><p>\u201cSomeone found one of the GPS trackers I\u2019ve been using on the Land Rovers and managed to scramble the signal,\u201d he murmured as he continued to peer into the electronic control board. \u201cI\u2019m trying to alter the device rather than attempting to steal the tracker itself back. If I can get it to remotely change the signal, then I\u2019ll have them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you trying to track?\u201d She stared down at the intricate array of tiny wires, nodules, and electronic relays with a frown.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder at her, his milk chocolate\u2013brown eyes faintly amused as he gave her a glance of male appreciation. \u201cThe new soaps Abram brought in for you smell nice.\u201d</p><p>She was that close to him. Not touching, but close enough that he had no problem smelling the very faint scent of rose and sandalwood.</p><p>She moved back, a sense of nervousness invading her as he continued to watch her for several seconds before turning back to the electronic device.</p> <p>It was merely another variation of the same theme that had played out in the past two days that Abram hadn\u2019t been present. The looks of interest, the silent reminder that Abram had already asked him to be his third and that he shared that huge bed with them every night.</p><p>For the past two nights she had gone to sleep with Abram\u2019s arms around her, only to awaken with Tariq\u2019s holding her. It was creating an intimacy she couldn\u2019t seem to escape.</p><p>Restraining a frustrated sigh she turned back to him, her lips parting to comment on Abram\u2019s absence when a hard, imperative knock sounded on the heavy, thick wood of the door.</p><p>Paige flinched with near violence, her heart jumping into her throat as her gaze flew to where Tariq was quickly folding a square of cloth over the device he had been working on and rising from the chair.</p><p>He pointed to the connecting door that led to his suite as he moved to it quickly.</p><p>He was leaving?</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be listening,\u201d he promised quickly, his voice so low as to be nearly silent. \u201cSee who it is, and don\u2019t let them know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the scarf that Abram had given her in case Azir showed up to use over her head and around her neck as a hijab.</p><p>The knock sounded again, harder, and this time, more impatient.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she called out as she quickly secured the scarf around her head as Abram had taught her.</p><p>\u201cIt is Jafar, Paige. I have someone here who wishes to see you.\u201d His voice came through the door quietly.</p><p>font color=\"#000000\"&gt;Dammit, where the hell was Abram?</p><p>\u201cAbram isn\u2019t here, Jafar,\u201d she stated from the seam of the door and frame. \u201cHe told me not to open the door to anyone.\u201d</p><p>She heard Jafar\u2019s laughter through the heavy wood. \u201cPut your scarf on and simply open the door. I do not intend to enter the room.\u201d</p><p>She looked to where Tariq watched from the doorway of his suite. He nodded at her as she gave him a look of desperation and silently mouthed, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced tightly before nodding again at her and disappearing into the other room.</p><p>Releasing the locks she opened the door several inches and stared at Jafar and the figure clothed in black from head to foot in the face and body covering usually only worn in the strictest of areas.</p><p>Behind the mesh screen of the burqa, feminine eyes stared back at her, though the shape and color were impossible to distinguish.</p><p>Behind the much smaller figure stood Jafar, as his odd, almost translucent pale green eyes watched her with knowing, mocking amusement.</p><p>Antagonism rose within her at the first sight of him and it was all she could do to keep her lips clamped closed.</p><p>\u201cSuch a look of anger.\u201d He grinned at her, a brow arching in a move of such arrogance that for a second, he reminded her of Abram.</p><p>\u201cStop trying to make her angry, brother,\u201d the feminine voice chided him with surprising tartness.</p><p>Paige\u2019s gaze jerked back to the shrouded figure and struggled to peer behind the mesh eye covering.</p><p>\u201cChalah?\u201d she whispered uncertainly, hopefully, though suspicion was blooming inside her.</p><p>\u201cI told you she would remember me.\u201d Soft laughter spilled from behind the dark covering. \u201cLet me in, Paige, so I can get rid of my hulking brother, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Paige\u2019s eyes flicked to Jafar once again. How cruel of him to bring the sister who had once been her friend to betray her.</p><p>She eased back slowly, allowing the door to open as she kept a wary eye on Jafar. She trusted him even less now. It was incredibly obvious he was attempting to use the sister he had once seemed to adore.</p><p>The lies of the past were piling up on his head, and she hoped the weight of them buried him. Quickly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d Chalah all but bounced into te room as Paige closed the door in Jafar\u2019s laughing face.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were still in college,\u201d Paige stated as she locked the door, her brows lifting as the burqa came off.</p><p>This was Chalah. White sneakers, her long legs just dark enough to give her a perpetually tanned look. Cutoff shorts and a snug camisole that shaped her full breasts and emphasized her tiny waist.</p><p>\u201cAll about covering yourself today, aren\u2019t you there, Chalah?\u201d she drawled.</p><p>Chalah rolled her eyes. \u201cI hear the Matawa deserted this damned place about the same time the money left,\u201d she snorted.</p><p>The Matawa, or religious police were the terror of any woman unlucky enough to draw their notice.</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell did you manage to get your ass in this situation?\u201d Chalah propped her hands on her hips as she glared back at Paige.</p><p>Long black hair was confined in a thick heavy braid. Exotic, honey brown eyes, thickly lashed, were sparkling as her lips pursed in irritation.</p><p>\u201cAn argument with Khalid.\u201d Paige admitted a truth she hadn\u2019t even told Abram.</p><p>\u201cIt figures it was that oaf\u2019s fault,\u201d Chalah retorted as she crossed her arms over her breasts and tilted her head curiously. \u201cLet me guess, he didn\u2019t handle catching you in that tight, hot embrace with Abram very well? Did he scream incest?\u201d She waggled her brows suggestively.</p><p>Paige stared back at her in surprise as she drew the scarf from her head and draped it over the back of the couch.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>She knew neither Khalid nor Marty would have told of the incident. To do so would have endangered Abram and further threatened Paige.</p><p>Chalah turned, glancing around the room before casting Paige an impish look from the corner of her eye.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Abram?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Paige shrugged. \u201cHe was gone when I awoke this morning. Now, tell me how you knew about Abram being at Khalid\u2019s that night.\u201d</p><p>Chalah shot her a dark look as she paced around the room as though looking for something. When she made her way back to Paige she shook her head, her expression pensive.</p><p>\u201cBecause Khalid either has one of Azir or Jafar\u2019s spies, or a very gossipy employee on his payroll.\u201d Chalah kept her voice low. \u201cnd if you dare let anyone know I told you that, even Abram, then I may not survive long enough to return to the U.S. and finish my degree.\u201d</p><p>Paige closed her eyes for a second before turning, her hand moving to rub at the side of her head wearily. Her temple throbbed with stress.</p><p>\u201cIs it Abdul?\u201d she asked as she turnd back, knowing it would break Khalid and Mary\u2019s heart if it were the manservant betraying him.</p><p>\u201cHow simple would that be?\u201d Chalah rolled her eyes expressively. \u201cBut, no such luck. I\u2019m afraid all I know for sure is that it\u2019s a female. A very vindictive one who\u2019s either in the house or in the employ of the Conover security team. She\u2019s been funneling information to the commander of the terrorist cell Ayid and Aman led for a while now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Jafar commanded those men,\u201d Paige said as she watched the other girl suspiciously and wondered what the hell was going on.</p><p>Chalah gave a brief shake of her head as regret twisted her expression.</p><p>\u201cNo, Paige,\u201d she whispered, her voice barely audible now. \u201cJafar has taken Ayid and Aman\u2019s place as a mere leader, but they were never commanders. Even Jafar doesn\u2019t know who the commander is, and he claims he enjoys living so he does not ask.\u201d</p><p>Pain flashed in Chalah\u2019s eyes at the admission of her brother actually being part of the cell.</p><p>\u201cDoes Jafar know anything about him?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>Chalah grimaced, grief flashing in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJafar refused to discuss it with me,\u201d she sighed. \u201cAfter Anwar\u2019s death he was so consumed with vengeance at first that discussing anything with him was impossible. Having him murdered as he was, and believing Azir was behind it consumed him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anwar had been Jafar\u2019s older brother by several years. A full brother that Jafar had idolized as a child. He had also been the heir to a third of the Mustafa province and had been petitioning the regime to reacquire the property with a vow that it would be run as the family of Mustafa had vowed to run it centuries before.</p><p>Paige knew both Khalid and Abram were still certain Azir and his sons, Ayid and Aman, were behind his death.</p><p>Chalah moved to the table and leaned against it as Paige watched her quietly for several moments.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Paige asked her warily. \u201cWouldn\u2019t Jafar be upset?\u201d</p><p>Chalah\u2019s expression sobered. \u201cIf he knew, then he would be very upset, and f Azir ever learned I told you anything, then he would most surely have me stoned,\u201d she revealed heavily. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I have to worry about you telling anyone but Abram, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Azir has known all along that Abram and Khalid weren\u2019t estranged,\u201d she whispered, her stomach pitching sickeningly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long he\u2019s known, but Jafar has known for several years. Just as he\u2019s known that Abram and Tariq have had a lover to share each time they\u2019ve been to the U.S.\u201d Chalah\u2019s gaze was curious now. \u201cWas it you?\u201d</p><p>Paige nearly choked on her own mocking laughter. \u201cKhalid had a cow when he caught Abram kissing me. Do you really think I could have gotten away with anything else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKnowing Khalid?\u201d Chalah\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cIt is rather doubtful.\u201d</p><p>And Chalah knew Khalid. Not as well as Paige did, and certainly not as a lover, but one of the young women Azir had bought Khalid years ago for a personal harem, attended the same college with Chalah, and the two girls had socialized often.</p><p>Chalah was considered a friend, as well as a cousin to Khalid, and he had made it plain more than once that if she ever needed anything then he had no problem helping her out.</p><p>Watching Chalah closely now, Paige still had a hard time believing the other girl was here, or that she seemed to be willing to help.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this, Chalah?\u201d Paige asked wearily, not bothering to hide her suspicion now. \u201cBy your own words, the brother who has spoiled you all your life might allow you to be stoned, or murdered for giving me this information. Why would you risk that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you would do it for me,\u201d Chalah said softly, her honey-gold eyes filling with pain. \u201cAnd Khalid would do it for me. But even more importantly, for Jafar. Because if anything happens to you and Abram, and Jafar ever realizes the mistake he\u2019s made, then it will kill him. Protecting him from himself is the only way I can help him at this point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven if you have to face being murdered by your brother? By your uncle?\u201d</p><p>Chalah sighed heavily. \u201cIt isn\u2019t murder here, Paige, not to these people or to this land. And not to Jafar or Azir. Betrayal isn\u2019t tolerated, especially by a woman, and Jafar and Azir both would see it as an unforgiveable betrayal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you would risk that for me, Abram, and Khalid?\u201d Paige asked her again. \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time believing that.\u201d</p><p>Chalah wasn\u2019t lying to her. She knew too many truths, understood the situation too clearly. But was she really trying to help, or in someway lead Abram into a trap?</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Chalah drawled as she crossed one ankle over the other and tilted her head to the side. \u201cWhy else would I return to this sun-baked wasteland but to try to help your stubborn ass? Have you really forgotten how much I hate this place, Paige?\u201d</p><p>Paige shook her head as she kept a careful eye on the other woman. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time, Chalah.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBut Jafar is your brother, and I know you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I do love him.\u201d Chalah nodded sharply. \u201cBut Jafar is wrong, Paige, and I couldn\u2019t live with myself if anything happened to you because of him. And I feel guilty,\u201d she whispered miserably. \u201cI knew he was up to something when he called and asked me if I knew why you weren\u2019t at your apartment any longer and if I had heard where you were staying. I should have called you then. I should have warned you he was looking for you.\u201d</p><p>But would it have really changed things? Would she have taken the situation even less seriously than she already had simply because she thought she could trust Jafar?</p> <p>Paige lifted her hand to rub at her temple again as she watched Chalah thoughtfully. Everything she knew of the other girl told her that Chalah was being honest. That she was simply trying to help.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to agree with my brother to love him, Paige,\u201d she said regretfully. \u201cAnd loving him doesn\u2019t mean I have to let him get away with what he\u2019s doing to you and Abram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you think you can help?\u201d Paige sighed as she paced to the table and sat down wearily. \u201cNeither of us have enough power here to protect ourselves, let alone our brothers. And you know that as well as I do. You should go home and be safe. If anything happens to you, you\u2019re only going to make Abram feel as though it were his fault. He has enough on his conscience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think Jafar won\u2019t have enough on his conscience when he realizes the mistake he\u2019s made?\u201d Chalah hissed back at her, her expressive eyes burning with anger. \u201cI came here to help, Paige. To help my brother and yours, as well as Abram. I need to know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Paige\u2019s eyes rounded in surprise. \u201cAnd you think I\u2019d know what the hell you can do?\u201d she whispered fiercely. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake Chalah, I haven\u2019t been out of these rooms since the day I came here. I have no idea what the hell is going on or how to help anyone. I don\u2019t even see Abram until after dark, and when I do see him, he\u2019s exhausted. So why don\u2019t you tell me what I could do.\u201d</p><p>Chalah stared back at her in dismay. Then her jaw tightened and she stomped to the end of the couch before turning back in frustration.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something, Paige.\u201d</p><p>Paige gave her head a quick shake as she kept her voice low. \u201cGo home. Go back to school. If Abram has to worry about protecting you as well as me, then it\u2019s only going to fracture his attention further. He can\u2019t afford that right now.\u201d</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t afford it. Losing Abram would kill her, especially if she lost him because of his affection, his connection\u2014whatever the hell it was\u2014to her.</p><p>He had come back to Saudi Arabia rather than defecting as he\u2019d planned after the deaths of his brothers.</p><p>He\u2019d been forced to return to Saudi Arabia as a personal favor to the Saudi Arabian ambassador to take pictures of suspected terrorists. When he\u2019d managed to get back to the U.S., he\u2019d had to return again because of the threat to her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to break away from the bloody legacy his father was creating here, or the threat of death that resulted from the pleasure he found in sharing his lover sexually.</p><p>\u201cJafar didn\u2019t used to be like this.\u201d Chalah sighed in regret as her lips trembled with the painful emotion she was feeling. \u201cHe wanted to be an American. He wanted to have the freedom to do as he wished, as Khalid did, as he knew Abram did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew Abram wanted to defect to the U.S.?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>\u201cPaige.\u201d Chalah stared back at her in bemusement. \u201cAbram, Tariq, Jafar, and several other cousins planned to defect together. It\u2019s been their plan since Abram\u2019s first wife, Lessa, was murdered by Ayid and Aman. Jafar has always known his plans, because they made them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jafar would know exactly how to block every move Abram made.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cBut Abram knows what Jafar is aware of,\u201d Chalah pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of battle between them.\u201d The other girl frowned in confusion. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t understand what started it or why they are at odds with each other.\u201d</p><p>It was the same problem Paige had, trying to figure out what had changed Jafar since the last time she had seen him. She had been vacationing with her parents in Greece, three, perhaps four years before.</p><p>As she watched, Chalah\u2019s expression turned somber.</p><p>\u201cJafar was a good man once, wasn\u2019t he, Paige?\u201d she whispered, grief flashing in her eyes for just a moment.</p><p>Paige looked away for a second wondering if she should lie, of if she should tell Chalah how she felt in regards to good men.</p><p>\u201cMen are what they are,\u201d she finally said softly. \u201cThey\u2019re either born mostly good, or they\u2019re born mostly bad, just like anyone else is, Chalah. But the bad is always there, and for most men, the good is always there as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor most men?\u201d Chalah asked with bitterness. Paige could see the need in her eyes for an affirmation that there was a chance that her brother wasn\u2019t mostly, or even worse, fully bad.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, some men are always bad,\u201d she said gently. \u201cAnd then, there are those good men, those really really good men, Chalah, who just want everyone to think they\u2019re bad for whatever reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d Chalah whispered, tears filling her eyes. \u201cThere are those really bad men who are really good at making some people think they\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Paige dropped her eyes and crossed her arms over her breasts to hold back the pain she felt for the other girl, to hold back her need to comfort her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t decided yet, was Chalah the young woman she had once known? The future pediatrician with a gentle, loving heart, or was she one of those people everyone thought was good, but who for whatever reason, knew the evil inside her personally?</p><p>She lifted her eyes as Chalah sighed heavily. \u201cGo home, Chalah,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIf you really want to help Abram, if you really want to help Jafar, then go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t trust me, and if you don\u2019t trust me, then neither will Abram,\u201d Chalah guessed.</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with trust, Chalah, and everything to do with the fact that from the sound of it, you know more than I do about the entire situation. And I think you know that if you talk to Abram, then he\u2019s going to tell you the same thing I did. Go home.\u201d</p><p>Tears glittered in her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re my family, Paige. They\u2019re all I have left.\u201d</p><p>What the hell could she say? She knew exactly how she felt. After the death of her uncle when she was still a teenager she only had her parents and Khalid left, and she\u2019d always been aware of the crosshairs Azir Mustafa kept the family under.</p><p>She\u2019d always been aware that any time, she could either be dead, or alone.</p><p>As her lips parted to attempt to comfort the other girl, the sound of a heavy knock on the door sliced through the room, causing both women to jump, and Chalah\u2019s eyes to flash with fear.</p><p>A fear far stronger than she should have felt.</p><p>\u201cChalah, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d Jafar\u2019s voice was far cold than it had been earlier.</p><p>Paige swung her gaze around to the girl, and watched in fury as a tear slipped from the corner of her eye. Slowly, she lifted her hand to the medallion on the necklace she wore, turned it around, and showed Paige the device on the back of it.</p><p>She\u2019d seen enough television programs and read enough adventure-romance novels to know exactly what it was. An electronic listening device. And Chalah had waited until the last minute to show it to her.</p><p>Paige straightened slowly, her arms dropping to her sides as she flashed Chalah a look of promised retribution. One way, some way, she would repay her for this.</p><p>Go home! she mouthed. Now!</p><p>Because if she ever saw the younger girl again then she would ensure Chalah knew exactly how completely severed their friendship was.</p><p>Jerking the scarf around her head, neck, and finally tucking it around her face until nothing but her eyes showed, she moved with jerky fury to the door and wrenched it open.</p><p>Chalah had only just managed to pull the abaya back on and secure the mesh over her eyes when Paige found herself facing the stone-hard, pale-eyed monster that watched her with calculating eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t dare speak. There were rules and punishments, consequences and dangers to uttering even one of the curses tearing through her brain now.</p><p>Hatred welled inside her, blistering hot and searing her from the inside out.</p><p>What had Jafar hoped to gain by using his sister this way?</p> <p>She stood back and turned slowly to stare at Chalah.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye,\u201d she stated with a withering stare. A ring of finality clearly echoed as she refused to say anything more.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t endanger the younger girl, but if Chalah dared to return then the rules would change.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Paige,\u201d Chalah said softly, miserably. Before Paige could avoid her, the other girl wrapped her arms around her in a tight, desperate hug. She whispered, \u201cI swear, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Paige stepped back slowly, deliberately pushing her away as her gaze moved to Jafar once again. He had forced Chalah, there was no doubt, but she had still betrayed Paige, Abram, and Tariq. She should have shown her the device before they ever spoke.</p> <p>\u201cTell Abram when he returns that it would not be advisable to leave at night any longer, for either him or Tariq,\u201d he warned evenly, his pale green eyes like glass, cold and unemotional as his gaze flicked over her. \u201cOr, Ms. Galbraithe, for you.\u201d</p><p>He reached past her, gripped Chalah\u2019s upper arm, and all but jerked her from the room.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t gotten what he wanted, and now his sister would pay for it, and Chalah knew it.</p><p>Her head was down, her shoulders shuddering as silent sobs shook her beneath the heavy shroud.</p><p>Paige prayed that the beating she knew Chalah would take for failure was the only punishment she would receive before Jafar allowed her to return to America, and to school.</p><p>Chalah had one dream, to be a pediatrician in America. But Paige doubted Jafar would allow her to keep it for long.</p> <p>Pulling his sister after him, Jafar turned and strode away, his long-legged stride causing Chalah to struggle to keep up with him as they moved around the bend of the hall and disappeared from view.</p><p>Paige closed and locked the door carefully before leaning against it and letting a silent sob ripple through her own body. How close she had come to trusting the other girl and attempting to ease the pain she had felt in her. How close she had come to destroying herself, Tariq, and worst of all, Abram.</p><p>\u201cThe listening device didn\u2019t work, Paige.\u201d</p><p>Jerking, she turned to see Tariq standing behind her, his expression creased with anger and his own sorrow. \u201cI detected it the second she and Jafar knocked on the door.\u201d He lifted the device he had been working on. \u201cI fixed it.\u201d</p><p>She turned and wiped her eyes. \u201cThat only detects it,\u201d she whispered painfully.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI switched on a device beneath the table before I left that alters the audio signal, either analog or digital. I didn\u2019t disable it until I saw you weren\u2019t going to betray Abram. Then, I used the controls in my suite to allow enough out to whoever was listening to assure them that you weren\u2019t shit, even if you knew. Perhaps, Jafar will send her home now.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer as more tears fell down her face, as she sniffed back the pain that tore through her and the disillusionment that shredded her heart.</p><p>\u201cI hate this place,\u201d she suddenly spat, though the sobs, as quiet as they were, roughened her voice to a rasp. \u201cOh God, Tariq, I hate this place.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped closer, his expression suddenly tired, and just as disillusioned as she felt. \u201cAnd you aren\u2019t alone,\u201d he whispered as he tucked a heavy strand of hair behind her ear, his fingertips caressing her ear gently for a fragile second before they dropped away. \u201cTrust me, Paige, in that, you will never be alone.\u201d</p><p>mbp:pagebreak/&gt;9</p><p>A day of dealing with Azir and Jafar\u2019s paranoia a</p><p>s he searched fruitlessly for the only contact that could arrange extraction out of Saudi Arabia had Abram in a less than pleasant mood when he returned to his room that night.</p><p>For whatever reason, and he was beginning to suspect those reasons, Jafar had convinced Azir that Abram needed to personally handle the drilling of a new water well outside of the fortress.</p><p>That well supplied water to the dozen or so families that lived outside the fortress walls and provided the Mustafa province with the few vegetables and animals used for their meals.</p><p>The problems with lines, pipes, and generators had led to more than one worker throwing his hands up in surrender at the seemingly unending problems and delays.</p><p>Two of those settlements farmed domesticated rabbit and lamb and sold the wool and small amounts of meat to other provinces as well. They had to have that water, yet it seemed something or someone had deliberately fouled the equipment to halt the pumping of it.</p><p>There were a few local incomes that Abram had been able to provide for the province, knowing that once he left the few benefits the regime provided would drain away.</p><p>To add to the problems, Abram had learned several of the men had spied Azir and Jafar testing the ground and the fortress wall behind his and Tariq\u2019s suites for tunnels and exits.</p><p>Azir had been searching for that tunnel since before Khalid\u2019s mother had escaped. And no tunnel had even played a part in her ability to slip from the fortress.</p><p>The part that worried Abram the most was the fact that Azir was certain the tunnel was there. There were no drawings or blueprints left to reveal or cause anyone to suspect any bolt holes other than the ones already filled in.</p><p>Entering the suite silently well after dark, he found Paige curled on the couch napping, and Tariq at the small dining table still adjusting the piece of electronics he had been working on for over a week.</p><p>Closing the door silently he watched as Tariq held a shushing finger up, rose to his feet, and motioned Abram to the connecting suite.</p><p>Frowning, Abram followed, wondering what the hell could have happened here in the suite today to cause the look of anger that gleamed in his eyes.</p><p>No doubt, it had something to do with either Jafar or Azir. The two men were beginning to irritate him to his last nerve, even more so than usual.</p><p>Closing the door to the sitting room behind them, Tariq turned to him, his lips tightening as his dark eyes flashed with silent, burning anger.</p><p>\u201cJafar brought Chalah here today and she was simply a fount of information.\u201d He sneered. \u201cAs well as carrying a tiny listening device attached to the medallion I fucking gave her for her sixteenth birthday.\u201d There was the reason for the fury. Tariq had always been fond of his little cousin. That medallion held special significance for him, and for her to use it against him or Abram would seem the worst betrayal.</p><p>Chalah Mustafa, Jafar\u2019s half-sister. She was Abram\u2019s first cousin, and would have been Tariq\u2019s if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Tariq\u2019s father hadn\u2019t been Hussein Mustafa as everyone assumed it was. That bit of knowledge was something even Azir was unaware of. There were a lot of half-siblings, step-siblings, half-cousins, and half-families parading as Mustafas these days though. There were times the dynamics of it boggled his mind and he wasn\u2019t a stupid man.</p><p>Abram listened silently to the conversation Tariq had recorded. His mind turned with suspicions and possibilities as Chalah attempted to gain the details of his relationship with Paige, as well as any plans they might have for leaving. She had revealed the recording device to Paige before leaving though, which meant she hadn\u2019t been there voluntarily.</p><p>She had been forced.</p><p>Somehow, Azir and her brother had found a way to make her attempt to betray those she considered family, as well as Paige, who had always been a friend.</p><p>Abram wasn\u2019t going to hold it against her, but neither would he ever be able to trust her again. Had she revealed the device before the conversation started, then he would have felt differently.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your impression?\u201d he asked Tariq as he rubbed the back of his neck in irritation when the recording ended. \u201cWas she forced by Jafar, by Azir, or by both?\u201d</p><p>Tariq grimaced furiously, his dark brown eyes burning with his anger and perhaps even a hint of betrayal. He\u2019d always cared for Chalah, always watched out for her whenever she returned to the province. To have her do something like this, without warning them, would have struck him in one of the few vulnerable areas he had.</p><p>\u201cHell, Abram, you know both of them, your guess is about as good as mine. Besides, you know that little hellion as well as I do.\u201d He growled as his arms crossed over his chest and his jaw clenched with his attempt at control. \u201cLet\u2019s say she sounded sincere in her offer to help as well as her worry. Enough so that she had Paige fooled until she showed her that device.\u201d Disgust filled his voice. \u201cShe had Paige convinced.\u201d He pushed his fingers through his thick, dark brown hair. \u201cOf something. Hell, I would have believed her if I hadn\u2019t known she was bugged.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it was damned hard to lose trust in someone he had known all his life, protected, and taken care of.</p><p>\u201cIs she coming back?\u201d He breathed out roughly.</p><p>Jafar wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with the information he would have heard, what little Tariq had allowed past the jammer. He would have to try again.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need this. They didn\u2019t need it. Chalah was as wild as the wind and just as unpredictable, but she had never been a danger until now.</p><p>That danger was forced. She hadn\u2019t done it willingly, but still, she had done it before warning them. That was a deal breaker in the trust department.</p><p>\u201cIf she comes back, Jafar will be escorting her, and to be honest, I can\u2019t assure you Paige will have the self-control not to confront Jafar. Remember, she doesn\u2019t know him like this, in the setting he was raised in. If she attempts to berate him, he could have her arrested and sent to the Matawa in the next province. Which is what I\u2019m beginning to fear they intend to do with us the minute you give your vow to the monarch\u2019s emissary.\u201d</p><p>It was no more than Abram suspected himself.</p><p>Hell, he didn\u2019t suspect it, he knew it. It was one of the reasons he knew he had to get the hell out of there before the emissary showed up.</p><p>\u201cHell, at the very least, he could punish her himself, or Azir could,\u201d Tariq bit out as he continued. \u201cEither way, it would end in bloodshed.\u201d</p><p>If either of them dared to touch Paige, then bloodshed would be the very least of their worries.</p><p>He had to find his contact, and that wasn\u2019t an easy chore when combined with the need to sleep and to leave Tariq there with her while he fought against the bond he knew would come when he took her.</p><p>And that was the overwhelming reason why he was the one out there searching for the contact rather than Tariq. That bond that he could feel growing night by night as he lay next to her naked body while she slept. Without moving, without speaking, she was invading a part of him that he had always managed to keep her from invading before.</p><p>She was like lightning, and there was nothing he could do to tame her, nothing he could do to keep her from burning into his soul if he gave her the chance.</p><p>Already, she was burning through his control and inciting a hunger inside him unlike anything any other woman could have touched.</p><p>He was so fucking hard and horny he was in agony. The past three days and nights had been hell.</p><p>As soon as she fell asleep he had to drag his ass out of the bed and do what he could to work their way out of an impossible situation. When he was done, when he couldn\u2019t go without sleep any longer, only then did he send Tariq out. then, he was left with her, sleeping beside her, feeling her against him, her delicate limbs entwined with his as they lay together.</p><p>What should have been accomplished quickly if he and Tariq worked together was taking twice the time and had become twice as dangerous. And much of the danger stemmed from the fact that he couldn\u2019t keep his mind off her enough to ensure he wasn\u2019t making mistakes.</p><p>All he could think about was fucking Paige until he had to cover her mouth to muffle her screams of pleasure. Or of holding her, controlling the movements of her body as he watched Tariq take her. Watched his cock slide slow and easy up her sensitive, tight pussy, or better yet\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His entire body tensed with a brutal, unrelenting hunger.</p><p>Or watching Tariq stretch the tight, small entrance of her ass, pushing inside her with the heavy breadth of his cock as she tried to scream from a pleasure that she knew how to distinguish from pain. A pleasure that engaged every sense, that left her focused on nothing but the submission of the act, the feel of a man\u2019s dick pounding inside her body in a way that forced home the knowledge that she was taken. That they trusted each other just as deeply.</p><p>The sight of it had been incredible in the past, Abram knew. Sharing a woman with another man was to be able to experience his lover\u2019s pleasure as he couldn\u2019t do in any other way.</p> <p>To allow him to watch her being taken. To see the primal, possessive clasp of her flesh as it stretched and took the invader pumping inside her.</p><p>The need for it was growing. The hunger for it was tearing at him even as he fought it, to delay it until he could get her out of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Now, Jafar thought he could mess with Abram\u2019s life further, with his happiness, by involving his sister and garnering evidence that he and Tariq were involved in sexual indecency?</p><p>If Jafar and Azir took their suspicions to the Matawa, the religious police, with the audio proof of admission from Paige, then even the king wouldn\u2019t be able to save them. And for that, Abram would have to kill Azir and Jafar both.</p><p>He looked around Tariq\u2019s suite, aware of the other man watching him carefully. He fought to push back the fury that was becoming harder to tame with each successive day.</p> <p>\u201cI expect Jafar to bring her back, Abram,\u201d Tariq revealed. \u201cHe obviously has no problem with using her however he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he brings Chalah back tomorrow, then we\u2019ll deal with it. We can\u2019t let him see either of us in the room with Paige though, and by all appearances both of us have to be staying in your suite. Tomorrow, he\u2019ll be aware that we\u2019re both there if he shows up at the door again.\u201d</p><p>Tariq teed, his eyes narrowing at the declaration and the knowledge that Abram had reach his limit. It was in his voice, in the tension building inside him.</p><p>They had known each other too long perhaps, shared too many lovers in the past. They knew the signs the other showed, and could gauge interest as well as that point where it couldn\u2019t be ignored any longer.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t hiding well either, Abram knew. The hunger for her was tearing him apart inside as he tried to give Paige and Tariq the room he felt they needed for Paige to become closer to the man he had picked as his third. Hoping, a part of him terrified, that she would find in Tariq whatever emotion it was that she was searching for in Abram.</p><p>Could he handle it?</p> <p>Could he handle it if she didn\u2019t?</p><p>God help him, she was his greatest weakness and he couldn\u2019t seem to find a way to protect himself should the unthinkable happen.</p><p>\u201cIs she ready?\u201d he finally asked Tariq when nothing else was said.</p><p>Surprise filled Tariq\u2019s eyes. \u201cReady in what way?\u201d</p><p>Surely his cousin couldn\u2019t be surprised by the question, or unaware why Abram had been leaving them both here, naked, in the bed together, each morning.</p><p>\u201cFor you?\u201d Abram paused, his brow arching sarcastically. \u201cFor both of us? Why do you think I\u2019ve busted my ass the past nights to do the work of two men? So you can catch up on your nightly beauty sleep, Prince Mustafa?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d left them there alone for a reason. To allow Paige to acclimate herself to the man she would call lover as well. He sure as hell hadn\u2019t left the two of them alone together for his mental health, because the knowledge of it had nearly corroded the last of his control.</p><p>Tariq grunted irritably at the comment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you want me to do, Abram?\u201d Tariq\u2019s arms crossed over his chest as he tilted his head and stared back at him with cynical mockery. \u201cShe stands in the window and watches for you. She waits for you as a new wife awaits her husband. Would you have me attempt to seduce her when she clearly shows no interest?\u201d He gave a bitter, hard laugh. \u201cDo I appear the fool to you? There is no desire that comes from her until she sees you. Only then does she begin to burn.\u201d</p><p>Abram\u2019s teeth clenched. This wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected despite the ambivalent feelings he had toward Tariq seducing not just her body, but her heart as well.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t exactly been standing outside the fortress twiddling my fingers,\u201d Abram growled disparagingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I go ahead and find our contact tonight and you can seduce your woman,\u201d Tariq suggested, distinctly annoyed. \u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake I see you walking into, my friend. Because she is not a woman that will forgive you for it.\u201d</p><p>She was the type of woman whose memory of her kiss and of her touch would torment him for life.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Tariq,\u201d Abram snarled.</p><p>A dark chuckle met his protest as Tariq stared back at him knowingly.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do know,\u201d Tariq informed him. \u201cYou know you haven\u2019t yet taken her because you fear when you do, she will become a part of your heart. Should that happen, then what defenses will you have if Azir and Jafar win in this game as Ayid and Aman always won in the others? Especially with Lessa. You are afraid you will not survive losing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be here long enough to allow that to happen,\u201d Abram stated savagely. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t taken her yet because I\u2019ve wanted her to have the chance to acclimate to both of us. This isn\u2019t a life she\u2019s used to, nor is it one her innocence will have prepared her for.\u201d</p><p>It was technically the truth, Abram told himself furiously.</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe her feelings are transferrable?\u201d Tariq grunted sarcastically. \u201cShe will accept me as a third, Abram, but this is all I will ever be to her. If you attempt to chance that, then you\u2019ll lose her. And I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s really what you want.\u201d</p><p>But was her heart, the knowledge, the acceptance of her feelings, something he could face?</p><p>Abram almost felt his hands shaking at the thought of it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a third, Abram, or do you want to be the third?\u201d</p><p>Abram narrowed his eyes, restrained his anger.</p><p>The question had a surge of powerful, forceful adrenaline racing through him. Never in his life had he allowed himself to play the third. He wasn\u2019t beginning now.</p><p>\u201cI am no third,\u201d he growled in a flash of dominance.</p><p>Tariq chuckled at the exclamation.</p><p>\u201cThen you should seduce your love, Abram. Prepare her yourself for the third you have chosen. Otherwise you may find yourself missing the opportunity to create that bond that will secure her heart to yours, rather than leaving it drifting and wild and searching for a home.\u201d</p><p>Secure her heart to his? Abram rubbed at the back of his neck, his teeth clenching at the thought of everything that could go wrong in his attempt to get them out of the fortress and to the extraction point on time.</p><p>The transport wouldn\u2019t be able to wait on them for long. The terrorist activity in the area made the extraction itself highly dangerous.</p><p>\u201cNo risk, no gain, my friend.\u201d Tariq grinned as Abram shot him a hard glance.</p><p>The risk was high enough to scare the shit out of him if he allowed himself to think about it.</p><p>\u201cAre you two finished bonding in there yet?\u201d Paige\u2019s voice came through the connecting door. \u201cOr do you need a few more minutes?\u201d</p><p>Immediately arousal turned to full, flaming lust. It swept through his body like a tidal wave and sent fingers of electric energy sizzling through his brain.</p><p>Seduce his woman? God help him, he would be lucky if he found the control to undress first. How much easier it would be to push the thobe to her waist, his trousers below his hips, and take her with all the impatience and driving need torturing him.</p><p>He\u2019d stayed away from her for three days, he\u2019d fought like hell to find the CIA asset able to locate and set up the extraction team. He had to get her the hell out of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>\u201cSee if you can find our contact tonight then,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI want extraction ASAP, Tariq. If I have to wait much longer, I\u2019m contacting Khalid. Tell our mutual friends who pass along information that in twelve hours I contact the desert lion.\u201d</p><p>Khalid\u2019s nickname among the tribes in the outlying desert areas was cemented. He was known as a savage enemy, a fierce ally.</p><p>Tariq nodded sharply, his expression stilling, all frustration, arousal, or any hint of anger smoothing away.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re out, check the tunnel exit as well and ensure no one has found the cavern that leads to it. If Azir and Jafar are still searching for it, then they may get lucky. If they do, then we\u2019re all screwed.\u201d</p><p>Abram watched as the door at the other end of the room swung open to reveal Paige.</p><p>Her expression was coolly polite, her emerald gaze straightforward and revealing little of her emotions.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you two boys could play together later?\u201d she asked as she propped her hand on her hip and leaned against the door frame.</p><p>Abram\u2019s gaze narrowed on her slowly. She knew how such a display of dominance toward him would affect him.</p><p>His dick, already iron hard and fully engorged seemed to swell further and harden painfully.</p><p>He\u2019d stayed away from her as much as possible. Now, there would be no saving either of them from the hunger raging through him.</p><p>\u201cOf course we can, precious,\u201d he all but crooned as his gaze drifted over the thobe and he imagined the sweet perfection of her body underneath. \u201cIf you\u2019re offering to play in other ways, then I am of course available.\u201d</p><p>Her nostrils flared in irritation. \u201cWell of course you\u2019d be available for your idea of fun,\u201d she scoffed. If he wasn\u2019t mistaken there may have been a flash of hurt in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTonight, precious, I am at your disposal however you may wish me.\u201d He held his arms out at his side, a part of him cringing that she should be hurt by anything after what she had already suffered. She had suffered because he had been unable to rein in his interest in her enough to at least keep her safe.</p><p>Turning, he nodded to Tariq to begin the job he\u2019d given him before moving for the entrance to the other room and the woman that haunted his thoughts and his desires.</p><p>As he escorted her back into his suite he was aware of Tariq closing the door between them and allowing them privacy as he prepared to leave.</p><p>\u201cNow, what activities would please you within the confines of what I can provide you?\u201d</p><p>How he wished they were in the U.S. rather than here. She could dress in the sexy, flirty clothes he had seen her in before and he could take her to her favorite restaurant or perhaps a starlit dinner on one of the exclusive dinner yachts.</p><p>He could take her dancing or they could attend a play.</p><p>\u201cWithin the confines of what you can provide.\u201d She shook her head at the addendum. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t much, is it?\u201d</p><p>Her back was to him, hiding her expression, but the pensive regret in her tone was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t much,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut hopefully, this will be over soon. We\u2019ll go out then, Paige. I\u2019ll take you to a place where everyone will see the beauty that\u2019s on my arm.\u201d</p><p>A few more days at most. As soon as he or Tariq could locate the CIA asset they worked with in the area.</p><p>\u201cTariq told you Chalah was here today?\u201d She turned as she reached the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cYes, he told me,\u201d he muttered in disgust. \u201cI\u2019ll have to send him to talk to her i she doesn\u2019t leave soon. She needs to get the hell out of here while she still can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost betrayed us all, Abram,\u201d she whispered, her expression reflecting the fear he knew was brewing inside her.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd if you had, Paige, no one could blame you. We\u2019ve all trusted her. Even I never suspected Jafar would go to such lengths to attain whatever it is he\u2019s after.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you trust her?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>Paige watched his expression carefully, a part of her not even certain if she had truly trusted Chalah even before she saw the audio device.</p><p>\u201cI trust no one with your safety or with your life, Paige,\u201d he told her, his expression thoughtful, intent. \u201cThere have been moments in the past few days that I\u2019ve even questioned my trust in Tariq.\u201d</p> <p>He moved to her, his much larger body dwarfing her as he stopped in front of her.</p><p>Her breath nearly stopped as he reached out, his fingers catching a curl that had fallen over her shoulder.</p><p>It was the only way he was touching her, his figure rubbing the soft strands slowly.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Paige,\u201d he stated softly, sending her blood pressure skyrocketing, pounding off the charts with the somber heat in his voice and in his face.</p><p>\u201cYou could have fooled me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even been here, Abram.\u201d</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t liked admitting she had been frightened while he had been gone. That a part of her had been certain Azir would come for her while Abram was gone. That he would find a way to hurt her, to perhaps kill her.</p><p>She knew if he could do it, he would find great pleasure in it. She had seen it in his face, in his eyes, the day he had backhanded her across the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to get you out of here first, Paige,\u201d He sighed as he laid the strands of hair neatly against her breast before he stroked the backs of her fingers along the curve of her breast.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think I can wait much longer to have you. I don\u2019t think I can sleep next to you one more night without touching you, without tasting you.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing tightly she fought to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve managed the past three nights.\u201d A frown jumped between her brows at the need, the sexual hunger in his voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d</p> <p>His lips twitched with an edge of amusement.</p><p>\u201cMy misbegotten attempt, as I said, to have you comfortable in your forced surroundings.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you, Abram. Do you know what I think?\u201d</p><p>His expression slowly tightened into one of dominant male lust.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cI think you have no intentions of being my lover, Abram. At the most, you intend to do no more than fuck me while we\u2019re here. And only then, if you simply can\u2019t resist any longer.\u201d</p><p>And exactly how right was she?</p><p>She watched his eyes narrow and glitter knowingly in his dark face. He knew she was right. She knew she was right.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t push this, Paige.\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice and the look in his eyes combined with the order sent a shaft of agony tearing through her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had me sleep between the two of you, naked, like a lover, with no intention of actually fucking me?\u201d Mocking amusement and bitter realization filled her. \u201cTell me, Abram, did you order Tariq not to fuck me as well?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed further. \u201cI do not order Tariq. As my third, that choice remained between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Shock had her drawing in her breath sharply. \u201cYou would have let him take me without you?\u201d Confusion filled her.</p><p>Paige knew enough about the lifestyle Khalid and his friends were a part of, and she assumed Abram shared the same rules. That didn\u2019t allow the third, unless it was a permanently agreed-upon relationship, to ever be intimate with the prime lover\u2019s woman without his presence.</p><p>\u201cThat would have been your choice.\u201d His expression was savagely tight now.</p><p>\u201cMy choice?\u201d She shook her head at his comment. \u201cAbram, do you think I don\u2019t know the world you live within when you\u2019re in Europe or in the U.S.? That I don\u2019t know the associates you and Khalid are closest to, and the rules they adhere to in terms of their private sexual tastes?\u201d</p><p>His gaze darkened in suspicion. \u201cWhat would you know about it, Paige?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that as though it\u2019s some deep dark secret that many of your friends and acquaintances share their ives with those who share their tastes.\u201d She stared back at him in disgust. \u201cDo you believe, Abram, truly, that no one but those who do it are aware of it? Do you think friends, brothers, and oh yeah\u2014\u201d Her eyes widened in false amazement. \u201cSisters, are not well aware of it? Do you take me for stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never imagined you were stupid.\u201d His voice was rougher now, containing that dark, black velvet roughness that almost mesmerized her senses.</p><p>It would have mesmerized her senses if not for the anger burning inside her.</p><p>\u201cThen what did you imagine?\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not smart enough to see what goes on around me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never imagined such a thing, Paige.\u201d Frustration filled his voice as he glared back at her. \u201cI simply do not imagine that it is within my right to limit your contact with a man I have brought to the bed with you.\u201d</p><p>Not limit her contact? Tariq was his third. The very idea of it implied, at the very least, a sense of possession in regards to a lover, if not a woman he had some feelings of depth for.</p><p>But evidently, that wasn\u2019t the way it was for him.</p><p>The pain of that realization, the realization that whatever was happening between them was only physical, that it was without emotion tore through her like a searing flame, burning through her heart.</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourselves!\u201d she hissed back at him as fury whipped through her along with the knowledge that he was showing no possessiveness, no dominance whatsoever in regards to either her body or her heart.</p><p>She slapped at his hands as they lifted to her, disgust and ragged emotions slamming a sense of pain through her senses.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me. Don\u2019t speak to me and don\u2019t either of you think you will ever sleep with me again,\u201d she cried out. \u201cThere\u2019s not a chance in hell I want you now.\u201d</p><p>She was dying for him. She was aching for him. She wanted to cry out at the knowledge that what she thought had been mutual desire had been something far different. Perhaps so different that it meant he hadn\u2019t wanted her at all.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you don\u2019t,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned right I don\u2019t,\u201d she cried out painfully. \u201cJust kiss my ass and get the hell away from me, Abram. Damn you. Damn you!\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t crying. There were no tears. The pain went far too deep, and hurt far too much for tears, yet.... instead of getting away from her, instead of leaving her in peace, Abram jerked her to him andpinned her in place against his chest.</p><p>\u201cKiss your ass?\u201d He snarled down at her. \u201cI\u2019ll do that and more.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>God, what she did to him. She thought he had no intention of talking to he</p><p>r? That he could sleep with her much longer without losing his mind?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fucking her that he had no intention of doing. It was loving her. And he could see in her eyes that she hadn\u2019t been merely talking about sex. She had said fuck, she had referred to sex, but she meant so much more.</p><p>Her heart was involved and she intended to involve his as well.</p><p>Holding her to him he turned his fingers into her hair, pulled her head back, and as he fought the grief he felt at the thought of never loving her, his lips covered hers.</p><p>Sweet heat, fiery feminine anger and passion overflowed from her lips. Her fingers curled into fists and pressed into his shoulders, stopping just the second before true rejection. She wasn\u2019t saying no, but the threat of it was there.</p><p>Give her a chance to consider the true reality of what he might very well intend and she would be screaming her rejection from the rooftops, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to blame her. Hell, he would agree with her.</p><p>He had no intention of giving her a chance.</p><p>As his lips covered hers, his tongue brushed the seam. He considered for less than a second the seduction he had actually considered each night he lay with her, her naked body curled into him.</p><p>He decided against it.</p><p>Dominance rose inside him. The need, the overwhelming hunger for her sexual submission rushed through him like a tidal wave of epic proportions.</p><p>Need beat at his brain. Control disintegrated. Only instinct remained. The instinct of a primal animal, determined to fully possess his woman on every physical level that could possibly exist.</p><p>He tugged at the strands of hair he tangled his fingers in. Just enough pressure to drag a moan from her lips and have her arching into his hold.</p><p>This was her acceptance of him and her acceptance of what she had to know was coming from him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t her lover, and easy had never been a part of him.</p><p>Sliding one hand from her back to her buttocks, his fingers curled around her firm, wounded globes as he lifted her off her petite feet, turned, and all but stumbled to the large bed at the far end of the room.</p><p>He paused only long enough to strip the hated throb from her body. If he never saw another of those hated garments shrouding the perfection of her body then it would be far too soon.</p><p>\u201cLay down,\u201d he growled as he stripped himself. The loose tunic and trousers came off, along with the even looser white underpants and the custom-made hiking boots he had worn.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move to obey him, rather she stared back at him defiantly, her breasts rising and falling quickly, tight, hard little nipples beckoning him.</p><p>\u201cYou lay down.\u201d Breathless, heat filling her voice along with the defiance. The sound of it had the head of his dick throbbing imperatively.</p><p>He almost allowed a smile to tug at his lips.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it works that way?\u201d he asked silkily. \u201cOh Paige, precious, it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d She was pushing at him, defying him and expecting to get away with it.</p><p>Turning his fingers in her hair, he pulled her head back and took the taste of her hunger with his lips again.</p><p>She tasted innocent. Her lips moved beneath his with just a hint of hesitancy, as though she hadn\u2019t kissed in a while. As though she had never been kissed by a man intent on drowning out her deepest hunger.</p><p>A hunger he would have, no matter the lengths he had to go to.</p><p>Jerking her against him until his cock pressed firmly into the flesh of her belly.</p><p>The heat of her body seared the sensitive head of his cock, drawing a pulse of precome from the bloated head.</p><p>Sinking his tongue past her lips to possess the sweet nectar of her hunger.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t submission she gave him. As his tongue pressed against the seam of her lips, they tightened, and pushing forward past their resistance he found her teeth locked tight to him.</p><p>Her fists were unclenched, her nails rasping against his shoulders like a little kitten kneading in pleasure.</p><p>Removing his hand from her hair he gripped her jaw instead, his thumb and two fingers pressing into the back of her jaw to force her teeth and lips to part.</p><p>A ragged little groan left her throat as his tongue forged inside to stroke against hers and to taste her need. It was there, the hunger and heat meeting his and flaming out of control.</p><p>Her nails pricked at his flesh as he arched her closer to him. The demand in his cock was beating through his body, thundering through his bloodstream.</p><p>Damn her. She nearly had his knees trembling from no more than her kiss. No more than her heated body arching, her stomach stroking against his dick.</p><p>Pumping his tongue into her mouth he nearly groaned as she suckled at it, hungry, sweet dreams of her heated mouth that had his cock jerking and throbbing from the engorged crest along the heavy thick shaft.</p><p>He wanted her mouth there. He wanted to stare down at her, watch her take him, watch her suck him, watch as her hot little tongue licked around it.</p><p>He pulled his head back, the breath rasping from his chest as he watched her eyes slowly flutter open.</p><p>Pleasure reflected in the brilliancy of her emerald eyes, the flushed features of her face. Her tongue peeked out to flutter against her lips, the sight of it drawing his balls tight with desire.</p><p>\u201cSuck my cock.\u201d The demand had her face flushing further and lust deepening in her gaze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stroked his hands up her shoulders, pressing against them to ease her to her knees, the demand imperative, the need clawing at his spine.</p><p>Not that she did as he expected. She didn\u2019t go immediately to her knees. She didn\u2019t suck his cock into the fiery furnace of her mouth.</p><p>Instead\u2014</p><p>She destroyed him.</p><p>She tore aside the fragile illusions of cynicism.</p><p>She used that ragged wound growing in his soul.</p><p>She broke him.</p><p>Then lick by sweet lick down his body she began to remake him.</p><p>Paige could barely breathe.</p><p>Heat raced within her chest furiously, nerves and desire, fear and excitement making her entire body tremble.</p><p>As his hands pressed against her shoulders her lips moved to his shoulders, her tongue tasted the salt and male flavor of his flesh.</p><p>Her hands moved down his sides as he caressed down her arms, back up, along her back. His head lowered, strong teeth nipping at her ear in retaliation.</p><p>Then she retaliated back. Her teeth scraped over his shoulder and she nipped hard, then lowered to the heavy muscle at his chest, then the male point of a nipple.</p><p>Abram jerked, groaning in surprise and in pleasure as her hot little tongue rakeer his nipple, and sent heat spinning through his senses.</p><p>Damn her, she made him want things, made him want things from her that he was certain weren\u2019t good for either of their emotional health.</p><p>\u201cMy emotional health is not inexhaustible,\u201d he groaned as her tongue licked and strolled down his chest to the tight, clenched muscles of his stomach.</p><p>The closer she got the harder his dick pulsed and swelled. The flesh was tight, so hard it was painful, so damned sensitive he swore he could feel the air around it.</p><p>Her nails scraped down his abs to his thighs as she kissed, licked, and nipped her way down until she was only inches from the heavy, engorged head.</p><p>And he was sure as hell doing his best to encourage her to lower, faster.</p><p>Damn if he wasn\u2019t ready to fucking explode from the need tearing through him.</p><p>Slender, graceful fingers curved around the side of the shaft, but there wasn\u2019t a chance of them fully encircling it. But she was touching it, and those pouty lips were coming closer by the second.</p><p>His fingers were buried in her hair again, clenched, and he grimaced as he felt her heated breath against the engorged, throbbing head of his dick.</p> <p>He watched, his gaze on her flushed features, closed eyes, and her pink little tongue as it suddenly licked over the darkly flushed head.</p><p>She licked and tasted, each stroke of her tongue like a lash of painful ecstasy. Once she got her lips around it and sucked him inside, he wouldn\u2019t last seconds.</p><p>Then her lips were there, slowly, so damned slowly, enveloping the head of his cock and sucking it into the tight, hot depths of her mouth.</p><p>He watched. Watched as her lips closed on him, as her tongue began to lick and rub against the underside of his dick as his fingers tugged at her hair, pulling and releasing as she moaned against the overly sensitive crest of his cock.</p><p>Holding onto his control was hell, not releasing the heavy tension invading his balls was becoming the most ecstatic torture he had ever known in his life.</p><p>Her tongue was lightning and rapture, her fingers silken heat as she began stroking the heavy shaft, her moans vibrating along the nerve-laden crest as he began thrusting slow and easy, fucking those sweet, pretty lips as he\u2019d only fantasized about for many years.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t going to survive this much longer. The tight suction of her mouth, her tongue lashing at it.</p><p>His hands tightened.</p><p>He could feel the perspiration easing down his temple as his control began to fray to the point that he could feel his balls tightening violently.</p><p>He was going to come.</p><p>Control be damned. He couldn\u2019t keep it together here. He wasn\u2019t going to last and he wanted to be buried inside her first. He had to be buried inside her before he lost his mind as he had the first time he had her naked body beneath him.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Her lashes lifted. Her eyes watered from taking him deep and she moaned again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come in that sweet mouth of yours.\u201d He breathed out roughly, his voice ragged. \u201cIs that what you want, precious? My come filing your hot little mouth?\u201d</p><p>She flushed deeper. She sucked his dick tighter and left him strung out on a rack of impending bliss.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty, precious,\u201d he crooned, watching her swollen lips draw on the heavy width of his dick.</p><p>Her mouth capped the swollen crest, worked around it and rubbed the overly sensitive underside with her hot little tongue.</p><p>She was destroying him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold on.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to let her go.</p><p>He wanted inside her. The full length of his cock sheltered in the sweet heat of her pussy.</p><p>His hips shifted, thrust, and moved against the swollen beauty of her lips.</p><p>His hands clasped her head and he forced himself to draw back. To drag the painfully swollen length of his cock away from the pleasure of her mouth.</p><p>Glistening, moist from her mouth and so damned hard he was dying. Then he lifted her from her knees and laid her back easily on the bed.</p><p>Then she shocked him. She had him stilling, his mouth watering, every nerve ending in his body heating in fiery response.</p><p>She laid back against the pillows, slender legs parted as her fingers slid into the moist heat of her saturated pussy.</p><p>Slender fingertips moved through the wet folds as she stroked and circled the swollen bud of her clit.</p><p>Dazed, mesmerized, she stared back at him, stroked her pussy, and whispered a broken moan.</p><p>He moved. Quickly, firmly, he gripped her wrist and pulled her fingers from the flesh he was going to own. Every kiss, every touch, every sweet erotic moan.</p><p>\u201cIt was feeling good,\u201d she whispered hoarsely, her fingers curling against his hand. \u201cAren\u2019t you curious how I please myself? How I fantasize and whisper your name when I come?\u201d</p><p>Seeing it would have him coming to the air alone, and that he wasn\u2019t doing.</p><p>Taking her other wrist he placed both on the pillow above her head with a determined look.</p><p>\u201cLeave them there,\u201d he warned her. \u201cDon\u2019t move them.\u201d</p><p>Her hot little tongue flicked over her lips as he shoved his knee between her thighs as he moved over her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to kiss her lips, he\u2019d intended to go straight to her pussy to lick at the sweet, heated warmth spilling from it.</p><p>But those sweet lips beckoned, they drew him.</p><p>His tongue pumped into her mouth, stroked and devoured her as he came over her, spreading her thighs to create the sweetest embrace he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Her legs lifted, knees bending as her feet pressed into the mattress, her knees gripping his thighs.</p><p>Thick and heavy, his cock slid against the slick wet folds of her pussy. Engorged, aching with a hunger tearing him apart.</p><p>His lips slid from hers, ran down the silk of her neck to the rise of firm, sweet breasts and tight hard nipples.</p><p>He had to taste her nipples. Candy pink and hard and sweet as hell. He curled his tongue around one and let his hunger have its way.</p><p>Paige was drowning. She could feel herself drowning in pleasure so incredible she couldn\u2019t find the strength to even attempt to resist even a second of it.</p><p>He\u2019d warned her to keep her hands at the pillow, but she had to touch him, she had to hold onto him.</p><p>Her head was spinning like a top, pleasure whipping through her system like a fire burning out of control.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his hair as his lips drew the sensitized flesh into his mouth.</p><p>Sucking, drawing on it, his tongue licking, his teeth scraping. Flares of sensation whipped and raced through her entire body. Arching into it she was desperate to get closer.</p><p>She wanted to hold onto him forever. She just wanted to stay here in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI waited,\u201d she whispered, dazed, so much pleasure. \u201cI waited so long, Abram.\u201d</p><p>So many years and so many dreams of his touch.</p><p>\u201cGod, Paige, sweetheart.\u201d Lifting his head he stared down at her, his legs pressing hers farther apart as he lifted, his knees digging into the bed, the head of his cock nestling into the satiny soft folds of her pussy.</p><p>The clenched entrance flared around the tip of his cock as he pressed forward, his eyes locked with the drowsy heat of hers and he began to work the stiff flesh into the heated grip of her pussy.</p><p>Paige was caught by the midnight of his eyes. She was caught by the pleasure-pain piercing and stretching her sex.</p><p>Her thighs trembled, her back arching, neck stretched back as her nails dug into his shoulders, her knees lifting, gripping his hips and opening herself to him.</p><p>\u201cThere, baby,\u201d he groaned, his fingers gripping her hips, his gaze still locked with hers.</p><p>\u201cHold onto me, baby,\u201d he groaned as she watched his expression tighten, watched his eyes flare.</p><p>That heat was burning through her. Like flames licking over her flesh, ripping through her senses. The thick width of his cock pressed in, stretched her and sent desperate aching need shattering through her as she arched, bucking against him, fighting to drive him deeper.</p><p>His fingers tightened on her hips, his hips keeping a steady, heated rhythm. He didn\u2019t speed up, he didn\u2019t go any slower. Keeping his gaze on her, he continued to work deeper into flesh rarely used.</p><p>Her head twisted on the pillows, dug into them, and with desperate whimpers she begged for more. She wanted to cry out, she wanted to scream for more, but oh God, she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she gasped, her nails digging into his shoulders, gripping as the muscles of her cunt rippled and sucked in tight hard spasms as the head of his cock lodged inside her. Working against the resistant muscles, the heavy flesh throbbing, burning inside her.</p><p>She needed more.</p><p>\u201cAbram, please,\u201d she moaned. \u201cOh God! Fuck me. Please, Abram.\u201d</p><p>His hips jerked, burying him deeper.</p><p>Paige lifted her knees, her legs wrapping around his hips as she ground her pussy upward, gasping with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, precious,\u201d he groaned. \u201cFuck that sweet pussy up to me. Give it to me, baby. Work on my cock.\u201d His lips moved to her neck, biting kisses, strokes of his tongue licking over her as he began to move deeper inside her.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, her pleasure echoing in the low cry that left her lips. \u201cDeeper, Abram.\u201d</p><p>She lifted closer, her legs tightening around his hips. \u201cFuck me deeper.\u201d</p><p>His hips jerked against her, driving his cock deeper, harder inside her.</p><p>She was shaking, shuddering in his grip, but he was shuddering too. She could feel him. His face buried in her neck, his lips moving against the sensitive flesh, his hips moving harder now, pushing his cock deeper inside her.</p><p>The pleasure began to whip through her. Sensation upon sensation as she writhed beneath him, her legs tightening around his hips, her arms clasping his neck.</p><p>\u201cTake me, Paige.\u201d He nipped at her shoulders. \u201cTake all of me, precious.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have so much as a second\u2019s warning. She\u2019d barely drawn in a tremulous breath when his hips bunched, gathering strength, then in one stroke he buried the full length inside her.</p><p>The heavy breadth of his cock forced its way inside her. Every hard inch stroking to her furthest depth and deeper. Pleasure and pain became rocketing fire as he began to move. He didn\u2019t pause, he didn\u2019t give her a chance to catch her breath or to prepare for the sensations tearing across her body, throwing her into a maelstrom of pure bliss. She wanted to scream it was so good, but she couldn\u2019t scream. Instinct kept the desperation bottled inside, silent, or nearly silent.</p><p>She had to bite her lip. She bit his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAh fuck!\u201d Her teeth at his shoulder did something. It triggered a reaction. It set loose a primal, sensual creature she could have never expected. A wild, primitive, erotic lover that hijacked her senses.</p><p>His hips twisted and surged, shafted inside her and fucked her with driving, forceful strokes. Each rasp of his cock thrusting through her pussy, pushing her to a limit she hadn\u2019t known existed. Pushing her toward an ecstasy so fiery she was lost in it, begging for more, dying with each stroke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Each heavy thrust parting and delving, stretching and burning. She bit into his shoulder harder, fighting the cries welling inside her, fighting to hold back.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she moaned. 01C;No. Please, Abram. Don\u2019t...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI want to scream,\u201d she whimpered. He growled. His lips covered hers, his tongue delved inside. He trapped the sound. He thrust harder, his cock stroking deeper, fucking her, possessing her, owning her as he never had before.</p><p>In that second she felt the sensations rushing, surging. Silent screams were ricocheting through her head and through her soul.</p> <p>She was coming with a force. She didn\u2019t know if she could survive. Exploding around the thick wedge of his cock as it began to throb violently. He groaned into the kiss and began coming inside her. Heated, deep spurts of his semen pulsing, surging inside the spasming flesh of her pussy.</p><p>Groaning into the kiss that held back her screams, his arms holding her to him, possessively, desperately.</p><p>And for the first time in her life she swore she belonged.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he knew what belonging meant.</p><p>And it terrified them both.</p> <p>11</p><p>\u201cMove! It\u2019s time to go!\u201d Abram hissed at her ear, a sense of</p><p>danger filling his voice and awakening her with a surge of fear-laced adrenaline.</p><p>Paige\u2019s eyes came open, staring up in confusion at him, his hand capped over her lips to cover any sound she may have made, born of fear or surprise.</p><p>Staring up at him she saw the icy features of his face, the cold, murderous rage glittering in his black eyes and she knew something, somehow, had just gone to hell.</p><p>\u201cClothes.\u201d He lifted his hand and with the other pressed clothing into her hands. \u201cShoes.\u201d They felt like hiking boots and they were shoved into her other hand. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p> <p>Gripping her wrist as he jerked the blankets back, exposing the warmth of her naked flesh to the chill air outside the covering, he pulled her from the bed.</p><p>Coming to her feet she was surprised to find soft, wool trousers, a heavy, short tunic, socks, and definitely hiking boots. She dressed quickly, her gaze trying to pierce the darkness as she caught Abram\u2019s shadow moving close to her as he dressed as well.</p><p>\u201cExtraction will be in place,\u201d Tariq hissed through the darkness. \u201cThere are horses waiting in the caverns, but we\u2019re going to be cutting it close. Azir is with the Matawa now, and they\u2019re itching to get in here.\u201d</p><p>The Matawa, the feared religious police who enforced the strict Islamic law on all matters from courtship to dress and marital intercourse.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they here?\u201d Jerking her socks on she tried to keep the fear from her voice as she hurriedly finished dressing. \u201cFor us,\u201d Tariq snarled in a sibilant whisper. \u201cAzir called them in. They\u2019ll hold you, me, and Abram until he makes the vow to the emissary, and once the emissary is finished they\u2019ll secure Abram for punishment of the crimes of sexual deviance and intent to abdicate a vow given to the monarchy, which is the same as treason. Until then, you will be held in the cells below the castle until the vow is given to give you time to contemplate your sins before you\u2019re stoned to death.\u201d Disgust rang in his voice as she laced the boots then rose to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Jacket, gloves, and a hat. \u201cThe temperature\u2019s dropped significantly. We have to hurry; they\u2019ll be here within minutes.\u201d</p><p>There was a sound of stone scraping against stone, and seconds later Abram gripped her hand and rushed her into a darkness even more overwhelming than that of the bedroom they had been in.</p><p>As he and Tariq wrestled whatever door was used back into place securely, the click of the lock reengaging, they all froze at the sound of heavy pounding at the bedroom door.</p> <p>\u201cYou will open this door. Abram el Hamid Mustafa. Tariq bin Sa\u2019id Mustafa. Paige Eleanora Galbraithe, you are hereby under arrest for the crimes of sexual deviancy and conspiracy to commit treason against the Saudi Arabian empire.\u201d</p><p>Paige reached out, her fingers clenched on Abram\u2019s arm at the sound of the rough, cruel tone and the charges being leveled against them.</p><p>The voices turned lower, the words muffled by the wood and stone barriers, only barely reaching her ears as adrenaline began to surge through her.</p><p>Why were they just standing there?</p><p>Her fingers clenched tighter on his arm, the need to run overwhelming her now. Each of those charges were punishable by stoning for a woman, though only the charge of treason held such a punishment for Abram and Tariq.</p><p>She could feel him against her, the tension in his body mounting as he extricated his arm from her grip only to wrap it around her shoulders and pull her to him.</p><p>The pounding came again.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d Abram began counting off. \u201cTwo.\u201d As he spoke he turned her toward the back of whatever cave, cavern, or room they were hidden within.</p><p>A second later the loud, raucous sounds of a heavy metal band began to scream through the room.</p><p>Paige jumped, only barely managing to hold back a cry of surprise at the shrill music. In the same d, Abram\u2019s arms tightened around her and they were rushing headlong into a darkness barely lit by the penlight Tariq held out before him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Abram snarled as they began to run through the stone corridor that she was certain had to run on forever.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell happened,\u201d Tariq hissed back. \u201cI was with our contact arranging extraction when he got the call that the Matawa were moving in on the fortress to arrest the three of us, and that Jafar couldn\u2019t be found. Azir contacted them from what our contact, Yassir, learned and he rushed me back to the cave entrance. From what we were being told as we ran for the caverns, Azir called them in and informed them of the charges. He\u2019s also having an \u2018arrest on sight\u2019 order placed against Khalid, Paige\u2019s mother, and her father if they enter Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s a fucking mess, and I still haven\u2019t figured out how Azir arranged it.\u201d</p><p>Azir, Abram\u2019s father. He had found another way to betray his son.</p><p>\u201cHe has minor influence with the Matawa,\u201d Abram growled. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to keep the order in force only until the authorities in Riyadh hear of it and bring it before the king. But until then, they can do exactly that; kill on sight.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even sound breathless or tired and Paige knew her legs would have already given out on her.</p><p>She tried to draw enough air into her lungs to keep from collapsing, her heart racing hard and fierce as Abram all but carried her at a dead run.</p><p>\u201cDid you complete the extraction plan?\u201d Abram\u2019s voice was lifeless, all emotion stripped from it now.</p><p>\u201cExtraction was all but complete when the call came in. Yassir managed to call in emergency extraction at that point,\u201d Tariq informed him. \u201cWe have three hours to reach the pickup point in the mountains. If we\u2019re not there, then they leave without us. I talked to the commander of the rangers myself and he intends to make damned certain nothing stands in the way of that information getting into their hands, but he\u2019s not willing to watch his men die to get it. Did you get the files?\u201d</p><p>Had any of them had time to get anything?</p><p>\u201cOn my back,\u201d Abram bit out. \u201cMy pack holds everything we\u2019ve gathered over the past year. Don\u2019t worry; extraction won\u2019t leave without us, Tariq. They need this too damned much and they know it.\u201d</p><p>He had made certain he wouldn\u2019t become a casualty to politics or indifference in the plans made to pull him and Tariq, and now Paige as well, out of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>\u201cJafar had Chalah driven to the desert airstrip where a private Learjet made a quick stop and picked her up before heading out again, earlier9;t worry;ening. That\u2019s where we suspect he is, on his way back from the airstrip,\u201d Tariq reported, as Paige swore there was no end to the tunnel.</p><p>\u201cAt least she\u2019s out of here,\u201d Abram bit out roughly. \u201cHaving my friends endangered in this war Azir has been waging against us is going to get him killed.\u201d</p><p>And she could hear the certainty in Abram\u2019s voice that he would be the one to kill his father.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to know is why the hell Jafar was so damned intent on getting her out of here tonight,\u201d Tariq questioned, his voice harsh.</p><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he kept her here, as Azir has been pushing him to do?\u201d Abram asked in return. \u201cGod only knows what either of them have planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are horses waiting in the cavern, and we should arrive at the extraction location just in time if we\u2019re damned lucky,\u201d Tariq stated as they rounded yet another curve in the tunnel.</p><p>\u201cIs there any way they can find the hidden door in Abram\u2019s room?\u201d Paige whispered as the fear clenched her stomach and trembled in her voice at the thought of being followed.</p><p>\u201cAzir has searched that room and every other room in the castle for the doors to the tunnels he\u2019s already closed in. He still hasn\u2019t found some of those. Many of the tunnels veer off in several different directions with the ones leading to more strategically located rooms accessed by more than one hidden stone door and tunnel, like a damned underground maze with no map,\u201d Abram told her. \u201cThis particular corridor empties into an old mine. It\u2019s easily millennia old and the exit is no more than a narrow slit in a wall surrounded by fallen boulders. If it were going to be found, Azir would have done so by now.\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t slowed. Both men kept a steady pace that never slackened, one Paige couldn\u2019t have had a hope of keeping up with if it weren\u2019t for Abram\u2019s arm locked around her waist.</p><p>Still, she was breathless, tired, and fighting to keep up just enough to keep him from having to slow his pace. She felt helpless, weak, and unable to fight enough to even participate in her own escape.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Azir turn you into the Matawa?\u201d She gasped as she struggled to help Abram keep her on her feet. \u201cWhat was the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell if I know,\u201d Abram growled. \u201cIt\u2019s at least two more weeks before the emissary is due to arrive and Azir has to have me there to give that vow, not under arrest, awaiting death, or dead. It served no purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would have held Paige and me until you gave your vow, then saw to our deaths once you gave it,\u201d Tariq stated, his voice heated and rough as he led the way through the corridor. \u201cHe\u2019ll nt risk allowing you even a single ally if he can keep you here.</p><p>\u201cPaige is an American citizen whose family is more than aware of where she is,\u201d Abram growled. \u201cHe knows he can\u2019t get away with that, just as he knows I would find a way to contact the American consulate, the Saudi royal offices, and any journalist willing to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd accidents happen in jails all the time, especially the detention cells the Matawa keep. When they did release her, Abram, you know the shape she would be in.\u201d</p><p>Paige didn\u2019t want to imagine the shape she would be in. She\u2019d heard enough about the Saudi prisons from Khalid as he recounted the horrors friends of his had suffered when being held by the Matawa.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like my idea of a favored vacation activity,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling as she thought she felt a breeze and detected a touch of fresh air ahead.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you need to talk to your travel agent about that, baby,\u201d Abram assured her somberly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe demand a refund,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Yes, that was definitely fresh air.</p><p>Thank God. She hadn\u2019t known if she could stand it much longer in that enclosed corridor with its dark, dank air and sense of forced enclosure.</p><p>The narrow slit of the opening in the cavern wall deposited them first onto a shallow pile of boulders that reached toward the roof of the rock ceiling overhead.</p><p>As though they had been tossed randomly at the wall and bounced to the floor around it. Still gripping her wrist, Abram pulled her through the brief stone maze into the main room of the large cave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The nicker of a horse had her eyes turning to the exit and the group of men and horses awaiting them.</p><p>Three of the riders instantly jumped from their mounts, holding their reins loosely as an older rider dismounted and waved them toward the horses.</p><p>\u201cMy nephew sent the message that Azir\u2019s guards and the Matawa are preparing to leave the castle.\u201d The rider moved quickly to Abram, handed over a rifle and a handgun holstered on belted leather.</p> <p>Looping the belt around his neck and under his arm, Abram grabbed the rifle and looped it over the pommel of the saddle before turning and quickly gripping Paige\u2019s hips to help her onto the horse standing next to his.</p><p>\u201cDo they have a direction they suspect we\u2019re riding to?\u201d Abram asked quickly as Paige took the reins he pushed quickly to her.</p><p>\u201cTo the mountains.\u201d The rider spat to the ground after speaking. \u201cRide hard and beat them there, but they may still get there before extraction.\u201d</p><p>He was American. The sound of the Texas accent surprised her.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d he called out as Abram kicked his heels into the horse\u2019s flanks and they galloped from the cavern into the crisp, clear predawn night.</p> <p>The thunder of horses\u2019 hooves echoed around her, drowning out the sound of her heart raving in her chest.</p><p>Abram took the lead and Tariq rode at the rear, keeping Paige between them. If it hadn\u2019t been for her they wouldn\u2019t have to run like this and the Matawa wouldn\u2019t be chasing them with such charges.</p><p>Of course, if Azir hadn\u2019t kidnapped her, none of this would have happened either.</p><p>\u201cYassir is positioning his men to track Azir\u2019s head hunters.\u201d Tariq called into the communication headset he wore. \u201cHe\u2019ll let us know if they head our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll head our way,\u201d Abram assured him. \u201cThere are only a few usable locations for extraction and they aren\u2019t that far apart.\u201d</p><p>They could pray and fight to get there first, but other than that it was out of their control, and that terrified her.</p> <p>The lack of control in both her emotions and responses to Abram when it came to her safety was terrifying. She had been an independent woman with a job, a future, and the ability to make decisions for herself. To risk death over such an idea was a nightmare to her.</p><p>Just as the furious race through the night would become, she was certain.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re heading this way, Abram,\u201d Tariq announced as they neared the base of the mountains that rose before them. \u201cYassir received confirmation from his spy among Azir\u2019s guards. The Matawa commander received a call and they\u2019ve changed direction.\u201d</p><p>Abram suddenly veered toward the more shadowed edge of the trail, his curse searing the night.</p><p>\u201cThey have watches.\u201d Tariq snapped. \u201cPossibly snipers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzir doesn\u2019t have any snipers and I doubt the Matawa do. But Jafar would have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould he give the order to fire?\u201d Paige\u2019s voice trembled, not as much in fear this time, but in rage.</p><p>If she survived this then she would kill Jafar herself.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d They were forced to slow the horses to a hard trot rather than a gallop.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take the next turn to the longer trail up the mountains,\u201d Abram told them. \u201cAnd this, boys and girls, is what sucks about these mountains. We have no trails for the mountain wheels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t need them if we didn\u2019t have to deal with the assholes in our family,\u201d Tariq grunted.</p><p>\u201cLucked out there, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Abram agreed as he turned his horse to another trail.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it luck.\u201d Paige interjected, a morbid sense of black humor overtaking her. \u201cI think you managed to get on God\u2019s bad side that week, boys.\u201d</p><p>Silence met her observation for a second before Tariq gave a mocking chuckle echoed by Abram.</p><p>\u201cWe manage to stay on someone\u2019s bad side all the time,\u201d Abram agreed. \u201cIt only began there.\u201d</p><p>It was a brief sense of lightness in the tension that grew from the battle just to stay alive. They moved farther up the face of the mountain along a curve that placed the jagged, sharp peaks of the huge boulders between them and their previous position.</p><p>Abram was trying to block any sight of a sniper\u2019s rifle, Paige thought.</p><p>\u201cJafar has joined them,\u201d Tariq announced, his voice suddenly heavy. \u201cHe\u2019s moving along a trail that will catch up with us before the Matawa and Azir\u2019s soldiers. He\u2019s riding in with a dozen men.\u201d</p><p>Abram picked up the pace despite the danger to the horses and to them.</p><p>\u201cExtraction ETA is coming up,\u201d Tariq assured him. \u201cWe\u2019ll be cutting it close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily want to simply cut it close,\u201d Abram growled.</p><p>Damn, this was going to hell in a handbasket, he thought, just as Azir had planned. This had been what he was working for all along. Not necessarily Abram\u2019s escape, but definitely ensuring that both Tariq and Paige were made aware that Azir held his fate in the palm of his hand.</p><p>He would kill himself first, Abram decided. And he would be damned if he left that land for Jafar to take over with his terrorists. He had recourse if he was forced to make that vow. Azir and Jafar would find out just how far he was willing to go to ensure they were destroyed if Paige and Tariq didn\u2019t make it out of here alive tonight.</p><p>\u201cYassir has made contactxtraction,\u201d Tariq reported. \u201cTheir ETA is on time and they\u2019re moving into the area. They\u2019re coming in opposite the Matawa but Jafar\u2019s men will have a view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to proceed, lights black, night sensor engaged,\u201d Abram ordered. \u201cWe\u2019re the smallest team on the mountain and we\u2019re starting to get nervous.\u201d</p><p>Tariq relayed the information as Abram glanced back at Paige, her face so pale it was easily seen in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it,\u201d he promised her, even as he prayed he could keep that promise.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming up on the clearing,\u201d Tariq stated. \u201cYassir has lost sight of Jafar and his men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re close then, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Paige guessed, her gaze tracking the darkness as the first, weak rays of dawn began moving in.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling they\u2019ve been close from the beginning,\u201d Abram stated as he watched the shadows closely.</p><p>Dawn wasn\u2019t far away. Extraction should arrive within minutes of the gathering legate, revealing the presence.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Tariq stated quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re almost home free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. Is that not your American saying?\u201d Jafar stepped from the shadows as Abram brought his horse slowly to a stop.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Jafar,\u201d Abram warned him. \u201cLook at it this way, with me gone, you can control the province.\u201d</p><p>Jafar hooked his fingers in the leather belt he wore over his tunic and watched Abram carefully.</p><p>\u201cAh yes, a perfect plan but for the fact that within two weeks the province reverts back to the regime if you are unable, or unwilling, to accept control of it. And you cannot appoint a successor for at least ten years in the event you have children.\u201d</p><p>Abram leaned his arms on the pommel of the saddle and regarded his cousin assessingly.</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut perhaps you could have ensured the vow was made at the very least if you and Azir had not dragged the Matawa into this.\u201d</p><p>Jafar grimaced. \u201cThat was not a decision I made but one Azir jumped into when he learned Pavlos and Marilyn Galbraithe were preparing to travel to the American embassy in Riyadh to protest the kidnapping of their only child, Paige Galbraithe. And I do believe our king himself must have been threatening repercussions against Azir despite the Matawa\u2019s protestations of your sexual deviancy.\u201d</p><p>Abram dismounted slowly, the knowledge that they weren\u2019t going to escape unless he managed to diffuse Jafar uppermost in his mind.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to leave Saudi Arabia without shedding blood; he especially hadn\u2019t wanted to shed Jafar\u2019s blood.</p><p>It didn\u2019t look like he was going to be able to get out of it.</p><p>He looked around at the men materializing behind their leader.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve wanted to know if you could beat me for years now, Jafar,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis I have.\u201d Jafar nodded with a pleasant smile. \u201cAnd always you have denied me this opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them go.\u201d Abram nodded to Paige and Tariq, ignoring their sudden protests. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll give you the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, Abram?\u201d Paige whispered desperately. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>He kept his gaze on Jafar\u2019s thoughtful face.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this a benefit?\u201d Jafar drawled. \u201cYour escape simply for the pleasure of the fight? This will bring me little comfort when the land of my father is taken by the king and we are asked to leave.\u201d</p><p>Abram nodded slowly. \u201cI see your point. Let\u2019s make it worth both our time and blood then. You let Paige and Tariq go either way. If you can beat me until I cannot stand then I\u2019ll stay, take the vow, and give you the ten years to ensure your possessions.\u201d</p><p>Jafar\u2019s brows raised in surprise. \u201cAnd if you can beat me to the point I cannot lift myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you ensure my escape when the extraction team arrives. Even against Azir and the Matawa.\u201d</p><p>A smile touched Jafar\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cAbram, please,\u201d Paige whispered behind him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your woman not have faith in your ability to win?\u201d Jafar laughed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have faith in your ability not to cheat!\u201d Paige shot back.</p><p>Abram winced at the savagery in her voice as she spoke, and at the insult she delivered to Jafar.</p><p>\u201cStrangely, neither do I.\u201d Jafar laughed as stared back at Abram. \u201cAre you willing to risk this?\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>Abram couldn\u2019t say that he had ever felt another person\u2019s pain or fear until now. His flesh</p><p>prickled with a deepening, dark sensation as he felt Paige\u2019s grip tighten. Her breathing was louder than before, the anger that had been brewing inside her was building.</p><p>If she\u2019d had a gun Abram feared she would have planted a bullet in Jafar\u2019s head the moment he revealed himself. Her hatred of him was becoming absolute.</p><p>\u201cA trade then?\u201d Jafar chuckled. \u201cAre there any rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s keep it interesting,\u201d Abram suggested, almost looking forward to the coming fight. \u201cFists, elbows, or knees only. Just as we did when we were boys.\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t fought since they\u2019d reached adulthood. The battles that they faced in their lives had made their familial grievances seem petty in comparison.</p><p>Jafar stepped forward, his thumbs hooking into the belt loops around his lean hips as Abram shed the coat he wore.</p><p>Before leaving the fortress he\u2019d dressed in jeans, a thermal undershirt, denim overshirt, and leather hiking boots. He was not just prepared for the cold desert night, but marginally protected as well.</p><p>The clothes were well worn and comfortable, soft and relaxed.</p><p>Jafar paused and stared at the clothing almost longingly before giving a little sigh and stretching his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAbram, you are mad,\u201d Tariq hissed. \u201cHe always beat both our asses when we were boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not boys any longer.\u201d Abram gave a tight, anticipatory smile as he stepped away from one cousin to face the other man. \u201cAnd I have a reason to win.\u201d</p><p>There was no posturing and no preliminaries. They went right at each other, fists flying, snarls erupting from their lips and pure male testosterone fueling each punch.</p><p>He had been needing this. A chance to beat some fucking sense back into his cousin since the day he\u2019d realized Jafar was fighting alongside Ayid and Aman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he snarled as Jafar managed to deliver an iron-hard fist to his jaw.</p><p>\u201cFor shame, cousin, such language,\u201d Jafar chided him as he jumped back to avoid Abram\u2019s answering blow. \u201cI have told you, such disregard of decency will only bring you to a sad end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat or my damned family,\u201d Abram retorted with a tight grin. \u201cTell me, Jafar, when did you stop dreaming of freedom and begin to dream of controlling lives instead?\u201d</p> <p>Jafar paused, his eyes narrowing in affront. His nostrils flared as something akin to an insane rage seemed to glow in the odd, celadon green of his eyes. That rage was the distraction Abram had awaited.</p><p>He took the advantage and slammed his fist into Jafar\u2019s jaw and followed it with a quick, striking knee blow to the groin.</p><p>Jafar\u2019s eyes widened in agony as he inhaled roughly. A tight whistling sound spewed from his lungs as Abram caught his shoulders and slammed his knee into his cousin\u2019s diaphragm. He followed that quickly with a hard right to his face, slamming a blow into his jaw, and throwing him backward to be caught by one of his men. The older, bearded fighter gave a wicked grin and threw his commander back into the fray.</p><p>Abram didn\u2019t have the time or ability to draw this little battle out. He could hear the low hum of the helicopter moving in stealth mode, much closer than he had anticipated. Within minutes the extraction team would be in place and ready to collect them.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let up. He had managed to gain the advantage, something he had never accomplished as a boy and assumed he would never accomplish as an adult. With fists, feet, and another knee to both the groin and to the stomach, Abram dropped his cousin to the dirt with a savage snarl of triumph.</p> <p>\u201cI win,\u201d he rasped, his voice sounding ragged and torn as he stared down at Jafar. \u201cThis time it mattered more than my father\u2019s pride.\u201d</p><p>Jafar stared at him, his breathing harsh and labored, his face bloodied, his odd green gaze strangely amused despite the pain that filled it.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, cousin,\u201d Jafar warned, his voice low. \u201cTo allow a woman to be such a weakness\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something flashed in Jafar\u2019s eyes, something bitter and filled with wild rage as he cut the words off.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Jafar. Without it, you become the monster you are beginning to face in the mirror each day,\u201d Abram said before turning and moving toward where Paige and Tariq waited.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a second\u2019s warning. Tariq\u2019s eyes widened, Paige cried out in fear, and the feel of cold steel against his neck stopped him in his tracks.</p> <p>Abram froze, regret for his cousin welling in his chest as much as for himself. \u201cYou used to be a man of your word, cousin. \u201cAnd unfortunately, of all things Abram had expected Jafar to remember, it had been the honor of his given word.</p><p>\u201cI used to be many things, cousin,\u201d Jafar said softly. \u201cMany hard lessons have taught me the error of my ways.\u201d The blade scraped against Abram\u2019s jugular as he allowed his gaze to meet Paige\u2019s.</p><p>Terror filled the emerald depths as her tears washed over her cheeks. Tariq stood behind her, forcibly restraining her from crossing the distance.</p><p>She would have run to him, he realized in bemusement. Even knowing there was nothing she could do, and that there was a high chance she could have been harmed, still, she would have run to him.</p><p>\u201cJafar, please, don\u2019t do this,\u201d she cried out in horror. Abram felt the knife begin to bite into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go back,\u201d Abram warned him softly, knowing the game his cousin was playing. \u201cI can\u2019t go back, Jafar. You know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReturn or die,\u201d Jafar snarled. \u201cI cannot afford to allow you to leave at this time, Abram. You know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no choice. Accept it,\u201d Abram answered quietly. \u201cI won\u2019t go back, Jafar, and I won\u2019t give that vow. You and Azir have lost this game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll put the blade to your lover\u2019s throat, Jafar suggested mockingly. \u201cThen would you do as I need you to do?\u201d</p><p>Abram almost paused at the way the other man phrased his words.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cYou would have to kill me first,\u201d he warned him. \u201cI won\u2019t let you touch her as long as I live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasily done.\u201d His arm tensed as the blade pressed harder.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me, Jafar,\u201d Paige screamed out furiously, her voice raw and hoarse as Tariq was forced to hold her back.</p><p>She strained against his hold, her expression twisting with rage.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Jafar, you owe me,\u201d she screamed again. Abram felt a trickle of blood at his neck and yet he still stood silently, too curious about the path his cousin would take to attempt to break his hold just yet.</p><p>Jafar paused.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me,\u201d Paige repeated as the tears rolled down her face. \u201cYou still owe me.\u201d</p><p>And just what the hell would Jafar owe her?</p><p>\u201cShe is a beautiful woman,\u201d Jafar sighed, his hold against the side of Abram\u2019s head tightening. \u201cAnd yes, I owe her much. Without her, perhaps I would be dead.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Abram wondered what the hell had been going on over the years that he was unaware of.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is how you repay your debts?\u201d Abram asked him. \u201cWith blood?\u201d</p><p>Behind him, he felt Jafar breathe in slowly, deeply, as though preparing himself. As his body tightened, Abram tensed as well, covering his own anticipation within Jafar\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, cousin,\u201d Jafar said. \u201cBut I cannot afford your escape or theirs.\u201d</p><p>As the words left his mouth the viperous red lines of the laser rifles\u2019 sights cut through the night, pinpointing Jafar and each of his men as black ropes and army rangers slid soundlessly into position.</p><p>They surrounded Jafar\u2019s team of men as Abram let his gaze move to Paige once again.</p><p>Something in him tightened each time he allowed his eyes to meet the grief in hers and to acknowledge the fear that filled her face as Jafar kept that knife at his throat.</p><p>\u201cRelease him, Jafar,\u201d the commanding voice of the black-masked ranger closest to him ordered.</p><p>\u201cI cannot do this.\u201d The lazy amusement in Jafar\u2019s voice was at odds with the tension in his body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make us start picking off your men,\u201d he advised when Jafar refused to move. \u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are called martyrs for a reason.\u201d Jafar mocked them though the knife never moved.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to move. What fucking game was his cousin playing? If Jafar was going to cut his throat, then he would have already done so.</p><p>Abram found it a little too easy to slam his elbow into his cousin\u2019s diaphragm as he caught the wrist holding the knife at the same time.</p><p>Thrusting Jafar\u2019s arm to the side as he held his wrist, Abram broke away from the hold, twisting the wrist as he moved and taking his cousin to his knees.</p><p>Abram released him. He jumped back to safety behind the rangers now circling the team of terrorist soldiers.</p><p>\u201cDrop your weapons and we\u2019ll leave just as quietly as we arrived,\u201d the commander ordered. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019ll kill, if we have to.\u201d</p><p>The terrorists\u2019 weapons were tossed carelessly to the ground as Abram moved quickly to Paige. They were gathered upwe </p> </body></html>"]
