A soft moan from the other side of the bed reminded me that I hadn\u2019t come home from the bar last night alone, not that I remembered the girl\u2019s name or what she looked like or if had even been worth her time to stumble into my apartment with me. I ran a hand over my face and swung my legs over the edge of the bed just as the bedroom door swung open. I never should have given the little brat a key. I didn\u2019t bother to cover up; she was used to walking in and finding me hung over and naked so I didn\u2019t see why today needed to be any different. The girl on the other side of the bed rolled over and narrowed her eyes at the new addition to our awkward little party.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you were single?\u201d There was accusation in her tone that lifted the hair on the back of my neck. Any chick that was willing to come how with a stranger for a night of unattached sex didn\u2019t get the right to cast judgment around, especially while they were still naked and rumpled in my bed.</p> <p>\u201cGive me twenty.\u201d I ran a hand through my messy hair and the blond in the doorway lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou have ten.\u201d I would have lifted an eyebrow back at her tone and attitude but my head was killing me and the gesture would be wasted on her anyway, she was way past immune to my shit. \u201cI\u2019ll make coffee, I already invited Nash but he said he has to go to the shop for an appointment. I\u2019ll be in the car.\u201d She spun on her heel and just like that the doorway was empty and I was struggling to my feet and searching the floor any pair of pants I might have tossed down there last night.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I had temporarily forgotten about the girl in my bed so I swore softly under my breath and tugged a black t-shirt that looked reasonably clean over my head. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I frowned at her as she lifted herself up in the bed and clutched the sheet to her chest. She was pretty, had a nice body from what I could see and I wondered what kind of game I had thrown at her in order to get her to come home with me. She was one I wouldn\u2019t have minded waking up to this morning.</p> <p>\u201cI have somewhere I need to be so that means you need to get up and get going. Normally my roommate would be around so you could hangout for a minute but he had to go to work so that means you need to get that fine ass in gear and get out.\u201d</p><p>She sputtered a little at me. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder as I dug my boots out from under a pile of laundry and shoved my feet into them. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of asshole does that? Not even a thanks for last night, you were great how about lunch, just get the fuck out!\u201d She threw the sheet aside and I noticed she had a nice tattoo scrawling along her ribs. That was probably what attracted me to her in my drunken stupor in the first place. \u201cYou\u2019re a real piece of work, you know that?\u201d</p><p>I was a whole lot more than just a piece of work, but this chick that was just one of oh so many didn\u2019t need to know that. I silently cursed at Nash. My roommate was the shit, we had been best friends since elementary school and I could normally rely on him to run interference for me on Sunday mornings when I had to bail but I forgot about the piece he was supposed to be finishing up today so I needed to hustle last night\u2019s tail out the door and get moving before the brat left without me, which was a bigger headache than I needed in my current state.</p><p>\u201cHey what\u2019s your name anyway?\u201d If she wasn\u2019t pissed before she was downright infuriated now as she climbed back into a super short black skirt and barely there tank top. She fluffed up mounds of clearly dyed blond hair and glared at me out of eyes now smudged with worn mascara.</p> <p>\u201cLucy, you don\u2019t remember?\u201d I slimed some crap in my hair to make it stand up in a bunch of directions on sprayed on cologne to help mask the scent of sex and booze that I was sure still clung to every visible patch of skin. I shrugged a shoulder at her and waited while she walked in front of me, hopping on one foot to put on a pair of heels that just screamed dirty sex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Rule.\u201d I would have offered to shake her hand but that seemed silly so I just pointed to the front door of the apartment and stepped in the bathroom to brush the stale taste of whiskey out of my mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s coffee in the kitchen, maybe you should write your number down and I can give you a call another time. Sunday\u2019s aren\u2019t a good day for me.\u201d She would never know how true that statement was.</p><p>She glared at me and tapped the toe of one of those awesome shoes. \u201cYou really have no idea who I am do you?\u201d</p><p>This time even against my throbbing brains wishes my eyebrow went up and I looked at her with a mouth full of toothpaste foam. I just stared at her until she screeched at me and pointed at her side, \u201cYou have to at least remember this!\u201d</p><p>No wonder I liked her ink so much it was one of mine. I spit the toothpaste in the sink and gave myself a once over in the mirror. I looked like hell. My eyes were watery and rimmed in red, my skin looked gray and there was a hickey the size of Rhode Island on the side of my neck. Mom was just going to love that, just like she was going to fall all over herself about the current state of my hair. Normally thick and dark, I had shaved the sides of it off and dyed the front a nice, bright purple so that it stuck up straight and looked kind of like a weed-whacker had been used to cut it. Both my folks already had an issue with the scrolling ink that wound around both my arms and up the sides of my neck, so the hair was just going to be icing on the cake. There was nothing I could do to fix the current shit show looking back at me in the mirror so I prowled out of the bathroom and unceremoniously grabbed the girl by the elbow and towed her to the front door. I needed to learn to go home with them instead of letting them come home with me; it was so much easier that way.</p><p>\u201cLook I have somewhere I have to be and I don\u2019t particularly love that I have to go, but you freaking out and making a scene is not going to do anything other than piss me off. I hope you had a good time last night and you can leave your number but we both the chances of me calling you are slim to none. If you don\u2019t want to be treated like crap maybe you should stop going home with drunken dudes you don\u2019t know. Trust me we\u2019re really only after one thing and the next morning all we really want is for you to go quietly away. I have a headache and I feel like I\u2019m going to hurl, plus I have to spend the next hour in a car with someone that will be silently loathing me and joyously plotting my death so really can we just save the histrionics and get a move on it?\u201d</p><p>By now I had maneuvered her to the entryway of the building and I saw her in the BMW idling in the spot next to my truck. She was impatient and would take off if I wasted anymore time. I gave Lucy a half grin and shrugged a shoulder, after all it wasn\u2019t her fault I was an asshole and even I knew she deserved better than such a callous brush off. \u201cLook don\u2019t feel bad, I can be a charming bastard when I put my mind to it. You are far from the first and won\u2019t the last that has to see this little show. I\u2019m glad your tat turned out badass, I\u2019d prefer you remember me for that rather than last night.\u201d</p><p>I jogged down the front steps without looking back and yanked open the door to the fancy black BMW. I hated this car and hated that it suited the driver as well as it did. Classy, sleek and expensive were definitely words that could be used describe my traveling companion and even as Lucy yelled at me and flipped me off as we pulled out of the lot to my apartment building all she did was roll her eyes and mutter, \u201cClassy\u201d under her breath. She was used to the little scenes chicks liked to throw when I bailed on them the morning after; I had even had to replace her windshield once when one of them had chucked a rock at me and missed while I was walking away.</p> <p>I adjusted the seat to accommodate my long legs and settled in to rest my head against the window. It was always a long and achingly silent drive, sometimes like today I was grateful for it, other times it grated on my very last nerve. We had been a fixture in each other\u2019s lives since middle school, she knew every strength and fault I had, my parents loved her like their own and made no bones about the fact they more often than not preferred her company over mine. One would think with all the history, both good and bad between us that we could make simple small talk for a few hours without it being difficult.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get that junk that\u2019s all in your hair all over my window.\u201d She had a voice that didn\u2019t match the rest of her. It was all cigarettes and whiskey, while she was all champagne and silk. I had always liked her voice, when we got along I could listen to her talk for hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it detailed.\u201d She snorted. I closed my eyes and crossed my arms over my chest. I was all set for a silent ride but apparently she had things to say today because as soon as she pulled the car onto the highway she turned the radio down and said my name, \u201cRule,\u201d I turned my head slightly to the side and cracked open an eye.</p><p>\u201cShaw.\u201d Her name was just as fancy as the rest of her. She was pale, had snowy white blond hair and big ole green eyes that looked like a Granny Smith apple. She was tiny, an easy foot shorter than my own six three, but had curves for days. She was the kind of girl that guys looked at just because they couldn\u2019t help themselves, but as soon as she turned those frosty green eyes in their direction they knew they wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. She exuded unattainability like some other girls oozed come and get me.</p><p>She blew a breath out and I watched as a strand of hair twirled around her forehead. She looked at me out of the corner of her eye and I stiffened up when I saw how tight her hands were on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it Shaw?\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip, a sure sign she was nervous. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you answered any of your mom\u2019s calls this week?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t exactly tight with my folks, in fact our relationship hovered somewhere around the mutually tolerable area which is why my mom sent Shaw to drag me home each weekend. We were both from a small town called Brookside in an affluent part of Colorado. I moved to Denver as soon as I had my diploma in hand and Shaw was a few years behind because she was younger than me and also because she had wanted nothing more than to get into D-U. Not only did the girl look like a fairytale princess but she was also on track to be a freaking doctor. My mom knew there was no way I would make the two hour drive there and back to see them on the weekends, but if Shaw drove and came and got me, not only would I feel guilty for making her take time out of her schedule to get me, but that I had no excuse to not go. Shaw paid for the gas, waited for me to stumble out of bed and dragged my sorry ass home every single Sunday and not once in going on two years had she complained about it.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was busy all week.\u201d I was busy, but I also just didn\u2019t like talking to my mom so I had ignored her all three times she had called me this week. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaw sighed and her hands twisted even tighter on the steering wheel. \u201cShe was calling to tell you that Rome got hurt and the Army is sending him home for six weeks of R&amp;R. Your dad went to the military base in the Springs yesterday to pick him up.\u201d</p><p>I bolted up in the seat so fast that I smacked my head on the roof of the car. I swore and rubbed the spot that made my head throb anymore. \u201cWhat? What do you mean he got hurt?\u201d Rome was my older brother, he had three years on me and had been overseas for a good portion of the last six, but we were still tight and even if he didn\u2019t like all the distance I put between me and my parents over the years if he was seriously injured I would have heard about it from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure; Margot said something happened to the convoy he was in when they were out on patrol. He was in a pretty bad accident I guess. She said his arm was broken and he had a few snapped ribs but she was pretty upset so I had a hard time understanding her when she called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRome would have called.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRome is doped up and spent the last two days being debriefed, he asked your mom to call because you Archer boys are nothing if not persistent. Margot told him that you wouldn\u2019t answer but he kept telling her to try.\u201d</p><p>My brother was hurt, but he was home and I didn\u2019t know about it. I closed my eyes again and let my head drop back against the headrest. \u201cWell hell, that\u2019s good news I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to go by and see your mom?\u201d I didn\u2019t have to look at her to know that she had stiffened even more. I could practically feel the tension rolling off of her in icy waves.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She didn\u2019t say more and I didn\u2019t expect her to. The Archers might not have been the closest, warmest bunch, but we didn\u2019t have anything on the Landon\u2019s. Shaw\u2019s family craped gold and breathed money, they also cheated and lied, were divorced and remarried and from what I had seen over the years had little need or interest in the biological daughter that came from a union figured out on a tax form rather than a bedroom. I knew Shaw loved my house, loved my parents because it was the only semblance of normalcy she had ever experienced and I didn\u2019t begrudge her that, in fact I appreciated the fact she took most of the heat off of me. If Shaw was doing good in school, dating an affluent undergrad, living the life my parents had always wanted for their sons but had been denied they stayed off my case and since Rome was usually a continent away I was the only one they could get to so I took no shame in using Shaw as a buffer.</p><p>\u201cMan I haven\u2019t even talked to Rome in three months. It\u2019ll be awesome to see him. I wonder if I can convince him to come spend some time in D-town with me and Nash. He\u2019s probably more than ready for a little bit of fun.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed again and moved to turn the radio back up a little bit. \u201cYou\u2019re twenty-two Rule, when are you going to stop acting like an indulgent teenager? Did you even ask this one her name? In case you were wondering you smell like a mix between a distillery and a strip club.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and let my eyes drift back shut. \u201cYou\u2019re nineteen, Shaw when are you going to stop living your life by everyone else\u2019s standards? My eighty-two year old grandma has more of a social calendar than you and I think she\u2019s less uptight.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to tell her what she smelled like because it was sweet and lovely and I had no desire to be nice at the moment.</p><p>I could feel her glaring at me and I hid a grin. \u201cI like Ethel.\u201d Her tone was surly.</p><p>\u201cEverybody likes Ethel. She\u2019s feisty and won\u2019t take crap from anyone. You could learn a thing or two from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh maybe I should just dye my hair pink, tattoo every visible surface of my body, shove a bunch of metal in my face and sleep with everything that moves, isn\u2019t that your philosophy on how to live a rich and fulfilling life?\u201d</p><p>That made me crank my eyes back open and the marching band in my head decided to go for round two.</p> <p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m doing what I want. I know who and what I am Shaw, and I don\u2019t make any apologies for it. I hear plenty of Margot Archer coming out of your pretty mouth right now.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted down into a frown. \u201cWhatever, let\u2019s just go back to ignoring each other, I just thought you should know about Rome, the Archer boys have never been big on surprises.\u201d</p><p>She was right. In my experience surprises were never a good thing, they usually resulted in someone getting pissed and me ending up in some kind of fight. I loved my brother but I had to admit I was kind of irritated he hadn\u2019t one, bothered to let me know he was hurt, and two, was still trying to force me to play nice with my folks. I figured her plan to ignore each other the rest of the way was a winner so I slumped down as far as the sporty little car would allow and started to doze off. I was only out for twenty minutes or so when her phone started singing The Civil Wars and jarred me awake. I blinked gritty eyes and rubbed a hand over the scruff on my face. If the hair didn\u2019t piss mom off the fact I was too busy to shave for her precious brunch might just send her into hysterics.</p><p>\u201cNo, I told you I\u2019m going to Brookside and won\u2019t be back until late.\u201d I looked across the car at her and she must have felt my gaze because she looked at me quickly and I saw a little bit of pink work its way into her high cheeks. \u201cNo Gabe, I told you I don\u2019t have time and that I have a lab due.\u201d I couldn\u2019t make out the words but whoever was on the other end of the phone sounded angry at her brush off. I saw her fingers tighten on the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business; I have to go now, so I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d She swiped a finger across the screen and tossed the fancy device into the cup holder by my knee.</p><p>\u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d I didn\u2019t really care about Shaw and her richer than God, future ruler of the known universe boyfriend, but it was polite to ask when someone was obviously upset. I hadn\u2019t ever met Gabe, but from what I heard from mom when I bothered to listen he was custom made to go with Shaw\u2019s future doctor persona. His family was as loaded as hers, his dad was a judge, or lawyer, or some other political nonsense I had no use for and I was sure beyond the shadow of a doubt the dude had to wear pleated slacks and pink polo shirts with white loafers. For a long moment I didn\u2019t think she was going to respond but she cleared her throat and started tapping out a beat on the steering wheel with her obviously expensively manicured fingers.</p><p>\u201cNot really, we broke up but I don\u2019t think Gabe really gets it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a couple weeks ago actually. I\u2019ve been thinking about doing it for a while. I\u2019m just too busy with school and work to have a boyfriend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it was the right guy you wouldn\u2019t feel that way. You would make the time because you wanted to be with him.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me with both blond brows raised up to her hair line. \u201cAre you, Mr. Manwhore of the Century seriously trying to give me relationship advice?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes which made my head scream in protest. \u201cJust because there hasn\u2019t been one girl I wanted to hang out with exclusively doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know that difference between quality and quantity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have fooled me, besides Gabe wanted more than I was willing to give and it\u2019s going to be a pain because my Mom and Dad both loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue that, from what I\u2019ve heard he was pretty much custom made to make your folks happy. What do you mean he wanted to more than you were willing to give? Did he try and put a rock on your finger after only six months?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a look and curled her lip up in a sneer. \u201cNot even close, he just wanted things to be more serious than I wanted them to be.\u201d</p><p>I laughed a little and rubbed between my eyebrows. My headache had turned into a dull throb but was starting to be manageable. I needed to ask her to swing by a Starbucks or something if I was going to get through this afternoon.</p><p>\u201cIs that your prissy way of telling me that he was trying to get in your pants and you weren\u2019t having it?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at me and pulled off on the exit that took us towards Brookside.</p><p>\u201cI need you to stop by Starbucks before going to my parents\u2019 house, and don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice you aren\u2019t answering my question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we stop we\u2019re going to be late and not every boy thinks with what\u2019s in their pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sky isn\u2019t going to fall on us if we show up five minutes behind Margot\u2019s schedule, and you have got to be kidding me, you strung that loser along for six months without giving it up, what a joke.\u201d</p><p>That made me flat-out laugh at her. I laughed so hard that I had to hold my head in both hands as my whisky logged brain started to protest by screaming at me. I gasped a little and looked at her with watery eyes. \u201cIf you really believe that you aren\u2019t nearly as smart as I always thought you were. Every single dude under the age of ninety is trying to get in your pants, Shaw, especially if he\u2019s thinking that he\u2019s your boy. I\u2019m a guy, I know this shit.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip again conceding I probably had a valid point and pulled the car into the coffee shop. I practically bolted out, eager to stretch my legs and get a little distance from her typically haughty attitude. There was a line when I got inside and I cast a quick look around to see if I recognized anyone because Brookside was a pretty small town and usually when I stopped by on the weekends I inevitably ran into some I used to go to school with. I hadn\u2019t bothered to ask Shaw if she wanted me to grab her anything because she was still being all uppity about having to stop in the first place. It was almost my turn to order when my phone started blasting a Social Distortion song in my pocket. I dug it out after ordering a big ass black coffee and took a spot on the counter next to a cute brunette that was trying her hardest not get caught checking me out.</p><p>\u201cWhat up?\u201d</p><p>I could hear the music in the shop blaring behind Nash when he asked, \u201cHow did this morning go?\u201d</p><p>Nash knew my faults and bad habits better than anyone and the reason we had maintained our friendship as long as we had was because he never judged me based on those factors.</p><p>\u201cSucked. I\u2019m hung-over, grumpy and about to sit through yet another forced family function, plus Shaw is rare form today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the chick from last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue. I don\u2019t even remember getting home from the bar but apparently I did a huge piece on her side so she was a little pissed I didn\u2019t remember who she was, so ouch.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled on the other end of the line. \u201cShe told you that like six times last night, she even tried to pull her top off to show you and I drove your dumb ass home last drunko. I tried to get you to leave at like midnight but you weren\u2019t having any of it as usual.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and reached for the coffee when the guy behind the counter called my name. I noticed the brunette\u2019s eyes follow the hand that wrapped around the cardboard cup. It was the one that had the flared head of a king cobra on it. The rest of the snake wound its way up my forearm and around my elbow, the extended forked tongue made the \u201cL\u201d on my ring finger in the tattoo of my name that was inked across the four knuckles of the same hand. Her mouth made a little O of surprise so I flashed her a wink and walked back to the BMW. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry dude. How did your appointment go?\u201d</p><p>Nash\u2019s Uncle Phil had opened the shop years ago on Capitol Hill when it mainly catered to gangbangers and bikers, now with the influx of young urbanites and hipsters\u2019 populating the area \u2018The Marked\u2019 was one of the busiest tattoo parlors in town. Nash and I met in fifth grade in art class and had been inseparable since, in fact it had been his plan since we were about twelve that we would eventually move to the city and work for Phil. We both had mad skills and the personality to make the shop bump with business so Phil had no qualms apprenticing us and putting us to work before we were both in our twenties. It was killer to have a friend in the same field; I had a plethora of ink on my skin that ranged from great to not so great that chronicled Nash getting better and better at his craft and he could state the exact same thing.</p><p>\u201cFinished that back piece that I\u2019ve been working on since July, it turned out better than I thought and the dude is talking about doing the front so I\u2019ll take it because he\u2019s a fat tipper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice\u201d, I was juggling the phone and the coffee and trying to open the door to the car when a female voice stopped me in my tracks.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I looked over my shoulder and the brunette was standing a car over with a smile on her face. \u201cI really like your tattoos.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at her and jumped back narrowly missing spilling scalding coffee all down my crotch as Shaw shoved the door open from the inside.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d If we were closer to home and Shaw wasn\u2019t already putting the car in reverse I probably would have taken a second to ask the girl for her number. Shaw shot me a look of contempt that I promptly ignored and went back to my conversation with Nash. \u201cRome is home, apparently he got in an accident and Shaw said he\u2019s got a few weeks of R&amp;R coming to him. I guess that\u2019s why mom was blowing my phone up all week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick ass. Ask him if he wants to roll with us for a few days, I miss that surly bastard.\u201d</p><p>I sipped on the coffee and my head finally started to calm down. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan. I\u2019ll hit you up on my way home and let you know what the story is.\u201d</p> <p>I flicked my thumb across the screen to end the call and settled back into the seat. Shaw glowered at me and I swore her eyes glowed at me in her anger. Really I had never seen anything that green anywhere else in nature and when she was mad they were just otherworldly.</p><p>\u201cYour mom called while you were busy flirting. She\u2019s mad we\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>I sucked on more of the black nectar of the Gods and started tapping out a beat on my knee with my free hand. I was always kind of a fidgety guy and the closer we got to my parent\u2019s house the worse it usually got. Brunch was always stilted and forced, I couldn\u2019t figure out why they insisted on going through with it every single week, couldn\u2019t figure out why Shaw enabled the farce, but I went every week even when I knew nothing would ever change.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mad you\u2019re late. We both know she could care less if I was there or not.\u201d My fingers moved faster and faster as she wheeled the car into a gated community and past rows and rows of cookie cutter mini mansions that were built back into the mountains.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true and you know it, Rule. I do not suffer through these car rides every weekend, subject myself to the delight of your morning after nastiness because your parents want me to have eggs and pancakes every Sunday. I do it because they want to see you, want to try and have a relationship with you no matter how many times you hurt them or push them away. I owe it to your parents and more importantly I owe it to Remy to try and make you act right even though lord knows that\u2019s almost a full time job.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath as the blinding pain that always came when someone mentioned Remy\u2019s name barreled through my chest. My fingers involuntarily opened and closed around the coffee cup and I whipped my head around to glare at her.</p> <p>\u201cRemy wouldn\u2019t be all over my ass to try and be something to them I\u2019m not. I was never good enough for them, and never will be. He understood that better than anyone and worked overtime to try and be everything to them I never could be.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and pulled the car to a stop in the driveway behind my dad\u2019s SUV. \u201cThe only difference between you and Remy was that he let people love him and you,\u201d she yanked open the driver\u2019s door and glared at me across the space that separated us. \u201cYou have always been determined to make everyone that cares about you prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. You\u2019ve never wanted to be easy to love Rule and you make damn sure that nobody can ever forget it.\u201d She slammed the door with enough force that it rattled my back teeth and made my head start to throb again.</p><p>It had been three years. Three lonely, three empty, three sorrow filled years since the Archer brothers went from a trifecta to a duo. I was close to Rome, he was awesome and had always been my role model when it came to being a badass, but Remy was my other half, both figuratively and literally. He was my identical twin, the light to my dark, the easy to my hard, the joy to my angst, the perfect to my oh so totally fucked up and without him I was only half the person I would ever be. It had been three years since I had called him in the middle of the night to come pick me up from some lame ass party because I was too drunk to drive. It had been three years since he had left the apartment we shared to come get me with zero questions asked because that\u2019s just what he did. It had been three years since he had lost control of his car on a rainy and slick I-25 and slammed into the back of a semi-truck going well over eighty. It had been three years since we had put my twin in the ground and my mother had looked at me with tears in her eyes and stated point blank, \u201cIt should have been you,\u201d as they lowered Remy into the ground. It had been three years and his name alone was enough to drop me to my knees, especially coming from the one person in the world Remy had loved as much as he loved me.</p><p>Remy was everything I wasn\u2019t, clean cut, well dressed, interested in education and building a secure future and the only person on the planet that was good enough and classy enough to match all the magnificence that he possessed it was Shaw Landon. The two of them had been inseparable since the first time he brought her home when she was thirteen and trying to escape the fortress of the Landon compound. He insisted they were just friends, that he loved Shaw like a sister, that he just wanted to protect her from her awful, sterile family but the way he was with her was full of reverence and care. I knew he loved her and since Remy could do no wrong Shaw had quickly become an honorary member of my family and as much as it galled me she was the only one that really, truly understood the depth of my pain when it came to losing him.</p><p>I had to take a few extra minutes to get my feet back under me so I sucked back the rest of the coffee and shoved open the door. I wasn\u2019t surprised to see a tall figure coming around the SUV as I labored out of the sports car. My brother was an inch or so taller than me and built more along the lines of a warrior. His dark brown hair was buzzed in a typical military cut and his pale blue eyes, the same exact icy shade as mine looked tired as he forced a smile at me. I let out a whistle because his left arm was in a cast and sling, he had a walking boot on one foot and there was a nasty line of black stiches running through one of his eyebrows and across the top of his forehead. The weed whacker that had attacked my hair had clearly gotten a good shot at my big bro too.</p><p>\u201cLooking good solider.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me to him in a one armed hug and I winced for him when I felt the taped up side of his body clearly indicating some busted or bruised ribs. \u201cI look about as good as I feel. You look like a clown getting out of that car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like a clown no matter what when I\u2019m around that girl.\u201d He barked out a laugh and rubbed a rough hand through my spiky hair.</p> <p>\u201cYou and Shaw are still acting like mortal enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like uneasy acquaintances, she\u2019s just as prissy and judgmental as always. Why didn\u2019t you call or email me that you were hurt? I had to hear it from her on the way over.\u201d</p><p>He swore as we started to slowly start and make our way into the house. It upset me to see how deliberate he was moving and I wondered if there was more serious damage done than the visible marks I could see.</p><p>\u201cI was unconscious after the Hummer flipped. We went over an IED and it was bad. I was in the hospital for a week with a scrambled noggin and when I woke up they had to do surgery on my shoulder so I was drugged up. I called mom and figured she would let you know what the deal was, but I heard that as usual you were unavailable when she called.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged a shoulder and reached out a hand to steady him as he faltered a little on the stairs to the front door. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too stubborn, I\u2019m here aren\u2019t I and I didn\u2019t even know you were home until like fifteen minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason you\u2019re here is because that little girl in there is bound and determined to keep this family together regardless if we\u2019re her own or not. You go in there and play nice otherwise I\u2019ll kick your ass broken arm and all.\u201d</p><p>I muttered a few choice words and followed my battered sibling into the house. Sundays really were just my least favorite day.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Shaw</p><p>I closed the bathroom door with a soft click and turned the lock. I collapsed against the skin and ran shaking hands over my face. It was getting harder and harder each and every Sunday to be Rule\u2019s chaperone to these family gatherings, I already felt like I was getting an ulcer and if I had to walk in on him and one of his disgusting bar bimbos again I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to make it out of his apartment without committing homicide. I turned around to splash some cold water on my face and lifted the heavy fall of blond hair off my neck. I needed to pull it together because the last thing I wanted was for Margot or Dale to notice something was off and even drugged up and in pain Rome was one of the most observant people I had ever met. He didn\u2019t miss a thing when it came to either of his younger brothers and me by association since I was technically lumped into the category of surrogate little sister.</p><p>It was getting harder and harder to spend time around Rule and not just because looking at him reminded me of everything that I no longer had which was the problem Margot and Dale struggled with, not that the insensitive ass had any empathy for his parents. My struggle came with the fact that Rule was complicated, he was brash, mouthy, careless, thoughtless, and often cranky and generally and insufferable pain in the ass but when he chose to be he was also charming and funny, artistically brilliant and more often than not the most interesting person in the room and I had been head over heels in love with both sides of him since I was thirteen years old. Of course I had loved Remy, loved him like a brother, like the best friend and consummate protector he had been but I loved Rule like it was my mission in life, like it was inevitable and no matter how many times I was shown what an awful idea it was, what a bad match we were, what a callous asshole he could be, I couldn\u2019t shake it so each and every time I had to have the fact that he didn\u2019t even think of me as more than a car pool driver shoved in my face it tore a little bit more of my battered heart apart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My own family was such a mess there was no way I would be half the person I was today without all the Archers had done for me. Remy had taken me under his wing when I was a friendless and lonely pre-teen, Rome had threatened to beat up the first boy that made me cry because he didn\u2019t like me back, Margot had taken me shopping for homecoming and prom dresses when my own mother was too busy with her new husband to care, Dale had taken me to Denver University and CU Boulder and helped whittle down the choices logically and rationally when it came to picking a college and Rule, well Rule was a constant reminder that money didn\u2019t get you everything you wanted and that no matter how perfect I tried to be, how hard I worked at being everything to everyone that it still wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>I blew out a breath that I felt like I had been holding for over an hour and took a piece of Kleenex to wipe away the black smudges that had run under my eyes from the water. If I didn\u2019t get down the dining room fast Margot was bound to come looking for me and I didn\u2019t have a reasonable excuse as to why I was currently hyperventilating in the bathroom. I fished a hair tie out of my pocket and pulled my hair into a low ponytail. I slicked on a sheer coat of gloss and gave myself a silent pep talk, reminding myself that I had done this a million other Sundays and that this one was no different. Just as I was stepping into the hall my phone rang and I had to struggle to keep back a groan when I saw that it was Gabe calling again. I sent the call to voicemail and wondered for the hundredth time in the last month why I had ever wasted a second of my time on his pompous ass. He was over entitled, overly grabby, overly superficial and overly interested in my last name and the fact that my parents were loaded than in me. I wasn\u2019t even interested in dating him, wasn\u2019t interested in dating anyone but my parents had forced my hand and as usual under their pressure I folded and ended up spending more time than I wanted with him. I managed to tolerate him for a lot longer than I thought I would be able to, after all Gabe was way more interested in himself than in me, it wasn\u2019t until he had started pushing for sex, started making me uncomfortable by grabbing and touching things I didn\u2019t want his hands anywhere near that I cut the cord. Unfortunately neither he nor my parents seemed to want to get the message and I had been inundated with calls, texts and emails for the last two weeks. Gabe was easy enough to dodge, my mother not so much.</p><p>I was shoving the phone back into my back pocket when a quiet voice stopped me. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you little girl? I\u2019ve been gone for over eighteen months and all I get is a hug and a peck on the cheek before you disappear? Where are the tears, where\u2019s the hysterics that I\u2019m home safe and sound? What\u2019s working in that complicated brain of yours because I can tell something is on your mind?\u201d</p><p>I hiccupped a little laugh and let my forehead fall onto the strong chest in front of me. Even battered and bruised Rome was the kind of guy that stood between the people he loved and anything that might possibly hurt them. He patted the top of my head and laid a heavy hand on the back of my neck. \u201cI missed that pretty face Shaw; you don\u2019t know how good it is to be home.\u201d</p> <p>I shuttered a little and wrapped a carful arm around his waist so that I could give him a squeeze and not hurt him. \u201cI missed you too, Rome. I\u2019m just stressed out. School is crazy right now, I\u2019m working three or four nights a week and my parents won\u2019t get off my back about this guy I just broke up with. You know I love it when we\u2019re all together. I thought your mom was going to have a heart attack when she called to tell me what happened to you. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay, I don\u2019t this family would be able to handle another Archer son going down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo probably not. I can\u2019t believe she still has you playing chuffer to my idiot brother.\u201d</p><p>I hooked my arm through his and we started to make our way to the dining room. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way he\u2019ll come. If I have to miss it because of school or because something comes up he just blows them off. Half the time when I get to the apartment he doesn\u2019t even know what day it is and has to scramble to get out the door, today would be a prime example of that. If I show up he feels obligated to ride with me no matter what or who he\u2019s in the middle of doing.\u201d</p><p>Rome swore under his breath. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t kill that kid to play nice with mom and dad once a week. He shouldn\u2019t need you to be his babysitter.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged a shoulder because we both knew that all the Archer brothers had a role. Remy had been the good son, the straight A student, the future Ivy leaguer , he was also the one saddled with the role of keeping Rule out of jail and running interference when his twin got into trouble that he couldn\u2019t talk his way out of. Rule was the wild card, the one that lived life to the fullest and made no apologies for those he might offend or hurt along the way. Rome was the boss, the twins adored him and followed his lead through good and bad because lord knew with the way the three of them looked there was lots and lots of bad thrown their way. With Remy gone it wasn\u2019t a surprise to anyone that Rome had become even more protective of his remaining brother and that I had fallen seamlessly into the role of trying to keep Rule on some kind of path of straight and narrow.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do for Margot and Dale. They\u2019ve always done so much for me and asked for so little in return suffering Rule\u2019s wrath once a week is a pretty easy sacrifice to make.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed in those eyes that were so much like his brother\u2019s that it sometimes hurt to look into them. Rome wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fool and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he knew more about all the things I kept locked down than he let on.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you being the target of Rule being Rule. Mom needs to get over her shit and so does he. Everyone is grown now and life is too short for you to be constantly playing the peacemaker between those two.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and lowered my voice as we got to the entrance to room. The table was already set and everyone was already in their regular seats. Dale was at the head of the table, Margot on his right with an open spot for me. His left side was left open for Rome and Rule had taken the seat at the opposite end of the table as far away from both of his parents as he could get. \u201cThey need to move past the fact that he\u2019s never going to be Remy, and he has to stop intentionally cramming that fact down their throats. Until one side gives and learns how to forgive it\u2019s always going to be this way.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a super light kiss to my temple and gave me a little squeeze back. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of them realize how lucky they are to have you little girl.\u201d</p><p>I let him go and went to take my seat between Margot and Rule. I tried not to wince when Rule sent a narrow eyed look in my direction, knowing Rome and I had more than likely been whispering about him. I slid into my spot and flashed Dale a smile as he started passing the typically lavish brunch around. I was about to ask Rome what he planned to do with his time off when Margot had me snapping my head around in shock.</p> <p>\u201cWould it be too much of a stretch to expect you to come to brunch in a shirt that buttons and in a pair of pants that don\u2019t look like they came from the thrift store? I mean your brother has several broken bones and was in a horrific accident and he still manages to look more put together than you, Rule.\u201d</p><p>I had to bite my tongue to stop from snapping at her to lay off of him. Mostly because family gatherings were supposed to be informal and fun and I knew good and well if I had showed up in jeans and a t-shirt she wouldn\u2019t even have blinked, but because it was him she viewed it as a direct attack on her.</p><p>He picked a couple pieces of bacon off the platter I handed to him and didn\u2019t even bother to respond to her. Instead he turned to Rome and asked what his plans were while he was home. He wanted him to come to the city for a week and spend time with him and Nash. I saw Margot\u2019s mouth tighten at the dismissal and Dale\u2019s eyebrows pull down in a frown. I saw varying degrees of the same look every Sunday we were here. It hurt my chest because even in a rumpled shirt and torn jeans Rule was the kind of guy that owned whatever look he was wearing. It was the same thing with the mass amounts of tattoos that covered him from head to toe and the array of metal that dotted his face here and there. There was no denying Rule was a good looking guy, probably too good looking to be honest, but he was complicated and the beauty he possessed was buried and camouflaged under things it was easy to look past. Of all the brothers he had the clearest, most arctic blue eyes, his hair even when it was decorated with purple or green or blue was still the thickest and the shiniest and even with every color under sun dancing across his skin, of the three of them Rule had always been the one the girls gravitated to. Just like the brunette at Starbucks this afternoon. Her name was Amy Rodgers and I had spent all four years of high school being tormented by her and her cheerleader cronies. She dated jocks and boys that bleed blue, not guys that rocked mohawks and had their eyebrows and lips pierced, but even she couldn\u2019t resist all that was Rule Archer in his magnetic glory.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s going on with your hair son? A color actually found in nature might be a nice change of pace especially since the whole family is together and we\u2019re all lucky to have your brother home in one piece.\u201d</p><p>I groaned inwardly and silently took the bowl of fruit Margot handed me. Now that they had teamed up on him there was no way he was going to stay quiet. Normally he ignored his mom and shot sarcastic one liners at Dale, but being interrupted and attacked from both sides while he was trying to catch up with Rome wasn\u2019t going to fly. Rule had a short fuse on a good day but corner him when he was hung over and being reluctantly civil at best and the fur was no doubt going to fly. I shot Rome a panicked look across the table but before he could interject Rule\u2019s voice snapped out like a verbal back hand across the face.</p><p>\u201cWell pops purple is found all throughout nature so I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about and as far as my clothes are concerned I figure we\u2019re all lucky I bothered to even put pants on considering the condition Shaw found me in this morning. Now if you\u2019re both done criticizing every move I make can I continue my conversation with the brother I haven\u2019t seen in over a year that nearly got blow up by a roadside bomb?\u201d</p><p>Margot gasped and Dale shoved his chair back from the table. I let my head fall forward and rubbed between my eyes where a headache was starting to throb.</p><p>\u201cOne afternoon Rule, one freaking afternoon is all we ask of you.\u201d Dale stormed out of the room and Margot wasted no time in bursting into tears. She buried her face in her napkin and I reached over to awkwardly pat her shoulder. I cut a look at Rule but he had climbed to his feet as well and was headed toward the front door. I shot a look at Rome who just shook his head and lumbered to his feet. Margot lifted her head and looked at her oldest with pleading eyes.</p> <p>\u201cTell him Rome, you go tell him that this not how you treat your parents. He has no respect.\u201d</p><p>She pointed a shaky finger at the door. \u201cYou tell him that this is unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>Rome looked at me then at his mom. \u201cSure mom I\u2019ll tell him, but I\u2019m also going to tell you that you had no reason to lay into him like that. Who cares if he wants to wear jeans and have hair like a god damn Smurf? What matters is that he\u2019s here and he made an effort and Shaw took time out of her life, her busy schedule to make that happen for you and dad and you waited exactly three seconds before purposely picking at the scab, both of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Margot gasped but Rome wasn\u2019t done. \u201cYou and dad need a wakeup call. I could have just as easily come home in a body bag as a cast. You\u2019ve already lost one son, you need to appreciate the ones you have left regardless if you agree with the choices we\u2019re making or not.\u201d</p><p>The tears came harder and she leaned her head on my shoulder. \u201cShaw loves coming to visit on Sunday; we should just stop asking her to bring Rule because clearly he doesn\u2019t want to be here. I\u2019m done trying to make him be part of this family it just hurts too much.\u201d</p><p>Rome shook his head and both of us sighed he followed his brother out of the room as I continued to pat Margot on the shoulder. This woman had been kind to me, treated me as a daughter when my own had no use for me so what I was about to say to her came from a place of refusing to watch another family disintegrate in on its self.</p><p>\u201cMargot you and Dale are wonderful people and good parents but you have to stop living in the past. I\u2019m not going to come see you guys on Sunday anymore, not unless you guys figure out how to accept Rule for exactly who he is and love him anyway. I miss Remy and it was tragic how he died, but you are never going to turn Rule into him and I can\u2019t stand by and watch you continue to try. My parents have been forcing me into a mold that doesn\u2019t fit for years and I only wish I had enough will to refuse the way Rule does.\u201d</p> <p>I climbed to me feet and had to fight back my own tears when she looked at me with shock and dismay marked on her face.</p><p>\u201cIf Remy was here none of this would be happening. Rule would never have started acting so awful, you and he would still be so happy together and Rome never would have gone off and joined the stupid military.\u201d</p><p>I had to take a few steps away because there was so much wrong with that thinking that it nearly floored me. \u201cMargot, Rule was always a handful, he never just bowed to you and Dale\u2019s dictates, Rome was enlisted way before the accident and I\u2019ve told you a million times Remy was my best friend, we didn\u2019t have feelings for each other like that. I think you need to consider talking to a professional because you\u2019re rewriting history and while you\u2019re doing it you\u2019re losing a pretty terrific son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t honestly believe that? Rule is just as awful to you as he is to me and his father.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip and rubbed my temples harder. \u201cHe isn\u2019t awful; he\u2019s just harder to love. Remy made it easy for you guys, Rule never has but he deserves the effort and until this family can see that I have better ways to spend my time. If I wanted bickering and bitterness I would just go home. I love you and Dale, but I see what you\u2019re doing to Rule and I will not be a part of it anymore. Rome was right; you need to appreciate the family you have and not spend your life comparing them to the family you lost. Remy was my whole world, Margot but he\u2019s gone and Rule is here.\u201d</p> <p>She crossed her arms and flopped down on the table. I knew there would be no getting through to her so I went to go to the front door. I wasn\u2019t surprised to see Dale leaning against the kitchen counter, watching me with serious eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t going to do well without you coming by. You\u2019re an important part of this family.\u201d</p><p>I tucked the ends of hair behind my ears and gave him a rueful smile. \u201cSo is your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargot isn\u2019t the only one that needs to remember that, and you have to admit that hair is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>I laughed for real this time and walked over to give him a hug. \u201cShe needs help Dale. Remy\u2019s been gone for a while and all she wants to do is push Rule to take his place. That isn\u2019t going to happen, we all know that.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of my head and set me away from him. \u201cDon\u2019t know why you\u2019re always defending that boy; he\u2019s got a hot temper and a wild streak a mile long. You\u2019re a smart, beautiful girl you have to know how Rule\u2019s story ends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in skipping ahead Dale. I read the book all the way through. Tell Margot to give me a call when she calms down but I\u2019m serious about Sundays. Until it\u2019s an actually family gathering, until Rule stops being vilified for just being who he is and not who you want him to be I\u2019m not coming. This just hurts too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough little girl, but if you need anything you know we\u2019re just a phone call away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he wouldn\u2019t appreciate you falling on the sword for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not Dale, but it\u2019s my sword to fall on and even if nobody, including Rule himself can see it, he\u2019s worth it. I think so and I know Remy always thought so, you might want to try and remember that next time he shows up with pink hair.\u201d</p><p>I made my way to the drive way and paused when I saw the brothers with their heads bent close together. Rule looked mad and Rome looked sad, it was heartbreaking and impressive all at the same time. Rule saw me first and pulled away. They said something to one another in low tones and bumped fists. Rome pulled Rule into a one armed hug and made his way over to me. I received the same treatment with the addition of a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna put as many fires out here as I can over the next week or so and then make my way to the city. I\u2019ll hit you up when I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and convince your mom to get some help Rome, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you little girl, you try and keep that jackass out of trouble for me.\u201d</p><p>I brushed a kiss across his cheek in return. \u201cI always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was this bad, Shaw. I\u2019ve missed so much by being away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamilies are like anything else, they take work, patience and people willing to make it work, I\u2019m so very glad you came home Rome.\u201d</p><p>I moved away after another hug and tossed my keys at Rule. \u201cI have a headache can you drive back to the city?\u201d I normally never let him anywhere near my car, he had a lead foot and no regard for other drivers on the road, but I wasn\u2019t going to make it. I felt the headache growing into a migraine and all I wanted to do was close my eyes and crawl into a soft bed and pull the covers over my head. I got into the passenger seat and curled into a ball.</p><p>Rule didn\u2019t say anything as he turned the ignition on and headed us home. He left the radio off and didn\u2019t even try and bother with forced pleasantries. I knew he wouldn\u2019t apologize for the scene; he never did so I didn\u2019t even bring it up. I was drifting in and out of a little nap when Gabe\u2019s ringtone started to trill from my pocket. I swore which was something a rarely did and turned the stupid thing off. By now my stomach was in knots and I was seeing spots in front of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe calls you now more than when you were dating.\u201d Rule\u2019s voice was low and I wondered if he had any idea how much my head was hurting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pain. I told you he didn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a problem?\u201d I cracked an eye open because it was really out of character for him to even kind of show concern for me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it\u2019s only been a couple weeks and I think he misses the idea of me more than actually being with me. I keep thinking he\u2019ll get bored or find someone else and just go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you let somebody know if he becomes an issue. No girl should have to deal with that noise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d We lapsed back into silence again until he cleared his throat. I\u2019d known Rule long enough to know he was working his way up to something and I just needed to listen.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry about this morning, I\u2019m sorry about a lot of Sunday mornings. You don\u2019t need to keep seeing me at my worst; in fact it\u2019s not your job to see to me at all. I\u2019m done with forced family fun time it\u2019s not doing anything but driving the knife in deeper and I see that now. This drama has been building for years and it\u2019s not fair that you\u2019re still stuck in the middle of it without Remy to back you up. He loved you to death and I\u2019ve done a piss poor job honoring that.\u201d</p><p>I was in too much pain to argue the semantics of my relationship, or rather nonrelarionship with Remy to Rule yet again. No one in the Archer family seemed to get that we were friends, best friends and nothing more. The legend of our relationship had turned into a monster that I just couldn\u2019t combat especially when the tiny amount I had eaten for brunch was suddenly crawling back up my throat. I lurched forward and grabbed Rule\u2019s arm. It probably wasn\u2019t the smartest move since we were going ninety five on the freeway but I was about to toss my cookies in a car that cost more than some people made in a year.</p><p>\u201cPull over!\u201d Rule let out a string of curse words and hastily weaved around a minivan to the shoulder of the road. I got the door open and practically fell on my knees as I lost everything in a violent stream on the asphalt. Warm hands pulled my ponytail out the way and handed me a ragged bandana when I could finally breathe. I took the bottle of water he handed me and sat back on my heels while the world tilted in a bunch of different directions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I sloshed the water around and spit it out on the ground away from the tips of his black boots. \u201cMigraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you have those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince always. I need to lie down in the back.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me to my feet with a hand under my arm and I realized it was the first time in years he had ever deliberately touched me. We never hugged, never brushed against each other, never hi fived or shook hands; we were strictly in a hands-off type of relationship so my system almost revolted at the contact. I groaned as he practically shoved me back into the car. I was short so stretching out along the back seat wasn\u2019t a big deal. Rule got back behind the wheel and look at me over his shoulder. \u201cYou gonna make it the rest of the way?\u201d</p><p>I threw and arm over my eyes and placed a hand on my rolling belly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a choice. Just be ready to pull back over if I scream at you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back into traffic and was quiet for only a minute before demanding, \u201cDoes everyone know you get migraines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t get them very often, just when I\u2019m stressed out or not sleeping well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Remy know?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to sigh but I just answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something I couldn\u2019t hear and I felt him rather than saw him look back at me. \u201cHe never told me. He told me everything, even crap I had zero interest in hearing, he never shut up about you.\u201d</p><p>He was wrong, so very, very wrong but that was Remy\u2019s secret and even though he was gone I still would go to the grave with it. There was a lot Rule and Rome never knew about their brother, things that he was scared to share, things he battled with on a daily basis and the fact I had migraines and was irrevocably in love with Rule didn\u2019t even scratch the surface.</p><p>\u201cHe probably just forgot about it, like I said I don\u2019t get them very often and when you guys moved to Denver and I still had to finish high school he probably just forgot they happened because we didn\u2019t hangout as much anymore. They\u2019ve been worse the last few years.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to explain it was because Remy was gone and all the stress he balanced out for me was now my own to deal with. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat seems like kinda a big deal to slip his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContrary to what all you Archers have stuck in your head there was a lot more to Remy than our friendship and what was or was not going on with me.\u201d</p><p>He snorted loudly. \u201cYeah right. Remy was a different person after he found you. He was always a good guy, always the best of all of us but once you came along it was like he finally found his purpose. You gave him someone to care about without any of the bullshit baggage the rest of us had. You made him better.\u201d</p><p>My heart squeezed so tight in my chest I thought for a second everything inside me was going to turn inside out. \u201cWell he saved me so we made each other better.\u201d</p> <p>We fell into an uncomfortable silence again until the car stopped in front of his apartment complex. He turned in the seat and looked down at me. I peeked at him from under my arm. The blue in his eyes was all but swallowed up by the paler silver and gray. \u201cCan you get back to University Park or do you need me to take you? I can have Nash follow us since he\u2019s home from work.\u201d It was a nice offer, one I was surprised he extended, but I had had my fill of Archers for the day and the drive from Capitol Hill to University Park wasn\u2019t that bad on a Sunday in the early evening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it. It\u2019s not that far.\u201d I scrambled out of the back and had to lean on the door frame while he got out of the driver\u2019s seat. We were standing so close I could see the pulse in his throat thumping under the tattoo he had there of a humming bird. \u201cThanks though.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled and rubbed his hands roughly over his face. He took a step back and made sure I was looking him dead in the eye when he told me, \u201cI\u2019m serious about Sunday. Don\u2019t show up here next week expecting me to play nice. I\u2019m over it.\u201d</p><p>I snapped a salute with two fingers to my brow and let my body collapse in the seat he had just vacated. \u201cMessage received. My services as chauffer slash buffer are no longer needed, which means I probably won\u2019t be seeing you around. Try and take care of yourself Rule, seriously somebody has to.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door before he could say anything else and didn\u2019t even wait until he moved away from the car to put it in reverse and pull away from the apartment complex. It was a short drive to my own apartment that I shared with my best friend Ayden. I had met her freshman year when we shared a dorm room together. She was a chem major, worked at the same sports bar I did and totally had the patience to deal with all my endless neurotic crap. Her family background was no picnic either so I loved that I could always rely on her to be there for me, she was also smart as hell and it had taken her exactly zero seconds to figure the reason my social life was boring and that I could never commit to any of the guys I dated was because I was hung up on Rule Archer so when I came stumbling in hurting with tears in my eyes she put me to bed without questions and pulled the blinds in my room closed while she fetched me some pain killers and a giant glass of water.</p> <p>The bed depressed when she climbed up next to me as I kicked my peep toe heels off and tugged my belt through the loops on my slacks.</p><p>\u201cIt was bad today?\u201d Ayden was from Kentucky and her southern drawl rolled over me like a smoothing balm.</p><p>\u201cHe was with some skank again, he had a hickey the size of Alaska on his neck, my mortal enemy from high school hit on him at Starbucks and it took Margot and Dale less than a minute to insult his clothes and hair and remind him he is not now or never will be his dead twin brother. Luckily this time they left out his job and disregard for manners but he blew his top and stormed out. They\u2019ve all decided its best we no longer come up on Sunday making this the second family I\u2019ve been a part of that can\u2019t figure it out and just love and appreciate one another and to top it off Gabe has been blowing up my phone all day and I can\u2019t think of anyone I want to talk to less, so yeah it was really fucking bad today.\u201d</p><p>She brushed a hand over my hair and laughed softly. \u201cGirl, the situations you find yourself in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give him the key to his place back?\u201d</p> <p>I moaned a little and buried my head in the pillow. \u201cNo I totally spaced it but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m in any hurry to walk in on him and two girls at once again. Honestly I\u2019ll be super glad to never have to see Rule\u2019s pierced junk again.\u201d</p><p>She snickered a laugh at me and rolled over on to her back so that she was staring at the ceiling. Ayden\u2019s hair was as black as mine was blond and cut in a funky short pixie style. She had big whiskey colored eyes and a heart that was pure gold. Besides Remy she was the best friend I ever had and I loved her for not making me have to lay it all out for her to sift through. She just got it and while she might not understand how I spent my time equally loathing and loving a person that viewed me as nothing more than a nuisance, she never condemned or criticized me for it.</p><p>\u201cThat boy, he is a handful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe the space will be good for me. Maybe time away from the whole family will finally give me the breathing room to kill the way I\u2019ve always felt about him. I can\u2019t spend the rest of my life walking away from other people just because they aren\u2019t Rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry to see Gabe go, but you do deserve someone that treats you amazing and loves you in all the right ways. You\u2019ve earned it because no one I\u2019ve ever met in my whole life loves as freely and gives as much as you do and seeing as those parents of yours might as well be carved out of ice that\u2019s just a damn miracle. You\u2019re a good girl Shaw and at the very least you deserve a good guy.\u201d</p><p>I folded my hands together and laid my cheek down. My head was slowly starting to stop throbbing and all I wanted to do was take a nap and maybe work on processing everything that happened today.</p><p>Ayden was right, I did deserve a good guy, I knew what one looked like, knew what one acted like in fact I had been best friends with the ultimate good guy. Remy embodied everything any sane girl would want in a boyfriend and yet I had never had those feelings for him, not once. I remembered clearly the first time he had taken me home with him. I was thirteen and having a really hard time fitting in with all the preppy, rich kids my first year of high school. I knew now that image and brands mattered, but then I just wanted to wear jeans and my hair in a ponytail. Remy had been seventeen and captain of the football team. He found me crying in the girl\u2019s locker room one day after a particularly nasty verbal beat down from Amy and her crew. He didn\u2019t make fun of me, didn\u2019t ask questions or get all weird because I was a freshman and he was a junior he just bundled me up and carted me home with him because I was sad and alone and he didn\u2019t want me to be either of those things ever again. He told me he could tell by my eyes that I was a kind person, that I needed someone to look out for me and from that minute on he decided he would be the person to do it. I remembered all the warm and fuzzy feelings that came with that moment, remembered the gratitude and overwhelming joy I felt at finally having someone see how worthy and deserving of unconditional love I was, but what I remembered most was everything inside me going upside down when Rule walked into the kitchen and titled his chin up at me and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s the chick?\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped beating, my lungs felt like they were going to collapse; my skin was suddenly too tight all over my body and I couldn\u2019t form a rational thought or a coherent sentence. Of course then I chalked it up to a silly teenage crush, all the Archer boys were good looking and had qualities that made them larger than life and every girl I knew had to have a prerequisite infatuation with a bad boy at one time or another, of course they normally grew out of it when they realized the bad boy was just an ass and they deserved to be treated better, but as time went on and as things changed my feelings never did. It was clear they were never going to be returned, Rule only saw me as Remy\u2019s little tag along, as a spoiled little rich girl and then as we got older as Remy\u2019s girlfriend, which sucked because I had never been any of those things and as a result I sabotaged relationships, turned down guy after guy simply because I didn\u2019t want a good guy, I wanted the one that was damaged and blind to the way I felt.</p> <p>I was a good girl, I was loyal and honest, and I worked hard and invested a lot of time and energy in building a secure future for myself. I stayed out of trouble and went out of my way to try and be the polished and perfect daughter my parents wanted me to be and the successful driven woman the Archers had given me the confidence to be, what I never spent any time being was the person that I actually felt like I was. She was locked somewhere deep inside of me, suffocating and still holding on to the hope that Rule would notice she was alive. It was exhausting and on the vulnerable moments when I was brutally honest with myself I had to admit I wasn\u2019t sure how much longer I could keep it up.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Rule</p><p>It was a crazy busy week at the shop. I think mostly because we were right in the thick of tax refund time and people that had extra money to spend often wanted to spend it on ink. I was booked with back to back appointments all the way through Saturday and even went in on Monday night to work on a guy\u2019s sleeve I had started a few months ago because I just didn\u2019t have any room in my schedule to fit him in. Nash was just as booked as I was, so when Saturday night rolled around we were both ready to let loose and tie one on. Sunday afternoon went about the same as last week only this time I walked the girl to her car and didn\u2019t have to worry about Shaw bursting in on a scene I didn\u2019t want her to see. I called Rome to see when he was going to come to town, but apparently things at home weren\u2019t any better after last week so he wasn\u2019t ready to leave mom on her own yet. I wanted to care, wanted to feel bad for her but I just couldn\u2019t muster it up.</p><p>I was getting ready to crack open a beer and plop in front of the flat screen to relax and watch the game when Nash came out of his room pulling on a hoodie and a black ball cap over his shaved head. He was a few inches shorter than me, built a lot stocker but in all actuality was a hell of a lot better looking. He kept his black hair shaved close to the scalp because he had twin tattoos on the side of his head and bright, bright eyes that looked more purple than blue and stood out starkly against his much darker complexion. He didn\u2019t have as much metal in his face as I did, just a hoop through the center of his nose and both ears sporting obsidian gauges, and for whatever reason he kept his hands and neck free of ink, which always made me laugh because of the stuff permanently marked on his head. We were a matched set so when we went out together it was usually a given we wouldn\u2019t have to come home alone. Nash was a much nicer guy than I was, he just looked several degrees more badass.</p><p>\u201cJet and Rowdy are at The Goal Line watching the game. They wanna hangout if you\u2019re game.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy worked at the shop with us and Jet was the lead singer of a local metal band we liked to go see play. They often rounded out the group that Nash and I traveled in and going to the bar to watch the game sounded a lot more fun than brooding on the couch by myself. So I put my beer back in the fridge and shoved my feet into my black boots. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nash drove a fully restored 73\u2019 Dodge Charger. It was a monster of black, chrome and motor. I was pretty sure everyone in the apartment complex knew whenever we were coming or going because it was just that loud and rumbly but it was a cool ride and I knew it meant a lot to him because he had done the rebuild mostly by himself. Nash\u2019s background was a little sketchy, but since my own was less than stellar I never really pushed him to talk about it. I knew his dad had died when he was really young and that his mom had remarried some rich asshole that to this day Nash refused to have anything to do with. Phil, the same Phil that let us make his shop our own, had been integral in getting Nash to adulthood without a criminal record and a whole pack of illegitimate kids.</p><p>The bar was in lower downtown or LoDo as the locals called it. It was a popular hangout for mostly locals and industry people and since I hadn\u2019t been around on a Sunday in years I forgot how packed it could be when the Broncos played. The guys had a table in the back right under a massive flat screen and already had glasses and a pitcher of beer waiting. Fist bumps and head nods for greeting went around the table as a raucous cheer went up in the packed bar as the Broncos scored.</p><p>\u201cWhat up fellas?\u201d Nash poured us a round as we settled in. Rowdy wiggled his eyebrows up and down and motioned to a spot over his shoulder towards the bar.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this better than family time? Nobody wants to see mom dressed like that.\u201d</p> <p>The girls that worked in the bar were all dressed in sexy sports themed uniforms, some were super sexy cheerleaders, some were in really small jerseys and hot pants that laced up like football pants and my favorites were dressed in little tiny referee outfits that barley covered their bottoms. It was hot and way better than getting torn to pieces by my parents just for breathing.</p><p>\u201cNo they sure don\u2019t.\u201d It was nice to just chill and spend time with the guys when normally Sunday\u2019s were the worst part of the week but today was awesome and even if I felt a twinge at my selfishness I knew enough beer would squash it.</p><p>Jet looked up from the plate of nachos he was steadily demolishing and pointed a finger over his shoulder towards the bar. \u201cWait until you see the chick waiting on us. Dude, just dude there aren\u2019t even words.\u201d</p><p>Jet\u2019s band Enmity was pretty big in the local scene and I knew from firsthand experience he had his pick of groupies and rock chicks so if he was impressed than the girl was probably a dead 10 and I couldn\u2019t wait to check her out. We chatted and pounded the pitcher away in under a half hour and the guys were getting louder and rowdier but it was a good time and we needed another round sooner than later. I had yet to see the elusive waitress of hotness when the hair on the back of my neck went up and I suddenly snapped to attention. There was a blond making her way towards the table. She had on the requisite referee outfit complete with ruffly little black shorts and fishnet stockings. She also was wearing a pair of black boots that looked a hell of a lot like my own, only girly and they went up seriously awesome legs to rest below her knees. The hair was so blond it was almost white and instead of being in a sleek, low ponytail like I was used to it was in twin pigtails on either side of her head and startled green eyes were looking at me from under razor straight bangs. Her mouth was a bright slash of red against a pale face I was as familiar with as my own and while I struggled with recognition my idiot friends were leering at her while Nash was climbing to his feet to enfold her in a bear hug.</p><p>\u201cHey girl, what are you doing here?\u201d Shaw gave a little squeal as she returned my roommates hug but her eyes never left mine.</p> <p>\u201cUh I work here, I have for a while. I normally have Sunday\u2019s off but since my schedule changed and it\u2019s busy I picked it up. What are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><p>I knew the question was directed at me but I was still too stunned at how different she looked to respond. Nash left an arm around her shoulder and pointed at our friends. \u201cThe guy with the goatee is Rowdy; he works at the shop with me and Rule. The guy shoving his face full of nachos is Jet, he sings for Enmity. Guy\u2019s this is Shaw, she grew up with Rule and his brothers.\u201d</p><p>I watched in a mixture of awe and repulsion as my friends practically fell over themselves to shake the hand she extended. I still hadn\u2019t said anything and it was starting to get awkward but she just smiled and picked up the empty pitcher and told us she would be back with another in a few minutes. All four sets of eyes followed the swish of her hair and the ruffles on her ass as she walked away and I wanted to punch everyone, including myself in the face. As soon as she was out of earshot Rowdy turned on me and reached across the table to smack me upside the head with the flat of his hand. I swore and glared at him but made no move to retaliate.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and pointed a finger at me. \u201cThat\u2019s the girl you complain about driving home with every weekend? That\u2019s the girl you whine endlessly about walking in on you when you\u2019re acting the fool? That\u2019s the girl you dodge calls from and avoid like the plague? Geez Rule I never knew you were gay.\u201d</p><p>Nash snickered and Jet busted out in a full belly laugh. I flipped Rowdy off and narrowed my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cShut up. You don\u2019t have any idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I have eyes and that chick is killer so either you\u2019re blind or stupid because if I was cooped up in a car with her for two hours every week I\u2019d be thanking God not bitching about it.\u201d</p><p>Nash shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t know she worked here. Do you really just ignore everything she says to you?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know either and you talk to her when she comes over on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask her if she wants coffee, not how she makes a living. Dude admit it, you suck.\u201d</p><p>I was going to argue but he kept going, \u201cAnd she is hot, she\u2019s always been hot you just don\u2019t like her so you can\u2019t see it. She looks good in all that fancy crap she\u2019s normally in, but man in that uniform...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her fine.\u201d I refused to comment on her hotness or lack of because that was weird to me. Of course I had eyes in my head so I knew logically she was a beautiful girl, but she always seemed so cold and so untouchable that I never really thought of her as attractive more like an impressive work of art that was meant for viewing in a museum rather than every day enjoyment.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie. You two can\u2019t stand each other.\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged a little. \u201cShe\u2019s like family. You know how I feel about my family.\u201d</p><p>Jet lifted an eyebrow, \u201cI wish my family had members that looked like that.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cKnock it off. Stop being a creeper.\u201d</p><p>She came back with not one pitcher but two and a plate of wings. She smiled at Nash and the other guys but when her bright gaze landed on me the shudders came down. \u201cThese are on me. I just can\u2019t help myself from trying to make sure you eat on Sunday.\u201d She turned away with a flip of her pale hair and moseyed over to another table full of middle aged guys in ill-fitting jerseys. I narrowed my eyes when one of them put his hand on her ruffle covered butt. Clearly used to it Shaw flashed that killer grin and easily side stepped the groper. It was such a different way to see her that when she walked past the table again clearly intent on ignoring me I reached out and grabbed her arm.</p><p>Her eyes flashed an emerald spark as she looked at the tattooed fingers I had wrapped around her wrist. I was surprised when a jolt shot all the way up to my shoulder at the contact. I lifted both eyebrows at her and gave her a nasty sneer.</p><p>\u201cDo your parents know you work here, and what about Margot? I have a hard time believing any of the adults you try so hard to impress daily know that you\u2019re prancing around here half naked.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at me and shook my hand off. \u201cNo, my parents don\u2019t know because they\u2019ve never asked and Margot knows I work in sports bar but she doesn\u2019t know what the uniform looks like and I\u2019m not even close to being half naked. Leave me alone, Rule. My roommate works here too and she\u2019s giving me the look that means she\u2019s about to call in the troops. Unless you want to be carted out of here by three very big bouncers you\u2019ll keep your hands to yourself and your trap shut. I like Nash, he\u2019s always been nice enough to me, but I have no problem getting you and the rest of your friends 86\u2019ed if you continue to piss me off.\u201d</p><p>We glared at each other in a hostile standoff until one of her other tables flagged her down.</p><p>\u201cJust one weekend.\u201d I frowned at her as she muttered the words so low I almost didn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Those eyes blazed so much at me I couldn\u2019t even pick out one solid emotion. \u201cJust one weekend I wanted a break from dealing with you.\u201d She flounced away from me and for the first time since I had met her I realized maybe spending time with me was as much a pain for her as it was for me. When I turned back to my friends they were all looking at me with a mixture of pity and awe. My scowl darkened even more as I chugged back my full beer in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I could hear the surliness in my tone.</p><p>\u201cDude, what\u2019s the deal with that?\u201d Rowdy was the one who asked the question but Nash and Jet both looked like they wanted to ask the same thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Nash lifted up his beer to hide a smile. \u201cYou looked like you both wanted to box each other or tear each other\u2019s clothes off and go at it right in the middle of the bar. What gives with that, I thought she bugged you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does. She\u2019s rich and spoiled; we don\u2019t agree on anything, we never have.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy gave me a look that outright called bullshit on my claim. \u201cI know what I saw and there is no way that if that girl didn\u2019t offer it up you wouldn\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to yell at him that he was wrong, so very wrong because before she was any of the things that annoyed me and got under my skin, she was Remy\u2019s and there was nothing in heaven or hell that would make me forget that. Pulling in my temper I poured another beer and lapsed into a moody silence. I wasn\u2019t attracted to Shaw, it was just seeing her in a new environment, seeing her in something other than her fancy outfits that cost more than I made in a month that had the tension between us reading to other people as something else.</p><p>We were almost to the bottom of the second pitcher and silently Shaw had dropped of a replacement when a really pretty girl with super short dark hair suddenly appeared at the edge of the table. She was tall and had eyes the color of Jack Daniels but there was nothing on her lovely face that came across as welcoming. She had a mouth that would give Angelia Jolie a run for her money and a body that was meant to stop traffic displayed in all its glory in a matching uniform to Shaw\u2019s only instead of kick ass boots she had on a pair of spiked heels that probably made her taller than Nash and Jet.</p><p>Jet sat up straighter and Rowdy, who was by far the drunkest of all of us since he had started adding shots of tequila twenty minutes ago, almost fell off his stool when she posted up at the table between the two of them. Her gaze was trained directly on me though so I met her look for look until she finally spoke. She had a soft southern twang and I could swear I saw Jet fall in love on the spot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re Rule.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question so I just nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ayden Cross. I live with Shaw.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure why that was supposed to matter to me so I kept silent while my best friend whipped his head around to glare at me. I was being kind of rude, but I was buzzed and still pissed at Shaw so I didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what your deal is but leave her alone. She doesn\u2019t need you screwing with her head anymore so just back off.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked because I honestly had no clue what this babe was going on about. \u201cI don\u2019t mess with Shaw.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes and pointed a finger at me. \u201cI know exactly what you do and don\u2019t do Tattoo Boy. I adore Shaw. She\u2019s sweet, nice and the best roommate ever so you need to just go do your troubled, bad boy act somewhere else, she doesn\u2019t need it...\u201dIt looked like she was gearing up to lay into me even more but something caught her eye and suddenly her eyes were glowing with gold fire. \u201cOh my God! I cannot believe that asshole had the nerve to show up here. I need to go get Lou.\u201d She spun on her heel and marched through the crowd leaving me reeling. I had no clue what she was talking about but clearly something had crawled up her butt so I looked over my shoulder and felt every protective cell I had suddenly come alive.</p><p>Shaw was standing by the bar . It was crowded but her white blond hair was unmistakable. So was the fact that she looked stressed and freaked out while a guy in a white polo shirt crowed her into the edge of the bar. He had a hand on her shoulder and was leaning down into her face, and whatever he was saying made her look like she wanted to punch him in the nuts or puke on his shoes. I\u2019d never seen the look of panic on her face like that before; she was normally so cool and unflappable that against my better judgment I was climbing to my feet. I wasn\u2019t the type to give two shits about a damsel in distress, but this damsel I knew for a fact could take care of herself and if she looked like she was struggling, despite how I felt about her I was going to intervene. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second.\u201d</p><p>Since I was tall and had a good portion of visible skin covered in designs that cried \u2018don\u2019t mess with me\u2019 I didn\u2019t have to worry about people in the crowded bar moving out of my way. When I got close enough her eyes snapped to me and I was pretty sure I saw relief flood into the sparkly green depths. Polo shirt leaned in even closer to her and I thought I heard him say something about how things were going to look when he went home alone over winter break. I saw her stiffen and try to pull away but polo shirt just moved in to more fully keep her pinned against the bar.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what my mother told you, Gabe. We\u2019re over; I have no interest in going to Aspen with you or your family. Stop calling me and stop showing up where I\u2019m at.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaby, we\u2019re meant for each other and once you stop being stubborn you\u2019ll see how great we could be together.\u201d I hated guys that called girls baby. Baby was what you used when you didn\u2019t remember the girls name or you were just too lazy to come up with your own nickname for her.</p><p>She wiggled a little more and I noticed the way the guy\u2019s followed the deep vee of her revealing outfit.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me Gabe. I didn\u2019t want to be with you like that when we were dating, I sure as hell don\u2019t want to be with you like that now. Leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Polo shirt got red in the face at her blatant rejection. He was about to lean even farther into her, about to put his other hand on her when I reached out and grabbed her wrist and tugged her free. Polo shirt was a good four inches shorter than me so I tucked Shaw\u2019s small frame under my arm and glared at him over the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late Casper.\u201d Without missing a beat she put an arm around my waist and practically collapsed into my side. I had used the nickname to tease her when we were younger because her hair was almost white and knew she hated it, now it sounded intimate and personal like we had some kind of secret polo shirt wasn\u2019t in on.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ve got an hour or so left of my shift can you hangout until I\u2019m off?\u201d Her eyes were pleading with me to play along but I was too busy wondering why my side felt like it was on fire where we touched.</p> <p>\u201cNo problem, who\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>Polo shirt was glaring at me and turning an alarming shade of red. He didn\u2019t even give Shaw a chance to respond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her boyfriend, Gabe Davenport. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>Shaw went stiff next to me and I felt her fingers clutch the back of my shirt.</p><p>\u201cGabe this is Rule Archer, Rule that\u2019s Gabe my EX boyfriend, only he\u2019s having a hard time getting the ex-part down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw, get away from him. What are you thinking? You can\u2019t possibly think anyone is going to believe you would go from me to someone like him, can you? Just look at him, he\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p><p>I was immune to the someone like him tactic, I heard it all the time but apparently Shaw wasn\u2019t. She bristled like a wet cat and made a move like she was going to poke the guy in the chest but I wrapped her back up against my side and subtly tried to calm her down by rubbing a hand up and down her bare arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Rule most of my life, Gabe. I could care less what he looks like because he isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s puppet and the same thing cannot be said about you. Don\u2019t think you can stand there and judge him or judge me, not when you\u2019re practically stalking me and trying to bully me into a relationship by manipulating my parents because you know they like you. Ayden is here and you can bet your ass if she saw you she\u2019s going to go get Lou. Lou doesn\u2019t like to see his girls upset so unless you want a scene that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll never live down go away and don\u2019t come back. You can call my mom, talk to my dad all you want, I don\u2019t want to be with you and nothing is going to change that.\u201d</p> <p>He looked like he was gearing up to keep fighting but there was a sudden surge towards the bar knocking Shaw even further into my embrace and I took full advantage by pulling her small frame completely in line with mine. The girl was rocking some serious curves and I wondered what in the hell I had been smoking to miss it right up until then.</p><p>\u201cWe got a problem bro?\u201d She pulled away from me slightly with a scowl and put her hands in the center of my chest to get a little space.</p><p>\u201cYeah, bro we do, but now isn\u2019t the time or the place and I don\u2019t have time to mess around with a peon like you. Shaw I\u2019ll see you later, this isn\u2019t done.\u201d</p><p>He shoulder checked me and sent us a double glare as he pushed around us. I gave Shaw a squeeze and let her take a step back but kept my hands loosely at her waist. I was watching polo shirt walk away and trying to catch Nash\u2019s eye over her head. She let out a breath that fluttered against my throat and sent a chill running across my skin.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. That guy needs to get a clue.\u201d Nash finally looked up and I jerked my head toward the door where polo shirt had just exited. He gave me a slight nod and said something to Rowdy and Jet which had the two of them climbing to their feet as well. I saw Shaw\u2019s dark haired roommate hanging by the door with a mountain of a man. She gave my friends an odd look as they filed out the door but didn\u2019t say anything. I dug my AMX out of my wallet and put it in Shaw\u2019s hand. Her luminous eyes were watching me curiously.</p><p>\u201cClose our tab out on that, will ya? I\u2019ll be back in just a second.\u201d</p><p>She took the card and fell back a step. I tried not to notice what it did to her chest when she crossed her arms over her breasts.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo run an errand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave Gabe alone, Rule. He isn\u2019t like you and Rome. He was born to be a politician. Threats and intimidation don\u2019t mean anything to a guy like that, just forget about him. The idea that I would leave him for a guy with tattoos and purple hair is enough of a blow to his ego to get him to leave me alone for a while, trust me. Besides I\u2019ll talk to Lou the bouncer, if I tell him that Gabe is harassing me they\u2019ll 86 him for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook Rome would kick my ass to Nebraska if he found out some douche bag was giving you trouble and I didn\u2019t say something, plus I hate guys that think they can just do whatever they want to a girl because he has an in with the parents. I\u2019ll be back in a second, just close our tab and hold on to the card in case you have to bail one or all of us out of jail.\u201d</p><p>I thought it was funny but she didn\u2019t even crack a smile. She was just looking at me like I had suddenly grown another head and I needed to get a move on it before the asshat left.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Shaw. Seriously, I got this.\u201d</p><p>I set her fully away from me and moved around her to follow the guys out the front door. The pretty roommate caught my eye and lifted a brow. \u201cMaybe you have redeeming qualities after all, Archer.\u201d</p><p>I flipped her off, because well that\u2019s what I do and made my way to the edge of the block where Nash and the boys were leaning against a white Lexus. A very nervous looking polo shirt was pacing back and forth in front of them threatening to call the cops waving his I-Phone around and asking repeatedly if they had any idea who his dad was. I tucked my hands in my front pockets and cocked my head to the side. I could see why Shaw\u2019s parents were all about this guy, he was alright looking if you went for a dude that looked like Banana Republic threw up all over him. He actually had coloring similar to mine, dark hair minus the purple and spikes, and light blue eyes, but he oozed entitlement and vanity in a way only the idle rich could. He was custom made to be the husband that had a piece on the side while the pretty wife smiled for the cameras during election time, and while my relationship with Shaw tended to be tumultuous at best, I knew on a soul deep level that she deserved better than whatever this slime ball was selling.</p><p>\u201cHey polo shirt slow down a minute I just wanna talk to you for a second.\u201d He was in the middle of telling Nash that he was going to sue him for this or that and that his dad was judge so they would throw the book at him when he finally noticed I joined the party. He lowered his wildly flailing arms and glared at me.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are, you know. Shaw might think she\u2019s clever but she has a picture of all three of you boys in her room on her nightstand and her parents have told me multiple times about her unhealthy attachment to you and your family. Her father has even threatened to stop paying for school for her if she keeps showing such questionable judgment in who she spends time with, this little encounter might just seal the deal.\u201d I had to give the creep credit. On my own I was a fairly intimidating guy, surrounded by guys that were just as big and a hell of a lot more used to physical violence than he obviously was, the little puke held his ground. \u201cI don\u2019t know what her fascination with a freak like you is, but it\u2019s time for her to outgrow it. She belongs with someone like me, not someone that can\u2019t go through a metal detector without clearing out their face.\u201d</p><p>Nash snickered and Rowdy laughed outright. I just shook my head a little and lifted up my mouth in a twisted grin. \u201cI think she belongs with someone more interested in getting into her pants than into her daddy\u2019s wallet. Shaw\u2019s a good girl and she has a good head on her shoulders. The fact she wouldn\u2019t let you even round first base in six months is pretty telling bro. From the sounds of it you would have better luck taking her folks on a date than her. Look she\u2019s like family and I don\u2019t like it when people mess with my family. This is a friendly little chat because we\u2019re on a public street and I\u2019m feeling generous, next time it won\u2019t be public and my generosity has a time limit. Leave her alone, end of story.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked like he wanted to argue, wanted to say something back put the mountain of a human being that was clearly the bouncer for the bar came around the corner. He looked at the guys on the car and the heated polo shirt and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cEnough. You four go back in, Ayden told me what was going on so your tab is on me. You,\u201d he pointed a meaty finger at Gabe. \u201cYou are no longer allowed at the Goal Line, consider yourself 86\u2019ed. If Shaw doesn\u2019t want you here I don\u2019t care how much you got in your wallet or what kinda pull your old man has this is my house and you aren\u2019t welcome. Next time you want to get all up on one of my girls, put your hands on them you won\u2019t have to worry about these guys because I\u2019ll make sure they never find your body, understand?\u201d</p><p>Even I didn\u2019t question that this monster meant business so polo shirt gulped and nodded his head slightly. My boys pushed off the car and Nash \u2018accidentally\u2019 shoved into him as they made their way over to where I was standing. Gabe swore and jumped into his car. He pulled away from the curb and flipped us all the bird as he squealed into traffic. The bouncer looked me up and down and flicked his impassive gaze over our motley crew.</p><p>\u201cYou friends with Shaw?\u201d</p> <p>I mean we weren\u2019t friends exactly but it was as close as any other explanation so I shrugged and answered, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m Lou. I look out for the girls that work here, Shaw and Ayden just happen to be two of my favorites. They\u2019re good girls; work hard here and at school. They aren\u2019t here just to show their asses and get into trouble and I respect that. I don\u2019t let anyone mess with those two; in fact I take it personally when someone tries to.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure why he was telling me all this but frankly he was one scary mother so I kept my mouth shut and just kept making eye contact.</p><p>\u201cShaw is a sweet kid but she tries to do too much by herself and if that asshole keeps bothering her she\u2019ll just suffer it in silence.\u201d Now he was looking at me pointedly so I lifted an eyebrow. \u201cI wanna know if something needs to be done about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw and I aren\u2019t exactly close like that. She wouldn\u2019t tell me something like that. You might want to have this talk with her roommate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m having it with you, son.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to that but just as I was about to say something sarcastic back the doors to the bar opened and the middle aged guys in the jerseys came spilling out and got between us. Lou gave me one last direct look that I couldn\u2019t help but take as him meaning business and went back inside. I looked back at my friends and sorta threw my hands up in the air.</p><p>\u201cSee what you miss when I go out of town on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>All three of them burst into laughter and Jet decided it was time for us to move onto another bar so I had to run in and get my card from Shaw. The guys pitched in ten bucks each for me to give her as a tip so I wound my way back to the bar where she was talking to another waitress; this one had honey-gold colored hair and was dressed in the cheerleader uniform. Shaw stopped midsentence and looked at me through narrow eyes, I grinned at her and handed her the money. \u201cYou bouncer friend picked up our tab but the boys wanted to make sure you got taken care of.\u201d</p><p>She handed me the AMX card back. \u201cWhat did you do to Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She sighed and I didn\u2019t even try to not watch the way it stretched her tiny little uniform across her chest.</p> <p>\u201cWell thanks for intervening; I don\u2019t know what his problem is.\u201d</p><p>The cheerleader was having sex with me with her eyes, and while I was normally totally a fan of hot chicks doing that to me I barely even registered her because Shaw was bending over to get her drinks and the ruffles on her butt were suddenly the only thing I could see. She was short so I never really thought about her having such great legs, but they were toned and curved just right and given enough time I could work up some seriously awesome fantasies involving those legs and those boots and nothing else.</p><p>\u201cHis problem is you\u2019re hot, richer than hell, have parents that are connected out the ass and you wouldn\u2019t put out. You not only left him physically hard up but blue-balled his visions of playing golf with your dad at the country club and sitting next to your mom at the republican convention. You dismantled everything he was trying to build.\u201d</p><p>She flipped one of her pig-tails out and picked up a tray full of drinks. \u201cI gotta get back to work. You think we can ever have a Sunday not filled drama and fights?\u201d</p><p>I ran a hand over my messy hair and shook my head ruefully. \u201cSunday\u2019s have never been a great day for me. I\u2019ll catch you later, Shaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Rule.\u201d</p><p>I made my way back out of the bar thinking that it was probably the first time since I had met her when she was just a kid that I had ever seen Shaw be Shaw and it made me a little nervous that when she didn\u2019t have all her guards up and all her haughty defense mechanisms in place she seemed so fallible, so undeniably human, so approachable and so...attainable.</p><p>Chapter 4</p> <p>Shaw</p><p>I counted the pile of money in front of me for the fifth time. I was having a hard time concentrating for a couple reasons; one was that the bar had gotten busy so I had stayed two hours past when I was scheduled off so I was dragging, the second was that there were ten other girls all trying to cash out around and the chatter was like a swarm of bees buzzing about purses and boys, the third was Ayden kept watching me like a hawk, looking for something but I didn\u2019t know what and the final was that Loren Decker, my post high school Amy Rogers wouldn\u2019t stop talking my ear off about Rule.</p><p>Loren was a living, breathing centerfold and was what happened when mean girls left high school and entered the real world. She was vapid, boring and made more money than most of us combined when she was on the schedule because her job was to be flirty and come across easy things that were hardly a stretch and for some reason she was dying to get every single detail I possessed about Rule. She wanted to know how I knew him, wanted to know how come he had never been in the bar before, wanted to know how old he was, what he did for a living, if we were dating, if he had a girlfriend, if he liked blonds and so on and so forth. It was endless, exhausting and I think it bothered me that yet another bimbo was just tripping over herself to fall on him. While I knew my feelings for him were my burden to bear alone, I wasn\u2019t about to offer up my slutty coworker on a platter so I just kept grunting responses and evading all the personal questions, which unfortunately didn\u2019t stop her from rambling about how gook looking he was.</p><p>\u201cI mean I don\u2019t normally go for guys with all those tattoos and piercings like that, but oh my God those eyes, have you ever seen anything like them? They\u2019re like glacial ice, so pretty! And his body, I bet he works out, I mean I normally like a guy with a six pack but that tall lean thing totally works with his look. What kind of girls does he normally go for? Are you sure he doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend? Seriously Shaw I just want to lick that hoop he has in the side of his lip, like so freaking bad. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been friends with someone that sexy and haven\u2019t gotten a piece, that\u2019s like against nature.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t gotten a piece of anyone ever, not that she needed to know that. Guys had tried, I had been tempted but every time I was close to sealing the deal my brain short circuited and reminded me that they weren\u2019t who I really wanted and I shut down like a light going off. I looked up at her and narrowed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cLore I\u2019m trying to do my cash out, can this wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me his number.\u201d I was close to losing it and ready to shove the pile of ones down her throat when Ayden must have sensed the storm brewing. She settled in the seat next to me and leveled the blond with a dark look. There was just something about Ayden that made people pay attention to her, whatever it was I loved her for it.</p><p>\u201cLore give the girl a break. It\u2019s not like their besties. If you wanted to ask him out you should\u2019ve done it while he was here.\u201d</p><p>She made a face that probably made guys buy her things but made me want to roll my eyes. \u201cI would\u2019ve but he was too busy checking out Shaw\u2019s ass, that\u2019s why I asked what was going on between them. I mean he didn\u2019t even give you a hug or anything when he left but you looked at each other like you were about to start making out any second.\u201d</p><p>Startled I looked up at Ayden. Since when did Rule who normally ignored me, or pretended I didn\u2019t exist start checking anything on me out? She lifted her eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIf Shaw runs into him any time in the near future I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll pass it along that you want his number or she can just give him yours if he\u2019s interested, now let\u2019s talk about something really important, what do you want to do for your birthday? It\u2019s only two weeks away.\u201d</p><p>I groaned and gave up on trying to get an accurate count out. Instead I just handed the money to Ayden and started sorting and stapling the credit card slips which took far less brain power. I hated my birthday. Normally it was a fight between which parent and step parent I was going to spend an awkward dinner with, that was when they bothered to remember, last year I just got a card from dad with a check for a grand in it and a call from my mother with a promise of something when she found time, there was never time. Ayden had ended up taking me for sushi and we went to see some stupid romantic comedy and the day went by lack luster and unmemorable. Even the Archers tended to be low key on my birthday I think it reminded them that another year had passed and that Remy was still gone. Rome always sent me something from whatever part of the world he was in and to this date those were always my favorite gifts. I guess since I was turning twenty this year I should try and make a big deal about it, I just didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go dancing?\u201d I looked at Loren like she had grown a third head. I didn\u2019t really socialize with the girls from work, not because I didn\u2019t like them, some of them were really sweet and most of them were just like me and Ayden struggling to pay bills and balance college, but they were normally young adults into drinking, partying, meeting guys, going out and doing all the things that just didn\u2019t register for me. I didn\u2019t need any more people in the world thinking I was fundamentally broken so I just avoided those social interactions.</p><p>\u201cUh I don\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>Ayden scowled at the blond. \u201cPlus who invited you?\u201d</p><p>She blinked heavily lashed eyes and wrinkled her nose. \u201cI thought maybe since it\u2019s your birthday Mr. Tall, Dark and Tattooed would be around. I\u2019m telling you ladies I\u2019m in stage four lust and it can\u2019t be cured.\u201d</p><p>Ayden and I shared a look and I went back to my stapling. \u201cNo, my birthday isn\u2019t a big deal so Rule won\u2019t be around. I like to keep it low key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean boring.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t friends with Loren, in fact I wasn\u2019t even particularly fond of her so I was about to tell to stick her where the sun didn\u2019t shine which was totally against character for me, but Ayden just kept on talking like Loren wasn\u2019t even there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on Shaw, let\u2019s do something fun. You know your parents are just going to stress you out and you only turn twenty once. It should be fun and exciting.\u201d She had a glimmer in her amber eyes that I knew she was cooking something up that I would be hard pressed to talk her out of. I shoved the piles of paper into the drop bag and took the money Ayden handed me and did my tally. We always made good money, but for whatever reason today had been very profitable. I pulled my hair out of the ties and raked my nails across my scalp.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later, okay? I just want to find Lou to walk us out in case Gabe decided to show back up and head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he will?\u201d</p><p>She hooked her arm through mine and we made our way to the main entrance. \u201cDo you think he would have the nerve to do that? I mean Rule and his friends seemed pretty intent on getting the point across that he back off and Lou told him to scram or he was gonna call the cops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ayd. He\u2019s acting crazy. I never would have thought he would show up here and try and be all grabby and in my face. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anymore. I mean it isn\u2019t like we had some great romance and I left him heart broken or anything. We were lukewarm on our best days. Rule thinks he\u2019s embarrassed that I dumped him plain and simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably right.\u201d</p><p>I made a face as Lou escorted us to my car. We said goodbye and headed home. I was trying so hard to make decisions that were best for everyone, I wanted Rule to have the love and support of his family, I wanted Margot to get help and stop vilifying her son, I wanted Gabe to get over his deal and just move on and mostly I just wanted to have everyone else be okay so I could stop feeling so responsible for it all.</p><p>The next week went by in a blur. I had two tests, I picked up an extra shift at work and I was doing a very complicated game of dodge the ex because Gabe also went to DU and even though he was prelaw and typically on the other end of campus for some reason he seemed to be popping up around every corner. He called me at least twice a day and I was considering getting a new number but it seemed like such a hassle that I just sent his calls to voicemail and got really good at pretending I didn\u2019t seem him.</p><p>Rome called and said Margot wasn\u2019t doing any better. She was flat out refusing to go see a grief counselor and was now blaming Rule for the fact that I refused to come to Brookside on the weekends. According to him she was insisting he had somehow brain washed me and turned me against her. He wasn\u2019t comfortable leaving her alone just yet even though Rule was harassing him to come and hangout I could tell he was feeling the familiar tug I often felt of being caught between his brother and his mom. I was bummed he wasn\u2019t going to be around on my birthday but he had so much on his plate I didn\u2019t say anything.</p> <p>When the weekend rolled around I was tempted to give my Sunday shift away just to avoid one more weekend of drama, but the bar was busy and if Rule came in with his friends I didn\u2019t see him. It was still weird not having to wrangle him for family brunch every Sunday but when my shift was over and there hadn\u2019t been any headaches or any accusations and hurt feelings I breathed the first sigh of relief I had in what felt like years. I was feeling so mellow I let Ayden talk me into skipping a study group and going to grab Mexican food instead. It was the first time in forever that I just felt like me and I almost didn\u2019t know what to do with myself.</p><p>Since it was the start of a new semester I felt like I was drowning in homework so I gave away my Friday shift and my Sunday shift, I didn\u2019t work this Saturday since it was my birthday and everyone at the bar knew that Lou just loved me and would murder anyone that tried to make me work on the day I turned twenty.</p><p>By the time Friday afternoon rolled around I still hadn\u2019t heard from either of my folks so I figured I was off the hook for forced family time, but I had received a text from Margot asking me to reconsider Sunday this week for my birthday. I had replied I would gladly come if Rule was invited as well and hadn\u2019t heard anything back. Ayden was being secretive about what she had planned and it was making me nervous. I would\u2019ve been happy with sushi and the movies again but she kept insisting that we needed to branch out, have an adventure, and do something new. Those words and her take no prisoners attitude seemed like a recipe for disaster but I was trying to stay positive because she was only trying to be nice to me and she was an amazing friend.</p><p>I was walking out of my anatomy class and texting one of the girls from work to remind her that she was working my closing shift tonight when I bumped into someone and immediately recoiled in fear and irritation. Gabe was standing in front of me looking as wrinkle free and immaculately groomed as always. His dark hair looked like he had been running his hands through it none stop and when he reached out to steady me I scrambled back so fast that I almost fell backwards onto my ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I wanted to sound indignant and hostile, but my voice cracked and I had to clear my throat to regain my composure. His blue eyes searched mine intently and I wondered how I had ever found him attractive when now he just weirded me out.</p><p>\u201cUh, you aren\u2019t returning any of my calls and you\u2019ve been really hard to pin down lately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to talk to you or see you. Get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw, wait.\u201d He held up a hand and dug something out of his pocket and held it out towards me. \u201cI know your birthday is tomorrow and I just wanted to get you something to say I\u2019m so sorry for how I\u2019ve been acting. I was just crazy that you might have moved on to that freak but your mom explained it isn\u2019t like that between the two of you. Here take it.\u201d He shoved the velvet box towards me and I backed away like he was holding a live snake in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking that from you, I\u2019m not taking anything from you. Leave me alone Gabe, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook Shaw you can\u2019t honestly believe there can ever really be anything between you and that guy. Your mom told me you\u2019ve been carrying a torch for him for years and that he\u2019s never even looked twice at you. You\u2019re just not his type, you\u2019re too good for him and he knows it. Just give me another chance; we make so much sense together.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to punch him but I just let the ice that traveled through me at his words coat all the anger I felt starting to build.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything else, just \u2018no\u2019, because I didn\u2019t need to explain myself or my feelings or the fact that I knew most of what he said about Rule was true. I wasn\u2019t too good for him, I was just too, ME for him to ever look at as anything other than how he did and I had had to make peace with that years ago. I took a few more stumbling steps backwards and then turned on my heel and broke into a full on jog to get away from him. I think he called my name but I didn\u2019t care I just bolted. He was starting to really freak me out and the fact that my own mother was giving out the most intimate details of my life to him just made me wanna vomit. I couldn\u2019t believe that a woman that didn\u2019t even bother to make note of when I was moving out of her house because college was starting noticed how I felt about Rule when he was clueless and it just raked across my ego like razors. If Gabe didn\u2019t knock it off I was going to have to look into changing my phone number and possibly getting a restraining order against him.</p><p>When I got home the apartment was empty so like a dork I made sure all the doors were double locked and that the deadbolt on the front door was closed. I hid out in my room and did homework and wallowed in the self-pity that was threatening to drown me. I didn\u2019t consider myself an overly outgoing or optimistic person; it came from years of being over looked at home and socially awkward at school. For a while Remy had managed to pull my head out of the privileged shell I normally coward in and I had thought for sure that when I left Brookside and went off to college I would come into my own, only Remy had died and I was still trying so hard to be all kinds of things to people that just didn\u2019t seem to appreciate my efforts. I dressed nice and minded my p and q\u2019s so that my parents wouldn\u2019t totally forget I existed. I babysat Rule and put up with his awful behavior because I wanted Margot and Dale to remember that he needed and deserve their love just as much as Remy had. I wore a ridiculous outfit to work and put up with silly girls and drunk customers because Ayden deserved a solid roommate that she could rely on and mostly I acted like interacting with Rule, watching him plow his way through the greater population of young adult women of Denver didn\u2019t bother me, didn\u2019t kill something side me and doing all those things day in and day out was starting to turn the little bits that were really me into a shadow.</p><p>I knew the reason I had initially agreed to go out with Gabe was because he in a very vague sense reminded me of Rule. He had dark hair, light eyes and while he was preppy and clean cut all the way he still had a little bit of mischief in him that just got past my normal reservations. I had known within the first few dates there was no spark, there never was because I was always looking for something, or rather someone that wasn\u2019t there, but Gabe was polite and comfortable until I hadn\u2019t wanted things to get physical. Six months was a long time to string someone along, I knew that, but it didn\u2019t justify the bizarre obsessive behavior he was showing now and it was just one more burden I felt I had to shoulder.</p> <p>I was so ready to just let it all go. I changed into a pair of sweats and curled up on the bed to watch some Netflix, knowing that Ayden wouldn\u2019t be home from her shift until after two leaving me to pout alone. I should be out and about, should have a phone full of friends I could call to spend a rare Friday night off with, but I didn\u2019t and that was just sad. All I needed was a couple of cats and a pint of ice cream to make the pathetic picture complete. Sometime after my second romantic comedy and Chinese delivery I vowed to fully embrace whatever Ayden had in store for me for my birthday tomorrow because what I was doing now was just sad. My roomie was right, I needed some fun, needed to lighten up and however she decided to make that happen I was on board for. I fell asleep watching yet another dorky girl get a fantastic make over because for whatever reason the guy couldn\u2019t see how beautiful she was under her glasses and messy hair.</p><p>I woke up the next morning to happy birthday texts from Rome and my father. As usual there was nothing from my mom and I hated to admit I was sad that Margot didn\u2019t send one. I decided to make breakfast. I was surprised by a beautiful bouquet on the kitchen table and recoiled when I saw who the card was from. I was seriously going to have to do something about Gabe.</p><p>Ayden was an early riser; she went running every morning no matter how late she got in from work the night before. She motioned to the flowers with her mug and scowled. \u201cThey were on the door step when I got back from my run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I think I might have to get a restraining order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t his dad a judge or something?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYeah.\u201d Getting Gabe to back off might be harder than I thought. \u201cDo you want me to make breakfast?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her dark head and her eyes glittered at me with excitement. \u201cNo I\u2019m going to take you to Lucille\u2019s and then I have the best birthday day planned for you in the history of birthdays.\u201d I loved Lucille\u2019s. It was a popular Cajun restaurant in Washington Park and probably one of the few places outside of New Orleans where you could find an honest to god beignet.</p><p>\u201cYay sounds good. What\u2019s on the docket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst we\u2019re going shopping.\u201d I made a face because I hated shopping. I lived in a ridiculous uniform for work and expensive, name brand clothes that my parents insisted I wear because I was supposed to be dressing for the job I wanted and not the job I had and doctors of any sort apparently didn\u2019t walk around in jeans and t-shirts even when they were off the clock. Seeing my face she grinned evilly. \u201cNo we aren\u2019t going rich girl shopping, we\u2019re going normal every day college girl shopping. We\u2019re going to the mall, we\u2019re going to my favorite thrift store, we\u2019re going to that cool vintage store on Pearl Street and you my friend, you are not allowed to spend more than fifty bucks on any one thing so there will be no two hundred dollar heels, no five hundred dollar cashmere sweater sets, no perfectly tailored slacks that are hand stitched by blind monks in the Andes or whatever. We\u2019re just going to be two normal friends spending a day blowing our tips on useless crap.\u201d</p><p>Oh that sounded like fun and something I never got a chance to do. \u201cAnd then,\u201d her whiskey tinted eyes widened dramatically. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the salon and getting our hair done and mani-pedis. One of the girls in my inorganic chemistry class has this great hair, she looks like rainbow bright, she swears by this place. So we\u2019re going to get all pretty, put on our new, normal girl clothes and go have dinner at that Brazilian place we\u2019ve both been dying to try.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded awesome all of it sounded awesome. I was about to launch myself at her in a huge hug of gratitude when she held up a hand. \u201cI\u2019m not done.\u201d She disappeared into her room for a minute and came back out with a card in a pink envelope. \u201cThe you are going to take this very cool, very necessary birthday present I got you and come out with me and I don\u2019t mean out to Dave and Busters or Old Chicago\u2019s, I mean out, out and I will cram a good time down your pretty little throat if it freaking kills me.\u201d</p><p>I opened the card with mild trepidation. I didn\u2019t know what she meant by out, out. Inside the card was a shiny wrapped present that at first glance looked like a credit card. After I read her sweet birthday wishes I carefully pulled the paper off and gasped when I saw what was looking back up at me. \u201cAyd I can\u2019t use this.\u201d</p><p>The Id had my face on it, my birthday only one year older and looked exactly like a Colorado driver\u2019s license. In fact it looked so much like the one in my wallet there was hardly any difference.</p><p>\u201cOh yes you can. You\u2019ve spent twenty years being everybody\u2019s good little girl, and I\u2019m sick of you killing yourself over it. Most girls your age go out, sneak into clubs, kiss boys, have sloppy one night stands, get into ridiculous, drama filled fights with their girlfriends, Shaw you don\u2019t do any of that. Tonight you are taking that Id and coming out with me and acting like every other idiot twenty year old I know. We\u2019re going to drink too much, act silly and have fun, you deserve it. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw you smile or laugh. You\u2019re letting your soul wither away trying to be someone you\u2019re just not and I can\u2019t stand by and watch it happen anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turn twenty one next year.\u201d I\u2019m not sure why I thought that was a valid argument to all her more than accurate points, but for some reason it\u2019s what popped out of my mouth.</p> <p>She shook her dark head. \u201cWho cares? You\u2019re twenty today and you\u2019re living like you\u2019re fifty.\u201d It stung because on the last trip to Brookside Rule had said pretty much the same thing. With a sigh I remembered my resignation last night to just turn myself over to Ayden\u2019s plan, to for once just let go. I tucked some hair behind my ears and squared my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Ayden looked up under raised eyebrows. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Let\u2019s do this. Let the birthday fun and debauchery commence.\u201d She squealed loud enough to make my ears hurt and rushed around the table to wrap me up in a hug that squeezed the life out of me.</p><p>\u201cTrust me Shaw, you will never forget today.\u201d She was right because by the end of the night this birthday would prove to be life changing.</p><p>Breakfast was amazing and we stuffed ourselves so full of fried goodness that by the time we hit the mall I needed to do a few laps just to keep moving. I tried on a million pairs of jeans and ended up buying quite a few. I grabbed a pair of Chuck Taylors that I always wanted but was never allowed to have and stocked up on boring old t-shirts and tank tops. At the thrift store I scooped up an awesome old school leather jacket and a couple western style shirts with pearl buttons that I knew would look awesome with my new skinny jeans. At the vintage store I went a little crazier because I just fell in love with all the fifties and sixties style dresses. I looked like a character out of Mad Men in a few of them and like Bettie Page minus the height in a couple more. I bought a pair of heels that were peacock blue and had sequined feathers on the side and a sweet pill box hat that I probably would never wear but adored. More importantly I laughed with Ayden for hours while we tried thing after thing on and felt like a giant weight was off my chest. It was fun, plain and simple and the fact I forgot what that felt like was just sad.</p> <p>At the salon I got a hot pink mani-pedi and just for kicks had them add little black stars. It was cool and totally against the normal pale and pearly colors I went for. The lady doing it had bright green dread-locks and a tattoo across her forehead so I was thrilled when she grinned at me and told me she approved. Everyone that worked at this salon had a cool, rock and roll kind of vibe and while I normally would have felt out of place and reserved, they were all so nice and friendly that it was impossible to do anything but relax and have a good time. The guy in charge of my hair was a big, obviously gay, African American dressed head to toe in leopard print. His shiny bald head had a big tattoo of an eye on the back and his shoes probably cost more than mine, but he was sweet and told me my hair was gorgeous and suggested I just put some layers in it to give it body and life. I was all on board and even asked if he could do something new with the color. My hair was so pale I normally avoided dying it simply because it went too far in the extreme. His dark eyes gleamed in excitement when I asked for something kicky but still respectable, what I got was my normally ash blond with a shadow of chestnut brown underneath. It was awesome, different but understated enough not to be alarming. My favorite part was that he had bisected my super straight bangs in half and added the darker color to one side. It was trendy and hip and so different from what my hair normally looked like I hugged him hard in glee on my way out. He hugged me back more than likely because I tipped enough to take a weekend trip on, but who cared, I looked awesome.</p><p>We ran back to the house to get dolled up for dinner. I put on one of my new outfits, a super tight pencil skirt and a sheer blue top with a black cami underneath. I curled up my new hair, put on more makeup than I normally wore and decided just for the hell of it I would wear my awesome black boots. They looked like something a Harley Davidson model would wear, but I loved them and they gave my look a certain edge that I was feeling after a day of letting the real Shaw off her perpetual leash. Ayden put on a slinky red number that made her long legs look endless and set against her dark hair had our waiter at the restaurant practically drooling into our water every time he stopped by to refill our glasses. She made me try out my new Id by ordering a drink, it worked like a charm and before I knew it we were both feeling no pain and having a great time bouncing from bar to bar and club to club in LoDo and even after a few hours making our way back up towards Capitol Hill and some of cool dive bars up there. I was surprised that I didn\u2019t even need to show the fake Id at most places, turns out a tight skirt and exposed breasts work just as well.</p><p>I was laughing hysterically at Ayden doing some impression of a guy failing around on the dance floor, we had drawn our fair amount of attention everywhere we went tonight and had had to pay for very few drinks. At the moment a guy from CU Boulder was trying to tell me all about his illustrious football career or rather he was telling my boobs about it since I don\u2019t think he had looked up from the girls once. Ayden was rolling her eyes and trying to avoid some guy in a banker suit that was offering to do her taxes for free if she gave him her number. It was silly and fun, I didn\u2019t have to work hard at the flirting or being charming. I was well past my way to being wasted so conversation was out. All I had to do was smile and sit prettily on the bar stool, two things I was apparently really getting good at. Another Cosmo that I definitely didn\u2019t need appeared before me and Mr. Football was leaning even closer to me when some sixth sense, maybe it was my fight or flight response suddenly kicked into over drive.</p><p>I lifted my head up and swiveled around on the stool practically kneecapping the leering football player. I looked around, craning my neck to see what had my skin suddenly feeling too tight but all I saw was the regular bar crowd mixing and mingling. Football player was trying to get my attention back by running a finger up and down my bare arm, I guess it was supposed to be sexy, but now I was drunk and unnerved so I wanted to go. I wanted to tell him to get lost so I could find Ayden and get someone to call us a cab but before I could any of those things a warm hand slid under the heavy fall of my hair to settle on my neck and a deep voice growled in my ear, \u201cHow in the fuck did you get in here, Casper?\u201d</p><p>Football player\u2019s eyes went huge because well, Rule was Rule. Gone was the dark hair spiked up in a crazy mess, now he had it all shaved on the sides and bleached out into a startling white mohawk that was several inches tall. He had on a tight black shirt with a flaming skull in a Viking helmet on it and a pair of black jeans that had a hole in the knee. Both his full sleeves of tattoos were on optimum display, so was the chain he wore from his wallet to his belt as were his heavy black motorcycle boots. He should look sloppy and unkempt next to the V-neck sweater wearing footballer, but he didn\u2019t. He looked hot and rumpled and clearly not to be messed with because footballer pushed away from the table in a hurry and vanished into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do to your hair?\u201d</p><p>I was drunk, admittedly probably not the best state to try and go toe to toe with Rule in after getting a two week break from him, but I liked my hair and he wasn\u2019t going to rain on all my birthday vibes, especially since he clearly didn\u2019t even know what the day was. I shook his grip loose and sucked back the tart drink in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>He lifted an eyebrow at me and took up the same spot football player had vacated, looking down my low cut top and all. \u201cThis bar is right around the corner from the shop. Nash and I stop by all the time after work. I just finished a client. I know they Id at the door, how did you get in?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I flipped my hair over my shoulder like I had seen endless annoying girls do only I practically fell off my stool because suddenly that last drink was letting me know just how bad an idea it had been to chug it. I grabbed the edge of the table and Rule reached out a hand to steady me. I felt like it burned where he gripped my upper arm. Definitely should have listened to my flight response a minute ago. I put a hand on my forehead it was warm and suddenly clammy. \u201cI need to go.\u201d</p><p>I tried to climb to my feet but the room started to spin around all crazy. I was so glad I opted for my boots instead of heels because as I involuntarily grabbed onto Rule\u2019s biceps to stay upright I knew I would have ended up on my face otherwise. It was too hot, too loud and if I didn\u2019t get out into some fresh air like yesterday I was pretty sure I was going to puke everywhere.</p><p>\u201cWho drove?\u201d Rule\u2019s voice was coming from far away and he smelled really good. With a sigh I leaned into him and buried my nose in his throat. He was so tall I had to use my leverage on his arms to reach. \u201cSeriously Shaw, how did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyden and I, we took a cab.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a banker. I need to go home.\u201d I feel my boozy legs start to wobble and his locked a heavy arm around my waist to keep me anchored to his chest. It was nice. Not bothering to think about it I wrapped both my arms up around his neck. He felt as good as I always knew he would.</p><p>\u201cHer roommate is running around somewhere; wanna see if you can grab her. I\u2019m gonna walk her to our place.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure who he was talking to but a familiar voice rumbled an affirmative and the next thing I knew I was being half marched, half carried out the front door of the bar. The cold January air made me snap my head back as Rule moved me from his front to his side and secured me with an arm around my shoulders. I hooked an arm around his lean waist and cuddled into his side. I knew logically it was the vodka making me act crazy, but I couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only three blocks from my place. I\u2019ll pour a gallon of coffee down your throat and shove some chips or a frozen burrito in your face and get you a cab. You\u2019re even paler than normal and if you try and get in a car right now you\u2019re gonna puke everywhere. Why are you drunk and dressed all sexified tonight anyway?\u201d</p><p>I shivered a little as the wind breezed across my bare legs. I turned my cold nose into his ribs and inhaled. He smelled like the antiseptic from the shop, like cigarettes from Nash, like the hair product in his mohawk and underneath it all the warm, earthy smell that was all just Rule. In eight years I had never been this close to him for this long. It was enough to send my deprived and alcohol soaked system into overdrive.</p> <p>\u201cYou think I look sexy?\u201d That seemed like the important part of the conversation. We stopped at a stop sign and he looked down at me with exasperation clear in those pale eyes.</p><p>\u201cShaw, every guy in the bar was circling you like you were bait in the water during shark week. You know you look good, what I think shouldn\u2019t matter. What should matter is why your suddenly dressing, looking and acting like a different person? What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to scowl up at him but that seemed too hard especially when his t-shirt rode up in the back and my arm was brushing against nice, warm skin. I stumbled off the curb as we made our way down another block and a familiar Victorian came into sight. He pulled me in tighter to his side and I didn\u2019t even try and hide the soft sigh that fell out of me. \u201cEveryone thinks I need to act a certain way, you, my parents, your parents, the girls from work, Gabe. Everybody always wants me to be this, do that, walk this line, toe that line and I\u2019m sick of it. Maybe for just once I just want to act how I want, feel how I want to feel without someone judging me and expecting something from me.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet as we walked up the front steps to the apartment. Maybe he was trying to translate my drunken speech because even I could hear that I was slurring between my chattering teeth. He pushed the door open and twisted the lock. It was warm inside so I shook off my jacket and pushed my shaking hand through my hair. I turned blurry eyes on him and almost swallowed my tongue. He was leaning back against the door watching me with hooded eyes. He wasn\u2019t throwing sarcastic barbs at me, or ignoring me he was just watching me. I blew out a breath and tasted the tartness of the cranberry juice across my tongue still.</p><p>I took a few unsteady steps towards him. He was tall and I was not so I had to stand on the very tip of my toes to reach his ear as I put a hand on his shoulder and one on the door beside his head. I expected him to move away, to gently shove me to the side but he uncrossed his arms and placed his hands on my either side of my waist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday Rule.\u201d</p> <p>Those pale eyes flared for a second and his mouth twisted down. The hoop on the side on his lip glinted at me in his frown. \u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry Shaw. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged it off and moved a step closer to him. \u201cIt okay, my own family doesn\u2019t even remember it.\u201d I pressed so close to him that my chest was flat against his and I could feel that the close proximity was having an effect on him. If I hadn\u2019t had to concentrate on my balance since I was on my toes I might have grinned at that. All I had ever wanted in life was to affect him, to get him to feel something, anything other than simple tolerance for me. \u201cI know what I you can do for me to make this officially the best birthday ever.\u201d I wanted to sound sure, to sound sexy and sultry but I\u2019m pretty sure I just sounded horny and drunk. I didn\u2019t care. I was here, the real me, the one that wanted him so desperately and always had and now there was no chance at putting her back in the cage.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think, didn\u2019t reason just used the grip I had on him to pull myself up even taller and plant my mouth solidly over his. The ring in his lip was shockingly cold against my own; the rest of him was undeniably hot and hard. It was everything I had ever wanted and even though he didn\u2019t kiss me back I still ranked it up there as the best birthday gift ever. I went to settle back down on my booted feet when something shifted, something changed and Rule went from the pliant recipient to something else entirely.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Rule</p><p>Shaw was drunk, really, really drunk. She was also dressed like something out of a retro fantasy and had on those boots that made me want to drool. I had been grumpy and moody all week, my friends had noticed, my clients had noticed, the chick I walked out on Saturday night noticed. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. At first I thought it was Rome, I was pissed he wouldn\u2019t just tell mom to grow the fuck up and get over her shit. I wanted him to spend time with me, to have some good times before shipping back out to the desert but he wasn\u2019t ready to give up hope that he could fix our fractured family and I didn\u2019t want to fight with my brother the freaking war hero. I thought maybe I just needed to get laid, but the hot blond I went home with on Saturday had started to annoy me in the car there and by the time we got to her room the last thing I wanted to do was see her naked so I bolted. Sunday came and went and the darker and darker my mood got. They guys suggested going to the Goal Line, thinking maybe I needed a dose of verbal ass kicking from an ice cold blond to get me out of my head, but I refused and instead spent the day brooding and playing Call of Duty. I had no idea what my problem was but with Shaw all but plastered to the front of me I was starting to get an idea.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been able to get the sight of her and her ruffle covered ass out of my head for days. Call me shallow, call me a chauvinistic pig, but there was just something about seeing her all sexed up and barely dressed that made me look at her in an entirely new light. It was like being introduced to her all over again and the prim and proper little lady that Remy had worshiped was overtaken by a sexy co-ed that had me up and night thinking X-rated things. Now with her looking at me all big eyed and swaying unsteadily I knew the right thing to do was fix her up and send her on her way, but then she kissed me and I was pretty sure I forgot my own name. I was too stunned to react at first, I mean I had kissed hundreds of girls and there was always something nice about it, but Shaw kicked nice to the curb and went right into coma inducing.</p><p>After I got enough blood back from below my belt I realized that she was pulling away, or rather falling away and yes I was a certified asshole because I knew she was sauced and I knew she was for all purposes still my twin brother\u2019s girl but none of that stopped me because she also tasted sweet and tangy, felt better than anything I could remember in my entire life and had on some kind of slinky top that was rubbing erotically across my chest, plus her hand where wrapped around my neck was playing with the last pointy spike of my new haircut and it was all going right to my dick which was screaming at me to do something. So like a bastard I did.</p> <p>I picked her up because she was short and I was tired of bending over. Her skirt was tight so I had no problem moving it up her shapely calves so that she could get those legs wrapped around me. She made a gasping noise and I maybe, possibly would have stopped what I was doing to her mouth if she hadn\u2019t used her new position to grind against my hard on and to get her hands up under my t-shirt shirt. Of all the things I had ever thought about Shaw, the fact that she would go off like a bottle rocket when touched just right would have never been one of them. She always looked so cool, so collected but now she was tugging my shirt off over my head and doing something with her tongue on my lip ring that was making my eyes cross. I knew logically Nash was probably only a few minutes from walking in the door with her roommate and this had to stop. There was no way I would be able to live with myself if I let this get out of hand while she was drunk, so I let go when she pushed away from me so that she was on unsteady feet on the floor in front of me and I thought maybe, just maybe even wasted she would be the voice of reason.</p><p>She just looked at me through hooded eyes the color of jade and licked a mouth that was very thoroughly worked over curiosity of yours truly. Nothing on this planet had ever been hotter. She started pulling at the ties on the top of her silky top and moved past me down the hall. I forgot that she knew where my bedroom was, that she knew her way around my place, that she had a damn key. It was on the tip of my tongue to tell her to stop, to tell her I would just put her to bed and she could just sleep whatever this was off, but as I followed behind her the blue top hit the floor followed by the black tank top and the skirt that did amazing things to her ass. I picked up the discarded clothing and tried to talk myself off the ledge. I couldn\u2019t do this, wouldn\u2019t do this, it was bad enough I had kissed her like a sex crazed lunatic. I needed to get control back like yesterday. This was Shaw, not some bar bimbo. Not someone I could mercilessly kick out in the morning and never speak to again.</p><p>\u201cShaw,\u201d she turned to look at me over her shoulder and I think I blacked out for a second. I dropped the pile of clothes in my hands on the floor and tried to unstick my tongue from the roof of my mouth. I had seen a lot of girls naked but none of them were this girl, none of them came anywhere close. Somehow she managed to get out of those tall motorcycle boots without falling on her face and she was staring at me with big green eyes clad in nothing more than a few scraps of black lace that were designed for aesthetics rather than function and every good intention, every idea that I should be the good guy, do the right thing went out the window. She was all ice cool hair, perfect pale skin, tiny little waist and high, touch me, please God touch me breasts. She had a body made to make men stupid and I wasn\u2019t immune. I took a fumbling step toward her after kicking the door closed behind me. Somewhere my conscious was whispering I should just put her to bed and go find a giant bottle of Crown to crawl into and a cold shower to get my libido back in check, but none of that was going to happen because she met me halfway and her little hands went right to my belt buckle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShaw,\u201d I tried again. I put my hands on her shoulders and where I thought I was going to push her away my body betrayed me and I ended up pushing the straps of that fancy bar off her shoulders. She pressed close to me, her hands making short work of the belt and the fastening on my pants. Her lips fluttered over the pulse pounding rapidly at my throat. Her hands trialed lightly over my chest and across abs that were tense with desire. One of her legs slid between mine and rubbed against the evidence that I wasn\u2019t going to stop her regardless of knowing it was the right thing to do.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking so hard.\u201d Her voice was all husky sweet and cloudy with desire. She was the last person on earth I should be contemplating doing this with but even as objections broke through my haze of lust I used one hand to unhook her bra and the other to tangle in her hair as I sealed my mouth over hers. Kissing Shaw was a different experience than kissing any other girl. For one she was really good at it. Most girls got lost or a little confused because of the bite of my lip ring and the fact I had a metal barbell in the center of my tongue, Shaw seemed oblivious to both of them and kissed me like she had been born to do it. She was also a lot shorter than most of the girls I normally hooked up with so there was an entire learning curve involved where I had to figure out a way to get all the best parts of us lined up. She didn\u2019t seem to care at all that I was a little rough, that I was suddenly impatient. I felt like if I gave myself too much time to get my head around what I was doing I would falter and stop and man I really, really didn\u2019t want to stop because her hands had found their way into my pants and my dick would kill me if I pulled the plug now.</p><p>She tugged the denim down over my ass and I pulled her up so that we were pressed together shoulder to thigh. I shrugged the pants the rest of the way off and gave her a little push so that she fell back onto my rumpled bed. It took some maneuvering and a few curse words to get my boots off and when I went to crawl up over her my brain short circuited because all she had on was barely there lacy panties and dreamy look on her face. A lot of girls had been in this bed, in fact last weekend had been the first time in a long time I had spent the night alone, but even though I was in a haze of testicle squeezing desire I knew that beyond a shadow of a doubt that none of them looked like Shaw looked against the dark sheets and comforter. She slid an appreciative eye over my naked form, not like she hadn\u2019t see it before, but somehow now that it was sprawled out on top of her, the look was more \u2018do me\u2019 and less \u2018Rule you\u2019re gross\u2019.</p><p>Her hand brushed over the tattoo of the sacred heart on the center of my chest and up along the two giant rib pieces that covered most of my torso. I had a lot of color and a lot of art work decorating my skin and when I was naked it tended to be a lot to take in and had been overwhelming to some of my less adventurous bed partners. I mean I wasn\u2019t vain or conceited but I knew I was alright to look at. I was tall and tended toward lean and fit, I went to the gym a few times a week but none of that really mattered because she was looking at me like I was everything she ever wanted and it was doing weird things to my head. I also had a barbell pierced through the head of my penis that meant I was both brave and idiotic; because half the chicks that saw it had no clue what to do with it. Shaw had walked in on me enough times to know that it was there, but she didn\u2019t seem to care either way. She let the pad of her thumb brush across the top ball of it which made suck in a breath.</p><p>I realized I was letting this girl call all the shots, that I was about to have sex with her and we had barely said a word, that she was touching me, making me go crazy and I was just letting her. I needed to get with the program so I hooked my fingers in her tiny little underwear and pulled them down her legs. She shivered in response and now that she was finally fully naked and trapped under me there was a hint of trepidation in her mossy gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d I had said it to many others before her, but I think this was the first time I meant it.</p><p>She put her hands on either side of my head and I realized my new hairdo wasn\u2019t exactly and easy one to work with where sex was involved. There was nothing up there for her to hold on to, nothing up there for her to run her fingers through, it was all spiked up and manhandled into intimidating spikes not that she seemed to care. She scraped her fingernails across my scalp and gave me a lopsided grin. I couldn\u2019t tell if the booze was wearing off or she was finally starting to realize we were naked and in bed about to cross a definite boundary, but a hint of the Shaw I was used to dealing with was starting to surface.</p><p>\u201cSo are you, you shouldn\u2019t be but you always have been. I remember the first time I saw you I thought I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re twins. Remy was so handsome, always so perfect, but you, God Rule you were just beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The fact that she brought Remy\u2019s name up while her hand was wrapped around my dick should have been like ice water on the moment. It wasn\u2019t. I kissed her below her ear and let my teeth nick her neck. She made a noise that did something to the center of my chest and hooked a leg up over my hip so that all her heat and ready to go was pressed up against my hardness. I blinked for a second because I felt like I was forgetting something. She was wrapping her arms around my shoulders and panting as I brushed kisses across her puckered up nipples and just as I was about to let her pull me in a shiver of apprehension slammed across my spine and I pushed up off her. \u201cCondom.\u201d I\u2019d been having sex since I was fourteen years old and it didn\u2019t matter who the girl was or how drunk I was I never forgot. The fact that my head was spun around by her, so lost in what we were doing that I almost put both of us at risk scared the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cI have one in my purse.\u201d I looked at her and blinked.</p><p>\u201cI have a box in the nightstand, Shaw, come on do you really want to do this? Think about it, you\u2019re wasted. You\u2019re going to regret it in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She sat up and her cool two-toned hair fell forward to cover the top of her swollen breasts. She looked like every naughty dream I had ever had and I couldn\u2019t believe I was trying to talk her out doing this with me. Her eyes suddenly got glassy and I knew she was going to cry. She went to crawl past me off the bed but I trapped her in my arms and rolled her so that we were once again lined up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never wanted me.\u201d</p><p>I was stunned so I just let my mouth fall open. \u201cUh I\u2019m pretty sure you can feel the proof of that not being true, in fact you just had your hot little hands all over it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and her silky blond hair rubbed across my chest. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She wiggled a little against me and reached an arm up for my nightstand drawer. If it had been anyone else I would have freaked out, but this was Shaw, anything that was in that drawer wouldn\u2019t surprise her or freak her out, including the loaded gun I kept in there. I heard the cellophane wrapper and felt her hands back below my waist. I wasn\u2019t sure I remembered ever having a condom put on me ever feel so good.</p><p>\u201cRule it\u2019s my birthday, my life is a freaking mess most of the time can you just for once do this for me, please?\u201d</p><p>What red blooded, American male would turn down a dead sexy, naked blond that asked you to please do it to her? Not me, no way, no how so I kissed her again, let my tongue slid against hers and lifted her leg up over my hip. I liked to think I knew what I was doing in this department, after all I had more practice than I cared to admit, but for some reason with her I felt like I what I was doing was all new. She kissed me back on a soft gasp as I started to slide in. She was tight, she was tiny, she was hot and wet, and I think I was going to die if I didn\u2019t get to get all the way in the next second.</p><p>She whispered my name across my neck and arched her back. Her nails dug into my shoulders as I lifted her up a little bit and tried to push all the way in. I swore and she froze as there was something most definitely in the way but my momentum was to great and I had her too keyed up to stop so she snapped wide eyes to mine as her mouth made a little O of surprised pain as I glared down at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck Shaw?\u201d</p><p>She gave her head a little shake and lifted her other leg up around my hip and moved against me in a way that made me utter every swear word I knew. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Rule, please don\u2019t stop.\u201d She was breathy and it was too late for that to be an option anyway. She felt better than anything I had ever felt in my life and there was no way I was going to stop now, not unless I wanted to walk funny until I was thirty. I let the fingers of one hand tangle in her hair and propped my weight up on the other so that I wasn\u2019t crushing her and went about having the best sex of my life with a god damn lying virgin.</p><p>She moved just the way I wanted her to, she touched me in ways that would wake me up in the middle of the night remembering them, she kissed me like she had been created to do it exactly the way I liked, she matched my rhythm the way only people that had lots and lots of sex together normally managed to do and every time she whispered my name or made a sexy sound of satisfaction and delight it made me feel ten feet tall. I hadn\u2019t had sober sex in a long time, I hadn\u2019t had sex with someone I knew for more than a few hours in a long time either and I couldn\u2019t believe the difference both those things made.</p> <p>I wanted it to be good for her, wanted it to turn her inside out like it was doing to me and since it was her first time I wanted to make sure that it was what she was going to have to compare every guy after me to. We moved together, she arched her back and put her hands back on my head.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Rule.\u201d She was close; I could feel the little tremors all along my cock. There was no way I was going to ruin this for her so I touched her in a way that was guaranteed to make her shatter and was rewarded with big eyes and a gasp of surrender. I was super relieved because I wasn\u2019t going to last much longer. I buried my nose in her neck and followed her over the edge. By the time it was done my arms were shaking and I was breathing like I had run a marathon. I slid out of her and rolled to my side all ready to have the regret and despair settle on me, only her eyes had drifted closed so I got up to go into my bathroom and clean up. I pulled on a pair of sweats and grabbed a wash cloth for her. When I went back into the room she was curled up on her side with her cheek resting on her folded up hands, she looked all of sixteen years old. The steady rise and fall of her chest indicated that she was asleep so I cleaned her up the best I could without waking her and settled in the bed next to her. I crossed my arms up under my head and stared up at my ceiling.</p><p>What the hell had I done? And what in the hell had Remy been doing with her for all those years if he hadn\u2019t been sleeping with her? They had always claimed they were just friends but no one had believed them. The love they had for each other, the protectiveness, the camaraderie they shared had often even made me jealous and I now I didn\u2019t know what the hell to think. Shaw had been a girl that never fell into the girls I can\u2019t or won\u2019t have sex with category for most of my life but now I had blown that all to smithereens I didn\u2019t know what to do about it. She wasn\u2019t just some chick I could never call again, that I could shove out the door the next morning and I didn\u2019t have the first clue what to do about it. Add in the fact that it was probably the most intense, best sex of my life and I felt like I was losing control. I shouldn\u2019t feel that way about Shaw; she shouldn\u2019t be the one to rock my world like it had never been rocked before. Frankly it weirded me out that she was better and more turned on by my ink and piercings than the majority of girls I brought home. Now I had a disarray on my hands and the wrong girl in my bed and I didn\u2019t have a clue what to do about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fell asleep sometime after the sun started to come up so when I woke up to the sound of my phone ringing the first thing I did was look on the other side of the bed. All the things from the night before slamming into my head. Shaw was gone. The pile of clothes I left on the floor last night was folded neatly on the end of the bed and none of her pretty little things were left. I groaned and threw an arm over my eyes while answering the call.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Something crinkled under my hip as I moved while my brother chuckled in my ear.</p><p>\u201cDid I interrupt something?\u201d</p><p>On a plain piece of sketch paper I had laying around for drawing up designs for clients she had written in her neat, girly scrip:</p> <p>Best birthday gift ever! Thanks</p><p>She didn\u2019t sign it, didn\u2019t say she would call or ask me to call her. It was plain and simple and I wasn\u2019t sure if it made me elated or furious. My brother was still waiting for a response so I shook the cobwebs loose out of my head and sat up in the bed. It smelled like sex and her.</p><p>\u201cNo I just didn\u2019t sleep good last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you bring strangers home with you, you have to make sure you sleep with one eye open so they don\u2019t rob you or stab you while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cDude you need to get out of the Army. Not every stranger is an insurgent.\u201d</p> <p>He muttered something under his breath that I didn\u2019t catch. \u201cHey I\u2019m gonna come to Denver for the week. My shoulder is acting up and I need to touch base with my Orthopedic surgeon plus mom is getting on my last nerve. Shaw refused to come over for lunch today because mom wouldn\u2019t invite you as well and now she\u2019s convinced you\u2019ve somehow corrupted her darling girl. I keep telling her she needs to see someone and dad even agrees but she\u2019s just so stubborn, I guess that\u2019s where we get it from.\u201d</p><p>I winced a little; glad the conversation was happening over the phone. I was sure guilt colored my face. My mom would freak out to extreme levels if she had any clue just how thoroughly I had corrupted Shaw.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer before you have to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be medically cleared first and I\u2019m supposed to meet with a VA counselor to make sure there isn\u2019t any PTSD from the accident. I have to have a clean bill of health all the way around before I go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019ll be nice to finally get a chance to hangout without all the family drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been calling Shaw all morning so I can take her out to dinner or something for her birthday. I\u2019m sure her moronic parents didn\u2019t do anything again and I hate the idea that she probably had to spend it alone. You should get off your lazy ass and come with us if I get ahold of her.\u201d</p> <p>I started to choke a little. It was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that she most definitely hadn\u2019t been alone but this was Shaw and as close I was to Rome he didn\u2019t need to know what we had been doing in this room last night.</p><p>\u201cNaw, I think she\u2019s had enough of me. I ran into her a few weeks ago and I see her around here and there. I think it\u2019s a nice break for her not to have to deal with me every weekend.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right. I\u2019m gonna crash with my buddy Drew since I don\u2019t think the shoulder is up to sleeping on your shitty couch and he has the room but I\u2019ll hit you up when I roll into town. If I can\u2019t get in touch with Shaw you and I can go grab dinner somewhere and you can disgust me with all the tales of your latest conquests.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed a hand over my tired face and shoved Shaw\u2019s note into the nightstand. I could still feel her hands moving all over me.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get off your butt and start pulling some conquests of your own. You\u2019re a hero dude, chicks eat that stuff up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like you Rule; I\u2019m not twenty two and living life by the seat of my pants. I\u2019ve seen the worst humanity has to offer, in the last four years I\u2019ve buried more friends than I\u2019ve made, I get out of the Army in less than two years and I don\u2019t know what the future holds for me so nailing every pretty girl in my path is pretty low on my priority ladder. Right now I want to get healthy, get our family back together and finish this tour up without any more dead bodies. One day you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t wrong. My priorities were very different from his. I made good money, had a ton of savings, drove a nice car but I was viscerally aware that the majority of my time was spent trying to outlive the shadow of my dead twin. I wallowed in superficial relationships so no one could get close to me, no one could judge me and find me lacking. I sought out girls that were easy, that had zero expectation beyond what I offered, a good time and a few mindless minutes of release but I had never had a girlfriend, never let anyone all the way in because I was scared I wouldn\u2019t be enough once they got down to the core of who I was. I knew it was messed up, knew I was an emotional train wreak and the thing with Shaw was just bound to make it even worse.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. A good time never killed anyone. Call me later.\u201d</p> <p>I tossed the phone on the bed and went into the bathroom to take care of business. When I went into the living room Nash was sprawled on the couch watching the early game on the flat screen. He had a mug of coffee in one hand and a doughnut in the other.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>He flicked his gaze up to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Did you see Shaw this morning?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and held up the doughnut. \u201cShe left these. So what\u2019s the deal with that? She was in the kitchen this morning so I assumed she stayed the night with you. I thought you were going to put her in a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did the roommate end up?\u201d I tried to change the subject as I got my own coffee.</p><p>\u201cI offered to bring her back here to wait for Shaw but she was having a good time so we had a few more drinks then I called her a cab. She seemed to think it was a brilliant idea that her very intoxicated friend was going home with you, why is that?\u201d</p><p>I grunted and sank down on the couch next to him.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Shaw and I have all kinds of twisted history, who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she spent the night with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming because I\u2019ve known you since forever that you didn\u2019t spend the night discussing politics and watching TV?\u201d</p><p>I glowered over at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and made a tisk, tisk sound. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, she\u2019s not one of those girls. You can\u2019t just have me escort her out in the morning and never talk to her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey I woke up alone this morning. I didn\u2019t make her go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would\u2019ve and Shaw is way to classy and smart to do a walk of shame. Man I can\u2019t believe you hooked up with your brother\u2019s girl. You really do have some problems, that\u2019s a whole mess I wouldn\u2019t even jump into no matter how hot the girl was.\u201d</p><p>I made a strangled noise and reached forward to put my elbows on my knees. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I don\u2019t think there is any real reason to worry about tarnishing Remy\u2019s memory. I don\u2019t know what was going on between those two for all those years but after last night there is undeniable proof that they weren\u2019t sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>Nash swore and his eyes got wide. \u201cShe was a virgin?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I probably shouldn\u2019t be sharing all this with Nash, but I was confused and he was my best friend. I was in over my head.</p><p>\u201cShe was a virgin and gave it up to you, holy shit bro that\u2019s like a huge deal.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought but then she was gone when I woke up and she was pretty trashed last night so maybe it was just beer goggles and too many martinis making the choices for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed fine this morning, I mean she looked hung over and pretty obviously worked over but she wasn\u2019t nervous or weird or anything. She called Ayden for a ride and ran out for breakfast while she waited. I dunno man, she didn\u2019t seem all swoony in love or stalker pissed off, she just seemed like normal Shaw. Granted I always thought she kinda had a thing for you.\u201d</p><p>I turned to him with a look of bewilderment. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe puts up with your shit no matter how bad it is. Don\u2019t you remember that one New Year\u2019s she showed up to get you and you brought home the redhead and her friend? That was a freak show and Shaw didn\u2019t even blink she just tossed you your pants and told you to get it together. She lets you be all moody, surly and grumpy and doesn\u2019t even bat an eye and trust me dude that shit gets old super-fast. She\u2019s willing to go to battle with the only parents she\u2019s known to show her any love because she wants them to treat you right and quit blaming you for Remy\u2019s death, she isn\u2019t doing any of that for Margot or Dale, and she sure ain\u2019t doing it for Remy, the only person any of that benefits is you. Even as stubborn and self-involved as you are, you have to be able to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s Shaw. Perfect, Shaw. Even when she was little she was untouchable and aloof. She would be over at the house all the time with Remy and every time I said anything or did anything she would just look at me like I was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou were an idiot. You don\u2019t remember being sixteen? We were nightmare and never very nice to her. You made fun of her hair, teased Remy mercilessly about spending all his time with her, you were an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, you still totally are. And Shaw is Shaw. She\u2019s so freaking beautiful it hurts look at her sometimes, but she doesn\u2019t even know it. She\u2019s still untouchable because she\u2019s always going to be richer and smarter than we are, but she doesn\u2019t care about any of that. She\u2019s cool, she doesn\u2019t care that you\u2019re just you, and honestly Rule, any chick that can put up with the headache that is you, well I\u2019d put a goddamn diamond on her finger.\u201d</p><p>I punched him in the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not that bad.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a look. \u201cYeah you are. Think about it, it only took seeing her dressed as a sexy referee to get you to notice she was an actual girl after all this time. You suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut man oh man did she look good in that outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, total suckage. So what are you going to do now, call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Rome is coming to town and since I like my privates located where they are I need to keep it on the low down. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll say anything to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, she knows it would drive your crazy mom right over the edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he paused and gave me a pointed look. \u201cWas it worth screwing everything up?\u201d</p><p>I let my head fall back on the couch and stared up at the ceiling. \u201cIt so totally was.\u201d</p><p>I had had the best sex of my life with a girl that I had thought was way out of my league and in love with my dead brother, yeah Nash was probably right if anybody could put up with all the crazy I was rocking I should probably lock them in quick because even I could see how seriously screwed up what I had allowed to happen last night had been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>Shaw</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that.\u201d I fiddled with my hair and adjusted the neck of the scarf I had on to cover my neck. Rome was looking at me like he was trying to see inside my head and I didn\u2019t like it one bit. I ignored his calls all day Sunday because I was still trying to get my head around the fact that I had drunkenly demanded Rule take my virginity and I had been sore, both from the booze and the bed acrobatics. I had a test Monday and had to work a closing shift, on Tuesday I did a volunteer shift at the children\u2019s hospital and suffered through an ungodly dinner with my father and his new wife so Rome had been forced to wait until Wednesday to take me on my belated birthday dinner. Ever since I sat down he had been peering at me intently and I had to kept checking to make sure that the scarf was covering the lovely hickey Rule had left Saturday night. I got enough flak from Ayden about it and I didn\u2019t need Rome joining in on the Shaw is an idiot band wagon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the hair. It\u2019s nice but I\u2019m just used to the all blond. You look different, more mature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you in jeans either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went shopping for my birthday. I decided that the pearls and heels didn\u2019t need to be worn every time I left the house, I have plenty for when it\u2019s time to play society maven for the folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of birthdays I brought this from mom and dad.\u201d He handed me a little bag and I set it on the table between us.</p><p>\u201cYour mom won\u2019t talk to me; I tried to call her the other day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s having a hard time now that you laid the law down. She always viewed you as an ally in the war on the get Rule to get his act together war. She just doesn\u2019t see what she\u2019s doing to him, to us.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI know that\u2019s why I had to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is from me.\u201d He gave me a gift certificate to my favorite bath and body store. I smiled and gave him a big hug. I just loved this guy, he looked like a warrior but he had such a good heart.</p><p>\u201cThank you Rome, that\u2019s so sweet. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too little girl, I tried to get Rule to come out but he had a late client. He was grumbling about having to draw yet another Harry Potter tattoo or something, I guess I forget he actually has to work.\u201d</p><p>I peeked inside the bag. It was a picture. Margot had found one of the very first pictures taken of me and Remy and put it in a lovely silver frame. I was so small and awkward and Remy so tall and handsome, we looked ridiculous but it was a sweet gesture and it brought tears to my eyes. I showed it to Rome and slid it back into the bag.</p> <p>\u201cI miss him every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do too; I miss the way he made everyone act right.\u201d</p><p>I laughed a little and sipped some of my iced tea. \u201cYeah he was good at policing the way everyone treated each other, he didn\u2019t tolerate any of the silliness we tend to allow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule said he\u2019s run into you a couple times, how was that?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat and willed the scarlet blush that had been accompanying Rule\u2019s name all week to stay at bay. \u201cKinda weird. He came into the bar I worked at with a bunch of friends on a game day. It\u2019s strange to interact with each other like normal people.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and I noticed the waitress openly checking him out when she dropped off our dinner. \u201cHe said told me you\u2019ve been having some issues with your ex.\u201d</p><p>I groaned and gave my head a shake. \u201cHe has a big mouth.\u201d Among other things but I wasn\u2019t going to let my dirty mind go there.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal little girl?\u201d</p> <p>I made a face and shoved a bite of pasta into my mouth. \u201cRule already talked to him, so did the enormous ex-marine that bounces at the bar. Gabe\u2019s just a spoiled guy that isn\u2019t used to rejection. He\u2019s having trouble hearing me say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still calling you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to lie so I tried to change the subject. \u201cWhat did the doctor say about your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at me and poked at his own food. \u201cHe thinks I need to up my physical therapy and if that doesn\u2019t work I might need a second surgery to fuse the bones together, either way I\u2019ll be home longer than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s good isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and I got the impression that he wasn\u2019t as excited about the prospect as I was.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to finish my tour; I don\u2019t want my tour to end like this. I hate leaving my platoon hanging. I\u2019ve been in the Army for six years, Shaw; I don\u2019t really know how to do anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a whole lot of people that love you Rome, getting out of the Army and being safe shouldn\u2019t be what scares you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but it is what it is.\u201d</p><p>We lapsed into a minute of silence before he went back to Gabe. \u201cWhat did Rule say to the ex?\u201d</p><p>I lifted a shoulder and let it fall. \u201cI dunno. He told him to leave me alone and Gabe immediately jumped to the conclusion that the reason I dumped him was because of Rule. Everyone always thinks that everything I do is because of Rule. It gets old.\u201d</p><p>Rome stared at me with eyes that looked so much like his brothers. I could tell by the twist in his mouth that I was not going to like what he had to say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him and poked at my plate. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule convinced Remy to move to Denver as soon as they graduated so you decided to move here too. Rule acts like an ass making things with mom and dad impossible so you decided to play peacemaker and drag him home every weekend. Rule acts and everyone has no choice but to react and we\u2019ve all been doing it for years, you included.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break up with Gabe because of Rule.\u201d That wasn\u2019t entirely true but I didn\u2019t need Rome trying to pick it apart.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His incredulous voice had me bristling up. \u201cI don\u2019t know the entire ins and outs of your relationship with Remy,\u201d I interjected automatically, \u201cWe were just friends, best, best friends.\u201d But Rome went on like I hadn\u2019t even said a word, \u201cbut I do know that when you thought no one was looking you watched Rule like a hawk. I know that every time he came stumbling home drunk, reeking like sex and cheap perfume from whatever teenage tramp he talked into letting him in her pants you looked like he had kicked you in the gut. I know that every Sunday you looked the same way when you brought him home, so Shaw are you really going to try and tell me that the choices you make don\u2019t involve Rule?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and pushed the plate away, my appetite suddenly gone. \u201cWhat do you want me to say Rome? My life has been entangled with the Archer boys for as long as I can remember, how much truth do you really think you can handle, I mean I\u2019m officially not a teenager anymore and some of it just isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s business. You want to hear that from the second Remy brought me home I loved him but that I was in love with Rule? Do you want to hear that I spent years and years being sad and alone with only Remy and you guys as friends and it was okay because you were all I needed even though every day my heart broke a little more because Rule had no idea I was alive? Do you want to hear that without your mom and dad I would have probably been forced into some boarding school and then some hallow Ivy League college just so my parents didn\u2019t have to deal with me? Come on Rome, what do you really want to know?\u201d</p><p>By the time I was done my voice was bitter and I had twisted my napkin into a little ball on my lap.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Remy kept you so close if he knew you were all tangled up by Rule? He had to know that wasn\u2019t a match that was going to happen, Rule doesn\u2019t do anything that takes work, and as much as I love you little girl you aren\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>These were the questions that I wished Remy was around to answer. I sighed. \u201cHe had his reasons, the least of which was to keep me as far away from my family as he could. He didn\u2019t want me to turn into a Stepford daughter even though he was only partly successful. Sometimes I still can\u2019t get out from under all those expectations.\u201d</p><p>He tapped his fingers on the table. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been in love with my brother since you were thirteen?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cPretty much and everyone else in the world seems to know it but him.\u201d I tried really hard to keep the memories from Saturday night at bay.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh you\u2019ve met your brother, right? Mr. I\u2019ll bang anything with big boobs and a negative IQ, Mr. I\u2019ll do what I want when I want. Rule doesn\u2019t need to know because it won\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>Rome shrugged his good shoulder and winked at the waitress as she dropped off our bill. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe it would be good for him to know. He\u2019s lived his life as a substitute for Remy for so long, maybe it would wake him up to know someone as good as you, as kind and loving has feelings for him and has for a long time. I know deep down he\u2019s a good guy, he just buries it under so much bullshit it can be hard to find.\u201d</p><p>My plan was to avoid Rule until hell froze over. I didn\u2019t regret sleeping with him, in fact it had lived up to every expectation I had ever had of sex and in all truthfulness my ideas of sex with him. There wasn\u2019t any other person I could have imagined giving my virginity to and while I wish I had been sober and that it had been based more on emotion than physical attraction, the deed itself had been amazing and worth any twinge of remorse I had. I knew my relationship with Rule would never be the same and I had to be okay with that. I refused to be the girl that pined after him, that stalked him and called him a hundred times a day. I decided the morning after it was all said and done that I was lucky it had been as nice as it was and if that was all I was ever going to get from Rule it was going to be enough.</p><p>\u201cNo, him knowing wouldn\u2019t change anything, it would just make me feel worse. We both know I\u2019m not his type and I\u2019ve dealt with enough rejection from people that are supposed to love me to last a lifetime. Rule and I can just go on about being uneasy companions when we\u2019re forced to spend time together and that\u2019ll just have to be how it is.\u201d Rome didn\u2019t need to know that things were bound to be even more strained and awkward between us now.</p><p>\u201cDinner with your dad was that bad this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got married again, she\u2019s twenty-five.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cShe spent the entire dinner telling me why I should rush the sorority she was in last year before she graduated, dad spent the whole dinner trying to tell me that I needed to give Gabe another chance. He wrote me out a check for a grand after implying he would double it if I took Gabe back so it was more like extortion and torture than dinner.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled without humor. \u201cNo word from your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how someone as softhearted as you came from those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either I\u2019m just glad I only have to deal with them in limited doses anymore. Being a constant disappointment is exhausting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifted a dark eyebrow. \u201cMy little brother probably knows a little bit about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens at birthday dinner stays at birthday dinner, right Rome?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything. If he hasn\u2019t noticed it after all this time it\u2019s not my job to hit him over the head with it, but I do think there is a good chance the two of you might be really good for each other. Opposites attract and all that.\u201d</p><p>The problem with that was I didn\u2019t think Rule and I were really all that opposite, I mean yes he had ink from the top of his mohawked head to his booted toes, and he was all metal barbells where I was pearls and antique cameos but we were both people trying to live beyond the boundaries everyone else seemed to want to set for us. We both had deep, painful issues with our parents, we both loved the other Archer boys beyond measure, we both desperately wanted to be seen for the value we had without other people\u2019s expectations of what we should or shouldn\u2019t be doing and after Saturday I now knew we both wanted sex to be just a little bit rough and just a little bit dirty. Yeah not as opposite as one would think at first glance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to keep Rule from living dark ever since Remy died, it\u2019s only gotten worse, not better and I just can\u2019t keep going down that path if there\u2019s never going to be an end.\u201d</p><p>Rome sighed as we got up and headed out into the chilly air. \u201cAt the end of the day little girl we\u2019re all each other has, so no matter how tough it gets for any of us we just have to power through and keep it together.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a hug and rubbed my cold hands together. I clutched the picture close to my chest and shivered as the bitter night breeze got past my scarf. \u201cThat\u2019s easier for you to say because you\u2019re an ocean away, most of the time it\u2019s just me and Rule in an uneasy truce and your parents breathing down our necks and mine ignoring me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said it yourself Shaw, you\u2019re not a kid anymore you can figure this out. I have faith in you.\u201d</p><p>That was just Rome. He was the protector, the one that ultimately wanted what was best for all of us. I told him to call me before he headed back to Brookside and made my way back to the apartment. It was a rare day that Ayden and I both had off so she was sprawled in the living room with books everywhere. She was studying so intently with the radio up so loud I don\u2019t think she heard me come in. She had been giving me crap all week about Rule. While she was all for me sewing wild oats and making decisions that made me happy, and believe me he had made me oh so very happy. She knew that my feelings for Rule were more complicated than I tended to let on and was convinced I was courting an even more thoroughly broken heart.</p><p>I tip toed up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder making her shriek and whirl around. The reaction was so dramatic it made me double over in laughter. I flopped on the couch with a groan and took off my coat and scarf. She scowled up at me as she reached over to turn down the radio. \u201cNot cool. How was dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe grilled me about Rule; he seems to think we can fix each other or some nonsense like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of the troublemaker have you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. I know how he works, Ayd. Do you know how many sad, bewildered girls I\u2018ve seen him ditch the morning after? I refuse to be one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but you guys know each other, you were kinda friends.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged a shoulder. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter to him. Women have always been interchangeable. It\u2019s been that was since we were young.\u201d</p><p>I ran a hand through my tangled hair and stifled a yawn. I had been studying extra hard because midterms were right around the corner and the extra weekend shift at work was starting to wear on me. Add in the fact I was waking up in the night all hot and bothered and I was tired girl.</p><p>\u201cI think I might go curl up with a book and crash out early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep the music down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries have a good night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou too, and hey at least the hickey is starting to fade.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at her and went into my room. I flopped face first on the bed and swore under my breath when I heard my phone ringing from my purse normally I would have ignored it but it was playing Twisted Sister\u2019s \u2018We\u2019re not gonna take it\u2019 and I knew it was my mother and if I didn\u2019t answer she would just keep calling back until I did. Her time was deemed just that valuable. I rolled over and dug it out.</p><p>\u201cHello mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw, I\u2019m sorry it took me so long to get back to you about your birthday. We were in California. Jack had a business trip and since it\u2019s so cold here I thought the kids would like the beach.\u201d</p><p>I guess phones didn\u2019t work in California. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to your father, he said you seemed distracted and out of sorts. We discussed it and I really think whatever game you are playing with Gabe has to stop. You\u2019re a mature young woman now Shaw, you need to start making smarter life decisions. Flitting from boy to boy just will not stand any longer.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even tell me happy birthday. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in Gabe, mom, not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterest is frivolous. He comes from a good family, he has a planned out future, those are things that a young woman of your linage need to look for in a partner.\u201d</p><p>I blew a hiss out through my teeth and squeezed my eyes shut. \u201cSo those are the things that drew dad to Marissa? She comes from a good family? She had a secure future? Or maybe he just likes her big ole double-ds and the fact she does whatever he says. Come on mom you\u2019re being ridiculous. I most certainly am not going to spend time with a guy that makes my skin crawl just because you like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage young lady! I don\u2019t know where you think all those smarts you have came from, but I\u2019m neither foolish or blind, I know that this has to do with that Archer boy. It always does.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my forehead where I felt the beginning of a migraine starting, she brought them on faster than anything else. \u201cSo what if it does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Shaw, when are you going to outgrow this silly crush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom I\u2019m starting to get a headache can this wait until another time?\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a long minute and I could feel the waves of censure over the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to invite the Davenports to dinner. You need to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not if Gabe is going to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will be there. Do not forget your father and I pay for your tuition.\u201d</p><p>Great yet another parent that was extorting me, boy was I lucky. \u201cYeah, fine, whatever.\u201d I didn\u2019t even say bye I just chucked the phone under the other pillow and hit the lights. I had no idea how Rome thought I could fix anyone, be good for anyone, I didn\u2019t even have control over my own life and it was making me physically ill.</p><p>I spent the rest of the week and weekend being a good college student. I studied every chance I got, finished my lab project, got a head start on one of my papers that was due at midterm and even managed to squeeze in some help for Ayden since she was struggling with I-Chem and I had breezed through it. I was working on a piece for one of my prerequisite classes, a speech on why assisted suicide should be legal, super fun stuff, but the apartment was too quiet and I was tired of ignoring my phone every time it rang fearing it would be one of my parents or Gabe so I packed my laptop up and went down to Pikes Perk to finish it. Ayden had texted that I should just come to the bar because it was slow, but I needed a less stimulating environment and a coffee shop full of hipsters seemed to be just the ticket. I had a pile of research in front of me and a caramel latte cooling by my elbow, I was so into what I was doing that I didn\u2019t notice the chair across from me at the little table getting pulled back until the metal legs craped across the floor.</p><p>In fact I was so intent on the paperwork spread out before me it wasn\u2019t until a familiar hand with the snake tattoo and his name across the knuckles pushed shut the top of my computer that I realized I had company. I blinked in surprise and looked up to find those arctic colored eyes watching me intently. He was still rocking the mohawk, only now it was a shocking red and he looked ridiculously good in a tight long sleeved t-shirt and jeans that were a little baggy. I didn\u2019t bother to hide the fact that I was openly checking him out.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I hadn\u2019t saved any of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met, remember? I know you well enough to know you probably save after every sentence.\u201d</p><p>It was every paragraph but whatever. \u201cThis is kind of out of the way for you, what are you doing here?\u201d I hadn\u2019t seen him or spoken to him in exactly ten days. The idea that he had purposely sought me out just seemed too farfetched to be believed so I scolded myself not to even begin to read into his sudden appearance.</p><p>\u201cI actually went by the bar. I ran into your roommate and she said told me you were probably here working on homework, Shaw we need to talk.\u201d I had never heard him sound so serious, it made me nervous. I needed something to do with my hands so I picked up my drink and tried to hide behind it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we do.\u201d I was halfway certain he was going to say something that was going to make me want to chuck the lukewarm coffee at his head.</p><p>He raised the eyebrow that had the double silver bars in and leaned forward so that he was resting his elbow on his knees and staring directly into my eyes. There were interesting shadows dancing and flashing in the silver depths of his that I didn\u2019t know what to make of, but he had never looked more enticing than he did in that moment.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You really think things can go down like they did and we just pretend like it never happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing and it seems to be working just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw,\u201d he sounded exasperated. \u201cWe are not going to have seriously awesome sex that of which just happens to be your first time and not talk about it. First off I want to know what you were doing with Remy for all those years if you weren\u2019t sleeping together, that just doesn\u2019t make any sense. I also want to know why you took off the next morning, you didn\u2019t even me a chance to try and talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I set the coffee down and pushed some of my hair out of my face, I leaned towards him so that I was almost in the exact same position he was. We were so close I could see each of his eyelashes as they brushed against his cheek when he blinked.</p><p>\u201cI told you guys until I was blue in the face that Remy and I were just friends. We never, ever had any kind of romantic relationship. Our friendship was deep, it was powerful and intimate in a way Neanderthal males fail to understand, but it was never physical and I can\u2019t believe you thought I would stick around after just to have you rush me out the door the next morning. I\u2019ve seen you in action more times than I care to admit Rule, I wasn\u2019t going to be another one of your morning after headaches. I have more pride than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were going to hold onto your virginity for twenty years and then just give it up to me for no apparent reason?\u201d He sounded slightly put out which made grin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had my reasons Rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd those would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me to know. Look I didn\u2019t ask you for anything after, I don\u2019t expect anything from you so can\u2019t we just get over it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo we can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I reeled back a little bit and frowned at him. \u201cWhat? Why not? We\u2019ve known each other forever; this is just a thing that happened.\u201d I flipped my wrist in a way I hoped was dismissive and went stock still as he grabbed my hand in his much larger one. I stared fascinated as the tattooed digits linked with my own.</p><p>\u201cSee this thing that happened,\u201d his voice dropped a few octaves and I was suddenly acutely aware that the coffee shop was full and that for whatever reason we had garnered enough interest from the fellow patrons that several nearby tables were watching our interaction with rapt attention. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just some insignificant event that we can just ignore, believe me I tried. I went out Friday and met a smoking hot redhead.\u201d I felt my face fold into a scowl as I tried to pull away from him. He smiled at me and used my trapped hand to pull me even closer. \u201cSadly it took maybe five minutes to realize that I was trying to use one girl to get another off my mind so I thought Saturday I would try for a blond or maybe a brunette, hell maybe both because my head was all twisted up by a chick it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d I tugged on my hand but he just pulled me closer still so that he was practically whispering in my ear and that I was almost sitting on his lap. I had to use my free hand to brace myself on his hard thigh. It was way too intimate, way too familiar to touch him this way when I was trying to put distance between us and he was telling me about trying to take other girls to bed. \u201cSo Nash and I went out and there were redheads and there were brunettes and there was even a super-hot chick that looked kinda like Pink but you think any of them did it for me? No, Shaw not one because they weren\u2019t fucking you and ever since you walked out on Sunday all I\u2019ve been thinking of is you. Now why is that?\u201d</p><p>His words made me shiver from the inside out. \u201cBecause it was new, because we have history and it makes it harder for you to keep me faceless and nameless, I don\u2019t know Rule.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a hand and ran his thumb across the rise of my cheek. I made my breath catch and my heart start to trip over itself.</p><p>\u201cWhatever the reason it matters Shaw. It matters a lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say Rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, all I know is other girls aren\u2019t you and that isn\u2019t cutting it for me so I think we need to figure out what\u2019s going on between us.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head a little and a silver flare lit up his pale gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be one of many. Like I said I had my reasons for letting things happen the way they did, but if you think I\u2019m signing up to be a bed filler because no one else is fitting the bill right now you are sadly mistaken. I know you Rule; I\u2019ve known you since you first figured out girls were more complicated than boys and you\u2019ve never wanted to put the work in.\u201d</p><p>The feather light sweep of that thumb across my cheek almost had me melting into a puddle at his booted feet. \u201cSo this time I will, we\u2019ll hangout, do shit together, I mean we\u2019ve known each other forever but I honestly don\u2019t really know anything about you. Come on Shaw what do you really have to lose?\u201d</p><p>Not my heart because he already had it even though he didn\u2019t know it. \u201cSo you want to like date?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not really the dating type but I swear that while we\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s going on that I\u2019ll keep it in my pants. No screwing around, no other girls. I owe it to you and to me to see what\u2019s here or if it was just a fluke.\u201d He sounded so sincere; he looked as serious and as determined to make me believe what he was saying as I had ever seen.</p> <p>I cleared my throat and bit my bottom lip a little. Sure it was what I had dreamed of, Rule suddenly realizing I was a girl and wanting to be with me. Granted in my fantasy that always came with his profession of undying love and devotion, but in reality his curiosity and a promise to at least feel things out was probably as good as I was ever going to get. I didn\u2019t know how much I trusted him, but I had always, always wanted him and it just wasn\u2019t in me to turn that down when it was being offered up on a silver platter.</p><p>\u201cIf we do this; hangout, spend time together your parents, my parents, Rome none of them are going to like it very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d</p><p>I guess I did but I always was the always the only one to worry about that stuff.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>I breathed out a soft breath and as it whispered across his mouth he briefly closed his eyes so I did the only thing that was left to do, I leaned forward and pressed my lips to his. It wasn\u2019t the same desperation as it had been the last time, there was no panic that he would change his mind, no years upon years of pent up desire and frustration, there was no regret that it was only going to be a one night thing Just the sweet press of my lips against his and the soft bite of that lip ring into my lower lip. Kissing Rule would always be uniquely different from kissing anyone else, there was just something about it that put it in a class all its own. I felt his lips turn up into a grin as audible sighs from several of the tables around us were heard. He pulled back and tapped a finger on the tip of my nose.</p><p>I sat back in my chair and cleared my throat. \u201cWell then.\u201d</p> <p>He barked out a laugh. \u201cYeah, at least that part of it seems to be a no-brainer.\u201d</p><p>I shifted in my seat and motioned absently to the work still sprawled across the table between us. \u201cAs nice as this little visit was I have to finish this presentation.\u201d</p><p>A quick flash of disappointment blazed across his eyes but he hid it behind that easy grin. \u201cWhen do you work this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work all weekend, but I\u2019m first out Saturday night, I just have to be in by ten on Sunday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this hanging out thing might be harder than I thought?\u201d</p><p>He said it light heartedly but I knew Rule, he was an instant gratification kind of guy. If my tight schedule made it hard for us to spend time together I had no illusions that he would wait around for me to get free, he would move on to something easier and more manageable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out around ten on Saturday and usually I\u2019m out by seven on Sunday, the Sunday shift is optional I just picked it up because we stopped going to Brookside and I figured I might as well make a little extra money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy buddy Jet is playing at Cerberus this weekend, why don\u2019t you grab your roommate and come hangout Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of music is it?\u201d Cerberus had a pretty rowdy reputation in town. It was located in the warehouse district and had been shut down more than once for one thing or another. It wasn\u2019t the kind of place I would normally consider spending time, in fact it was the kind of place I normally avoided at all costs just on the off chance I would run into someone I knew and they would rat me out to my parents, but if I was going to commit to trying to spend time with this boy that I had wanted forever, then my horizons were going to have to expand.</p><p>\u201cMetal.\u201d</p><p>I snorted a little. \u201cAyden is from Kentucky, she likes Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood. I don\u2019t know that I could wrangle her into that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re actually really good, they went on tour with a pretty famous band last year, besides Ayden seems like a pretty cool chick I bet she would go just to be your wingman. If she doesn\u2019t come just come alone, I won\u2019t leave you hanging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to go to Fort Carson for the weekend. He has to set up meetings with his VA counselor. He\u2019s having a rough time since he isn\u2019t healing as fast as he thought he would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hide this from anyone Shaw, if you want to play those kind of games maybe you need to rethink whether this is something you really want to do or not.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his forearm and let the tips of my fingers dig into the body of the snake that was marked there. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to hide, just don\u2019t make me look like an idiot Rule. This matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters to me too, Casper.\u201d He climbed to his feet so that he was towering over me. He bent down and pressed a soft kiss to the crown of my head. \u201cBy the way you look good in jeans. Come to the show Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d I watched him walk out of the coffee shop and it wasn\u2019t lost on me that so did every other girl in the place. I stifled a sigh and ruefully shook my head. I went to flip the top of my computer back open when the girl sitting directly across from me caught my eye. She was a little bit older than me, had long dreadlocks that were a startling ocean blue and she was staring at me in open envy. I had to blink a little bit because I was so used to being the one that looked at the girls crawling out of his bed like that. She gave me a sheepish grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have your hands full with that one.\u201d</p><p>Considering I wasn\u2019t even a hundred percent sure what we were doing I had no doubt she was right. It wasn\u2019t like he asked me to be his girlfriend or even on an honest to God date, he just said he wanted to hang out and spend time together, that wasn\u2019t defined or clear and I didn\u2019t even know what that meant to him. I appreciated that he told me he was willing to keep it in his pants, that he was aware that whatever was happening between us was important enough to try and figure out without the complication of other girls involved, but I was acutely aware that old habits tended to die hard and Rule was not known to practice restraint. I huffed out a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d</p><p>The girl laughed a little. \u201cHe actually tattooed a giant lotus flower on my friend\u2019s leg; she spent all three sessions trying to get him to ask her out on a date. I guess I can tell her he has a girlfriend so it\u2019ll make her feel better.\u201d</p><p>I picked my coffee back up and tried to get my head out of the Rule fog that it had descended into and tried to move it back to good college student mode.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? It sure looked like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other a long time, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>She winked at me and gave me a saucy grin. \u201cOh honey when they look like that and exude that kind of do-me, do-me it always will be.\u201d</p><p>Well there it was. If a perfect stranger could plainly see after literally only five minutes of watching us together that it was always going to be a battle to keep things with him on the level what chance did I have of making anything between us work? With that depressing thought I went back to assisted suicide and tried to cheer myself up.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Rule</p><p>The club was packed. Enmity was a pretty big local draw for metal heads and punk-rockers, plus Jet had been in the scene since he was just a kid so he had a solid local following from just being around for so long. Some crappy wannabe Slayer band was opening up for them and already doing their warm up, they were followed by an all-girl punk band so the show was supposed to run late which was good because it was well past eleven and I couldn\u2019t stop looking at the display on my phone to check the time. Every time I did it Nash rolled his eyes and Jet laughed at me, granted they were doing a bang up job of polishing off a bottle of Patron between the two of them so I didn\u2019t take it personally but I had sent Shaw a text over an hour ago to verify she was going to be here and I hadn\u2019t heard a thing back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was antsy and ill-tempered partly because I was navigating uncharted territory and undeniably because this whole monogamy thing was new to me. I was used to scratching an itch when I felt it, used to appealing to baser needs and letting my carnal instinct drive me, behaving not because someone asked me to but because I wanted to was entirely new to me and the side effects sucked. I was horny and irritable, plus I was sick of playing phone tag with her, I had no idea how busy Shaw\u2019s life was. The girl was bouncing from class, to work, to volunteer stuff all day long. When I saw her before on the weekends I had just assumed she had free time and was choosing to spend Sunday\u2019s with my folks, clearly that wasn\u2019t the case. Every minute of the girl\u2019s day was planned and orchestrated, it made the fact that she had sacrificed a lot by refusing to see them until they opened their eyes more clear.</p><p>\u201cChill out. If she said she was coming than she\u2019s coming.\u201d Nash shoved an elbow in my ribs making me jostle the phone I was glaring holes into. I shoved it back into my pocket and picked up the beer I had been nursing for over an hour. I caught the eye of a smoking hot blond that had been scoping me out under the radar since we walked in the bar and had to do a quick mental rundown of why I thought spending time with Shaw and figuring out how she had got my head all twisted and turned was a good idea when easy as pie was right in front of me. The blond gave me a smile that all but screamed \u201cI want you to take my pants off with your teeth\u201d and I almost choked when beer went down the wrong tube.</p><p>Jet snickered and rubbed a hand through his messy black hair. The guy looked like a rock star; he was lanky and had that permanent freshly-laid and outta bed look that made girls stupid and dreamy eyed with zero effort. He also had an awesome voice and could sing, like really sing which made the fact he chose to be in a heavy metal band ironic because most of his stuff with Enmity was screaming and loud, but the guy was a consummate musician and could write a killer song as well as play pretty much any instrument he picked up. One night after a particularly nasty bout of beer pong he had confessed that he liked metal because he couldn\u2019t deal with the fame and adulation of more popular styles of music. They guy wanted to be in a band but for reasons that only made sense to him, had no interest in being a full blown rock star, even though he had the look and the chops to do it.</p><p>\u201cI swear you pull more tail than me and I\u2019m in a freaking band. All you have to do is blink and you have broads falling all over themselves to have at it.\u201d</p> <p>I cleared my throat and set the beer down on the table. \u201cYeah, well I told you guys I need to cut that shit out for a while.\u201d</p><p>Jet looked over his shoulder at the blond than back at me with a smirk. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>Nash tossed back a shot and hissed out a breath through his teeth. \u201cCut him some slack dude, he\u2019s got a good thing working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying he doesn\u2019t have to even work at it.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out my phone and checked the time for the hundredth time. \u201cSomething tells me that is about to be completely untrue.\u201d</p> <p>Jet and Nash both did another shot and Jet gave a howl. \u201cThe first band is getting ready to start so I gotta go make sure the guys are ready to kick some ass tonight. We\u2019re getting ready to finish the album we\u2019ve been working on so we need to kill it tonight.\u201d A round of fists banging went back and forth and I sighed as the blond gave me another pointed look. I didn\u2019t mean to keep looking in her direction but I guess old habits died hard.</p><p>\u201cThis blows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, chill. Shaw is awesome, she\u2019s a total babe, she\u2019s got enough balls to give you your shit right back and she knows you and still is willing to give you a shot. She\u2019ll be here so just calm down and tell your junk to freaking relax.\u201d</p><p>My hair was still up in the crazy mohawk so I couldn\u2019t run my hands through it; instead I rubbed the back of my neck and tapped my fingers on the edge of the table.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think she wants to give this a shot, I mean logically she knows I\u2019m a bad bet, she knows what my history is like and historically we don\u2019t have anything in common. I know I can\u2019t get her out of my head, but what do you think her reasons are for seeing what this is all about are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s a super bright chick and whatever her motivation is she\u2019s thought a lot about it. I don\u2019t think she went to bed with you just because and I seriously doubt she agreed to kick it with you simply because you asked. I think if you can keep your head on straight and your dick in your pants you\u2019ll eventually find out why she\u2019s doing what she\u2019s doing and I\u2019m pretty sure the reasons will knock you on your ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m certifiable for even thinking I\u2019m going to be able to do this.\u201d I liked girls, liked no strings attached sex, liked going where I wanted when I wanted and I liked not having to answer to anyone but myself and hooking up with Shaw put all those things on ice. I sighed again and let my eyes wander back over to the blond. She was still looking at me only now her very pretty face was scrunched up into a scowl. Her mouth was pulled in like she had tasted something sour and I couldn\u2019t figure out what had changed in the minute since I had last caught her eye until I heard Nash mutter \u201cDamn,\u201d and realized that every guy seated around us had turned to watch Shaw and Ayden as they made their way past the bar and towards where we were seated.</p><p>They made a striking pair. By far the classiest girls in the place, it was clear neither one had ventured down to Cerberus before. Shaw\u2019s blond hair was loose and long, falling over shoulders bared in a black halter top. She had skinny jeans on that looked like they would need to be surgically removed they were so tight and a pair of bright blue heels that should look ridiculous at a show like this, but instead had even old school head bangers drooling in their pints. Ayden had her dark hair spiked up and sexy, she was in a tiny little skirt and a billowy purple top that completely fell off of one shoulder. She was rocking a pair of black cowboy boots that had clearly seen some better days but that didn\u2019t stop the two of them from turning every single head, male and female as they slid up on our table.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just stared at Shaw while she stared back. I was pretty sure all the blood in my brain had been diverted south so I just blinked at her like an idiot while Nash chuckled and told both of them hello.</p><p>\u201cHey. Sorry we\u2019re late we had a bachelor party run over and it took us longer to get out of there than we thought it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent you a couple of texts to see what was going on.\u201d I should be asking her if she wanted a drink, doing something to let her know I was happy she was here but instead I was being surly and weird.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cMy phone is off.\u201d</p><p>Ayden propped her elbows on the table and took the shot Nash offered her up. She glared at Shaw and pointed a finger at her. \u201cTell him why it\u2019s off.\u201d There was accusation there and I saw, even in the dim light of the bar the way she flushed.</p><p>I put a hand on her lower back and bent down so that my lips were touching her ear. I felt her tense but she leaned her hip into mine. \u201cWhy is your phone off Casper?\u201d</p> <p>She shifted her weight from foot to foot. \u201cBecause Gabe is blowing it up. Mt mom invited his parents to Brookside Country Club for dinner next weekend and they expect us both to be there. He has it in his head that we should ride up there together and won\u2019t leave me alone about it so I turned my phone off because he\u2019s making me crazy and I don\u2019t even want to go in the first place.\u201d</p><p>A cocktail waitress chose that moment to walk by so the girls ordered drinks and I got another beer. I pressed Shaw closer to my side and turned so that we were facing each other.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>She flattened a palm on the center of my chest right over my heart and looked up at me with sad, green eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have to go or my mom will make my life hell, but I don\u2019t want to be anywhere near Gabe. I\u2019m trying to just ignore the entire thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work for long.\u201d I liked the way she fit next to me, like she was custom made to be right there.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The waitress dropped off drinks and Ayden grimaced as the first band started. I laughed and poured her another shot.</p><p>\u201cJust power through the first two, I promise Jet\u2019s band is really good.\u2019</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI like stuff with a little more twang and a lot more banjo.\u201d</p><p>We all laughed a little. \u201cJust help Nash finish the tequila, that\u2019ll get you through and if it gets too bad I bet Jet has ear plugs we can go snag for ya.\u201d She said something I didn\u2019t catch but made Nash laugh hysterically so I turned back to Shaw. I gave an internal shiver when I noticed she was having some kind of girly stare down with the other blond from earlier. I curled my hand all the way around her waist and yanked until she was pressed full body against me.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like she has to be so obvious about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw look around. There are at least ten guys sitting no less than five feet away I can actually see undressing you with their eyes, it\u2019s cool. I\u2019m hanging with you, not her and you\u2019re here because of me not them, that\u2019s what matters, right?\u201d</p><p>She made a face at me which made me want to suck on her bottom lip. I reached up and tucked a piece of her hair behind her ear. It felt like satin and immediately slipped back out. \u201cI\u2019ve never waited around for a week to spend time with a girl I\u2019m into before, frankly it blows, and I want to spend time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry we ran late. I had to do some work to get Ayden to agree to come. This really isn\u2019t her scene, mine either for that matter, but I\u2019m glad we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She ran her index finger over the tattoo of the phoenix that was sticking out of the sleeve of my t-shirt on my bicep. \u201cI want to spend time with you too, Rule. I\u2019m sorry my life is so hectic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I slid my hand under the heavy fall of her hair and leaned down to whisper in her ear, \u201cSo are you going to come home with me tonight or what?\u201d If she said no there was a good chance I was going to have to take a cold shower before I could get my jeans off. Her green eyes were brilliant as they gazed back up at me, never had a girl, especially a girl I had known for so long been able to keep me guessing as to what she was thinking. Shaw was a hard one to read, her eyes just seemed to be reflecting back what I was feeling instead.</p><p>\u201cWe took a cab so as long as I make sure Ayden is cool that can definitely be an option.\u201d Her voice had dropped to an even huskier octave and I thought it was possible I had never heard anything sexier. I grunted in approval like the Neanderthal I was and let my hand fall from her waist to the curve of her ass.</p><p>The four of us chatted and had a couple more rounds while we all suffered through the first and second band. The second one would have been alright if the lead singer had focused more on trying to sing than looking a part but for the most part they just hollered and jumped around for an hour and Ayden was ready to jump on stage and wrestle the microphone from the poor girl. I was surprised how fun it was to just hangout. Ayden was funny and sarcastic, she and Nash bounced barbs back and forth like they had been friends for years and by the time enmity was setting up the Patron was gone and the two of them were loaded. Shaw was quieter, she was watching everyone and everything around her, she asked questions and responded when engaged in conversation but for the most part she just kept an eye on what was going on rather than fully participating in it. At one point I almost started a brawl because I had gone to the bathroom and Nash had slipped out to smoke, we were only gone for a minute and by the time I got back to the table some sweaty metal head was trying to press up on Shaw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wasn\u2019t the type that got jealous, I mean I lived my entire life not being as good as my twin so I couldn\u2019t understand the murderous rage that was suddenly flowing through me, the sudden need to claim something, do announce to the world that she was mine. Luckily Nash got to the table first and sent the guy on his way in no uncertain terms because chances were I would have pulverized him and ended up spending the night in jail. Still when I got back to the table I had yanked Shaw up to the tips of her fancy ass blue shoes and planted a kiss on her pretty, pink mouth hard enough that my lip ring stung. I thought maybe she would pull back, maybe give me crap for acting like an idiot bit she just griped my shirt in her tiny hands and let me do what I had to do. When I finally set her back down her eyes looked glassy and she was flushed. She slicked her tongue over her bottom lip and settled back into my side.</p><p>\u201cGotta tell you Rule, I\u2019m a fan of kissing with all that metal in your face. I never thought that was something I would be into, but you sure make it work.\u201d</p><p>Oh man was that the hottest thing I had ever heard, ever. I hooked an arm around her shoulder. \u201cAnd you know maybe next time you could just pee in a circle around me so that they know you\u2019ve already been there.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled at her dry remark but didn\u2019t bother to deny what the overt action had been about. We continued to chat and have a great time but by the time the house lights went down and Jet was ready to hit the stage I had had enough of friend time and wanted alone time with just her, unfortunately Jet knew how to put on a good show and even though Ayden claimed that the racket the band was making could in no way be called music it only took two songs to have her dragging Shaw up to the front of the stage with her. The band was loud, aggressive and blazed from song to song, but Jet was a good looking guy and knew how to work a crowd so it didn\u2019t surprise me when the girls had run off that there had been a drunkenly, interested gleam in Ayden\u2019s eyes. Unfortunately it also left me alone to deal with my plastered best friend.</p> <p>\u201cYou gonna make it?\u201d</p><p>Nash\u2019s violet eyes were at half-mast and I was pretty sure that if the table wasn\u2019t available to hold him up he would be face first down on the floor. This is what I normally looked like after a night of hard drinking, it was slightly startling to see it from the other side.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d His words were mumbled and unfocused and I saw visions of sexy time going up in smoke and replaced with the reality that I was going to have to manhandle him back to the apartment and get him in a bathroom like right now.</p><p>\u201cBro you better not yak in my truck. Let me go find the girls and let them know we have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmhhh...\u201d Okay it was mission critical to get him out of here before the tequila came back up. I sighed and started toward the stage only to be intercepted before I got there by the blond from earlier. Now that Shaw was here and my head was in control not what was in my pants I could clearly see there was no comparison between the two. Shaw was flawless and pretty in a way that didn\u2019t require five pounds of makeup and clothes that exposed more than they covered. She was also charmingly unaware of the affect she had on the opposite sex, where this girl was here to be seen and appreciated. She put a finger on the center of my chest and blinked heavily lashed eyes at me.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh hi.\u201d I would just step around her but the bar was packed and the band was making the crowd go crazy. People were jumping up and down and banging heads all around so unless I walked right over her I wasn\u2019t going to be able to get by. Because I was so tall I had a clear sight of one dark head and one light bouncing along to the music right up front, while I was stoked Shaw seemed to be having fun, I was also bummed she was practically impossible to get to.</p><p>\u201cSo I saw you earlier, you\u2019re friends with the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Normally this was the kind of girl I sought out, easy, no strings, aware of where the night was going and what the morning was going to hold.</p><p>\u201cSo do you maybe wanna get out of here, go somewhere quieter where we can...talk?\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows shot up. When I was drunk maybe that sounded smoother, but now that I was sober it just seemed kind of sleazy and desperate. \u201cThanks but I\u2019m here with somebody.\u201d</p> <p>Her bright red mouth pulled into a frown and she took a step back. \u201cYeah I saw that, and I also saw that there is no way that she\u2019s with you for long.\u201d</p><p>I was used to judgment, used to hearing that I wasn\u2019t up to par or good enough for whatever reason, but coming from a boozed up bar fly that had just tried to talk me into taking her to bed it made me reel back a little.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what else to say to that.</p><p>The girl snorted and flipped her over processed hair over her shoulder. \u201cThat girl has money and status written all over her, you have ink and nothing but a good time spelled out bright and clear all over you. How long do you think she\u2019s going to think you\u2019ve got more going on than that?\u201d</p><p>I frowned and was done with social courtesy. I physically moved her out of my way and called over my shoulder, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019d be an idiot not to stick around until she figures it out.\u201d Sweaty bodies got nudged and prodded until I got to the girls. Jet was right in front of them both on his knees, his head was thrown back, his shirt was torn off and the massive angel of death I had tattooed across his torso was in full display. He was wailing like a true rock god and while Shaw looked fascinated, Ayden looked like she was about to melt into a pile of orgasmic goo. Looked like my buddy had turned the country mouse, rock for the night. I put a hand on Shaw\u2019s hip and bent low to tell her, \u201cI gotta get Nash out of here, he\u2019s done for.\u201d She looked at me with big eyes and nodded with no argument. She leaned over to holler something at Ayden who hollered something back. The brunette wiggled her fingers at me in a wave and the next thing I knew Shaw\u2019s tiny frame was pulling me back through the crowd. Nash was now almost fully draped over the table and I didn\u2019t miss the bouncer giving him the eye.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ayden, you said we needed to make sure she got home okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe promised to call when she was leaving. She said she would just get a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be alright here by herself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s a big girl and can take care of herself, plus I think she danced most of the booze out. I think she\u2019s sticking around to tell your friend how much she enjoyed the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJet has that effect on women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why.\u201d I wrestled Nash up and marched him out of the bar with an arm around his waist. He was solid and maneuvering his sturdy bulk was difficult.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna change your mind and drop me for a rock star?\u201d</p><p>She snorted and took the keys I tossed her to get the cab doors open so that I could shove Nash sideways across the back seat. \u201cYou better not get sick in here dude.\u201d</p><p>There was no response so I helped Shaw climb in and it occurred to me that she hadn\u2019t even hesitated to leave with me. That made something in the center of my chest get all slippery and warm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying that he\u2019s pretty charismatic and even though I didn\u2019t understand half of what he was singing it was still pretty powerful. He had that entire bar eating out of the palm of his hand, that kind of draw is impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jet was born to be a rock star he just has a problem with the spotlight and recognition he always has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve known him a long time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used to go see him play when we were kids, back when he was into punk. Nash, Jet and Rowdy have been my inner circle for a long time. Rowdy we met later when he started working at the shop but we all kick it like we are brothers from other mothers.\u201d</p><p>She settled in the leather seat and I adjusted the heat when I noticed she was rubbing goose bumps on her arms. \u201cIt must be nice to have a lot of good friends. I was never like that.\u201d</p><p>I looked out of the corner of my eye at her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shy and awkward. I never know how to just make friends like that. I was picked on a lot in high school. Remy was my only real friend and now really only Ayden. I have a hard time letting people in, I guess because I\u2019ve seen how painful it is when it\u2019s the people that are the closest to you are the ones constantly disappointing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me and Rome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Nash groaned from the back and I looked over my shoulder apprehensively. He didn\u2019t sound good. \u201cWhat about us, we were there too, weren\u2019t we your friends?\u201d</p><p>She made a little humming noise that immediately made vital parts of my anatomy take notice.</p><p>\u201cRome has always been like a big brother, he looked out for me, he picks on me, he tries to keep things that hurt me and cause me pain at bay. You, well you were always something else, not a friend, not a brother just something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that bad, the something else?\u201d</p><p>I felt rather than saw her shrug. \u201cIt has been, and then sometimes it\u2019s not.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to make of that so I let the subject drop. I drove the rest of the way keeping one eye on the road and one eye on Nash who was making increasingly loud noises of distress in the back. When we got to the apartment I looked across the cab at her but she was bent over the back of the seat rubbing Nash\u2019s bald head and uttering soothing words to him.</p><p>\u201cHey I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll take to get him squared away, you can just hangout and if you want me to run you home or whatever I will.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me over her shoulder and raised a pale brow. \u201cRule its fine. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know how you end up in the state you\u2019re normally in on Sunday morning. Like I told you I just have to be to work on Sunday around ten as long as you make that happen we\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>At a loss for words I just stared at her for a moment before Nash\u2019s gurgling made me move. \u201cHave you always been this awesome?\u201d</p><p>She shut all the doors behind us and helped me haul Nash up the steps. I noticed she didn\u2019t answer my question, but she did get Nash a huge glass of water and fished around in my bathroom until she found some pain killers. She left both on the bathroom sink in the hall that Nash used and gave me a pointed look. \u201cCome find me when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>I swore in a long litany under my breath as I helped Nash battle his thermal and jeans off. I was contemplating shoving his ass in a cold shower when the tequila started to take its revenge. The tattooed head disappeared inside the toilet and I spent the next hour making sure he didn\u2019t pass out and alternately cramming liquids down his throat and jumping out of the way as they came back up. When I was finally sure he wasn\u2019t going to get sick anymore I hauled him to his bed and made sure he was face down before I did a quick cleanup of the bathroom and myself and then went to find Shaw.</p><p>The door to my room was cracked open and she had my TV on. I wasn\u2019t sure what I was going to find, the dirtier part of my imagination had all kinds of interesting scenarios laid out but wait awaited me wasn\u2019t one of them. She had my California king stripped to the mattress pad and was making short work of changing all the bedding. Her crazy blue shoes were in the center of the floor looking totally out of place next to my discarded t-shirts and jeans and as I propped myself up in the doorway all I could do was watch her. She seemed to be having some kind of conversation with herself but she was muttering too low for me to hear what she was saying. I waited a full five minutes for her to look up at me or notice my watching her but she never did, so I asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d which made her jump about a foot in the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She put a hand on her chest and had the good grace to look a little bit guilty.</p><p>\u201cChanging your sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh...Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Shaw why are you changing my sheets at nearly three o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d</p><p>She was saved from answering when a Garth Brooks song rang from her pocket. I was starting to see she liked to pick songs for ring tones that fit the person calling. She had a brief conversation with who I assumed was Ayden and left the phone on the night stand next to the bed. She picked up the edge of my comforter and started to smooth it back over the big bed.</p><p>\u201cAyden got a ride home, I guess your friend in the band remembered her from the Goal Line and offered to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool, though Jet isn\u2019t exactly known for being a one girl kinda guy so I hope she isn\u2019t reading anything into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said she can take care of herself and honestly you aren\u2019t really known for that either,\u201d she waved a hand over the bed, \u201cso I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to sleep let alone do anything else in a bed that has had more visitors than DIA without changing the sheets first.\u201d Her bottom lip stuck out and she sounded slightly defiant.</p> <p>\u201cShaw,\u201d I moved out of the doorway, making sure to shut it and turn the lock on my way to her. \u201cNo one has been in that bed since you. I told you I knew on that Saturday that something was happening between us that was different.\u201d</p><p>She shivered a little as I got close and I could see raw vulnerability in her eyes. It was scary to know how easily I could hurt this girl and how desperately I didn\u2019t want that to happen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this with you, Rule. I drunkenly threw myself at you and was lucky you were willing to catch me, but sober it\u2019s hard to look at that bed and not see every single other girl that was there before me, sometimes more than one at a time.\u201d</p><p>She tried to make light of it but I could hear the genuine melancholy coloring her tone. I put both my hands on her face and tilted her head back so that we were eye to eye.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change the past, Casper, not any of it. I can\u2019t make any of those girls disappear or the fact you walked in on them on Sunday morning time and time again go away, I can\u2019t bring Remy back or go back in time and not call him for a ride that night. There are probably a million and one regrets I have and if they are going to be between us here or in bed then let\u2019s just stop it now because I\u2019m not going to do combat over my past when my future is finally starting to be something I want to invest in.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands up and grasped my wrists, at first I thought she was going to pull me away but she didn\u2019t. She leaned forward and let her forehead hit the center of my chest. \u201cRule if this goes bad it\u2019s gonna be so, so bad.\u201d Her voice was just a husky whisper against my chest.</p> <p>\u201cTrue, but if it\u2019s good it\u2019s going be so very, very good.\u201d I tunneled my fingers through her hair and she let her hands fall to my shoulders. We weren\u2019t a perfect match, she was a lot shorter than me and I had to admit that I knew logically we made an odd pair physically but there was just something about her, something about the way she curved into me, the way she sighed my name like a prayer, the way she smelled like sunshine and sweetness and everything yummy all wrapped into one bite that made none of that matter and made her the only girl I could ever remember wanting to hold onto for more than a fleeting minute of time.</p><p>She started to pull my shirt over my head and I laughed a little when she got mad when it got stuck on my spiky hair. She made a face at me and tossed it over her shoulder onto the floor. She used a finger to poke the front tip of the spiked up hawk and lifted an eyebrow. \u201cYou look hot with a mohawk, Rule but I gotta say this hair is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d She trailed her hands over my ribs and stopped to look at the art work imprinted there. On one side was a grim reaper that ran from under my arm pit to the top of my thigh, on the other side was a beautiful angel and in-between them on my back was a massive gothic cross that went from shoulder blade to shoulder blade and ended at my tailbone, scrolling from shoulder to shoulder on an elegant banner was \u2018Remy\u2019 in bold script. I had more inked skin than not and where I normally didn\u2019t think anything about it, being naked next to her in all her pale, perfect skinned glory it seemed slightly overwhelming. Her hands moved lower and before I had even kissed her she was messing with my belt buckle.</p><p>\u201cRemy would have loved that piece you know? He always used to tell me he was so glad when you started getting tattooed. He said someone having the same face as him was always too weird, but then you started looking so different , he was glad it was you because there was no way he could tolerate sitting still long enough to get anything done.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Remy was always moving, always fidgeting and twitching he would have never been able to sit long enough for a session and every time I had come home with a new piece something I wanted to show off, he had been the first to see it. If he had lived long enough to see me finish my apprenticeship he had promised to let me draw up something for him, it was one of those million regrets I had mentioned earlier. She was making short work of my pants and I had the sudden need to slow her down so I picked her up like she was a little doll and tossed her onto the center of my bed. She bounced with an oaf and ended up sprawled on her back spread eagle. I toed off my boots and let my pants fall the rest of the way off, since I typically just went commando when I crawled up over her I was naked and she was still fully dressed. Her eyes got big because I put my hands under her shirt and dropped down to plant a bunch of kisses along her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like good whiskey, Shaw. You go to a guy\u2019s head quick and smooth. Last time we blazed through a bunch of the good stuff, why don\u2019t we slow it down a little this time?\u201d I let my fingers brush over the top of her bra and felt her body get tight. She bent her legs up so that I was cradled in between and despite our size difference we fit together just fine. She let her hands roam all across my back and I felt the edge of her nails bite into my skin and the press of her heels into the curve of my ass, it was awesome.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid last time that if we slowed down to think you would stop and I felt like I would die if you stopped.\u201d</p><p>I had my hands under her bra now and she was making little gasping noises that made me harder than I already was. I got her shirt off over her head and sealed her mouth shut with mine. She didn\u2019t hesitate to kiss me back and I decided then and there that kissing Shaw was probably as close to heaven as I was ever going to get. There was just the right amount of give and take, just the right amount of tongue and teeth, just the right amount of breathless pull that made me see stars and want to tear her pants off and forge ahead like a marauder. She wasn\u2019t kidding about liking the jewelry in my mouth. She rubbed her tongue across the barbell and rubbed her bottom lip across the hoop in a way that had my eyes drifting closed and almost made me forget that I was supposed to be showing her that there was lots of good stuff we had flashed past last time.</p><p>\u201cSee I don\u2019t think we spent anytime here.\u201d I ran my thumb over her nipple and watched as it puckered instantly at my touch. \u201cYou are so pretty and pink Shaw and I don\u2019t think you even know the half of it.\u201d I let my tongue run across the base of her throat and down until I had one peak in my mouth. She tasted as sweet as she smelled and the idea that I was the only one that got to do this to her, that she was mine, just mine made it all even better. She muttered my name and arched up as I worked her over pretty good with my mouth on her breasts. She was undulating under me, pulling me closer to her with greedy hands and rubbing against the part of me that fully agreeing with her that I was moving to slow. I let go of the flesh I was torturing with a soft pop and kissed her breast bone. \u201cSee, good stuff.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed, \u201cTotally.\u201d I propped my weight up on an elbow and traced a path from her throat to her belly button. The taunt skin on her belly quivered a little when I traced a pattern around the small indent. I liked the way my tattooed skin looked against her much clearer canvas; I also got a little kick out of the fact that when I flattened my palm against her belly that my name went from one side to the other claiming what I was quickly starting to consider my very own. I let my thumb hook under the top of her pants and rubbed a pattern that made her wiggle enticingly against me.</p><p>\u201cRule,\u201d there was a hitch in her voice. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I kissed her again and took my time about it I wanted her to know that she affected me just as much I seemed to be affecting her. Normally when I was with a girl I was all about instant gratification, there was no build up, no anticipation. I mean I liked to think that I had developed some pretty good moves over the years but I was also a big fan of getting to the finish line in as little time as possible. I wasn\u2019t there to create memories. I was there for a mind numbing orgasm and a minute of peace, but she was different. With her I was different and this thing happen between us was most definitely different.</p><p>I got under her super tight pants and was surprised to find that she hadn\u2019t bothered with anything underneath. I pulled my head up and grinned down at her. \u201cCommando?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and shifted a little when my fingers brushed over all her soft and warm parts. \u201cWhat? These pants are practically painted on and no matter how tiny the panties are they show so no underwear was the only option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never peg you for the type.\u201d She gasped my name out as made my way in to her damp heat. Her whole body bowed up against mine and I caught her across the back to keep her there and taunt under my ministrations. The friction between what I was doing and her tight pants was making her quake in my arms and I knew it was only a matter of time before she came apart in my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re always so proper and put together, who knew underneath was such a naughty girl?\u201d She was slick and fluttery all the things I wanted a girl to be right before she made a sweet noise of surprise and flared her eyes open at me. Her hands clamped down on my neck and she tugged me down for another mind bending kiss right before I felt her melt. I smiled against her mouth and shifted so that I could help her pull her pants off even though she was moving a lot slower than me. Once she was as naked as I was I took a minute to appreciate the view because a naked Shaw was something to appreciate and a naked, luminously satisfied Shaw was something master artists would kill to capture on canvas.</p><p>She leaned over me to dig a condom out of the drawer. I settled on my back and let her crawl over the top of me. I stacked my hands behind my head and just watched as she tore the packet open with her teeth and set about suiting me up. She was gentle about it and I think afraid she might hurt me but it was a good thing she took her time with it because the jewelry down there sometimes made getting protection on tricky. Once everything was set and I was hard enough to pound nails she looked at me a little apprehensively and settled over my lap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I know how to do it this way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And wasn\u2019t that just amazing? I got to teach this beautiful, amazing, kick ass girl all about sex and all about the great shit in between. I moved so that she was where she needed to be and helped her figure out how to slide down and glide back up. I gritted my teeth and let out some swear words because nothing had me prepared for her trying to find her rhythm. As she moved up and down, rocked back and forth and pretty much turned my mind to mush I tried to keep some modicum of control but it was no avail. When I felt her start to come apart I flipped her over on her back and drove into her like I was trying to bury myself inside her to live forever. She didn\u2019t seem to mind the manhandling too much, her nails scraped across the shaved part of my head and her tiny little teeth nipped into my shoulder. It only took another breath before I followed her over the edge than laid in an annihilated heap on top of her. I felt her hands flow over my shoulders and her husky voice ask in my ear, \u201cHave you always been this awesome?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Shaw</p><p>I was having a hard time concentrating in my study group which wasn\u2019t a good thing because we were all expected to carry our own weight. I was pretty good with anatomy so I wasn\u2019t too worried about falling behind but I didn\u2019t want anyone else to fall behind because I couldn\u2019t keep my head in the game. Trying to find time to work in Rule with my already busy schedule was proving to be a daunting and frustrating task. In the last two weeks I had only managed to squeeze in two lunch dates when he had time between clients, a Friday night where he came to the bar with his friends and hung out with me until I got off, and a subsequent Saturday night that of course lead to Sunday morning but I had to work so Sunday was just a brief kiss goodbye and then I was on my way out the door. We talked on the phone and texted back and forth, but it wasn\u2019t enough for me and now that I was sleeping with him on a regular basis it wasn\u2019t enough for the me that wanted nothing more than to roll around in bed with him every chance she got.</p> <p>I was blushing at a particularly hot memory when one of the girls had to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention. I\u2019m sure my face was bright red so I cleared my throat and fanned myself down with the notebook I was using to take notes. \u201cSorry, what did you ask?\u201d</p><p>She repeated the question and I stumbled through an answer telling myself I had to stay focused for the remaining hour of the session. My phone went off a couple times in my pocket but like a good college student I ignored it and gritted my teeth through the rest of the question and answer portion of the meeting. As soon as time was up I gathered my things and bolted out of the room we were using for the meeting. It was rude but I didn\u2019t even bother to say goodbye to my classmates. I wanted to see what was on my phone. Rule liked to send me dirty text messages when I least expected it. They made me get all breathless and silly and I couldn\u2019t wait to see what these might be, only the name on my phone wasn\u2019t his but Gabe\u2019s and that made me want to toss the little device onto the ground. My mom was still insisting on a family get together, luckily her schedule was so busy that I had managed to avoid it and Gabe for the last few weeks, but from the sounds of the messages he had left me that was no longer the case.</p><p>Shaw I spoke to your mother today. She would like me to bring you to Brookside on Saturday night for dinner at the club. She would like you to stay the night there and then we are doing a big gathering at her house on Sunday for brunch. My parents will be there along with several other influential people.</p><p>I groaned out loud and scrolled down to the next message.</p><p>I know you are hesitant to spend time alone with me after my erratic behavior, but assure my intentions are good. All I\u2019m offering is a ride.</p> <p>I most definitely didn\u2019t want to be stuck in a car with Gabe for an hour and I most certainly didn\u2019t want to deal with my mother for an entire weekend plus Saturday night had proven the one night I week I actually got to spend with Rule and I absolutely didn\u2019t want to give that up but I didn\u2019t see where I had a choice. I bit my lip and replied that I would be there but that I would be driving myself. There was no way in hell I was going to Brookside without a way to escape. He texted back that that would be fine and asked if I would mind then giving him a ride. I wanted to say no but figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt anything to just take him and drop him off. We arranged to meet at a bakery that was between our two places on Saturday morning and I was just about to put the phone away when Black Rebel Motorcycle Club trilled from my hand. Rule\u2019s sneering face looked up at me from the display and I couldn\u2019t hold in a smile.</p><p>Ayden warned me every single day that I had to be careful. I was in love with Rule; Rule wasn\u2019t in love with me. We were having sex, really amazing, make the world stop sex but he never, ever mentioned anything about a relationship or how he felt and my roommate was sure I was standing on the cliff of an epic heartbreak just waiting to fall over. For now I was okay taking what he was willing to give, I mean it was more than he had ever given to anybody else, but in the back of my mind I knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough forever and eventually something between us was going to have to change or at the very least be defined into clearer terms that I could live with.</p><p>\u201cHey you, I thought you were working late tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019m also starving and wondering if you\u2019ve eaten yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I just got out of my study group and have to go work on a project for my anatomy class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it something you can do here?\u201d</p> <p>I tucked a piece of hair behind my ear and stepped gingerly across the icy parking lot. \u201cAt the shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we have Wi-Fi and its quiet, just me and my client. You can grab some food and then work here for a couple hours until I\u2019m done. We can go back to my place later if you want.\u201d</p><p>I so totally did want. I bit my lip and got into my car. \u201cAre you sure you can work with me hanging around, I mean I don\u2019t want to distract you or anything.\u201d</p><p>He gave a soft laugh that sent goose bumps running up and down my arms.</p><p>\u201cWhile you are quite a distraction Casper, my client is a fifty five year old retired homicide detective that would gladly ring my neck if I screw his piece up. It\u2019s a memorial tattoo in honor of his son that died in Afghanistan so feed me so that I can do a good job and not get my ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and clamped the phone between my shoulder and ear. I hadn\u2019t ever been in Rule\u2019s shop, that seemed like a line that our previous relationship didn\u2019t cross but I had to admit I was curious to see what the inside of a real tattoo parlor looked like. \u201cWhat do you want me to bring you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not picky, just make sure there is a lot of whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright I\u2019m still at the school so give me a half hour or so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool.\u201d He hung-up without saying goodbye, something that drove me nuts because he always did it but I was learning that he had a lot of weird quirks that I never noticed before. There was a lot I was learning about him, things that surprised me that I had missed over the years, like the fact that he was such a good friend. I had seen him interact with Rome and Remy so I knew he was giving and loving to those he cared about but he was the same way with his boys. Nash and Rule were most definitely a team. When one zigged the other zagged instinctively, they lived in sync, worked in sync and it was clear to see that they just got each other and as high maintenance and complicated as Rule was I had to admit it was fascinating to watch. They made each other laugh and made each other mad, Rule was kind of a slob and Nash was a neat freak. They took care of each other in different ways, Nash tended to be quieter, let things slide like the jerk from across the street taking his parking spot even though it was snowy and cold, didn\u2019t bother him enough to make a fuss but Rule was a born fighter, a hot head that refused to let anything ride. The guy in Nash\u2019s spot came out to find his car painted with an elaborate scene of a big purple dinosaur getting head from what looked to be a perverted Yoda on the hood done in washable paint. Sure he was furious and wanted to call the cops but Nash has talked him out of it by pointing out that he could have had the car impounded which would cost more than a trip to the car wash, showing how the boys just balanced each other out.</p><p>I decided on Chinese because I could grab a decent variety of things and I loved sesame chicken. There was a line and I had to wait for what seemed like an eternity to get it. It was closer to an hour by the time I found the shop and a place to park that wouldn\u2019t take me an hour to walk to the shop. Parking on Capitol Hill was a nightmare and walking on the crowded sidewalk with bags full of takeout and my laptop case proved to be an interesting challenge but I made it and the glass door painted with an interesting m\u00e9lange of old school sailor tattoos swung open before I had to figure out what to juggle in my full hands in order to pull it open. Rule took the food from me, pressed a quick, hard kiss on my startled mouth and ushered me into the tattoo parlor. He flipped the sign on the door to closed and guided me past a long, marble counter that had a series of portfolios laid out across it and a massive high-tech computer system propped up on top.</p><p>Each of the work stations was divided by a waist high wall and a mounted flat screen TV. Everything was bright and shiny clean, there was a myriad of different artwork plastering the walls and there were all kinds of interesting old school tattoo designs for people to choose from spotting the available wall space. It was visually stimulating and there was old Bad Religion playing quietly on the house sound system. It was all very Rule, it was like he had found a place to work and completely and totally embodied who he was as a person and that was just really special to see. He led me to a back room that had a table and couch as well as a mini fridge and a bunch of different stations that had drafting tables and special lights for artists to use. Sitting at the table was a middle aged man that could have easily been one of my father\u2019s golf buddies ,except for the fact that he had his shirt off and the entire center of his chest was covered in not gray hair but a stark black outline of a bald eagle and an American flag.</p><p>Rule dumped the bags on the table and began digging through them. \u201cShaw this is Mark Bradley, Mark this is Shaw I hope you don\u2019t mind if she sticks around for a bit since she was nice enough to bring us dinner.\u201d</p><p>He started dishing stuff out onto plates that he pulled out of nowhere. \u201cSure thing, I didn\u2019t know you went out and got yourself a girl, Rule, a pretty one at that.\u201d</p><p>He winked at me over the guy\u2019s head and handed me a loaded up plate that I probably wouldn\u2019t even put a small dent in. \u201cShe sure is that.\u201d</p><p>We ate in compatible silence for a few minutes but I kept checking out the bold outline on Marks chest. It was huge and seemed like such a massive commitment for someone in their fifties to be making</p><p>\u201cThat piece is pretty impressive.\u201d He looked down at himself and then back up at Rule.</p><p>\u201cThe kid has real talent. I looked all over town to find someone that would do what I wanted justice. Rule got it right away and it didn\u2019t hurt that his brother is enlisted so he understood the importance behind it all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe mentioned it was a memorial piece for your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately. Roadside bomb a few years ago, he was my oldest and nothing seemed an appropriate way to honor how proud I was to be his father.\u201d</p><p>I felt tears well in my eyes. I was so used to parents being thoughtless or lost in their own grief to really express their heartache in a healthy way. I reached out and squeezed the older man\u2019s hand while blinking away the moisture gathered in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think that is beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy kid was a sucker for a good old school tattoo. I gave him crap every time he came home with something new. It would tickle him pink that this was the way I chose to keep his memory alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be finished with it today?\u201d I asked Rule who was eating while standing up watching the interplay between me and his client intently.</p><p>\u201cNo. Something that big takes a few sessions. Today we\u2019ll hammer in the rest of the solid black and the gray, get some of the highlights and all the shading done, his next sitting will only be an hour or so and I\u2019ll get the color in it. It\u2019s going to be classic when it\u2019s all done.\u201d</p><p>We finished eating and I offered to clean up the mess while Rule went out to set up for Mark. I was pulling out my computer and books to set up in the back room when he poked his head into the room and crooked his finger at me. \u201cCome out here and post up in one of the empty stations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on Casper, you make the view better.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him and moved to set up across from him. I settled into the surprisingly comfy chair and propped my computer on my lap. The music switched to The Gaslight Anthem and I hummed along.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d</p><p>I glanced up at Mark who was making an interesting face as Rule bent over him, the constant buzz of the tattoo machine surprisingly lulling and comforting.</p><p>\u201cI want to be a doctor. I would eventually like to work in emergency medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big goal. Why emergency medicine?\u201d</p> <p>I pulled my hair up into a sloppy knot on the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a doctor, my dad is a heart surgeon but I lost a really close friend a few years ago in a horrific car accident and I guess I felt like maybe if he had had better care when he got to ER he would have made it. I want to make a difference when it matters most.\u201d</p><p>Rule looked up and we stared at each other for a long moment before he put his head down and went back to what he was doing. Mark grunted. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty special girl you got there kid You better be doing right by her.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something I didn\u2019t hear and I turned my attention to the project I still had a bunch of work left to do on. I typed away and the machine buzzed for a solid two hours. We didn\u2019t really talk much, me because I was working and subvertly watching Rule, Mark because as time went on it was clear he was hurting and Rule because when he worked he was focused solely on what he was doing and it was extraordinary to watch. He was actually putting a little bit of himself into what he was leaving on Mark and he wouldn\u2019t settle for less than a perfect end product. I think watching him work, watching him diligently change this man\u2019s body forever made me fall just a little bit harder for him.</p><p>Mark had to take a couple breaks and each time he got up Rule made his way over to me. The first time he dropped a kiss in the top of my head, the second he pulled me into a full body make out session that had me readjusting my shirt when Mark came back inside from smoking a cigarette. All in all it was a pretty nice way to spend an evening and I got plenty of work done. Four hours later Rule was wiping smears of black ink off of Mark\u2019s angry red skin and the image he had on his chest was a beautifully etched tattoo that was an honorable tribute to his fallen son. I told him again how beautiful I thought it was and that I would love to see it when it was all done, he gave me a hug like a real dad would and told me to take care of myself. He also paid Rule which made me balk. I had no idea how much getting tattooed cost and then he left him a gigantic tip on top of it.</p><p>Rule told me to pack up and then went about cleaning up his station and shutting the shop down for the night. It took us another hour to finally leave and by then I was yawing and getting sleepy. My car was close enough that I decided to just leave it and not try for a spot closer to their apartment and Rule promised to get up early in the morning and take me to it if I wanted. The walk was fast because it was cold, it helped that he pulled me close the entire way. We said hi to Nash, I thought maybe he wanted to sit for a second and chat but he dropped my stuff on the coffee table, grabbed a couple beers out of the fridge and hauled me into his room.</p><p>We didn\u2019t talk, didn\u2019t seem to need to. By now I was getting the hang of how the whole sex thing, or rather the whole sex with Rule thing worked. He was very tactile, very hands on and I benefited from all of it. After rolling around not once but twice I was quite happily sprawled across his naked chest randomly tracing the scales of the snake on the arm next to my face. He was propped up on a pillow and drinking one of the beers and messing around on his phone while drawing some kind of pattern on my back with his finger. I was sated and almost asleep when his voice rattled through my head.</p><p>\u201cWant to come to another show with me on Saturday? I tattoo one of the guys in Artifice and I got backstage passes.\u201d</p><p>I let my eyes snap open and I went stiff which he was bound to feel since I was using him as a body pillow. I pushed my hair out of my face and looked up at him. His eyes were droopy and sleepy as well but I saw that he really wanted to know what my answer was. I gulped a little and bit down on my lip like I did when I was nervous.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go to my mother\u2019s for the weekend. I\u2019m leaving on Saturday and won\u2019t be back until sometime Sunday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Now he was the one that went stiff underneath me. \u201cYou going alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My voice was barely a whisper. \u201cI told Gabe I would drop him off at his parents on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told the guy that has been stalking you and harassing you that you would give him a ride?\u201d The incredulous tone made me nervous.</p><p>\u201cYes I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was easier than dealing with the guilt trip and endless amounts of disappointment my mom would throw at me if I didn\u2019t. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I understand perfectly. Your mom says jump and you do it right into that nut job\u2019s arms. I can\u2019t believe this Shaw, I barely get to see you as it is, I go freaking insane half the time because I wake up in the middle of the night to reach for you and you aren\u2019t there and you\u2019re off planning a weekend getaway with your psycho exboyfriend. Unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>I rolled off of him and pulled the sheet up around myself feeling exposed and vulnerable, neither having to do with the fact I was naked. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like that and you know it. I don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t want to spend time with Gabe but letting my mother have her way is easier than trying to defy her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know? Have you ever even tried to defy her?\u201d</p><p>I sucked a cold breath in through my teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s my mom Rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. We can talk about it tomorrow.\u201d He rolled onto his side away from me and I knew Rule well enough to know that there would be no talking about it tomorrow. In fact as he dropped me off at my car the next morning there was zero talking, zero kissing, zero eye contact, zero anything from him to indicate that a conversation could fix what I had somehow done.</p><p>I texted him after work on the next day that I was sorry and wanted to see him but got no response. I called him on Tuesday to see if he wanted to get lunch and talk about things and got sent right to voicemail By Wednesday I was practically frantic and ready to show up at the shop or at his apartment and demand that he talk to me only Rome was back in town and commandeered me for dinner Wednesday and let it slip that he was crashing at Rule\u2019s for a few days because his other buddy had family in town for the week. My heart nearly devoured itself when I realized Rule hadn\u2019t even bothered to let me know Rome was in town. I very well could have shown up and made a complete ass out of myself in front of his brother and he didn\u2019t even care. I spent Thursday and Friday sobbing onto Ayden\u2019s mostly unsympathetic shoulder and trying to get through my shifts at work. I was a mess and on Saturday morning when I stopped at the bakery to get Gabe all I wanted to do was run his smug, smiling face over with my BMW.</p><p>He tried to lean in to kiss me on the cheek and I pulled away so violently I smacked my head on the driver\u2019s side window.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I could almost see the icicles hanging on my voice but I didn\u2019t care. I missed Rule, I was mad that I was having to pick between him and another family and I was pissed that he couldn\u2019t see why I had to do what I did. All week long I had been plagued with visions of his room turning back into a revolving door of sexual conquests and it made me hyperventilate. I could see why he was angry at me, but I hated that he was just shutting me out.</p><p>\u201cCome on Shaw can\u2019t you at least try and make this weekend pleasant? Our parents would be thrilled if we could just work things out between us.\u201d</p><p>I turned the radio on and let Georgia rock of the Drive by Truckers fill in the void where my conversation should go. I slapped Gabe\u2019s hand away when he reached for the volume control. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on Shaw we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being so stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe I\u2019m involved with someone else, there is nothing we need to talk about. The only reason I\u2019m going this weekend is to get my mom off my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat tattooed punk? You can\u2019t think you have anything serious with him Shaw, seriously what are you thinking? You\u2019re going to come home after a seventy-two hour shift at a hospital and he\u2019s just going to be sitting around waiting for you like some kind of house husband? You really think that\u2019s an accurate description of how your future looks with someone like that? More like you start your residency and as soon as he sees how much you\u2019re gone and how much time he has to spend alone he starts bringing all those girls that were there before you back around. Get real, guys like that are not in it for the long haul, they\u2019re only there until the shine wears off.\u201d</p><p>I bristled because it was hitting a little too close to home for me right now so I just turned the music up louder and did my best to ignore him for the rest of the ride. I made great time, driving faster than I should have but desperate to get out of the confined space with Gabe. He had tried several times to pull me into conversation but each time I upped the volume on the radio until the Truckers were at an ear splitting level making it ridiculous to try and talk. He finally got the point and zipped his mouth shut. I practically shoved him out the door without stopping when I got to his house in Brookside. He motioned for me to roll the window down so he could talk to me but I just gritted my teeth and pulled away with squealing tires.</p><p>My parents lived in another gated community in Brookside so as I tooled through town I decided to stop at the Starbucks where I had taken Rule last time I was here and pull myself together. Just to torture myself a little more I pulled out my phone and died a little more when it showed no new messages or texts. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I felt like everything I had ever wanted was slipping right through my fingertips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShaw? Shaw Landon is that you?\u201d I looked up from my coffee and stifled a groan as Amy Rodgers barreled down on me. I should have remembered her and this Starbucks went hand in hand.</p><p>\u201cIt sure is, Amy how are you?\u201d</p><p>She air kissed my face and gave me a toothy smile. She had never even pretended to be this nice to me in high school so I was instantly on high alert.</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m good. I just finished beauty school and I\u2019m working in a super trendy, super high end salon in Denver, you\u2019re living there now too, right?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded and I saw her eyes trail over my new and improved hair. \u201cWell I\u2019m excited I ran into you, I was thinking about looking you up.\u201d</p><p>I lifted a brow. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She flicked her hair over her shoulder. \u201cWell I was home a few weekends ago doing laundry and I ran into one of the Archer twins, the one with all the tattoos, anyway I remembered that you were close with them and I was wondering if I could get his number from you. I can\u2019t remember which one is which but lordy was he gorgeous. I heard they moved to Denver too and I was hoping I might be able to start something up with him.\u201d</p><p>I felt everything inside me turn to ice. I almost threw my coffee in her pretty, perfect face but just barely, by the skin of my teeth managed to refrain myself. \u201cRemy died, Amy it\u2019s just Rule, has only been Rule for almost three years now and I\u2018m sure he would just looooove to hear from some idiot girl that didn\u2019t even know who he was, just one of the Archer twins. You make me want to vomit and you\u2019re lucky we\u2019re in a public place or there\u2019s a really good chance I would be punching you repeatedly in the face right now.\u201d She gaped at me in astonishment as I pushed past her and tossed my coffee in the trash, all taste for it gone. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you his number because he\u2019s mine and if you get anywhere near him I swear to God the things I do to you will be chronicled on Investigation Discovery for years to come.\u201d</p><p>I was shaking by the time I got back in the car and it only took a second for the tears to come. I missed Remy, I missed Rule and I missed Margot and Dale. Rule was right, I didn\u2019t know what it felt like to defy my mother because I never had and now she was just one more person trying to get between me and the person I wanted to be with. I had no trouble laying claim to him with a bimbo like Amy, but my mother, well that was far bigger fish to fry. I had always known he was worth it, that\u2019s what I was waiting so desperately for his parents to see, but when the time had come to prove it I had done what everyone else did to him and let my mother pressure me into doing something that moved me away from him. I pressed my forehead against the steering wheel and picked my phone back up. I stared at it for a solid five minutes with the car running trying to think of what to say to him and all I came up with was:</p> <p>I really am sorry, I never meant to hurt you. I should\u2019ve stayed. I really miss you.</p><p>I put it away before I made myself crazy seeing if he was going to write anything back and made my way to my parent\u2019s house. The house was more like some kind of elegant mountain chalet than an actual home. Everything past the gates was elegant and expensive and as I parked and made my way to the front door I remembered how small I felt next to the grandeur. When Remy had come into my life and taken me under his wing, I had taken the opportunity to spend every second I could at the Archer\u2019s, for all their faults they made a home where it was clear people were loved and cared for, both my mother and my father\u2019s homes had none of that. They were filled with servants and show pieces and as I was led into the living room I was struck again by how very much I didn\u2019t want to be here and how if I couldn\u2019t fix things with Rule after this weekend there was a good chance I was going to have to be committed because I just might lose my mind.</p><p>My mother in all her refined glory came at me with a critical eye. There was no hug, no how was your drive, no sorry I missed your birthday sweetie just a quick sweep of her ice cold gaze from the top of my head to the toes of my laced up leather boots. Her already tight mouth pulled into a frown. \u201cWhat have you done to your hair Shaw? It looks dreadful and I hope you brought more appropriate clothes for the country club, we\u2019re going to dinner not a potluck.\u201d</p><p>I was wearing leggings and a long oxford with a wide leather belt that matched my boots. It was way too fancy for a simple car ride home but I had been trying to avoid this exact scene. Once again I had failed to meet her exacting standards. My hands curled tighter around the bag I had refused to give to the maid that opened the door. My heart was in my throat, well actually it was back in Denver currently ignoring me but that wasn\u2019t here nor there.</p><p>\u201cI assume you and Gabe had time to talk on the way up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019ve told you I don\u2019t have anything left to say to him.\u201d</p> <p>If it was possible her mouth pulled into an even tighter frown, she looked like she was sucking on a lemon. My mother was a beautiful woman, I got my fair hair and light coloring from her, but as I looked at her objectively for possibly the first time in my life I realized that all that beauty was harsh and encased in so much ice and bitterness that it was hard to see.</p><p>\u201cI asked you to stop being ridiculous young lady. You will be polite and charming this weekend. I will not tolerate any hostility or rudeness directed at Gabe or any of the Davenports, do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>From somewhere deep inside of me the Shaw that I was when I was with Rule, the Shaw that should have refused to come on this farce of a weekend raised her head. I flicked the ends of my two-toned hair over my shoulder and brushed past my mother to head to the stairs where my room was located. \u201cYou ordered me to be here mother, so now you have to deal with that whether you like the outcome or not.\u201d She called something after me in a shrill voice but I tuned her out calling over my shoulder, \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re ready to leave for dinner.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door to the room that had never really felt like mine and let my bag drop on the floor. My mother\u2019s interior designer had done the room in a pallet of grays and soft pinks. It was all very lovely, feminine and girly to the max with a million frilly pillows on the bed and even an honest to god lacy canopy draped over the white four poster bed. It was the room a person that wanted to sleep in luxury and be surrounded by million thread count sheets would enjoy, for me it had always felt lifeless and dull. There were no personal pictures, no splashes of color, no TV or radio simply nothing to describe a thing about the person that was supposed to live there. I settled cross legged on the center of the big bed and sent Ayden a text. She had been acting a little weird since the night she had Jet take her home from the bar, but she didn\u2019t want to talk about it and since I was having my own boy drama I didn\u2019t want to fight to drag it out of her.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t even in the door two steps before she mentioned my hair and my outfit. So good to be home L</p><p>That sucks honey.</p><p>Yeah and Rule still won\u2019t text me back.</p><p>Ummm....</p> <p>What?</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I should tell you.</p><p>Tell me what?</p><p>You have to promise not to freak out.</p><p>Well now I\u2019m bound to freak out!</p><p>Loren was talking about being out last night; she said she saw Rule and the boys at whatever club she was at.</p><p>Oh my God....</p><p>Yeah well she mentioned she was going to try and talk to him or whatever because she\u2019s a clueless slut, but he had some redhead hanging all over him, she said she couldn\u2019t even get close to him.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Yeah well she also said he left with her, the redhead, I mean she said the whole gang of them left together and she is a heinous gossip and likes to cause trouble but I figure you should have a heads up since you can\u2019t get ahold of him.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>You okay?</p><p>No, not at all.</p><p>Want me to hurt him for you?</p><p>Maybe, I\u2019ll call you later after I get through this stupid dinner. Love ya girl.</p><p>You too xoxo</p><p>I swiped a finger across the screen and took a second to hold my breath before letting it out in a furious screech and chucking the expensive device against the wall. I buried my head in my hands and tried to keep from throwing up. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. I had had everything I ever wanted for just a few seconds and all it took was one single bump, one tiny disagreement to screw it all up. It shouldn\u2019t hurt that I was so easily and quickly replaced I knew Rule, knew how he operated but I still felt like someone was poking holes in the very fiber of my soul with a scalding hot poker. Being in love with Rule had never been an easy thing to do, and now that I knew what it was like to actually love him I wasn\u2019t sure how to go back to before.</p><p>I spent the rest of the afternoon sequestered in my room. My mother sent one of the staff up to see if I wanted lunch but I refused to answer the door when they knocked. She sent her husband up around five to tell me that we were leaving in an hour for the club and while a big part of me wanted nothing more than to wear skinny jeans and my motorcycle boots I decided that having that fight with my mother in front of my half siblings would just make me seem childish and ridiculous so I put on a long sleeved white and purple A-line dress that hit me a few inches above my knee and spent a few minute flat-ironing my hair so that it fell in a slick curtain around my shoulders. I had a pair of purple booties that had a spiked heel and little studs on the back that completed the look It wasn\u2019t exactly picture perfect country club gear but it should get me through the front door without too much trouble.</p><p>My mother gave me the evil eye as I came down the stairs and Jack helped me into my gray pea coat. No one said anything as we piled into the family Escalade and headed to the country club. The kid\u2019s jibber jabbed back and forth and I brooded about Rule and some unknown redhead hoping it didn\u2019t mean what I thought I did and willing the car to get a flat tire so I could avoid Gabe and his family. It didn\u2019t happen and when we got to the club and I had to force a smile and let Gabe kiss my cheek and pull out my chair and it literally took every single ounce of willpower I had not to run screaming in the other direction. I settled in between Gabe and my mother and prepared to suffer through the most awkward, awful dinner of my life.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Rule</p><p>\u201cSo you want to come clean and tell me why you\u2019re acting like even more of an asshole this week than normal?\u201d Rome was standing over me while I bench pressed the weight up off my chest. He had asked me to go to the gym on Saturday because he was supposed to start rehabbing his shoulder. Even banged up I forgot how cut my brother was. Working out with him put me to shame and I spent most of the workout trying not to flinch when I noticed how much more weight he was using than I normally did. Once the bar was locked in place I sat up and ran a towel over my sweaty face and newly shaved head. I hadn\u2019t cut it all the way to the scalp like Nash wore his, but the mohawk was gone and all I was left with was dark stubble all across my head. With my eyebrow rings and the tattoos that peaked up my neck I thought it made me look a little like an escaped prisoner.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I followed Rome as he moved over to the set of free weights and started hefting one back and forth with his bad arm. It still bothered him because he winced each time he retracted and extended but he didn\u2019t complain and just kept up the reps. I should tell him I was all bent out of shape over Shaw; he would probably have really good advice to give me because I was pretty sure I was on a path bound to screw up something that was turning out to be amazingly good. When he left Wednesday to take her to dinner it had been everything I could do not to tackle him and demand to know if she had asked about me, if she was doing okay but then I remembered I was purposely not answering her text messages or returning her calls and figured I would just leave it be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes met mine in the mirror as his face twisted into a tight grimace of pain. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with why Shaw looked like a freaking ghost on Wednesday when I saw her, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think one thing had to do with the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not stupid. She\u2019s had a thing for you for a while and I figured it was only a matter of time before you got your head far enough out of your ass to see it. Plus both of you have been staring at your phones for the last week like they hold all the answers to the universe and looking like kicked puppies when they don\u2019t have on them whatever it was you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>I swore and worried my lip ring with my tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re really gonna be cool if I tell you Shaw and I have been hooking up? Or are you going to hurt me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s more than hooking up I will be cool as hell. Shaw isn\u2019t one of your one night stands and if you\u2019re treating her like she is I\u2019ll break both your legs.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at him and flipped him off in the mirror. \u201cWhat do you mean she\u2019s been into me for a while? She got hammered one night and things got heated and I couldn\u2019t stop it from happening so I figured why not roll with it. I like her. I mean I like spending time with her. She\u2019s fun but she\u2019s always so busy and this weekend she went back to Brookside with her weirdo ex because her mom told her too. I just don\u2019t know that I can hang out with someone like that. She\u2019s twenty years old, she should be living her own life, not bowing down to her parent\u2019s every whim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let me guess, instead of having a rational, reasonable conversation with her about it where you laid out your concerns you probably just shut her out and refused to talk to her while you seethed and festered in your own anger.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged a shoulder.</p><p>\u201cRule, Shaw has known you for a long time. Can you imagine what she\u2019s thinking you\u2019re out doing while you\u2019re ignoring her? Come on brother use your head for one bloody second. Is it worth it to ruin it all before you even get it started? That girl sees you, I mean really sees you and I think she has since the very beginning when everyone was always looking around you to see Remy. You need to stop being stubborn and make things right with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe went with her ex, Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah and you went out last night and let some skank shove her tongue down your throat. Not everyone operates off the same script Rule. Most people want to make their parents happy, want to have them approve with what they are doing with their lives, not everyone can burn every bridge the way you do. Most people want a way back home.\u201d</p><p>I cringed a little because he words hit right at the center of me. Had I been just a little drunker, just a little stupider I probably would have made a mistake last night that there was no going back from. Luckily the redhead had tasted like sticky sweet lip gloss and smelled like cheap floral perfume and had none of the softness or perfectness of how it felt being lip locked with Shaw so I had sent her on her way and felt like shit for the rest of the night. I knew I was going to have to talk to Shaw. I couldn\u2019t keep going on like this or I was going to purposely end up sabotaging everything that was building between us.</p><p>\u201cIt freaks me out Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why. Once someone is in it kills when they leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on Rule, the people that care enough to get in normally don\u2019t want to leave. Just look around you, I\u2019m still here, Nash hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, Jet and Rowdy would kill for you and if you took a minute to think about it Shaw has been there just as long. You might have thought she was there for Remy because he always watched out for you and protected her, but I think you\u2019re smart enough to realize now that maybe she was trying to take care of you for another reason all together.\u201d</p><p>He let the weights clatter to the rack with a thud and turned to look at me out of cool eyes.</p><p>\u201cGrow up Rule, stop acting like a spoiled brat that can\u2019t live outside his brother\u2019s shadow. You have an amazing, successful career, a solid group of friends, a family that might be broken but loves you none the less and you have a pretty spectacular girl just waiting for you to realize she\u2019s yours for the taking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan when you go big brother you go all out.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes at me as we made our way to the locker room. I shrugged back into my street clothes and shot a quick glance at my phone. My heart constricted in my chest when I saw the message she had sent. I could practically hear how sad she was in the words. I really was an asshole; I could have talked to her instead of sending her off with that jackass without a word. I was trying to think of something to write her back when Rome thunked me on the back of the head with his palm.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be to work at noon anyways. Hey Rome,\u201d I waited until he turned and looked me in the eye. \u201cWhat about mom and dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe and Shaw. If I get it figured out, if I manage not to screw it up royally what am I supposed to do about them? They would never understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? You deserve to be happy and so does Shaw. Remy is gone and that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat and ran my hand across the back of my neck. \u201cYeah well Shaw was never with Remy that way.\u201d</p><p>His eyes got big and his mouth sort of dropped open. \u201cDo I want to know how you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but let\u2019s just say I know for a fact she and Remy didn\u2019t have a relationship like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell regardless it isn\u2019t any of mom and dad\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>I sighed again. \u201cYeah I guess.\u201d</p><p>We parted ways and I made my way to the shop. I had a busy day with clients back to back and I was still committed to going to the show with the guys that night, plus Brent the lead singer of the band was a good client and I got a lot of good press out of having my work on him since Artifice had blown up over the last few years. I went home and changed and got ready to roll out with the boys but my mind was still on Shaw and the text she sent me this morning. She had hurt me and while I was too hardheaded to admit it that was the reason I had pulled away. I didn\u2019t want her around the ex because logically he was a better match for her and I didn\u2019t want to come up short. By shoving her away and not giving her a chance to talk about it, or a chance for us to work it through I was cutting off any chance at rejection or being found lacking before it could start. I was an idiot, of all the people in my life Shaw had never been one to make me feel like I was less than anything. Yeah she could be judgmental and chilly when she was feeling pressured and cornered, but she never made me feel like I wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>The show was awesome; we got treated like rock stars because we were backstage and knew the band. The girls that were around were tempting and alluring but when it came time for the after party I dipped out early and went home by myself. I took a shower and crawled into bed still staring at my phone. Not able to contain it anymore I finally sent her a text back.</p><p>I kissed some chick last night.</p><p>I held my breath because I didn\u2019t know what she was going to write back. I was fully prepared for her to tell me it was over, that I had gone too far but nothing came. I stared at the screen for a good twenty minutes, my heart racing and still nothing came through.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t do it to hurt you I\u2019m just an idiot and this is harder than I thought.</p><p>There still wasn\u2019t a response and I felt that weird slither in my chest that was tied to Shaw start to shatter. All I knew was I had to fix this, that I wasn\u2019t ready to let her go just yet. Rome was right I needed to grow up. I hadn\u2019t even given this a fair shot, as usual my hot head was writing checks the rest of me wasn\u2019t prepared to cash. I tossed and turned all night, she never called or texted me back and I began to panic. I heard Nash stumble in at some point after four and I hoped Rome slept through it. I got up the next morning and started moving around the apartment at a frantic pace. I brushed my teeth and shoved a bagel in my mouth. I tore through my closet to find the one shirt I owned that had buttons on it and found the single pair of black Dickie pants I had that weren\u2019t jeans. I put a black hoodie on and a pin-striped blazer over it and bounded out the door all while my brother and roommate looked at me like I had lost my mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going? To church?\u201d Nash looked a little worse for wear and Rome was just watching me knowingly.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to Shaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t answering her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think her mom\u2019s just gonna let you roll up to the house and let you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care; I need to talk to her so I\u2019m going to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Rome winked at me and saluted me with his coffee cup. \u201cAtta boy. Call me if they have you arrested I will totally come get you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>I had to stop and put gas in the truck and for whatever reason there was a ton of traffic going out of town. I was impatient and ready to have a fit of serious road rage by the time I finally got to Brookside. I tried to call her one more time and was sent right to voicemail, I almost crushed the phone in my hand when her recorded greeting cheerily told me to just leave a message. I knew where her mom lived because I had been forced to pick her up more than once and bring her to our house when I still shared a car with Remy. I followed the car in front of me through the gates and found the house with no problem. There was a menagerie of all kinds of expensive and fancy cars that seriously had no place being in Colorado parked out front the chalet style mansion. I jogged up the front steps and rang the doorbell. I was expecting a maid or maybe some fancy ass butler to open the door, what I wasn\u2019t expecting was an older, harder version of Shaw. There was no doubt this woman was Shaw\u2019s mother, they had the same white blond hair, the same piercing green eyes, but where Shaw was delicate and lovely, this woman looked like she had been carved out of a solid block of ice. I saw her eyes narrow and sharpen when she saw me but I was on a mission and I didn\u2019t care who this chick was she wasn\u2019t going to stand in my way, even if I had to run her over.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to Shaw.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth pulled tight and she put her small body solidly in the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019re Margot and Dale\u2019s boy aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them.\u201d We weren\u2019t friends, were never going to be and she was making that clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s personal. I just need to speak with her for a minute then I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re interrupting a private gathering; Shaw is here with her boyfriend I don\u2019t think she wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>I fought back an eye roll. The lady was manipulative and delivered it like it was fact, but I wasn\u2019t stupid so I just stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cDavenport is a stalker not her boyfriend. Just get her for me would ya?\u201d I could see that my lack of respect was starting to get under her too tight skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you presume to know what\u2019s going on in my daughter\u2019s private life? You\u2019ve always just been a crush, we all know you two aren\u2019t right for each other and it\u2019s time to stop playing childish games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook lady what\u2019s going on between me and Shaw has nothing to do with you and I assure you it isn\u2019t a game. I don\u2019t mind making a scene if it gets me what I want but something tells me that you wouldn\u2019t all your guests to wonder what the commotion was about.\u201d I lifted my pierced brow. \u201cAm I right?\u201d I think she was about to tell me she was going to call the police or holler for her husband but she didn\u2019t get the chance because the heavy door was yanked out of her death grip and suddenly Shaw\u2019s pale face appeared around the doorjamb. \u201cRule? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Her hair was braided up in some fancy design that looked like it hurt. She had on a pearl necklace that looked like it was from the 1800\u2019s and a pink sweater that looked fuzzy and soft. She was also in a pair of loose cream colored pants and had on a pair of pink heels that looked like they cost as much as my truck. She was so far removed from the Shaw that I was used to rolling around naked with I almost turned around and left without saying another word, but her green eyes were wide and sad and that slippery feeling in the center of my chest started to throb. I didn\u2019t care that her mother was watching me with an eagle eye I grabbed her arm and pulled her onto the stoop with me. I held her face in my hands and peered straight into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She put her hands over mine and blinked up at me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent you a text last night, I tried to call you back all night and you didn\u2019t answer me. I\u2019m sorry. Sorry I pushed you away, sorry I acted like an idiot, sorry I don\u2019t know how to do this thing between us right, I\u2019m just sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy phone is broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked it on a laugh. I wanted to kiss her, wanted to scoop her up in my arms and take her somewhere so far away from here.</p><p>\u201cI threw it against the wall because Ayden told me you went home with some girl Friday night; I shattered the screen on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit, I\u2019ll buy you a new one.\u201d She closed her eyes and squeezed my hands.</p><p>\u201cDid you do it, go home with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I kissed her which sucks on my part and makes me an asshole, but I knew it was wrong so I stopped it and I swear if we get this straight between us I will never let it happen again. I\u2019m trying to figure out how all this works Shaw, I hate that you\u2019re the one that has to get hurt because of my learning curve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shut me out, you left me alone in the dark Rule. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had anything hurt that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Casper; I know, but don\u2019t give up on me now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drove all the way here just to apologize?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cWe have to fix this.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a lopsided grin. \u201cWe need to learn how not to break it in the first place.\u201d I gulped down the sudden surge of emotion in my throat and pulled her into a tight hug. It felt like coming home, a feeling I don\u2019t think I had ever actually experienced before. I kissed her softly behind her ear and whispered, \u201cBy the way your mom hates me, like HATES me.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands in the back pockets of my pants and stood on her tip toes to kiss the underside of my jaw. \u201cThat\u2019s okay she hates me too. Why did you cut your hair all off? It looks good, you look good but I liked the mohawk.\u201d</p><p>I self-consciously ran a hand over my naked skull. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just needed to change it.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me with serious eyes and folded her hand in mine. \u201cIt makes you look more like Remy than all your other hairstyles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw tell your friend goodbye and come back inside, we have guests and you\u2019re being very rude.\u201d</p><p>She peeked over my shoulder at her mother and I felt her grip on my hand tighten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not coming in without Rule.\u201d Oh shit she was doing it again, putting herself between me and another disapproving parent.</p> <p>\u201cHey it\u2019s cool as long as we\u2019re good I\u2019ll just catch up with you when you get back to D-town. I can wait to see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw,\u201d her mother\u2019s voice was all whiplash warning. \u201cthis ends now. Send him on his way and come inside, you\u2019ve made enough of a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m with him, if you want me to sit through another meal where you\u2019re going to blatantly ignore Gabe trying to grope me and purposely make me uncomfortable then I\u2019m doing it with Rule there to keep him in check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw he does not belong in there with this group of people.\u201d</p><p>There it was, the judgment, the censure the idea that because I lived on my own terms and in my own way I wasn\u2019t good enough for this girl. I pulled her to my side and met her mother\u2019s glare with one of my own. Remy might have protected her by giving her a safe haven but I was a fighter by nature and this lady had pushed enough of my buttons to last for years.</p><p>\u201cRight but I\u2019m the one she spent her birthday with, I\u2019m the one that makes her happy and I\u2019m the one that is ready to protect her from the creep you keep shoving at her. I\u2019m more than willing to take her with me and get out of your hair but I doubt you want to try and explain her hasty exit to the Davenports so why don\u2019t you just suck it up for once in your life and let your kid have something, just one thing that makes her happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw?\u201d There was confusion in the woman\u2019s tone now.</p><p>\u201cI go where he goes, so if you don\u2019t want him to come in then I\u2019m outta here, I never should have come in the first place.. I\u2019m tired of being manipulated and used as a pawn and accessory. I told you about Gabe and you refused to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re perfect together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, only I want to be with him.\u201d She hooked her thumb in my direction.</p><p>\u201cHe openly admitted to cheating on you only a day ago, what kind of relationship do you honestly think you can have with him? Do you think your father will continue to pay for school when he hears about this?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged against me and I put a hand on her hip to pull her back against me. \u201cI\u2019m sick to death of worrying about it, it gives me migraines and my relationship is mine to work out. He\u2019s not perfect and neither am I, if I choose to forgive him you don\u2019t get a say in it or not.\u201d</p><p>I felt like a heel. I shouldn\u2019t have assumed the redhead was just going to be forgotten, but she was still letting me hold her so I wasn\u2019t too worried about it.</p><p>\u201cFine. Come in, eat brunch and try not to embarrass yourselves while you\u2019re at it. Shaw I want you gone as soon as brunch is done and don\u2019t think for one single second that this is over. Just wait until I speak with your father about this circus.\u201d</p><p>She spun around and disappeared inside the massive house. I looked down at Shaw and ran a finger across her furrowed brow. \u201cWe okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly. Let\u2019s just get through this then worry about the rest later. \u201cShe started to pull away from me but I caught her around the waist and pulled her back to me.</p><p>\u201cShaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I kissed her. I kissed her so that she could feel my regret, my desire to do right, the way that she had a piece of me now and I wasn\u2019t letting go. I kissed her because I had to and kissing her made me feel better. When I lifted my head her mouth looked puffy and damp and her eyes were glassy with banked passion.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d</p><p>She giggled a little and hooked her elbow around my arm. \u201cThese are a bunch of country club people and mom\u2019s political associates. You clean up nice but don\u2019t expect them to welcome you with open arms. I don\u2019t think any of them have ever even seen a tattoo up close and personal so be prepared to be treated like half pariah and half zoo exhibit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I can\u2019t promise to play nice if that douchebag tries to put his hands on you in front of me though.\u201d</p><p>She shivered against my side. \u201cHe was awful last night. I kept trying to move farther and farther away and he just followed. My mother is insane if she thinks I\u2019m spending one more minute with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to drive him back to school today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning on faking a headache and just letting him drive while I lay down in the back seat.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like that idea at all; she didn\u2019t need to be vulnerable and subjected to that nonsense.</p><p>\u201cJust give him the keys to the BMW and you can ride back with me. Have him text you when he\u2019s home and Nash and I can go get your car later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, look I know I messed up but I\u2019m here for real now. We\u2019re going to do this and I promise I\u2019ll take care of you as best as I can. You\u2019re going to have to be patient with me because I\u2019m flying blind but this is the kind of thing I should be doing for you, plus I don\u2019t want you anywhere near that guy. He has something going on under all that polo and khaki and I don\u2019t trust him one bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright I\u2019ll set it up and if he refuses I\u2019ll just tell him he has to find his own way home then.\u201d</p><p>She led me into a dining room that was packed with every real house wife of Brookside and every single person in the top earning percentile of the state. There was a lot of money and power in this dining room and Shaw was right, they were all looking at me like I was a wild animal let out of a cage. She tightened her grip on my arm and led me over to a table with all kinds of food spread out on it. Everyone gave us a wide berth for about three minutes but as soon as Shaw tried to lead us to the table we were waylaid by polo shirt and the rest of the junior league. He looked me up and down then skimmed over Shaw in a way that made want to hang him from a tree by his own intestines.</p><p>\u201cThis is a private function, I doubt you were invited.\u201d</p><p>I lifted an eyebrow and settled a hand on Shaw\u2019s lower back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with me.\u201d Her tone was cold and left no room for argument.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone, polo-shirt. This isn\u2019t the time or the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here. You\u2019re a thug and a loser, Shaw is going to get tired of living on the wild side and see reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she shoved her keys at him and dragged me behind her into the room where everyone was seated at a massive table. All eyes were on us as she stormed to the table calling over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not spending one second more with you; you can take the Beamer home by yourself or find your own ride. I heard him sputter but I was too busy pulling out Shaw\u2019s seat and settling in next to her to enjoy it. I could feel most of the eyes in the room on us and her mother\u2019s smug look from the head of the table, I was about to tell Shaw this was silly and just making everyone uncomfortable when I heard a surprised voice say my name.</p><p>\u201cRule? Rule Archer is that you? What are you doing all the way out here for brunch?\u201d The seat next to mine was pulled out and Alexander Carsten a long time client of mine settled into the seat next to me. I gave him a grin and shook the hand he offered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up Alex, long time no see. How\u2019s the leg piece? Did it heal up alright?\u201d</p><p>He laughed a big hearty laugh. Alex was a lawyer or something, he was in his early forties and pretty successful. I knew he drove a sweet Jag and had an awesome loft somewhere down in LoDo but he was cool as hell for a buttoned up kind of guy. I had done a couple big pieces on his leg and on his back and under his pressed shirt and silk tie I knew he had two full sleeves, one Nash had done for him and one Rowdy had done. He paid big bucks and was an awesome tipper. Considering this was the last place on earth I would have planned on running into a client I was stunned into momentary silence. I felt Shaw drop her hand onto my thigh and I covered it with my own.</p><p>\u201cIt healed perfect. I was actually thinking about swinging by in a few weeks and getting you to draw up something for my chest. So what are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually from Brookside but I\u2019m here particularly because my girl is stubborn and trying to prove a point.\u201d I inclined my head at Shaw and she narrowed her eyes at me. Alex looked around me at Shaw and snorted out a laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating Eleanor Landon\u2019s daughter? I bet that went over like coal on Christmas.\u201d I guess she hadn\u2019t changed her name when she left Shaw\u2019s dad or maybe it was just a better name for her political propaganda.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah she\u2019s not a fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell don\u2019t worry about it she isn\u2019t a fan of much from what I hear. Well it was good to see a familiar face at one of these shindigs. I hope she keeps you around, these people can use the culture shock. This stuff is normally so boring.\u201d</p><p>We bumped fists and I turned back to Shaw to ask her how much longer we had to stay but now everyone in the entire room was staring at me like I had grown an extra face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed and pressed her head against my shoulder. \u201cDo you have any idea who that was?\u201d</p><p>I poked a piece of orange in my mouth and pressed her hand harder into my thigh. \u201cAlex. I tattoo him, actually we all do he\u2019s a shop regular.\u201d</p><p>She was laughing so hard there were tears running down her face. \u201cThat\u2019s Alex Carsten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule, Alex is the State Attorney General. He\u2019s the most influential legal person in all of Colorado. My mother helped get him elected.\u201d</p><p>I ate another slice of orange and noticed Shaw\u2019s mom was looking at me totally different now. \u201cWeird. He\u2019s tatted up like crazy, under that suit and tie is some serious artwork.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just too funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey how much longer do we have to stick around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s finish eating and then I need to pack my stuff up in my room. You can come up and help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the queen of the castle is going to let me in the ivory tower?\u201d</p><p>She leaned in closer to me and moved her hand up even higher on my thigh, it made me almost choke on the orange I was chewing on.</p><p>\u201cShe might not want you in there,\u201d her green eyes twinkled up at me with merriment, \u201cbut I sure do.\u201d</p><p>This stupid brunch couldn\u2019t end fast enough. I popped another piece of orange in my mouth and tried counting backward from a hundred to get my libido in check. I thought brunch with my folks was rough, I was starting to see why Shaw was so interested in pulling my fractured family back together, even as messed up as we Archer\u2019s were, these rich people had us beat in crazy and nasty by spades.</p><p>Chapter 10</p> <p>Shaw</p><p>I was doing my best to get away from my mother\u2019s house but even though the plan had been to escape as soon as we were done eating Alex had shown back up at the table and hijacked Rule. He claimed one of his coworkers was interested in some custom artwork for his man cave and he thought Rule might be the perfect person to produce it for him, so there I was again the odd man out at one of my mother\u2019s awful events while my tattooed, pierced boyfriend was making the rounds like some kind of celebrity. It was kind of funny and I was secretly thrilled it had to be getting under my mother\u2019s skin, but I wanted to go. I wanted to get him alone and make up for lost time. It felt like things had shifted dramatically between us and I needed time to put it in perspective, need time to figure out what it meant to him exactly because to me he had defined the relationship by showing up here to apologize and I needed to know he felt the same.</p><p>My mother was working the room and Jack was tied up with the kids, Gabe was hanging out with the other future business leaders of America shooting killer looks at Rule, and my guy was in the middle of elegantly dressed men describing something with his hands that had them all nodding eagerly and chattering away at him. I saw my opportunity to escape for a minute so I slid through the kitchen and made my way up to my room. I shoved all my stuff into the bag I brought and tossed my broken phone on top. I think I would hold Rule to buying me a new one since he was the reason I had tossed it against the wall in the first place. I was looking around the bed for anything I might have forgotten when warm hands slid around my waist.</p><p>I knew Rule\u2019s touch and this wasn\u2019t it so I jerked upright and shoved hard against Gabe\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d He grabbed my arm, hard, and tried to pull me towards him. \u201cGet out of my room Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I figured it all out Shaw.\u201d He kept pulling on my arm hard enough that I knew there was going to be a bruise. I was trying to push him away from me but he was exerting a lot more force and he was stronger than me. \u201cYou dumped me so you could have sex with Archer, well by now you should have screwed him out of your system. You never gave me a shot to show you what I can do. I think you need a fair comparison before you totally shut me out.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyes spring wide as I renewed my efforts to get free. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me! I didn\u2019t sleep with you because I\u2019m not attracted to you. I didn\u2019t want to have sex with you then and I don\u2019t want to have sex with you now. You need to go or Rule is going to murder you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled my wrist tight behind my back so hard I yelped. He lowered his face until it was right in mine and grabbed my jaw with his other hand. I was starting to actually panic, my room was upstairs and on the other side of the big house, sure someone would hear me scream if I yelled but I wasn\u2019t sure how the fall out of that kind of scene would be. I struggled to be released and he just laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of the street thug nor am I impressed by his artistic genius or whatever Carsten was going on about. He\u2019s trash and not going to get in the way of what I want, and Shaw you belong to me you should know that now.\u201d He gave me a hard shove back so that I fell onto the bed I immediately scrambled across the other side so that the entire mass was between us. \u201cYou better get on board with this, Shaw before it gets ugly.\u201d</p><p>I was breathing hard and had a hand to my throat. It was shaking and so was I. He threw my keys on the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll get my own ride back to Denver, wouldn\u2019t want you to spend any more time alone with tattoo boy than necessary would I?\u201d</p><p>He strolled out of the room like he hadn\u2019t just assaulted or threatened me. I shook myself out of the shock and gathered my stuff and bolted down the stairs. I found Rule wandering around the kitchen looking lost and clearly searching for me. I handed him my bags and hustled him out of the house without bothering to say goodbye to anyone even my mom and it wasn\u2019t until we were on the highway headed home that I broke down. Out of the blue broken sobs wracked my whole body and I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I was shaking so hard and making such a hysterical mess that Rule freaked out and pulled over to the side of the road. He kept asking me if it was my head but I couldn\u2019t answer so I just crawled into his lap and cried and cried.</p><p>It took a solid twenty minutes for the deluge to stop and by then Rule was frantic and threatening to take me to the nearest emergency room.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine just give me a minute.\u201d He was rubbing my back and his blue eyes were crystal like frost. I pressed my forehead against his and pushed up the sleeves of my coat. Angry red welts and ugly purple bruises were encircling my entire wrist. \u201cGabe ambushed me in my room when I was grabbing my stuff. He shoved me around and threatened me, he said I needed to get on board with this, whatever that means before it gets ugly. He really hurt me Rule and he scared me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him but it\u2019s getting really bad.\u201d</p><p>He went still as a statue underneath me and he lifted one of his hands to grab my injured wrist. He turned his head to press a soft kiss against my pulse and breathed out in a tone that sent chills up my spine, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I let him sooth me for a minute before climbing off him and settling back in the passenger seat. \u201cI have to go back to Brookside and get my car tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll take Rome and we\u2019ll go get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until one but I think I want to call Mark and ask him about getting you a restraining order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you let us leave without confronting him. You should have raked his ass over the fire in front of his parents and all those people he was trying so hard to impress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was freaking out, I just wanted to escape. I just wanted you.\u201d My voice trailed off in a whisper and he reached over to haul me up next to his side. Having bench seats in a big truck was nice.</p><p>\u201cYou have me Shaw, any way you need me, any way you want me, you have me.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my face into the curve of his neck and exhaled. I think that was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to me. \u201cHow about you being the bell of the ball today? I bet that made my mother furious. She looked like she was going to have a coronary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of clients that are out there in the business world, more and more of the general population is sporting some serious ink. She shouldn\u2019t be so judgmental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo she shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want you to get into trouble over Gabe. I just want him to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a one armed hug. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Casper. I promise not to do anything overtly stupid. I just want him to leave you alone as well and I will make sure that happens. In the meantime I don\u2019t think you should leave work alone so have Lou walk you out and if we can figure something out with our crazy schedules I want you to stay with me or I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, I don\u2019t want you to rearrange your whole life around because some guy is being an asshole to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I do and not because I have to but because I want to. He isn\u2019t getting his hands on you again Shaw. Not ever again.\u201d</p><p>It was a nice thought so I didn\u2019t want to argue instead I let him snuggle me into his side and absently ran my hand up and down his leg while he drove. I didn\u2019t ask if he was taking me home or to his place and I honestly didn\u2019t care until I remembered Rome was crashing on his couch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey are we going downtown or to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured mine since I need to get Rome to help me with your Beamer in the morning. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh is it going to be weird walking in together with him there? I\u2019ve had about enough drama for one day.\u201d</p><p>I felt him shake his head. \u201cNaw we talked about it today. He knows we got something going on and its cool. He did say that he would break both of my legs if I kept acting like a jackass though, so there is that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm...why did you do it?\u201d I knew he would know what I was asking about without explaining.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s what I do.\u201d He swore under his breath. \u201cGirls have always been easy and they usually smell good and taste good so for just a second things are simple and nice and all the crap doing battle inside my head goes quiet. I knew I didn\u2019t want someone that wasn\u2019t you but I was pissed off and confused so I just did what I always do and thought maybe it would make me feel better. It didn\u2019t, it made me feel like absolute shit and made me see pretty clearly there is no substitute for you. I made a mistake but it could have been so much worse and I hope you can sincerely forgive me.\u201d</p><p>It made my heart hurt but I understood it because I understood him. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I get it. It just can\u2019t be your excuse for stepping out on me every time we fight. I don\u2019t have it in me to just look the other way every time you use another girl to work out your hurt feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you no more. I\u2019ll figure this out Shaw I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so because we\u2019re going to disagree Rule, we argued before we started sleeping together so you know we\u2019re going to probably argue more now.\u201d</p> <p>His hand stroked up and down my arm. \u201cThat\u2019s cool because I bet make up sex with you is going to be out of this world.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t deny it so I just stayed quiet and let him sooth me while he drove, he even picked Straylight Run to listen to instead of his normal blaring punk rock or heavy metal so by the time we parked in front of the Victorian I was back in control. He took my bag from me and led me into the apartment. Rome and Nash were on the couch yelling at the TV, I assumed the Broncos were losing and they both looked up at me with twin faces full of relief.</p><p>\u201cThank God. Now maybe he\u2019ll stop acting like a cranky toddler that skipped nap time.\u201d Rule smacked Nash on the back of the head as Rome got up and wrapped me in a bear hug.</p><p>\u201cGlad you gave him another chance little girl.\u201d</p><p>When I was back on my feet I grinned sheepishly at both of them and turned back to Rule. \u201cI need to call Ayden and my phone is trashed, can I use yours?\u201d I expected him to spend a minute erasing texts or clearing his search history but he just handed it over. I tried to hide how happy that made me so I bit my lip and motioned down the hall. \u201cI\u2019ll just go in your room so I can hear her over the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead I want to talk to the guys for a second anyway.\u201d The grimness of his tone let me know he wanted to fill them in on my situation with Gabe. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in just a minute.\u201d</p> <p>I resisted the temptation to scroll through his contacts and look at his text conversations and dialed Ayden. I didn\u2019t know if she would answer since she wouldn\u2019t recognize Rule\u2019s number but she ended up picking up on the third ring.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat number is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m using Rule\u2019s phone because I\u2019m a genius and threw mine against the wall.\u201d</p><p>She snickered at me. \u201cIt was because I told you about the girl at the club wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you have his phone so you must have worked things out somewhere along the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe came to Brookside to apologize and then he crashed my mother\u2019s brunch and ended up being the star attraction. It was impossible not to forgive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Something tells me that one comes with a whole truckload of drama you so might as well get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah well I\u2019m not short on drama of my own.\u201d I went into the bathroom and leaned against the sink. The image looking back at me in the mirror was startling. I looked agitated and even paler than usual. \u201cGabe grabbed me and shoved me around. He cornered me in my room and threatened all kinds of crazy stuff. I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do about it. Rule\u2019s all set to get together an old fashioned lynching squad and I don\u2019t want him to get in trouble because of me. It\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat asshole put his hands on you?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYeah, I have bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I say let Rule have at him. You better be looking into a restraining order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, Rule has a client that used to be a police officer he\u2019s going to call him. He also said he wants to stay with me or have me stay here until the whole thing is resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like your boy is getting serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I guess that\u2019s better than nothing for now. When are you going to get a new phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably tomorrow, Rule said he would buy me a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan I like a fella that knows how to apologize right. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d The last was asked as a question.</p><p>\u201cI think so, I\u2019ll let you know for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove ya girl. Be safe, let Rule take care of you for a minute you\u2019ve earned it. You took pretty great care of him all this time now it can be his turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t a relationship supposed to about taking care of each other equally?\u201d</p><p>She laughed but it sounded bitter. \u201cYou\u2019re asking the wrong person that honey, my track record isn\u2019t anything to brag about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyden, do you want to talk about something? You seem, I dunno sharper than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m good, just worry about you right now honey. I missed you this weekend.</p><p>\u201cMissed you too.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and set it on the edge of the sink. I pushed the sleeves of my sweater up and splashed cold water on my face. I took the tie out of my hair and unwound the tight braid so that my hair fell down around my shoulders. I took off the pearls and kicked off my heels and started to feel a little bit more like myself. I heard the bedroom door open and close and Rule softly called my name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in here.\u201d</p><p>I heard some shuffling and some swearing as he maneuvered through the stuff scattered on his floor. The bathroom door swung open and his eyes met mine in the mirror. The chilly depths of his were shadowed with concern as he crowded in behind me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreaked out but other than that okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about your mom ratting you out to your dad?\u201d He put a hand on either side of me, trapping me between him and the basin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop her so if she does I\u2019ll deal with it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about school? She said he would stop paying if you didn\u2019t do what she wanted.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back so that I was pressed against his chest. \u201cThey both like to use that threat against me, it\u2019s their favorite extortion tool. I figure they\u2019re both actually more worried about trying to explain to people why their daughter is working at Subway instead of in medical school to actually stop paying tuition and if they do,\u201d I raised a shoulder and let it drop. \u201cThen I figure out a plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew you were so adaptable.\u201d I made a face that made him laugh and he moved his hands around so that they rested on my stomach. \u201cThe guys are going to order pizza and watch the rest of the game I told them I would check and see what you were thinking for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>I pushed my hair back let my head fall onto his shoulder. \u201cI want to take a hot shower and then I think I want to take a nap. This week has sucked, I\u2019ve been stressed out and burned out from school. I can\u2019t remember the last time I got to just relax.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyebrows went up. \u201cYou won\u2019t mind if I kick it with them for a bit?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head no. \u201cSeriously go bro-out I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He watched me for a solid minute, waiting to see if I was just messing with him, to prove that I was fine with him spending time with his boys I pressed a kiss to his jaw. He pressed a kiss to my hair and backed out of the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019ll grab your bag for you.\u201d</p><p>He set it on the toilet and gave me a hard kiss before searching my face for signs of something. I laughed and physically shoved him out the door before closing it firmly in his face. \u201cGo, be a guy. I\u2019ll be here when it\u2019s over.\u201d I waited until I heard the outside door shut and then stripped down and climbed in his shower. If I never had to suffer through one of my mother\u2019s functions again it would be too soon. I scrubbed every inch of my body until it was pink and shiny, laughing hysterically because I had to use Rule\u2019s dude soap and I ended up smelling like a seventeen year old boy that just discovered Axe body spray. Even his shampoo and conditioner was designed for male only use so instead of my normal coconut and lime I ended up with hair that smelled like sandalwood and spice. I finger combed my wet hair and put on a pair of yoga pants and a t-shirt and fell into his rumbled bed. For the first time in a week I felt like I could take a real breath. I burrowed into his side of the bed and fell asleep within seconds even with the hooting and hollering coming from the living room.</p><p>Hot hands were traveling under my clothes in a lazy caress. I woke up already turned on and squirming under Rule\u2019s seductive touch. I blinked to get my eyes used to the darkness but squeezed them shut again when his mouth landed high on my inner thigh. It was like the best dream ever, only now I was awake and wiggling in anticipation as his breath blew across the most sensitive parts of me. I reached for his head and giggled a little as my fingers skimmed over the buzzed surface. The stubble tickled across my sensitive fingertips.</p><p>\u201cI really do miss the mohawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll grow back.\u201d I felt the slide of his lip ring over damp skin and sucked in a gasp so hard that it made my lungs hurt. He laughed against my skin and his hands moved to hold me where he wanted me. \u201cI missed this. Nobody has ever been as sweet as you Shaw.\u201d</p><p>I felt the press of the barbell in his tongue as he moved in and around the part of me that had woken ready to take what he had to give. \u201cI think the fact you\u2019re comparing me to the legions of girls that came before me should probably make me furious, but I think I\u2019ll choose to take it as a compliment.\u201d The last faded away on a tight moan as he pulled my hips up and settled his mouth at burning point of my desire. I had heard tales from my coworkers and even from Ayden about how having a guy do this for you was often the best part of sexy, naked time but I had always had my doubts because it seemed invasive and too intimate, and I wasn\u2019t wrong. As he kissed and licked and maneuvered around all my damp folds and aching flesh I went a little crazy. There was nowhere to hide how he was affecting me while he was doing that and man did he know what he was doing. At one point I wanted to scream his name but at the last second remembered his brother was just across the wall and shoved my fist in my mouth to stifle my reaction as the world kaleidoscope into brilliant color in every direction. I didn\u2019t know how it was with other guys, but as with everything else I experienced with Rule, he just made it all so good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laid in a pile of worthless goo as he rose up off the bed and began to haphazardly pull his clothes off. The show was a delight in itself so by the time he crawled in the bed beside me I was ready to purr and curl up around him like the satisfied sex kitten he was turning me into.</p><p>\u201cThat was certainly a nice way to wake up.\u201d I curled my hands up around his shoulders as he rolled over me and put his knee between my legs.</p><p>\u201cYou were out for most of the afternoon. I kept waiting for you to peek your head out and join us but in never happened.\u201d He dropped his head so that his nose rubbed against the side of my face. \u201cI checked in on you and you just looked so perfect all sleepy and pretty in my bed I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d He laid a soft trail of kisses from behind my ear to the sensitive hallow of my throat. His fingers skimmed down my arm and lightly encircled my bruised wrist. Gabe had left a ring of black and blue marks that stood out in stark relief against my pale skin so I couldn\u2019t help the emotion that clogged my throat when Rule lightly stroked the damaged flesh and lifted it up to press butterfly kisses around the circumference.</p><p>\u201cThis should have never happened, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>I trailed a hand down over his flank and let my fingers spread out across the colorful surface of his ribs. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have gone in the first place. I need to learn to set boundaries with my parents and stick with them. It\u2019s not worth sacrificing things that matter to me in order to try and make them happy.\u201d</p><p>He took the hand he was holding and pinned it to the bed above my head, his pale eyes blazed into mine with a mixture of want and compassion. \u201cShaw I\u2019m the one that feels the need to burn the house down when the faucet springs a leak, I know I tend to go the extreme and I need to back off. However if you think I\u2019m ever going to stand by and watch you purposely put yourself in danger with that asshole again be prepared for us to do battle.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get a chance to reply because he kissed me, really kissed me, kissed me with an edge so that there was no mistaking he was serious and that I needed to pay attention to what was happening between us. There was a bite of teeth and the press of metal and all the goodness that was just Rule as tongues slid together and hands began to roam. He caught my free hand and pinned it above my head with the other one so that I was stretched out and prone beneath him. His eyes glittered with pure wicked intent as he leered down at me.</p><p>\u201cI think I like you like this.\u201d His free hand twisted and wandered over sensitive skin and moist creases. I whimpered a little because it felt so good and because I wanted to move but he held me still with the press of his much bigger body into mine. \u201cI like having you at my mercy. I can do whatever I want to you.\u201d He proved his point by taking the top of one breast in his mouth and sucking until it almost hurt. He\u2019d left a hickey the first time we did this too but this one seemed different, more like a territorial marking, a claiming of sorts.</p><p>\u201cGood thing for you I like all the things you want to do to me.\u201d He pulled a leg up and hooked it around his lean hips. I felt the hot press of him ready at my entrance and tried to shift so that he came inside. He pulled back and grinned down at me.</p> <p>\u201cAlways so impatient.\u201d I tugged at my trapped hands.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled again as he kissed me. \u201cSo tell me.\u201d</p><p>I tried to pull him inside with the sheer for of will alone but he kept moving just out of range with a taunting smirk. \u201cSeriously Shaw tell me.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut because there was only so much truth I was ready to hand over to him in one day. He moved my other leg and pressed in just a millimeter or two making me start to quiver. \u201cTell me why we all thought you and Remy had a serious thing going one but I\u2019m the one that was your first. Tell me why Rome seems to think you\u2019ve had a thing for me for a while now. Tell me why when we do this it\u2019s so much different than whenever I\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p><p>I wanted him to move, wanted him to let me move but when I pried my eyes open he was watching me closely, clearly in control enough to wait me out. I met his pointed stare for a heartbeat before whispering, \u201cBecause it\u2019s always been you even when I didn\u2019t want it to be, even when it broke my heart over and over again. It\u2019s just always been you.\u201d</p> <p>My words changed something in him, his eyes flashed with a frozen spark and suddenly he was in and moving and the rest of the world just stopped and faded away. All that mattered was what was happening between us in that moment and it mattered to him just as much as it mattered to me. His tempo changed with each thrust, he was always a little wild, a little uninhibited in bed but it was like my words had broken something loose inside him and this was the real Rule, the guy that used crazy hair and a body full of ink to deflect anyone getting too close. I gasped and moaned, finally calling his name out in a shaky voice as we raced towards the end together. It felt different like he said, more powerful, more intense and when he finally dropped his forehead down to touch mine it felt complete.</p><p>I sighed in contentment and wrapped my arms around him. He pulled me over him and rolled so that I wasn\u2019t getting crushed. I closed my eyes and was about to go back into a very satisfied sleep when the entire length of his long body went board straight underneath me. My eyes popped open as I felt his hands tense in the ends of my hair and I forced my head up to look down at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bed\u2019s wet.\u201d</p><p>I just stared at him blankly. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that means we didn\u2019t use protection. I haven\u2019t had sex without a condom since I was a teenager and an idiot, Geez no wonder it felt so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>I made a face and rolled off of him. \u201cBecause my mother made me. She thought I was hooking up with one or both of you Archer twins long before it ever happened. I\u2019ve just stayed on it because it makes my period less crazy so we should be fine.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me back to his chest and brushed my hair away from my face. \u201cWith my history you really wanna chance it?\u201d</p><p>I exhaled. \u201cYou really know how to ruin a moment Rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey I told you it\u2019s my job to protect you even if that means I have to do it from myself. We have to have clean health screens to work in the shop since we work around bodily fluids, needles and open skin and my last one was crystal clear and like I said I never ever have unsafe sex unless it\u2019s with a high maintenance blond with killer green eyes that makes me so crazy I forget.\u201d</p><p>I cuddled into the curve of his body and let him wrap his arms around me. The hand that had his name inked across the knuckles ended up resting across my chest and I used my index finger to trace over the bold letters. \u201cI trust you and I think we\u2019re good so I\u2019m not going to make an issue out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah because like I said it\u2019s always been you Rule, even when I really wished it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to wish I had paid closer attention.\u201d</p><p>I laced our fingers together. I liked the way they looked all tangled together. His were long and covered in brilliant designs, mine were small and tipped in boring pink polish but next to each other they were more interesting, more vital. I fell back asleep listening to the steady inhale and exhale of his breath in my ear and thinking that even if I hadn\u2019t been on the pill having a moment of wild, uninhibited and totally unprotected sex with him was most definitely worth any of the risks that were involved with that. I could think of a worse fate that brining the next troublesome Archer into the world.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Rule</p><p>\u201cThe first time I came home and saw you sitting in the kitchen with Remy I remember thinking what in the hell has he gotten himself into? You were so pale and scared, your eyes were twice as big as normal and you looked like a little bird that had fallen out of the nest. Remy had always had a soft spot for the neglected so I wasn\u2019t surprised, but I was flabbergasted at how quickly the rest of the family took to you. I always thought it was going to be us Archer\u2019s against the world forever and then there was you and it all kind of broke apart and I became even more of the black sheep than I had been. Rome adored you, mom and dad just took you and Remy as an evitable unit and I was left out in the cold as usual. I think I just took all those feelings of separation and alienation and transferred them onto you. Remy and I were always two parts of a whole and when you came along that went away to some extent. I think I was jealous that he spent so much time and effort being your hero and not being my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time I saw you I was terrified. I had seen you and Remy around school and everyone always talked about the Archer twins like you were some kind of mythical creatures. Remy was so athletic and had all the right friends and the best grades, you were always in trouble, running around with older kids and constantly getting called to the office for skipping class or whatever else you were up to. Remy saved me and brought me home, he made me laugh when nothing in my life seemed remotely funny and he was kind when no one in my life had ever even tried to be nice before. He sat me in the kitchen told me not to worry when his brothers came home he would keep them in line and then you and Rome came barreling through the door. Rome looked at me and shook his head he asked Remy if I was another stray and you, you just looked right through me like I was a ghost and asked him if he still wanted to go with you and Nash for pizza. I thought you were beautiful in such a different way than Remy. You guys looked so much alike but you turned your looks into something so interesting I couldn\u2019t look away. I stared at you for a full fifteen minutes and then when you and Rome left you looked at me and said \u2018Geez Rem get her a cup of tea or something she looks like Casper the Friendly Ghost. Remy just shook his head and sat down across from me he knew then, he always knew, he told me, \u2018Rule is a good guy, Shaw, the best actually. I love him more than anything in the world but he\u2019s also a sixteen year old guy and an Archer. Don\u2019t barrow heartache when you can avoid it.\u2019 For years and years he told me over and over that I was being foolish that I shouldn\u2019t get wound up about you when your priorities were elsewhere and then about a year before he died he changed his tune. When you moved to Denver together suddenly he was all about me going to DU after school, all about me getting to a point where I could tell you how I had felt about you. Suddenly he was Remy the matchmaker, it was weird and then the accident happened and I never got a chance to ask what changed his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad I know now and I still think you look like Casper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad too and I don\u2019t mind when you call me Casper, its kinda sweet. Besides when you first started it I thought I was special, none of the other girls ever got a nickname you just called them sweetie, or babe, or honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are special, you were special then too I was just too stupid to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have been ready for you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hushed conversation gave me a whole new insight into the girl that was starting to mean so much to me. It also brought up a lot of questions that I couldn\u2019t ask of my deceased brother. I wanted to know why if he had known she had a thing for me, he let me and the rest of the family happily believe they were an item for all those years. It seemed deceitful and shady and so not like Remy. I also wanted to know why he hadn\u2019t said anything to me about her, I thought we shared everything and not that I had been in a place in my early teens to offer Shaw anything it still seemed odd he hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about her feelings to me so that I might have treaded more carefully around her instead of trampling across her feelings like a herd of buffalos.</p><p>The quiet conversation took place early in the morning while she was stumbling around my room trying to get ready for school. She only had her fancy dinner with mom clothes and didn\u2019t want to run back to her apartment so I told her to take one of my t-shirts out of the closet. It was fun to watch a hot chick scramble around half naked and pick through my pretty basic guy wardrobe. She ended up in her leggings and boots and my Black Angels t-shirt that hung almost to her knees and suddenly getting up to take her to school seemed a lot more fun. She dodged my grabbing hands with a laugh while trying to pull her hair into a ponytail. This was the kind of interaction I missed by only engaging in meaningless one night stands. I liked playing with Shaw, liked having her using my bathroom and being all up in my stuff and the more I thought about it the more I realized I had missed her in more areas of my life than my bed this last week.</p><p>She pressed a quick kiss to my mouth and told me she was going to make coffee and something for breakfast so I struggled to get up and searched around for my phone to call Mark. I wasn\u2019t going to waste any time trying to put as many roadblocks between Shaw and Davenport as I could. I pulled on a pair of dark jeans and a shirt and went into the bathroom to splash cold water on my face. The phone rang while I brushed my teeth and Mark picked up just as I was spitting into the sink.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up kid?\u201d I was checking out my stubbly face in the mirror and decided since I didn\u2019t have any hair at the moment I was just gonna let it go, maybe try and grow it into a goatee or something.</p> <p>\u201cHey Mark, sorry to bother you but I have a problem and I need some advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou piss off that pretty girl of yours?\u201d</p><p>I laughed and leaned against the sink. \u201cYeah but I managed to fix that all on my own, but she is the reason I am calling. She has a lunatic ex who doesn\u2019t seem to want to take no for an answer. He\u2019s been showing up at her work, following her around, calling her a million times a day and he\u2019s a friend of the family so her parents keep making excuses for her to be around him. This weekend he cornered her when she was alone shook her up and grabbed her. He left bruises on her arms and made a bunch of threats about what he\u2019s going to do to her if she doesn\u2019t take him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell she didn\u2019t tell me about until after we left her parent\u2019s house and I\u2019ve already told him in no uncertain terms to leave her alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe Davenport.\u201d</p><p>There was a low whistle and I could practically see Mark pacing back and forth. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t happen to be Judge George Davenport\u2019s son would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. He keeps throwing around that there isn\u2019t anything I can do to him because of who his dad is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might be right. I would say we need to get a personal protection order in place as soon as possible, but there is a good chance if Davenport sees his son is involved it might not get passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is, but we still need to try otherwise there won\u2019t be anything on file. You need to keep a clear head about this kid. The name Davenport is pretty powerful in our legal system and you don\u2019t want to end up on the wrong side of it.\u201d</p><p>I ran an agitated hand over my head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let him anywhere near her Mark, plain and simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine but don\u2019t go looking for trouble. She\u2019s going to be a sitting duck if you go after the son and end up locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pissed Mark, not stupid. I want her safe and his guy taken down a notch or two but I\u2019m well aware that me rearranging his face isn\u2019t going to accomplish either of those things, however if he comes at me I make no promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he comes at you take him out, but remember guys like this use laws and regulations to fight not bare knuckles and fists. Tell Shaw to be extra careful, tell her to try and be around someone else at all times, look at getting her a Taser or some mace and tell her if he shows up or put his hands on her again to call the police. She can get a harassment order in place if he keeps hounding her and once the police are involved there isn\u2019t much a judge can do to make the report go away. Give her my number just in case, tell her to call me if she has questions or just needs to talk. Like I said that\u2019s a special girl you got there, Kid. You wanna keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are and Rule,\u201d I waited a moment while he finished. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you finally settling down. You\u2019ve always reminded me a little of my son, wild and carefree but you needed something to give you purpose. For my son it was fighting for our freedom and protecting his country, for you I think it\u2019s figuring out you are worthy of the kind of love and affection a girl like that can offer. You two take care I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone just as the door swung open and Shaw stuck her head in. \u201cCome on let\u2019s eat so we can go.\u201d</p> <p>I looked at her, I mean really looked at her and that slippery stuff in my chest suddenly settled right in the center. Her green eyes got wide when I tugged her into the bathroom and pulled her between my spread legs so that she was up against my chest and I rested my chin on the top of her head. Sometimes the difference in our height was just delightful.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d She put her hands around my waist and gave me a tight hug.</p><p>I let out a breath that felt like I had been holding for a hundred years. Suddenly I knew that no matter how my parents felt, no matter what happened in the future near or far I was for once doing the absolute right thing. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. Better than good actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay well I don\u2019t want to be late so come eat some pancakes and take me to school.\u201d She gave my ass a little pat and bounded back out of the room. I shook my head on a little laugh and followed her out. Rome was up and sitting at the table listening to her tell him about the bizarre brunch yesterday but Nash was nowhere in sight. I had let both of them know what was going on with polo shirt yesterday and I think they were both on hyper alert so that I didn\u2019t go off the rails. My brother gave me a questioning look as I sat down, but I wasn\u2019t about to go into detail while Shaw was prancing around feeding us breakfast.</p><p>\u201cYou still good to come to get her car with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep but I\u2019m going to swing by mom and dad\u2019s while were there, you wanna come?\u201d</p><p>I flipped him off because he knew the last thing I wanted to do was see my folks. \u201cCan\u2019t anyways I have an appointment at noon.\u201d</p><p>Shaw placed plates in front of both of us and took a seat on my right, she gave me a warm smile and I knew besides feeling right that this is what I had been missing for so long. I felt at home, this girl, my brother, my friends all the things that I had surrounded myself with suddenly made so much sense and I had a clarity that had been missing since Remy\u2019s death. I loved my family, but I had never felt like I was part of them, this world I had developed, this life I was living it was a good one, filled with solid people that saw me for who I was and cared about me anyway. My throat got tight and I had to hide the swell of emotion behind a glass of orange juice otherwise I risked blubbering like a baby. I cleared my throat, \u201cI\u2019m gonna run Shaw to school then come back and get you is that cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll go kick Nash and see if wants to hit the gym with me while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Shaw. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have Ayden take you to work after school, right?\u201d She nodded at me and continued to eat her breakfast. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll come get you from the bar when your shift is done. Your car will be here so you can decide if you want to stay or go to your place later.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a shoulder and let it fall. \u201cI don\u2019t get out until two, its Monday night football so we\u2019re busy. I\u2019ll probably just stay here, besides you need to take me to get a phone tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does he owe you a phone?\u201d I glared at my big brother but she answered before I could tell him to shut it.</p><p>\u201cI broke mine on accident and Rule offered to replace it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did? That doesn\u2019t sound like my little brother.\u201d I know he was just trying to rile me up but awesome sex and having Shaw close at hand with a plate of pancakes in front of me made that an impossible task. I smirked at him and leaned back in my chair to reach out and put my arm across the back of Shaw\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning over a new leaf.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, eyes that were so similar to mine gleamed with repressed humor. \u201cFor you to be considering someone else like that is more like turning over a whole freaking tree, not just a leaf, but good for you. Being considerate is a nice change for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you.\u201d Shaw rolled her eyes and let her fork clatter to her plate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both ridiculous and I\u2019m going to be late so let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. \u201cLet me grab shoes and we\u2019ll head out. Go grab your stuff. Thanks for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She ran out of the room and I pushed to my feet. I glowered at my brother.</p><p>\u201cI do know how to be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you want something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough. I want her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks to me like you got her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I just need to figure out how to not screw it up.\u201d</p><p>Rome got up as well. \u201cYou won\u2019t Rule. When it matters you never do, just remember that. Hey what did your cop buddy say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she needs to keep her eyes open and he wants me to get her a Taser or mace. He thinks the little punk is pretty insulated because of his old man but he pretty much said if he tries anything with me I can lay him out. It sucks, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to put his hands on her and live to tell about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep her close and keep it under control, you know we got your back in this lil bro.\u201d</p><p>I made a face and lowered my voice because I heard Shaw coming back down the hall. \u201cIf anything happens to her Rome I\u2019m going to lose it, I mean I know I kind of went off the rails when Remy died, but something tells me if that girl ends up hurt or worse there won\u2019t be any recovering from that for me.\u201d</p><p>I think he was probably going to answer something back but Shaw popped up at my elbow and none to subtlety tugged on me to let me know she was ready to go. She waved to Rome and hustled me out to the truck. It was cold out so I wrapped and arm around her and tugged her close to my side. She rubbed her cold nose on my neck and laughed when I swore at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou need a hat.\u201d My newly shorn head was actually freezing but I was a tough guy so I just pulled the hood of my sweatshirt up and raised the eyebrow with the hoops in it at her.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever macho man. Thanks for getting my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, just make sure you keep an eye out at school today. I don\u2019t want polo shirt way laying you on your way to class or anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPolo shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavenport, he always has on a stupid polo.\u201d</p><p>She laughed so hard I had to hold her upright and give her a boost into the truck, not that I minded because it meant I got to cop a feel of her superb backside.</p><p>\u201cThat he does. I\u2019ll make sure I walk to class with someone. This girl Devlin is a bunch of the same classes as me and we have a couple study groups together so I\u2019ll just stick with her. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a fan of Gabe either so that should make asking her easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. What kind of phone do you want? I don\u2019t want you to have to wait until tomorrow to have one. I\u2019ll go on my way back from Brookside and pick one up.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged and messed around with my I-Pod until the smoky sound of Lucero filled the cab. \u201cI don\u2019t care. The same as my old one is fine. I need my contacts switched over though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at me and scooted over so that she could put her hand on my knee. Her fingers tapped out the rhythm of the country tinged rock as we made our way across town to the university. It took about twenty minutes in light traffic, but it was getting ready to snow and I could see having to push my first appointment back because of weather since I was driving out of town. She wanted me to just park on the street and drop her off, but I wanted to keep her in sight as long as possible so I parked the truck at a meter and told her I was walking her to her first class. She rolled her eyes but didn\u2019t argue when I opened her door and helped her hop down.</p><p>I tucked her back in the curve of my body and walked across the campus with her, thinking this was the only time I had been on a college campus for a reason other than a party. Several people called out a greeting to her or waved hi, she replied in kind and I didn\u2019t miss the speculative looks we got since I\u2019m sure we made an odd pair and her classmates probably weren\u2019t used to seeing her out of her normal rich girl gear. We stopped outside an impressive looking building and she tilted her head back so she was looking up at me. Her green eyes were bright, her hair was in a sexy tangle from me and from the brisk Colorado air and her nose was a charming shade of pink and I don\u2019t think I had ever seen anything cuter.</p><p>\u201cDrive safe. I agree with your brother I think you should try and see your parents while you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to argue with her so I just kissed her hard and fierce with enough tongue and enough force to let her know she would be on my mind throughout the day. I thought maybe she would freak out about the public display of affection but it only took between one heartbeat and the next for her cold hands to climb up my chest and wrap around my neck. She kissed me back with just as much fervor and when she fell back to her feet she was breathing hard and had a pretty flush under her pale cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cYou be safe too. I\u2019ll see you later. I\u2019ll bring your phone by the bar after work. Remember don\u2019t be alone whenever you can avoid it. And Shaw,\u201d she met my gaze with humor lighting up her own. \u201cI like you going to school in my clothes, that\u2019s totally hot.\u201d</p><p>She stood back on her tip toes and kissed the end of my chilly nose. \u201cAgreed, and you suck for changing the subject but I can take a hint so I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>I watched her walk up the stairs of the building, she paused at the top where a girl was seemingly waiting for her. She smiled at the girl and told her hello. I heard the other girl ask her in a surprised voice that was loud enough to carry down to where I was waiting, \u201cWho was that?\u201d I was curious as to what her answer would be considering that wasn\u2019t something we had ever really talked about.</p><p>Her laugh carried sharp and clear through the winter air. \u201cThat\u2019s Rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a new boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he isn\u2019t exactly new, but yeah.\u201d</p><p>I was her boyfriend. She was my girlfriend. How weird was that? I hadn\u2019t had any girl in my life long enough in twenty two years to call a girlfriend I didn\u2019t even have friends that were girls really, Shaw was the closest thing that had ever come to filling that role as well. I was her boyfriend and that made me want to dance a jig and pump my fist in the air. Instead I winked at her when she turned back to look at me and laughed when she in turn stuck her tongue out at me. Why hadn\u2019t I realized before that letting someone in would make me happy, that she made me happy. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I had laughed so much and even in bed she made it fun. She made things better and I knew I wanted to do the same for her.</p><p>I sent Rome a text that I was on my way and he replied back he and Nash were just finishing up at the gym so he should be ready to go when I got home. I changed the music to the Bloody Hollies and rocked out on the way back to the Victorian. I ran in to grab her phone out of her bag and collect my brother and in no time we were on the highway headed to Brookside. The first few flurries of snow started to pelt the windshield when we were just entering the interstate and I swore knowing what it was going to do to the commute and my schedule for the rest of the day. In fact before we even got to Brookside Nash called and told me both my noon and two o\u2019clock appointments wanted to reschedule because of the weather so I no longer had the work excuse as a reason to bolt home without trying to see my folks.</p> <p>Rome not being stupid blatantly listened in on the call and looked across the cab of the truck expectantly. \u201cIt won\u2019t kill you to stop by and just say hi for a minute. We can even go there first so they don\u2019t ask why we have Shaw\u2019s car with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t see the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is that no matter how you feel they\u2019re still our parents and you don\u2019t just get to give up on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? They gave up on me the minute the good twin was pronounced DOA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it and grow a pair. You can tough out a five minute visit with mom and dad if only to say at least you tried. It\u2019ll make Shaw happy to know you made a minimal effort at least. Remember their more like her parent\u2019s than her real parent\u2019s so if the two of you are going to do what you\u2019re doing for the long term you\u2019re going to have to show her that even if mom isn\u2019t going to budge that at least you tried.\u201d</p><p>He was right and it totally made my stomach turn over. Right now Shaw was all about building a bridge and forcing my mom\u2019s hand when it came to dealing with me and accepting me but after seeing how awful her biological mother treated her I had no doubt the divide between her and my parents wouldn\u2019t be longstanding which meant I had to figure out how I fit into that puzzle. Trying wouldn\u2019t kill me but it was sure as hell going to be awkward and uncomfortable, for all of us I was sure.</p><p>\u201cFine we can stop by but don\u2019t get your hopes up. I haven\u2019t heard from either one of them since I left brunch that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArcher pride is a dangerous thing. If we aren\u2019t careful it\u2019s going to destroy our entire family.\u201d</p><p>I just grunted in response and tried to tell myself that doing this was not only going to make Shaw happy but clearly it meant something to Rome as well and if there was anyone in the world that I would do anything for it was my brother. Rome never asked me for anything and had given me his support and his approval endlessly even when it put him at odds with the rest of the family and I owed him at least the opportunity to try and mend what was fractured. We drove the rest of the way to their house in silence; I could see Rome giving me surreptitious looks out of the corner of his eye the entire way. I think he was waiting for me to drive past the exit or freak out and change my mind but I kept telling myself that I didn\u2019t need my parents to look at me the same way they looked at him to go home and be okay. Before that tore me apart and made me act like a troubled adolescent with a chip on his shoulder, now I knew I was going home to a kick ass job, a rock star brother, a smoking hot girl that happened to be totally into me issues and all and to a solid group of friends that were willing to put up with me and have my back no matter what and while the hole that Remy\u2019s death left would never really be filled, I was living a good life and they should be proud of me and if they weren\u2019t they could just piss off.</p><p>Both my folk\u2019s cars were in the driveway when we pulled onto their street. I hissed a breath out between my teeth and tried not to flinch when Rome clapped me on the shoulder and gave me a little shove. \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p><p>I jumped out of the truck and my boots sent little tufts of snow scattering. I could see my breath in the air indicating the weather was going to get worse before we headed home which was kind of how I felt about my situation here. I knew Rome had a key but since I was with him he stopped at the front door and knocked relegating himself to stranger status just like me. I heard shuffling around and it took a few minutes for my dad to come to the door. He peered out at us in surprise and I had to admit I was secretly pleased he looked equally surprised to see Rome as he was to see me.</p><p>\u201cBoys? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He pushed open the screen door and motioned us into the warm house. I was rubbing my hands together to warm them up so he didn\u2019t even try to give me a hug after he embraced Rome which was fine by me because I wasn\u2019t sure we were at the hugging phase of our relationship anymore.</p><p>\u201cRule had to run an errand before work out this way so I thought we would stop by and say hi. You guys aren\u2019t busy are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo your mom is upstairs.\u201d His gaze settled on me. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you son.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to throw out something flippant but in the vein of trying to make peace I gave a lopsided grin and answered, \u201cYeah I bet. Rome thought it would be cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule this is your home, you are always welcome here.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to say I hadn\u2019t felt welcome in well over three years but I just nodded and said, \u201cThanks for that dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of errand did you have to do an hour away in the snow?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed a hand over my head and looked at Rome sideways. \u201cUh I actually told Shaw I would come get her car for her. She left it here when she was visiting her folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw was in Brookside this weekend? You might not want to let your mom know that. She\u2019s having a hard time with the line Shaw drew in the sand. That little gal is just as stubborn as you boys and I don\u2019t think Margot was prepared for her to stick to her guns the way she has. It\u2019s awful nice of you to help her out Rome.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at the automatic assumption Rome was the one she called on even though he had already told him it was my errand. I wasn\u2019t going to say anything but Rome chuckled and patted my dad on the back.</p><p>\u201cNot me old-timer. Shaw and Rule have called a truce. You should see them; they actually act civil and spend time like normal people do together. He\u2019s the one that told her he would get the car, I just got roped into being the second driver.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My dad looked over Rome\u2019s broad shoulder at me with shock clear on his face. \u201cReally? You two were always at odds, even when you were young.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m trying to grow up a little bit. She\u2019s been in my life a long time I\u2019m trying to put that into a new perspective. We get along fine.\u201d Plus spending time with her naked as often as possible was my new top priority in life and doing things that made her happy and kept her safe also had the bonus of making me happy which was such a new feeling I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it yet.</p><p>\u201cWell maybe you can tell her how hard it\u2019s been for your mom without her around. Getting her to come by for a visit would be lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has her reasons for staying away dad.\u201d My tone sharpened reflexively but I kept my face smoothed out trying the belay the tension that was growing as we walked into the living room where my mom was watching TV on the sofa. Her eyes snapped from Rome to me and then back. Even from across the room I could feel the displeasure radiating off of her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She didn\u2019t even look at Rome her eyes were glued to me and her anger was like a whip across my skin. I shoved my hands in my pockets and met her gaze with a level one of my own. I wasn\u2019t going to let her get under my skin this time; I owed it to my brother and to my girl.</p><p>\u201cJust came by to say and see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you here.\u201d Rome went stiff beside me and I heard my dad take in a quick intake of breath but I wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>\u201cI know but I thought it wouldn\u2019t kill me to try and fix things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother you just ruin everything.\u201d Her voice was raspy and I swore I could see the hatred she harbored hanging off of each syllable. My dad took a step forward but Rome pulled him back. \u201cMargot that\u2019s enough. The boy is our son not a stranger we\u2019re going to just put out on the street because you\u2019re unhappy with him right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad it\u2019s cool, I know how she feels and she\u2019s never hidden it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect Rule? Because of you your brother is in a box in the ground and the girl I think of as a daughter won\u2019t have anything to do with me. You\u2019re a poison to this family.\u201d</p><p>Well that was a little harsher and a little blunter than she normally went for but it was finally out in the open. I rubbed my fists in my eyes and bit out a sigh. My dad and Rome were trying to talk over each other, both trying to get her to retract her awful statements and telling her that none of it was true but it was to no avail.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey everybody stop. It\u2019s oaky, come on Rome don\u2019t act like you\u2019re shocked. She always blamed me because I called him that night for a ride, it\u2019s cool I get it. In fact I blamed myself for a long time too until I realized it could have been a million other reasons. It was an accident, an accident that took someone we all loved but still an accident. She could blame the truck driver, she could blame Remy for speeding, she could blame God for the rain or even the doctor in the O.R. for not being good enough at his job but no, she blames me and always will and its fine if that\u2019s what she needs in order to keep it together I can shoulder that load.\u201d All three of them were looking at me with wide eyes. It was probably the most I had said to my parents in one sitting in over five years and there was no yelling or no temper tantrums. \u201cShaw is a smart girl and has strong convictions so I refuse to let you put your actions and consequences with her on me. She told you straight up what you needed to do in order to maintain your relationship with her and you refused. No one is to blame for that but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about Shaw. She is in a totally different league than you; she and Remy were both on a far better path than you ever dreamed to walk.\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head sadly and jerked my head toward the door. \u201cMom you have no clue. Shaw\u2019s the most loving, kind, compassionate person in the world she would chew off her own arm before trying to put herself above someone she cares about. She doesn\u2019t give a flip about this path or that path as long as everyone she loves is going somewhere and at the end they are happy. I\u2019m outta here. I have shit to do. Dad it was good seeing you, surprisingly the first three minutes of this visit were pretty good, Rome I\u2019ll be in the truck.\u201d</p> <p>I turned to walk back down the stairs and out the front door but her chilly voice stopped me cold. \u201cStay away from Shaw, Rule. You\u2019ll just end up hurting her like you did your brother.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell her it was way too late for that warning that I was beginning to know Shaw inside and out, that she was becoming a critical part of me but I just met her cold gaze with one that I\u2019m sure held resigned sadness. \u201cGood luck ever getting her back into the Archer family fold with that kind of attitude mom. Keep it up and it\u2019ll be a cold day in hell before Shaw ever steps foot in this house again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy she would choose you over this family is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>I gave her the only answer there was. \u201cBecause she thinks I\u2019m worth it.\u201d</p><p>I gave Rome a bland look and moved around him being careful to avoid my dad. I didn\u2019t look back to see if either of them followed me but when I got outside I let out a pent up breath and looked at the street blanketed in snow. Her words hurt, they always had but instead of feeling self-destructive and alone like I normally did I could fully see now that the issues were all hers and there was nothing I could do to change her mind unless she actively sought out help. Too much time had passed with me playing the role of the accused for me to offer any form of clarity up to her.</p><p>\u201cSon,\u201d I was startled at the sound of my dad\u2019s voice. He had stopped to grab a jacket but followed me to the driveway. Rome was nowhere to be seen. I shifted my feet in the powder and shoved my hands deep in the pockets of my hoodie. \u201cWe need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much for this always being my home as well, huh dad?\u201d I regretted it as soon as I said it. There was still a little boy somewhere deep inside me that wanted his parent\u2019s approval and no matter how hard I tried I just couldn\u2019t get him to shut up. \u201cSorry, that was stupid.\u201d</p><p>My dad shook his head and for once I saw genuine remorse in his gaze. \u201cI had no idea it had gotten this bad with your mother, Rule. I\u2019m not a fan of the crazy hair or the obsessive tattoos all over every part of your body and it bugs me to no end that you purposely dress like a hoodlum just to annoy us but I\u2019ve never blamed you for what happened to Remy. You were two very different boys, always were but I loved you both the same. I heard what your mother said at the funeral but I convinced myself it was just grief, just a mother\u2019s overreaction to losing a child too young. I honestly thought she would find her way clear of the sorrow and depression but after today I see where Rome is coming from. We need help, she needs help. I would never ban a child from my home pink hair, blue hair, green hair none of it ultimately matters because I love you and I just want you to be happy and live a good life. I would prefer you stop aggravating an old man every chance you got while doing it, but I don\u2019t want you to think that I ever wish it was you and not Remy that night. It should have never happened to this family, but it did and you are absolutely right that it was an accident.\u201d</p> <p>I stared at my dad like he was a stranger. It was cold and I could barely feel my toes but my blood was pumping fast and hard in my veins. \u201cYou\u2019ve never said any of that to me before. You normally just get mad and leave the room or let mom tear me apart at every turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been hard for me to relate to Rule. Rome was my buddy, Remy was everybody\u2019s best friend and you, well you made your own path when you were just a little fella and I never felt like you needed any kind of guidance from me to get where you wanted to go. Your mother is fragile, more so than I thought and while I knew that what has been happening over the last few years hasn\u2019t done us any good as a family I guess I kept hoping she would just snap out of it. The harsher we were the more you fought back, you never let her get to you the way I think she wanted and while I should have stopped it years ago I guess I see now how much damage what we were doing could have done to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants me to be Remy.\u201d Saying it out loud to him felt like letting go of a lifetime of tightly held secrets.</p><p>He coughed and rubbed his thick hands together. \u201cShe wants the easy relationship she had with Remy with you. Remy wasn\u2019t argumentative or problematic, he just went with the flow. Rome knew we didn\u2019t want him to join the military but he did it anyway because he\u2019s stubborn and determined to make a difference in the world. You were never easy going and complacent. You hated curfew and any rule we imposed on you, you were always creative and quirky but hard to relate to, we said go left and you went backwards, she doesn\u2019t have a son left that she can just dictate and manage. She misses having someone to mother and Remy never minded her doing it for him and neither did Shaw, but now Shaw has chosen a side and Margot is devolving rapidly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad I can\u2019t come back here, not like this. I appreciate everything you said today, in fact I wish you had said it years ago and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have a history of bad behavior and questionable choices littering my history the way I do now, but I\u2019m not going to be her scapegoat anymore.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and looked at the door as Rome came out looking thunderous. \u201cSomething tells me you aren\u2019t the only Archer that is making that call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw too. I\u2019m not going to let mom use her as a pawn in this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah neither am I. She\u2019s like a daughter to me.\u201d</p><p>Rome joined our little huddle and boy did he look pissed. My eyes tended to be light and go silver or gray whenever I felt a strong emotion, my brothers blazed a bright blue the color of the base of a flame.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out of her damn mind. Seriously dad she needs therapy and possibly drugs. I can\u2019t believe she said that shit to Rule.\u201d</p><p>My dad sighed again and shifted sending tufts of snow that had gathered on the shoulders of his jacket drifting to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI know son. I just told Rule I recognize the problem is worse than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only have a few weeks leave left; you better let her know I won\u2019t be back unless she gets her head on right. I tried to tell her and she just started spouting nonsense about Rule brainwashing everybody she cares about. She has straight up vilified him, her own child. I refuse to support her treating him that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both good boys. For right now you two take care of each other and I\u2019ll work on your mother. I love you both. Don\u2019t give up on us yet.\u201d</p><p>We all shared a back pounding round of hugs before Rome and I climbed back into the truck. I had to let the massive motor heat up before the heater would pump out warm hair so while we waited I stared out the snowy windshield in contemplation while Rome rattled on about our mom. He was repulsed by her reaction to my surprise visit, I wasn\u2019t. I was however stunned by everything my dad had told me. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time anyone told me they loved me besides my brothers. I had forgotten how nice it made me feel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou wanna take the Beamer or the truck since it\u2019s coming down pretty good now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe BMW. I\u2019ve seen you drive little brother, you won\u2019t make it back to Denver in one piece in that sports car.\u201d</p><p>He had a point and I wanted to get back in one piece because I wanted to get Shaw a phone and pick her up from work and spend the night in bed with her wrapped around me making her whisper my name over and over in that husky voice and maybe, just maybe getting someone to tell me they loved me would apply to her because I wasn\u2019t sure, but that slippery feeling in my chest sure felt a hell of a lot like love.</p><p>Chapter 12</p> <p>Shaw</p><p>I was still trying to figure out my new phone. Instead of replacing my broken one with a replacement of the same model Rule had gotten me the brand new version with all the bells and whistles and the thing was ten times smarter than me. I was trying to text Ayden that I was running late for our coffee date because one of my classes had run late. I hadn\u2019t seen her for more than a few minutes in the last couple of weeks so we were meeting to catch up. She was still acting a little off but between always staying at Rule\u2019s place and having him crash at ours, to shifting my schedules around at work and being constantly vigilant to avoid any kind of run in with Gabe since the protection order had been shut down cold like Mark had predicted, pinning her down and making her talk to me hadn\u2019t been possible.</p><p>I was developing a pretty good rhythm. On the days I worked I stayed on the Hill with Rule since his place was closer to the bar and he didn\u2019t mind coming to have a drink and waiting for me to get off so he could take me home he and Lou were like the best of friends now. On the days I was at school or volunteered he would show up sometimes around dinner but often right before bedtime and spend the night at my apartment. I had decided to drop my Saturday shift in order to have one weekend night off to spend with him. He liked to go out on Friday and Saturday nights with his friends so I figured it was cool to let him have a night to get his bro-time in while I was working, plus it was fun to have a weekend day off to go shopping or watch a movie when I was so used to being busy all the time. Being with Rule was teaching me that my time was precious and I needed to spend it doing things I wanted as well as the things that were required of me. That was partly why I felt justified in ignoring the calls from my parent\u2019s that had been coming in nonstop since the trip to Brookside.</p><p>I finally got the text sent out and got one back saying she already had a seat and had ordered for us. When I got to the coffee house the place was packed but Ayden had secured a spot by one of the windows and was messing around on her phone. A table full of geeky looking guys was trying to get her attention by talking and laughing loudly but she seemed oblivious. I missed our girl time and I wished she would talk to me about what had been bothering her the last month but with so much on my own plate I was well aware that I hadn\u2019t been the best friend as of late.</p><p>I flopped in the seat across from her and gratefully scooped up the frothy drink she had ordered for me. She made a face at me and put her phone away. \u201cI almost saw your boyfriend naked this morning.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed at the look on her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to that, you\u2019re welcome?\u201d</p><p>She crinkled her nose at me. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much shame does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Rule, right?\u201d</p><p>She picked up her own drink and peered at me over the top of the cup. \u201cI guess he doesn\u2019t really have much to worry about does he? I don\u2019t know how you don\u2019t get distracted by all that stuff inked all over him, I think I would spend all my time looking at his tattoos rather than getting down to business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet.\u201d She had a faraway look in her pretty eyes that I just couldn\u2019t let slide anymore.</p> <p>\u201cCome on Ayden; tell me what\u2019s going on with you lately. I know I\u2019ve been wrapped up in my own nonsense but I can see the change in you. You look so sad all the time and that\u2019s just not like you.\u201d</p><p>Her whiskey toned gaze shifted from one side to another before settling on the table between us. She set her coffee down and traced the rim of the cup with her finger.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I mean I know but not really.\u201d I just watched her because I wasn\u2019t sure what she was talking about. \u201cI used to think I had it all figured out school, boys, my future, all of it. I knew that coming from nothing and no one didn\u2019t matter because I was on the right track and I was going to be something great and now I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night at the rock bar, the night I had Jet take me home I practically threw myself at him.\u201d I saw her flinch a little. \u201cHe was polite enough about it all but said I wasn\u2019t really his type and that nice girls like me deserved better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that seems chivalrous and nice of him, not life altering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing Shaw, I\u2019m a nice girl now but you have no idea about the life I lived before I moved to Colorado. When I was in Kentucky I was out of control. I partied, messed around in all kinds of bad stuff, played around with too many guys and I was a mess inside and out. It took a miracle to get me into this school and away from all of that but part of me is still that girl and when Jet turned me down it just made both parts of me go a little sideways. He\u2019s cute and in a band, I was mad, really mad when he rejected me on the basis of being a good girl, that\u2019s just not who I think I want to be. I\u2019ve been struggling with it ever since.\u201d</p><p>I set my coffee down and looked at her out of narrowed eyes. \u201cYou let a guy get all up in your head after one brief encounter? That doesn\u2019t sound like you at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was something about this guy, Shaw. I don\u2019t know what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyden you\u2019re amazing. I don\u2019t care what your life was like before because now you\u2019re loyal and kind, you make me laugh, you\u2019re smarter than practically anyone I know, you\u2019re ridiculously beautiful and we both know that there have been times in the last couple of years that the only thing holding me together was you. I\u2019ve meet Jet a few times and he is nice and definitely a babe but he\u2019s also a rock and roll guy that comes with legions of rock and roll groupies fawning all over him so whatever moment you had with him is not worth this mopey, self-doubt he seems to have spawned in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis from the girl that pinned over her guy in silence for almost a full decade?\u201d Her sarcasm was biting but well deserved.</p><p>\u201cYes and look how miserable and lonely it made me. All I\u2019m saying is that if a guy can\u2019t appreciate you for how wonderful you are then he isn\u2019t worth it and if he doesn\u2019t want to sully your good image, whether it is real or not then I hate to say it but that just sounds like maybe he wasn\u2019t interested. You are pretty country and he is pretty rock I mean I know I\u2019ve been drowning in opposites attract and all that stupid nonsense for my whole life with Rule but maybe they really don\u2019t and you just weren\u2019t his type. I\u2019ve seen the girls that gravitate to these guys when they go out, heck I\u2019ve walked in on Rule with them over and over again and trust me big brains, self-confidence and ambition are not things these women bring to the table.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled loudly. \u201cMaybe. It just made me wonder about what I\u2019m doing. I date, I have a pretty good time, I love living with you and I\u2019m awesome at school but I feel like something is missing and when I see your super-hot, half-dressed boyfriend covered in tattoos looking all sleepy and satisfied I get a little burn near my heart that hurts. I think I\u2019m lonely and not for something casual and simple. Trust me I had plenty of that when I was younger.\u201d</p><p>I laughed a little and scraped off some of the foam of my drink with my finger and popped it in my mouth. I think the table of geeks gasped but I wasn\u2019t sure because when I looked back up at them they were all frantically typing away on their laptops.</p><p>\u201cSo you pick a heavy metal singer to get all mushy and sentimental over? Man we\u2019ve got marvelous taste in men.\u201d</p><p>She laughed with me and leaned back to cross her long legs at the ankle. \u201cI think it\u2019ll probably fade away but in the mean time I need to get my head around moving forward without totally forgetting who I am, I mean look at you. You\u2019re not suddenly covered head to toe in ink and sporting a face full of extreme piercings. You took all the parts of Rule\u2019s make your own rules philosophy and used it mellow out and take control of your own destiny not turn into a new you.\u201d</p><p>She was partly right. I figured it was probably too much information to tell her I had been seriously considering getting my nipples pierced. Rule was always telling me how sensitive they were, how easy it was to get me turned on and all worked up and ready to blow by just playing with them and after having intimate contact on a repeated basis with someone that had piercings through strategic parts of their anatomy I knew exactly how the little pieces of jewelry could enhance the experience. It had always been Rule for me so I didn\u2019t know what it was like to be with anyone that didn\u2019t have barbells in their cock and through their tongue, but as good as it was with him I had no desire to find out how it was with someone unadorned. I didn\u2019t want them for him, I wanted them for me but I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready to commit to something that big yet.</p><p>\u201cHe influences me, he always has but I don\u2019t want to be with someone that only wants to be with me just to change me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and neither would I. I think when I left home I had the idea that if I didn\u2019t change I was just going to be stuck in that endless rut forever and somehow I lost everything, even the good stuff about the pre-Denver Ayden.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and squeezed the hand she had resting on the table. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just entering a new phase, maybe this isn\u2019t new Ayden or old Ayden but a excellent new incantation of both. You\u2019re fine, whoever and whatever you want to be is just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope so. So have you seen or heard anything from Gabe?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and kicked back in the seat. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve seen him on campus coming and going but he keeps his distance. Rule\u2019s retired cop friend says he heard that Judge Davenport wasn\u2019t happy to have his son\u2019s name come up in open court so maybe he put a leash on him. The guys have been really good about keeping me close so I don\u2019t think he has the nerve to go up against Rule or Rome and I\u2019m purposely avoiding all contact with my parents so if he\u2019s trying to enlist them it isn\u2019t doing him any good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your long term plan? Rome has to go back to playing solider soon and as much as I\u2019m sure Rule likes keeping you close eventually it\u2019s gotta get old. The honeymoon phase won\u2019t last forever.\u201d</p><p>I was worried about that myself. Right now he seemed to like hanging out at the bar and didn\u2019t seem to mind juggling our hectic schedules back and forth to see each other and to keep his eye on me, but I agreed with her that it couldn\u2019t last much longer.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do. If the legal system can\u2019t help and my own parents are working against me to keep him off my back I just don\u2019t know. I wish he would just find another girl that is socially acceptable and forget about me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either but I\u2019m glad you aren\u2019t trying to handle this all on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good for me. I feel like my life is finally my own with him in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told him that you\u2019re in love with him and have been for eternity yet?\u201d</p><p>I gulped down some of my drink and it went down the wrong tube. I hacked for a second until tears filled my eyes. \u201cNo! Are you nuts? Why would I do that? He already knows that I\u2019ve had a crush on him since forever and I think just that weirds him out. I don\u2019t want to put all kinds of pressure on him to feel the same about me. He wants to be together and he\u2019s making a true and honest effort to be in this relationship with me and for now that\u2019s good enough.\u201d</p> <p>She clicked her tongue at me and waved a finger back and forth. \u201cIf you think you hide the way you feel about him at all you\u2019re so wrong. The feelings you have for that boy radiate out of you like a bright light. He has to see it every time he looks at you.\u201d</p><p>I fiddled nervously with the ends of my hair. \u201cWell he\u2019s never said anything about it and that\u2019s just fine by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so silly. You\u2019ve been in love with this guy since you were a teenager and now you have him and you\u2019re still worried about being open and honest with him? It just seems to me like you wouldn\u2019t want to waste any more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Rule we\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s unpredictable and doesn\u2019t deal with emotions in a typical way. I don\u2019t want to scare him off by getting too intense too quickly. I\u2019ve seen what he does to people that push him and it isn\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth I think he\u2019s just as sprung on you as you are on him. That glow you have well he has it too just in a darker, slightly more confused way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell that\u2019s nice to hear. I don\u2019t know that I believe it but still it\u2019s a nice thought.\u201d</p><p>We spent another hour and one more coffee each catching up. We talked about school and I told her a little about Margot\u2019s breakdown when Rule went to get my car. We talked about work and how ridiculous Loren seemed to be every time she opened her mouth and we made plans to go shopping the following weekend after another trip to the salon. By the time we were done it was too early for dinner and she had to run to get ready for work. We left on a hug which I\u2019m pretty sure caused the tabled of geeks to spontaneously break into juvenile erection territory and I headed up to Capitol Hill. Since I was off and Rome was back in the Springs for another checkup I had promised Rule I would meet him at the tattoo shop and wait until he was done with his last client.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been in the shop during business hours so when I pushed open the door I was slightly taken aback at how busy it was. There was a girl behind the counter with super short hair bleached out as white as mine and spiked up all over the place. She was answering the phone, handling the people milling about the waiting area and pointing perspective clients in the directions of the appropriate portfolios. There were three other artists set up in the stations not filled by Nash, Rowdy and Rule. I noticed one of them was a very pretty girl with black and green hair that looked like something out of a comic book. There were also six clients in varying positions getting various designs and making various noises and looks of discomfort that had their friend\u2019s and the artist\u2019s laughing and making light hearted comments. Against Me! Was blasting over the sound system and the entire vibe was energetic and exciting. I couldn\u2019t fathom how anyone earned such a good living in such a crazy environment, but it seemed to suit Rule\u2019s personality to a tee.</p><p>I stood unsure in the doorway for a full minute just taking it all in until I was jostled to the side by a girl in too tight pants and disgusting Uggs. Her hair was teased up and I could see she had swirling sleeves of ink under her super tiny t-shirt and I guess she was good looking in a trashy, desperate kind of way but the girl behind the counter apparently had no time for whatever she was asking for because her voice, loud and clear with a hint of an East Coast burr told her none to graciously to \u201cFuck off Liza. I already told you over the phone that he was booked up for the next two weeks and he has no interest in working late to touch your shit up.\u201d</p><p>The girl mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and leaned over the counter. The receptionist or whatever her title was rolled her eyes dramatically. \u201cLook let me break this down for you; he is not interested in you. You are a client, you give him money to tattoo you not date you and not to flirt with you. He\u2019s busy and I mean busy so if you want work done you will get put in the book like everyone else and come in for your scheduled appointment. Besides he\u2019s got a girlfriend now and has no interest in the little ink bunnies anymore.\u201d</p><p>I blinked rapidly in surprise when I realized she was more than likely talking about Rule and that I was more than likely the girlfriend she was referring to. How strange was that? The girl continued to have a little bit of a fit until it became clear she wasn\u2019t going to get past the blond fireball to get to the artists. She shoved past me on the way out the door and immediately a clean cut college guy took her place at the desk. He made his appointment with no fuss and I continued to watch the ebb and flow business for a while until the girl\u2019s attention finally landed on me.</p> <p>\u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d She wasn\u2019t exactly friendly, more like matter of fact so I started a little bit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just waiting for someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you can have a seat over there if you\u2019re waiting for a client.\u201d</p><p>I tucked my hair behind my ears and cocked my head to the side and regarded her carefully. \u201cI\u2019m actually waiting for Rule.\u201d</p><p>Now that she was looking at me I could see she had really unusual colored eyes, one was dark brown and the other was a swirl of green and blue. She gave a really heavy sigh and narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cLike I told the other tattoo tramp, Rule is busy. If you want to see him you have to have an appointment just like every other client.\u201d</p><p>I snickered against my will. \u201cTattoo Tramp? Is that what you call them?\u201d</p><p>She seemed surprised by my question. \u201cYeah. You have no idea how many poor girls are walking around this town with stupid lower back tattoos just because they wanted to pull their pants down for one of the guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I would totally believe it.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned her elbows on the counter and sized me up and down. \u201cWhat did you say your name was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t but then again you didn\u2019t ask. I\u2019m Shaw, I\u2019m not a tramp of any persuasion and I don\u2019t have any tattoos so neither of those things applies to me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I said my name her jaw dropped open and she shoved off the big leather chair she was sitting on. Her wicked colored eyes went wide and she smacked her hands down hard on the marble surface separating us.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit you\u2019re Shaw? You\u2019re freaking real? Unbelievable! Guys Rule\u2019s girl is here and she\u2019s like an actual girl with an actual brain. Un-freaking-believable. The terrible trio have been talking about you for weeks and I just didn\u2019t believe it but here you really are.\u201d</p><p>Like something out of a movie all eyes in the shop suddenly swiveled up to where I was standing. I had spent plenty of time with Nash and Rowdy over the last few week so they both just offered up brief \u201cheys\u201d and went back to what they were working on. Rule\u2019s look turned my insides out and he gave me a wink before saying something to the kid he was working on and sitting back to wipe the excess ink off. The other three artists stared at me openly which would have made me super uncomfortable but the blond had sprinted around the counter and was now standing right in front of me. She was almost the same height as me but weighed a good thirty pounds less, somehow though her wild hair made her look taller and it was hard to believe that loud voice came out of such a tiny package. She was like a punk rock pixie.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how long I\u2019ve waited for one of those guys to land a serious girlfriend? Forever! Sending away the ink bunnies has never been as satisfying as it is now and I never ever would have pegged Rule as the one to go down first.\u201d She waved a hand over her shoulder at the opposite side of the shop where the three artists I didn\u2019t know were working and pointed to each one. \u201cBixie, she\u2019s married to a firefighter so she\u2019s never caused to much fuss with weirdo client stalkers, Mase has an on and off girlfriend so he can behave but when they\u2019re off he can give Rule a run for his money in the man-whore department, Jasper, well we call him Jaz keeps his liaisons all quiet and secret because he\u2019s got ties with the Kings of Sorrow the local biker club and apparently that\u2019s supposed to be hush-hush so the bunnies don\u2019t hover around for him too much, but the terrible trio, man oh man I show those bitches outta here all day every day and even with Rule being hooked up with you it still seems like that\u2019s my full time job.\u201d</p><p>She talked so loud and so fast I had a hard time tracking everything she was telling me, plus Rule had snapped off his gloves and was prowling towards me in the way that made my legs go all gooey. He moved with a limber ease that was just sexy and confident, also his hair was starting to grow back in and I liked the near black fuzz covering his scalp.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling my girl stories Cora? I told you Shaw\u2019s been around for a long time you aren\u2019t going to be able to scare her.\u201d He came around the corner and before I could get myself all worried about whether it was appropriate to touch him at work he had me all wound up with his hands in my hair and his mouth slanted across mine. He tasted like coffee and peppermint; he also didn\u2019t seem to mind that all eyes remained on us while he thoroughly devoured me, like we hadn\u2019t seen each other in weeks rather than just this morning. He gave his tongue one last flick, clicking his tongue ring against the back of my teeth. When he pulled away I\u2019m sure my eyes were glassy and I was breathing hard. I cleared my throat and put a shaky hand on his chest until I regained my composure. \u201cI\u2019ve got like a half an hour left are you cool to hangout that long? You can come chill in the back and do your school shit or whatever.\u201d I nodded and took a step back from him. He was potent and went to my head fast.</p><p>\u201cNo stay up here and hangout with me. I\u2019m dying to know all about this mystical creature that got you to act human for once.\u201d</p><p>He shot an annoyed glance over his shoulder at the pixie. \u201cShaw this is Cora Lewis. She\u2019s the shop manager and our resident body modification expert.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled her eyebrows up and down and gave me a leer. She twirled a finger in Rule\u2019s direction. \u201cSince you\u2019re with this guy I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with my work.\u201d</p><p>I choked back a laugh and put a hand to my mouth as a hot flush worked up Rule\u2019s neck. \u201cSeriously Cora?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged a tiny shoulder. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s true isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His arctic eyes landed back on me and the chagrin in them made me laugh out loud. \u201cShe\u2019s from Brooklyn. None of us know where Uncle Phil found her and they refuse to tell us but she keeps the shop running like a well-oiled machine. Most of us wouldn\u2019t know if we were coming or going without her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can stay up here and wait for you. I\u2019m hungry though so you need to feed me when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>He bent down and put his lips right next to my ear. \u201cOh I\u2019ll feed you when I\u2019m done alright.\u201d</p><p>A hot shiver shot through me so I gave him a heavy lidded look. \u201cGoody.\u201d He kissed my cheek and made his way back to the waiting client. I shifted my gaze to Cora and blushed when I noticed she was gaining like a demented Cheshire Cat.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like is it?\u201d</p> <p>I blinked and shifted from foot to foot. She grabbed my hand and pulled me around the counter actually shoving me into another leather chair that was stashed back there.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>She swiveled her chair so we were facing each other and gave me a level look. \u201cIt\u2019s like all hot and bothered but sweet and fuzzy too. I didn\u2019t know the asshat had any of that in him. You make him human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the second time she had mentioned something like that but I had to wait until she fielded a couple phone calls to question her about it. \u201cWhat do you mean about that exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with Rule for the last five years. I was here when he and Nash started their internship right outta high school. Phil and I go way back so I\u2019ve known the boys for a while. I adore Rule. I think it\u2019s genetically impossible not to be kind of in love with him when you come equipped with a vagina. It\u2019s just something about all that angsty, moody swagger he has that makes you want to cuddle him up and make him feel better.\u201d</p> <p>I knew exactly what she was talking about so I just nodded in agreement. \u201cBut he\u2019s also arrogant and explosive, he treats women like crap because too many of them let him get away with it and for a long time after his brother died I watched him just go through the motions of living his life the way it was before. He came to work, he hung out with is boys, he gave me shit on a daily basis and he screwed his way through the entire Front Range but he was doing it all locked inside this bubble that none of us who loved him could get through. He was cold and unreachable but then all of a sudden there were cracks and some of the old Rule was showing through. The robot version of himself he had been operating from for so long started to fade and the good ole human Rule was back and I think it has to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really nice thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nice if it\u2019s the truth. So tell me how a vanilla girl like you all virgin skin and no piercings gets into a guy like Rule. From first appearances I would never peg him as your type; you look more Brooks Brothers than Dickies if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>I twirled a piece of hair around my finger and watched as she typed a bunch of stuff in the computer. She was freakishly efficient and fast and I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to talk about how sexy I found Rule with someone that already had intimate knowledge of my boyfriend\u2019s junk.</p><p>\u201cWhen he was sixteen he came home one day with an awful tattoo of a horseshoe and a shamrock on his forearm. Phil had given Nash a tattoo machine and some ink for his sixteenth birthday and instead of trying to learn on pigs or melons they decided that they would try to learn on each other. Both of them were always really gifted artistically. Nash was more into street art and graffiti type stuff where Rule just fiddled around with it and happened to learn he had some real talent. Anyway I was over at his house and I don\u2019t know if you ever got a chance to meet Remy but identical doesn\u2019t even come close to how those two looked. The same eyes, the same dark hair, the same innate sense that they were out of this world good looking but Rule came home with that terrible tattoo and suddenly he was a new guy. He claimed his skin as his own, made the mark to define who he was and how he was different from Remy and it was just beautiful how much he loved what changing his outer appearance did for his inner sense of self. He\u2019s always been a babe but when he started to customize the hotness it just made it better and better. Without all the tattoos and piercings he just wouldn\u2019t be Rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you? You\u2019re not into any of it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know. I had really particular parents growing up and if I had come home with a tattoo or any kind of extreme piercing they would have grounded me until graduation so I never even thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just turned twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still live at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t you be allowed to do whatever you want with your body without fear of their reaction?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and swiveled my chair back and forth. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ve actually been thinking about getting a little something done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tattoo? You know Rule would give you something beautiful especially since he\u2019s the one that would have to look at it all the time.\u201d</p> <p>We shared a laugh that had the guys in the shop looking at us curiously.</p><p>\u201cNo I was thinking about getting my nipples pierced.\u201d I wasn\u2019t normally so open but I figured since she did it for a living it was kind of like talking to a doctor about a health problem. Her unusual colored eyed widened and she gave me a huge grin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s super-hot.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and continued to twirl my hair. \u201cI like the way it looks and like you said I\u2019m familiar with your work so I know it can be awesome I just don\u2019t know that I\u2019m ready for something so extreme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey take a bit to heal but when they do it\u2019s amazing. If you decide to go through with it let me know and I\u2019ll do it for you for free, I\u2019ll just charge you for the jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell Rule\u2019s birthday is next month so if I do it it\u2019ll be before then.\u201d</p><p>She clapped her hands together and giggled like a little girl. She was kind of crazy but I think I liked her. I had always had such a hard time making friends and just being at ease around new people it was a testament to all the positive ways Rule was influencing me that I could talk with this wacky girl with no reservations or inhibitions.</p><p>\u201cOh a sexy surprise I just love that idea. Like I said just let me know and we can work something out, I like seeing my boys happy and doing right by a good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I think.\u201d</p><p>We chatted easily for another hour because whatever Rule was working on was taking him longer than he thought. I watched her process out the clients that were finished getting their designs done and watched her help a few people come in that had questions and were interested in setting up consultations. She chased off another girl that came in looking for Rowdy this time and by the time Rule walked up to the counter with his freshly bandaged canvas I felt like I had made a new friend. She was sarcastic and witty as hell but her insights into the way my guy\u2019s head worked was clear and coming from a different perspective than I had ever heard before.</p><p>Rule\u2019s client looked like he was barely old enough to drive but he was sporting some major artwork and had his entire upper arm wrapped up and shiny with ink and salve. I didn\u2019t miss the appreciative look he gave me as he was walking out and apparently neither did Rule. He flicked the kid in the back of the head and told him that if he wanted his sleeve finished he better keep his eyes to himself. He told me to give him just ten more minutes so he could clean up his station and then we could go. I watched him walk away and noticed that the female client Nash was working on and the young girl that the artist they called Mase was working on both did the same thing. Cora was right, it was just some kind of magnetic pull he had over the opposite sex and as long as I was with him I was just going to have to learn to deal with it.</p><p>He moved quick and came back to collect me in no time at all. He handed Cora a bank bag and hollered out goodbye to no one in particular and pulled me out with him into the now frigid evening air. I shivered involuntarily and huddled into his side while he adjusted the hood of his sweatshirt over his still mostly naked head and shoved his arms through the sleeves of a black mechanic style work coat that had the tattoo shop\u2019s logo and name embroidered in a bright design on the back.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to order something for delivery or go somewhere?\u201d He rubbed his hands together roughly and then pushed them under the fall of my hair to clasp the back of my neck. They felt like blocks of ice so I shivered even harder until he pulled me to his chest and tucked my head under his chin.</p><p>\u201cDelivery so I don\u2019t have to move my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool what are you in the mood for I\u2019ll call on the way home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything really I\u2019m just hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure but no green peppers or mushrooms on my half.\u201d</p><p>I hooked an arm through his and gingerly tried to keep up with his long strides as we made our way to the Victorian. My phone vibrated in my pocket and I frowned as I saw it was once again my father. I was sure whatever story my mother had spun about my last visit had him all riled up but I just didn\u2019t have the patience to get a lecture from a guy who\u2019s new wife was only a few years older than me on morality and suitable romantic partners. I sent the call to voicemail and let go of Rule to sidestep a particularly dangerous and icy patch on the side walk.</p><p>He scowled at me and snatched my hand back up. He tugged me around so that I was pressed up against his front while he walked forward and guided me backwards. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you fall.\u201d</p><p>I reached up to put my hands on his shoulders and gazed up into eyes that were just as frosty as the snow coating the ground all around us. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not all the time?\u201d We stopped at the front of the Victorian and I moved my hands from his shoulders to the back of his neck which made his hood fall off.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never trusted anyone all the time. It\u2019s the people I care about the most that always seem to do the most damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be one of those people Shaw.\u201d If only he knew how bad it had hurt my heart each time I had to see him with one of his conquests he wouldn\u2019t be saying that. I forced a small smile and brushed my fingers over the soft black hair starting to grow on his head.</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head and hauled me inside because it was way too cold to keep messing around outside. He shrugged out of his coat and hoodie while motioning for me to hand my stuff over. \u201cNash has a date tonight so he won\u2019t be home until later if at all.\u201d He disappeared down the hall to drop his armful in his room and came back on the phone with the pizza place. I took down a couple plates and handed him a beer while looking in a futile attempt to see if the boys had anything in the fridge to make a salad with. I needed to get some normal food in this place if I was going to keep spending time here or I was going to end up the size of a baby hippo.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s probably done with having me around in the man-zone. I know Ayden mentioned that she almost got an eyeful while you were over this morning. They\u2019re undoubtedly sick of us.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and took a chug out of the beer bottle. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to surprise Ayden this morning but I thought she was gone. I didn\u2019t know she just went running.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah she goes every morning and it\u2019s not like she was complaining in fact she complimented the view.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cNash doesn\u2019t mind having you here he likes that you actually cook and that we don\u2019t have to get delivery or bring stuff home every single night. Plus you smell good and always pick up the random stuff we leave laying around. If having you here got on his nerves he would say something to me and more than likely to you as well. He has no problem letting Rome know when he has over stayed his welcome.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back against the counter and twisted the cap off a bottle of water. \u201cSo Cora was telling me all about your ink bunnies or tattoo trollops as she calls them. I had no idea just how far your appeal reached. Girls got work that they aren\u2019t going to love in ten years just to spend time with you. That\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCora has a big mouth and exaggerates but getting tattooed is pretty intimate no matter who the client is. When they leave they\u2019re leaving with something you put on their skin forever. They trust you to capture their vision and execute it perfectly so sometimes that means you have to invest in them as a person to some degree. Some girl\u2019s especially younger ones get really wrapped up in the process and turn it into more than it is. I have my fair share of clients that have little crushes on me, that come back for work not because I\u2019m awesome but because they want to spend time in the setting but it\u2019s my job so I keep it professional. I\u2019m not going to lie I\u2019ve hooked up with a client or two but never after work or never while I was in the process of doing a piece. Sex and work don\u2019t belong in the same place.\u201d</p> <p>I sucked back some of the water and mulled that over for a minute. \u201cDoes it bother you that I don\u2019t look like the typical girls you find attractive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I hopped up on the counter and let my legs dangle. I tapped the tip of my nails on the tiled surface and cocked my head to the side while I studied him closely. \u201cI don\u2019t have tattoos or piercings. I don\u2019t have sex hair or wear clothes that are impossible to breathe in, I\u2019m just you know, a normal girl and I\u2019ve seen enough, been around enough of your morning after\u2019s to know that I\u2019m not what you typically gravitate towards and I just wonder if when you look at me you wonder if I could look better if I looked different. Looked more like you and your crew.\u201d</p><p>He put the beer down on the dining room table and locked eyes with me while he stalked towards me. Before that would have made me nervous and panicky but now it made me get all warm and breathless. He didn\u2019t stop until he was pressed right up against me, between my legs with our hips aligned in a perfect position to make me forget my own name.</p><p>\u201cWhen I look at you I don\u2019t see anything but you and Shaw, you are perfect. I don\u2019t care what color your hair is, if you\u2019re pale or tan, if you have makeup on or just woke up all I care about is that when I look at you, you always look back and see me. You\u2019re beautiful inside and out and if you wanted to tattoo all that pretty white skin from head to toe I would be honored to put it there for you but if not I\u2019ll take you all smooth and milky white any chance I get.\u201d</p> <p>It was heart wrenchingly romantic. It was the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever said to me and I was about to go all weepy female on him and blubber out how wonderful everything he said was and how much he meant to me, well either that or I was going to yank his clothes off and have at him right there in the kitchen. I was waffling between the two reactions when the doorbell rang and shattered the mood. He pushed away from me and went to collect dinner. I took a minute to get my composure back. The boy was potent all right and I planned to enjoy every single minute that it was directed at me.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Rule</p><p>There were a few moments over the last week that had been so perfect, so poignant that they literally froze me with fear and made me want to run the other way as fast and as far as I could get. Sitting on the couch in my living room eating pizza and knocking back a few cold ones while I watched Sports Center and she messed around on her computer doing school work was one of them. Watching her just be had me suddenly feeling like I was suffocating in the rightness of it all and I had to escape to a burning hot shower before I did something stupid like ask her to marry me or tell her to take a hike. She just fit, she filled every hole I had in my life and the idea of her not being there, of it going away terrified me like nothing I had ever felt before. I didn\u2019t want to rely on her, didn\u2019t want to build a mountain out of what might just be an early in the relationship infatuation but there was something there that made me think if this all went away because of something I did or because she suddenly woke up and realized how much better she could do that I would never be the same.</p><p>The last few weeks had been amazing. I liked having her in my house and in my life and I enjoyed making a place for myself in hers. My friends all adored her and I think had tiny little crushes on her because she was just so oblivious to her appeal that it was endearing and hard not to fall for. I could tell when we left the shop that Cora was a fan and that meant a lot because she was kind of like a big sister and I trusted her instincts when it came to people. It was why she was such a good shop manager. Shaw was already part of my family and after I had given her the rundown of what went down on my visit home she had wasted no time in firing of a scathing email to mother letting her know that in no uncertain terms was she going to stand for that behavior and vehemently asking her to seek help. She had my back and not for the first time I wondered how long she had been fighting for me and I hadn\u2019t noticed. It always made me feel like shit.</p><p>The quiet moments were settling and made me feel like I was building a foundation to something great and the passionate moments, the moments where she looked at me like I was a present she had always wanted to unwrap were enough to make me think I had found the one person that would never bore me in bed. The thing about being the only guy she had ever been with was that I got to teach her everything and Shaw had always been an A+ student. Whether it was fast or slow, gentle or rough, a quickie that blew my mind or an all-night session that had her running late for class the next morning there was no doubt that we were sexually compatible. She was starting to figure out her own preferences, like the fact she liked it a little rougher and more dirty than I would have figured her to but she also somehow managed to find humor in the act when it was awkward or not going the way one of us intended and I couldn\u2019t remember ever having as much fun in bed in my life. I didn\u2019t know it was possible but she even made sex better and the thought of any of it or all of it going away just made me want to fall into a hole and never climb out.</p> <p>I was trying to shake off the fear after all it was just a nice night at home and Nash was gone so I should be doing my best to make her scream my name over and over again at the top of her lungs but the doubt lingered and I stayed in the shower until the water ran frigid and cold forcing me out. I ran a fuzzy towel over my head and face and secured another one loosely around my waist. I left my clothes in a heap on the floor and wandered into my room figuring she would still be out in the living room doing her homework and I would have a couple more minutes to get my shit together only the TV was off and she was sitting in the middle of my big bed sipping on the beer I had abandoned when I bolted earlier. As if that wasn\u2019t enough she was only wearing my T-shirt that had the tattoo parlors logo on it. It looked better on her than it ever had on me and she was watching me with very serious eyes the color of new grass.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat and tried to play it off. \u201cNothing. Why?\u201d Only this was Shaw and she knew my bullshit better than almost anyone. She scooted to the edge of the bed and set the beer down on the night stand.</p><p>\u201cBecause you were in there forever and you already took a shower this morning. Something spooked you and you ran I want to know what it was.\u201d</p><p>I considered lying to her, considered telling her that she was just imagining things but in the end knew that I just needed to come clean and hope that she didn\u2019t freak out because I was so emotionally screwed up.</p><p>\u201cAll this,\u201d I waved a hand between the two of us. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy, so basic and thoughtless that sometimes it freaks me out. I\u2019m not used to normal and ordinary so it makes me nervous. My life was always about trying to grab onto fleeting moments of pleasure, of feeling good and now I have that all the time with you and I get lost in my head wondering what I\u2019m going to do to screw it up or how I\u2019m going to keep it together if you decide to take it away. Sometimes I get sucked into my visions of what could happen and I have a really difficult time staying in the present. Watching TV with you, just being with you sooths something inside me that I didn\u2019t even know needed soothing but it also makes something in there cower in fear. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She just watched me and I prepared myself for her to get up off the bed and walk out the door. If she did I was pretty sure towel or not I would chase her into the cold and beg until she came back. Instead she unfolded from the bed and came up to me on bare feet. My shirt covered all the good stuff but just barely. She stopped so that we weren\u2019t touching but we were close enough to share breath.</p><p>\u201cIt scares me too Rule. I\u2019m not used to ordinary either and I never thought I would have that with you, never thought I would have anything with you at all so it\u2019s okay to get a little lost in your head as long as you come back and we can talk about it. I\u2019m not going to ask you to give anything you aren\u2019t comfortable with. People have done that to me my entire life and I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d</p> <p>I exhaled a hard breath and unclenched the fists I hadn\u2019t been aware I had curled up at my sides.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I ask you to give me everything Shaw, what if I want it all? Won\u2019t that make me just like all the rest of them?\u201d</p><p>She made a noise in her throat and then broke into a smile that nearly killed me on the spot she was just so lovely and pure. \u201cNo because you don\u2019t have to ask for anything, all of it is already yours. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve ever wanted to give it to.\u201d This girl was going to be the end of me. She put a hand on each of my sides, one splayed over the angel one splayed over the reaper and I thought my heart was going to pound out of my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise not to bail on me when I get lost, Shaw. You have to promise to just wait it out until I can find my way back. I need to know you\u2019re at the end of the tunnel when everything goes black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to wait for you Rule and I don\u2019t mind doing it as long as you promise not to shut me out. I can\u2019t do this with you, be so wrapped up in you and what\u2019s happening between us if you\u2019re going to close the door on me when it gets to be too much. My heart can\u2019t take that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But I wasn\u2019t sure that was a promise I could keep. My default was to return to what I knew and that was distance and space so that I could protect myself. \u201cI can do my best Shaw but I told you all along I\u2019m not real sure how to do this whole relationship thing and I\u2019m scared shitless I\u2019m going to do something to screw it up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned forward and let her hands glide up around my back and across my shoulders. She pressed a soft, open mouthed kiss to the center of my chest and it made my entire life zero in on that tiny point of contact.</p><p>\u201cWell you can be scared alone or we can be scared together. I prefer the second option but if you need some space to get your head around it and figure out what you want I can make that happen. I want to be with you Rule, but I\u2019m not going to be here with you if it makes you hurt and makes you freak out. We both deserve better than that.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure at this point it was about what I deserved or not but I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to let what I had with her get demolished under the weight of doubt I couldn\u2019t control. I finally reached out and pulled her to me in a suffocating hug that pressed all her length against all my bare skin. I had spent plenty of time with her this morning, making her beg, turning myself inside out but that didn\u2019t seem to matter, my cock reacted under the towel letting her know that whatever was going on inside my head had no bearing on how my body felt about her. \u201cI\u2019m just messed up Shaw. I\u2019m sorry that I get this way but the last thing I want is to chase my tail all alone.\u201d I kissed her, letting her feel the things I couldn\u2019t say as they burned through my blood. I wanted her always and the idea of that made my knees weak.</p><p>She let me devour her mouth, let me get my hands all tangled up rough in her hair, let me press her up against the closest wall and press an insistent erection against her all without complaint or argument. There was no gentleness, no concern for skill or whether or not I was making it feel good for her, all that existed was a blinding need to get inside her, to make her feel the emotion that was making me go crazy. I needed to syphon off some of the want and need and the only way to do it was to get it out of me and into her. Her head made a dull thunk against the wall and I felt her suck in a tense breath and still none of it gave me pause. The towel hit the floor and my t-shirt offered no resistance as I rushed through getting both of us naked. Somewhere in my head I knew I needed to slow down, needed to get control back that my hands were too hard on her, that my mouth was going to leave marks but I couldn\u2019t pull it in.</p><p>She whispered my name, tried to get me to slow down but I didn\u2019t care. I was ready to just move in her, to burry all the fear and uncertainty blindly inside her warm body but this was a girl that knew all my tricks, knew that I was operating from a place where I probably wouldn\u2019t even remember what I was doing in the morning and she wasn\u2019t going to let me turn her into another faceless conquest that I used to find silence. Since I no longer had hair and was so much bigger than her she had to resort to digging her nails into my scalp and pressing her teeth down on my invading tongue to get me to jerk back and give her some breathing room. She struggled to catch her breath and pushed away from the wall by planting her hands in the center of my chest and giving me a hard shove.</p><p>I stumbled back a step and shook my head back and forth. \u201cCasper,\u201d I wanted to apologize, wanted to tell her I would never devalue all that she was coming to mean to me on purpose but she didn\u2019t give me a chance. She stood up on her tiptoes and put a small hand over my mouth. Her green eyes were big and there was a mixture of desire and trepidation in them that twisted my heart into a knot. This girl just simply understood me and wasn\u2019t going to blame me for all the crazy that I had built up inside of me.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t, Rule.\u201d She moved her hand and kissed me with a million more levels of care than I had just shown her. \u201cYou need me to take care of you right now so I\u2019m going to do it but I\u2019ll be damned if you don\u2019t know its me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s you Shaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood because for a minute there I wasn\u2019t sure and I can\u2019t even being to tell you how much that pissed me off. Now shut up and let me help you out of the dark.\u201d</p><p>I went to grab for her, to wrap her up and hold her close but she evaded my hands and slithered around so that she was on her knees in front of me. I stopped breathing for a second when her lips landed somewhere below my navel and my abs contracted hard enough that it hurt. We had messed around plenty but this wasn\u2019t and area she had seemed ready to venture into before now. My dick quivered in anticipation as the tip of her tongue traced the outline of the mermaid I had inked down there where the long tail curled right around the base of my cock. I didn\u2019t know how far she was willing to take it so I gingerly placed my hands on the top of her head. Her hair felt like silk against my fingertips and I stop moving just in case anything I did was going to make her stop.</p><p>\u201cShaw.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to ask her to keep going or to stop because I wasn\u2019t sure how much I could take. I felt wound up too tight and too ready to break as it was. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d I meant it when I said it but I also knew there was a good chance I would die if she decided to stop. Her mouth was damp and warm and the apadravya piercing I had through the tip of my dick and the Jacob\u2019s ladder that was spaced out on the underside pulled the sensitive skin taunt when she closed it over the eager flesh. My eyes squeezed shut as I hit the back of her throat and every sensation I had ever experienced up to this point in my life ceased to exist.</p><p>I had received head from a bunch of different girls in my lifetime, had enjoyed it pretty much every single time but there was something about having Shaw on her knees before me, having her suck and pull me into her pretty mouth that made this experience better than all the rest. I was breathing hard and my knees were suddenly feeling like they weren\u2019t going to hold me up anymore. My cock throbbed in time to my heartbeat and flesh that was sensitive suddenly felt to tight and ready to split into pieces. I didn\u2019t have the words to encourage her or to tell her what I liked and didn\u2019t like, not that it mattered because just like with everything else we did in the dark she seemed to have a natural aptitude for it. She played with my piercings, her quick little tongue darting in and around metal that heated and cooled as she moved her mouth around it. I sucked in a breath and tried to stave off the impending orgasm but there was no controlling it. I gasped her name in warning, tried to tug at her long hair to let her know that she might want to get out of firing range but she wasn\u2019t having any of it. She finished me off like a champ, placed a kiss on my quivering stomach while I tried to get my mind back in working order and glided to her feet in all her naked glory. She lifted a blond brow and flipped her now tangled and messy hair over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always take care of you Rule, in fact I like doing it because it makes me happy and it feels good but I\u2019m not ever going to let you use me to work out your demons like you did with all those girls that came before me so you better learn the difference.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer her because she was right so instead I picked her up by the waist and tossed her on the bed. I didn\u2019t need to give her time to get ready for me I was pretty sure that working me over better than anyone ever had, had done a good job of turning her on and making her wet and slippery. Her folds were already slick and ready for whatever I had to give. When I moved inside I made sure the top ball of my piercing rubbed against her most sensitive parts. Now that we had sex with nothing between us I knew even if I wasn\u2019t particularly stellar in the sack that having all that jewelry down there could and would create a sensation that got her off regardless, not that I didn\u2019t always make it my goal to make her lose her mind. She hooked her legs up around my hips as I moved in and out of her and let her eyes fall at half-mast. I was braced up above her and her hands were wrapped around my biceps. I was pretty sure I could die a happy man having her look up like that at me, with having her moan and writhe beneath me as pleasure shot through her body and made it clench around mine. I had never really given much thought to monogamy and committing to having sex with only one person over and over again because I had never really seen that as a path I was going to take. With her I knew it to the bottom of my soul that I would be happy just having her, making her fragment and break apart. When she moaned my name low and needy it triggered my own release and I buried my face in the delicate curve of her neck and growled like a feral animal. After we were both wrung out I collapsed on top of her in a boneless heap and felt her wrap her slender arms around me. I kept my face pressed into her neck and gave her a series of butterfly kisses with my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cYou make me think everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to give me better access to her neck and rubbed her hands lightly up and down my spine. \u201cAll we can do is try, Rule. I\u2019m willing as long as you are and I\u2019m not delusional, I\u2019ve known you a long time and know it isn\u2019t always going to be easy and fun that things like pizza and a quiet night at home have the ability to send you into a tailspin but I\u2019m here as long as you recognize what is happening and agree to try.\u201d</p><p>I snickered a little against her damp skin which made her shiver. \u201cIf freaking out means I get you to go down on me to get me to stop acting like an idiot I can\u2019t promise to knock it off any time soon.\u201d</p><p>She swore and swatted me on my ass. I fell asleep with her wrapped up in my arms and her soft laughter in my ear. The tunnel was long and dark and sometimes no matter how good my intentions were the walls tended to close in on me but if Shaw was willing to be my light at the end then there was no way I wasn\u2019t going to try.</p><p>We were both quiet the next morning when we got up to go back to her car. We stopped at the corner coffee shop for breakfast and neither one of us seemed overly eager to rehash the events of the night before. After a solid night\u2019s sleep and waking up to her peaceful and innocent face I had my head back on straight and was calling myself all kinds of fool for letting my usual hang-ups pull me in such a dark direction the night before. Pizza and quiet time on the couch was nothing compared to all the heavy shit I now had rattling around in my brain after she made me come clean. I was ashamed that she knew I had been trying to use her body to escape, to take something that was so different with her and on such another level and drag it down to where every other sexual encounter had begun and ended. If Shaw hadn\u2019t called me on my shit and just let me go it would have been the end for I us. I knew it and I was pretty sure she knew it. Allowing me to put her in a box with all the rest was something she wouldn\u2019t stand for and I was eternally grateful.</p><p>It had warmed up just a tad from last night so the icy spots on the sidewalks were now mushy puddles of dirty slush. We navigated around them while balancing hot coffee and trying to stay warm. She had parked her car off the street a couple blocks over from the shop in one of the neighborhoods. I was getting ready to ask her if she was alright, if everything was still cool between us but she came to a grinding halt and I almost ran into the back of her. I swore softly as the hot coffee splashed over my hand. \u201cWhat the hell Shaw?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move and I had to jump back when her coffee slid out of a suddenly lifeless hand and clattered on the snowy ground. She lifted a shaking hand to her mouth and before I could ask again what was wrong a pickup truck that was waiting to make a left hand turn moved and I caught sight of her car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All the windows were smashed out, the headlights and been shattered; all four tires were on the metal rim on the ground the slashed rubber sitting lifelessly around them like tattered material. The pristine black paint job was now marred with ugly red spray paint that had even uglier words blazed across the surface. The hood had the word \u2018whore\u2019 in huge letters and along each side of the car from front to trunk were variations on the same thing. It was bad and considering what kind of car she drove it was also going to be extremely costly to fix.</p><p>I could see that she was shaking so I put an arm around her shoulder and tugged her to my chest. At first she resisted, standing stone still, eyes locked on the senseless destruction but when I applied just a little more pressure she came willingly and I tucked her head up under my chin.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably call the cops.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered against me and I felt her head move \u2018no\u2019 under against my throat. \u201cNo. What\u2019s the point? His dad will just cover for him again and make it all go away. Besides it\u2019s not like there is any proof he did it.\u201d</p> <p>I hated that she was probably right. \u201cDo you want me to take you to school? I can get this taken care of for you while you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to call the insurance company and have it towed somewhere. Why can\u2019t he just leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>I ran a hand lightly from the crown of her head to the ends of her almost white hair. \u201cBecause you\u2019re kind of impossible to get over.\u201d</p><p>She sighed against my neck and just let me hold her until she stopped shaking. \u201cI guess I need to go back to your place and get this taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I handed her what was left of my coffee and made sure I kept her tucked in close to my side on the way back to the Victorian. We were both quiet, now for different reasons but I knew I needed to keep the rage that was practically choking me at bay until I got her somewhere safe and she felt secure. Having something destroyed like that must have been a violation like I couldn\u2019t imagine and even though Gabe had been quiet the last few weeks it was clear now he had no intention of letting go of his obsession with my girl.</p> <p>When we got back inside she immediately started calling around getting things in place for an adjuster to check out the damage and have the car towed to a body shop. She needed a rental in the meantime and wasted no time in setting that up as well. After about an hour or two where I just watched her like a hawk all the adrenaline finally wore her out and she mentioned that she wanted to take a shower and lay down. I sent her off to my room with gritted teeth and a kiss, hoping she couldn\u2019t feel the fury that was burning in every cell of my body.</p><p>Nash came crawling in a few minutes after I heard the hot water turn on. He looked a little worse for the wear but he had a shit eating grin on his face and his shirt was on inside out so I assumed the date had served its purpose. He took one look at the way my jaw was clenched and the way I\u2019m sure my eyes were flashing with platinum fire and asked,</p><p>\u201cBad night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad morning. Shaw\u2019s car got trashed last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it was polo shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else would do something like that to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI dunno one of your legions of one night stands that\u2019s pissed off you\u2019re off the market? You both have some pretty heavy baggage floating around out there.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even considered that I might be the cause of retaliation against her. That just made me even angrier. I inclined my head toward my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep an eye on her until I get back? She seemed okay but I could tell she was pretty shaken up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going? I have to be at the shop at one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back before then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t Nash; it\u2019s long past time for me to lose my shit. This asshole is going to hear it from me that if he keeps messing with her that I\u2019m going to annihilate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking for trouble and not in a good way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll be back in a few just keep an eye on Shaw and if she asks where I am make something up. She doesn\u2019t need to worry about anything else today.\u201d</p><p>He begrudgingly agreed but I could tell he was not stoked with what I was about to do.</p><p>I jumped in the truck and drove to the school. I knew that Shaw had class the same time as Gabe on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays so when I found a place to park it only took a nod at one co-ed and a wink at another to find my way to the where all the political science classes were held. It was cold outside and students were hurrying from building to building with their heads down so no one really paid any attention to me as I lurked around the building that I was sure Gabe would eventually come out of. Fortunately for me I didn\u2019t have to wait long and campus security had already passed my direction without so much as a pause because twenty minutes into my vigil the doors opened a group of dudes that looked like they had emptied out a J Crew store and topped it off with all off L.L Bean\u2019s winter line came pouring out. They were all laughing and talking about something and Davenport looked so self-satisfied I just wanted to knock his pearly whites down his throat.</p><p>I waited until the group dispersed and it was just Davenport by himself. He pulled the collar of his Patagonia jacket up around his ears and pulled out his cell phone. I pushed off the wall of the building I was leaning against and followed him silently until he reached the parking lot. When he stopped by the Lexus I reached out and grabbed the back of his neck and shoved him forward so that his face was smashed against to freezing metal of the roof. He let out a surprised sound and the bag with his books and computer in it clattered to the ground. He struggled but I had a good grip and was fueled by a living fury so he didn\u2019t have a chance. I leaned forward so that my elbow ground painfully into the base of his neck and tightened my fingers until I felt his skin start to resist.</p><p>\u201cYou want to harass someone, scare someone, terrorize someone you might want to pick someone that doesn\u2019t have a pissed off boyfriend waiting around the corner preppy boy. This is the last time I\u2019m going to tell you to leave Shaw the hell alone. If you don\u2019t that fancy Ken Doll face you seem so fond of is going to end up like hamburger.\u201d I gave him another shove so that the metal smacked unforgivingly against his cheek. People were wandering around the parking lot and stopping to stare at us but I didn\u2019t care. \u201cAre we clear?\u201d</p><p>He grunted and got his hands under his chest so that he could lever himself off the side of the car. I let him go and stepped back, hands hanging loose at my sides in case he decided he wanted to throw down right then and there. He smoothed down the hair my rough handling had messed up and glared at me while working his jaw back and forth.</p><p>\u201cWe both know my father can keep me out of jail, what can yours do for you? Change a tire, help you move?\u201d He laughed bitterly and spit out a mouthful of blood that narrowly missed the toe of my boot. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a match for me in the real world. You can call yourself her boyfriend all you want but the fact of the matter is she simply isn\u2019t allowed to walk away from me for someone like you. That\u2019s just bad precedent.\u201d</p><p>I thought he was just spoiled and annoying but the more he talked the more I started to wonder about his sanity. The guy talked like a lunatic.</p><p>\u201cDude go fuck someone else. Shaw isn\u2019t into you, she never will be and harassing her is just pissing everyone off. If you think I\u2019m scared of what your dad or anyone else can do to me if it means protecting her than you\u2019re in for a shock and even if you manage to get me out of the way there is a whole group of people out there ready to take my place. You aren\u2019t going to get anywhere messing with her and if you ever touch her again I\u2019m going to snap every single one of your fingers off and cram them down your throat.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed at me and poked a finger in my chest. He was lucky I didn\u2019t knock him in the mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re so stupid, so uneducated and low class to think it has anything to do with sex. I can get sex anywhere, you really think I let Shaw dangle her ass in front of me for six months and didn\u2019t get some on the side? Sex is irrelevant and if she\u2019s giving it up to you I don\u2019t want to go near her with a ten foot pole. This is business and image; she can\u2019t set a protocol that I\u2019m replaceable with a tattooed punk that has nothing to offer. I can\u2019t have people remembering that.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the wrist of the hand that was poking me and shoved him back into the car. \u201cIf you think sex with Shaw is irrelevant than you\u2019re the one that is uneducated jackass. Get over yourself, if I can prove that you had anything to do with her car we\u2019re pressing charges. If you keep harassing her we\u2019ll keep going to court and eventually someone will notice your old man covering your ass. I\u2019m telling you this stops now or you can go to the hospital and I can spend some time in jail, got it?\u201d</p><p>We stared each other down but by now there was a decent size crowd gathered around while we sized each other up. I didn\u2019t see the security guard until he was getting in between the two of us. Before he could start asking questions I flipped Gabe off and headed back to the side street where I had parked the truck. The guard called something after me and I heard Davenport\u2019s raised voice but I didn\u2019t stop until I was back in the truck and had the heater blaring. I flexed my hands repeatedly on the steering wheel and took a few deep breaths to get myself back under control. The last time I had felt this impotent amount of anger, this unfinished need to destroy something was when I had watched them put my brother in the ground. I wanted to tear his perfectly tailored body apart seam by seam and watch him suffer. Pushing him around and making him uncomfortable just wasn\u2019t enough. The darkness, the unpredictability that lurked inside me reared up again and wanted unbridled vengeance but I had to put it back in the box because I wasn\u2019t going to make Shaw wrestle with it again so soon.</p><p>It took me a solid half hour before I felt like I was ready to go home and face her. When I walked in the door Nash was playing one of the game units and screaming a mouthful of obscenities through the headset at whomever he was playing with. He ripped the gear off and gave me a once over as I shut the door and climbed to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any blood or gore.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and tossed my jacket on the back of the couch. \u201cToo many people around plus I think kicking his ass would only encourage him. The guy has a whole tool box of screws loose. It isn\u2019t even about Shaw it\u2019s all about how it looks that she dumped him and is hanging out with me. His ego is out of this world I seriously don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do about it because he\u2019s right about his dad being able to cover for him, he already proved it once.\u201d</p><p>Nash jerked his head in the direction of my room. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t made a sound. She never surfaced after the shower so I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s doing, but I have to go or I\u2019m going to be late for my appointment and I still need to tweak the drawing a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool I got her. Maybe she was just so stressed out she slept the whole time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou could only be so lucky bro.\u201d</p><p>I snorted and waved him off as I headed toward my room. The door was closed and everything was dark when I pushed it open. Shaw was curled up in the fetal position in the center of the bed and it didn\u2019t take a genius to tell she was wide awake and had been crying. She had her hands tucked up under her cheek and was staring sightlessly at the blank TV.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d Her voice was raw and even more husky than normal from crying. I sat on the edge of the bed reached out to run a hand over her thigh.</p><p>\u201cI told him to back off and that it wasn\u2019t smart to piss off someone that had me as a boyfriend. I don\u2019t know what his deal is Shaw, I think the dude is certifiable he just doesn\u2019t relate on any kind of logical level.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were going to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I might have but it was broad daylight and there was an entire college of students walking around. I pushed him around a little and we tossed some crap at each other but I just mostly wanted him to know you aren\u2019t alone, that if he hurts you there are plenty of people waiting in the wings to hurt him back.\u201d</p><p>Silent tears ran down her face and I had to lean all the way over her prone form to wipe them away with my thumbs.</p><p>\u201cI just want him to go away. I never did anything to deserve this. All I ever do is what everyone else wants why I am being punished for doing the one thing in life I want for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Casper, I just don\u2019t know.\u201d I didn\u2019t know how to make her feel better so I just scooted up on the bed behind her and gathered her up in my arms while she cried. I didn\u2019t consider myself an empathetic or even a compassionate guy. I was usually so wrapped up in my own head and my own spiral of emotional nonsense to pay much attention to anyone else\u2019s, but holding Shaw while she cried changed something in me on a fundamental level. I felt like there was nothing on earth I wouldn\u2019t do or wouldn\u2019t give to make this better for her. I felt like a failure for not stopping it from happening to her and I knew that from this point on keeping an eye on her and keeping her relatively safe from just Davenport wasn\u2019t enough. Suddenly with blinding clarity I knew that I wanted to keep her safe and protected from anything that was ever going to hurt her forever and ever and that just sucked because I had a sneaky suspicion that somewhere along the line I had probably been the cause of just as much distress as polo shirt was proving create and that just made me want to break things all over again.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p><p>Shaw</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d Ayden sounded nervous and she wasn\u2019t thrilled I had dragged her to Marked so early in the morning. We were sitting in a little room at the shop I had never seen before even though I was spending more and more time at the shop waiting for Rule to get off or dropping him off dinner if he had to work late. The room had clearly been decorated by a female, Cora\u2019s funky sense of style was all over the place and it smelled a little less antiseptic than the rest of the shop. I was sitting on a chair that looked an awful lot like the one you would find in a gynecologist\u2019s office and nervously fidgeting with everything in sight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you want to do something that\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll only hurt for a minute and I trust Cora.\u201d I did. Whenever I was at the shop we inevitably ended up spending hours talking and had even taken our budding friendship out of the building. When Rule or Rome were unable to pull \u2018eyes on Shaw duty\u2019 Cora didn\u2019t seem to mind hanging out with me until one of my many watch dogs was free. I really liked her and since the idea had taken root I was happy that having someone I knew and was comfortable with pierce me was the only way I was going to go through with it. Cora had even agreed to come in when the shop was closed while Rule and Nash were at the gym so that I could keep it a surprise.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to make sure you\u2019re doing it for you and not for Rule. What if you guys break up and the next guy you date is all straight laced and proper? Pierced nipples might not work for your next boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a bored look and tried to calm my nerves. The truth was doing it had nothing to do with Rule. I was back to feeling like I had no control over my life again. The thing with my car and the way Gabe was still influencing my day to day life, the pressure from my parents about everything from my hair to Rule, the way Rule disappeared inside himself when I started to get too close it was all closing in on me and I needed something that was just for me. I wanted this little something that was my choice, a decision to alter my body that no one else had any say in. I was having migraines more frequently, three in the last two weeks and if I didn\u2019t do something I was going to shatter apart in too many pieces to put back together.</p><p>\u201cIf I Rule and I break up you really think the next guy in my life is going to be all clean cut and preppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. You dated Gabe for six months and he\u2019s about as opposite physically from Rule as one can get. I bet pierced nipples would send him into cardiac arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never dating anyone just because I\u2019m supposed to again, and I\u2019m not planning on dating anyone besides Rule for the foreseeable future anyway so let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.\u201d</p><p>The truth was things had been strained between Rule and I for the last week. I didn\u2019t know what it was but he was treating me like I was spun sugar and going to break apart at any moment. When he didn\u2019t think I was paying attention I would catch him staring at me with a confused look in his gaze like he was trying to figure out what I was still doing there, or why he was still around. He was obsessively concerned about my safety and making sure I was never ever alone and even though we still spent every night together at alternating homes the time we spent in bed had morphed from passionate and out of control, to moments that felt tender and fleeting and while it was nice and hard to complain about it didn\u2019t feel like him and it was starting to really concern me. I didn\u2019t know how to address it because it wasn\u2019t like there was anything actually wrong, he was still emotionally present, still attentive and clearly willing to try like I asked him but something was off I just couldn\u2019t put my finger on what it was.</p><p>\u201cIf your father finds out he really will make good on pulling his tuition check for next year.\u201d</p><p>My dad had finally gotten tired of me ignoring his calls and had ambushed me at the apartment last weekend. I had tried to explain the situation with the car, tried to make him understand about Gabe and his threats but none of it did any good. All my dad was concerned about was how things looked for him and mom the requisite threat about tuition had been lobbied about but it held no weight with me. I told him if he pulled my tuition I would gladly get a job as a striper to pay my way through med school and he hadn\u2019t liked it one bit. I knew the threat would only keep him off my case for a brief minute but for now that was all I needed if he wasn\u2019t going to take my back against what was going on with Gabe.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t seen hide nor hair of him but I don\u2019t think Rule pushing him around had really sent him to ground. Ayden mentioned she had heard some girls in one of her classes talking about me and from the sounds of it his new mission was to trash my reputation on campus with a series of foul lies and outrageous stories. Luckily I was pretty immune to hearing awful stuff about myself from growing up in such a judgmental and hatful household or else I would have been freaking out even more and contemplating changing schools to just get away from it all.</p><p>\u201cYeah he would, good thing that\u2019s not something he ever has any opportunity to see.\u201d</p><p>Cora opened the door with a little metal tray in her hand that looked sterilized and smelled like hospital grade antiseptic.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>I swung my legs up and around so I was lying back in the chair and tried to control my rapid breathing.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fast so it\u2019ll be over quick. Just remember you have to keep them clean so for the first three to four weeks don\u2019t play with or let you know who play with them even though he should know the rules by now.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as she told me to strip out of my tight V-neck Henley and bra. I shivered involuntarily at being so exposed but Cora was reassuring and even though I knew she wasn\u2019t really into it Ayden held my hand and watched what was happening with rapt attention.</p><p>\u201cFirst I gotta mark you to make sure they\u2019re even and straight on both sides.\u201d It was weird to have someone even though that someone was a friend handle my body in such a way. The tip of the marker was cold and it made me shiver but not nearly as much when she put the metal clamp on the first light pink tip. Her two toned eyes stared into mine and I felt my nails dig into Ayden\u2019s palm. \u201cOkay babe take a really deep breath and when I tell you let it out slow and even. You\u2019re going to feel a lot of pressure from the needle pressing through and then the jewelry being put in place just keep your eyes on me and keep breathing.\u201d</p><p>I did what she said and after the initial pain that admittedly had a couple of surprised tears welling in my eyes it was just more uncomfortable than painful. She repeated the process on the other side and just like that it was over and I was pierced. She asked me if I wanted a mirror. I took it and admired her handy work.</p><p>I had pretty nice breasts already, they weren\u2019t huge or anything outrageous but they were firm and high and my nipples were always a nice, pretty pink. The silver hoops were similar to the ones in Rule\u2019s eyebrow and the one in his lip but the ball at the center of mine was a bright aquamarine globe. They were sexy and feminine and I freaking loved the way it looked. I took the aftercare instructions and climbed back into my clothes. I felt the little piece of me that had been flailing over the last weeks lock back down and I smiled at Cora and gave her a hug.</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. It\u2019s over the top hot.\u201d</p><p>Ayden nodded as she pulled on her coat. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would suit you but I was wrong they look really girly and sexy. I can see now why you wanted to get it done.\u201d</p><p>Cora lifted her super blond eyebrows as I shoved money into her hands. \u201cI know you said you would do it for free but I want to pay you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and tried to hand it back but I refused to take it. \u201cI would like to consider us friends now and I don\u2019t take advantage of friends so please just take it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at me and moved around to pick up all her equipment. \u201cIf you wanted a tattoo and Rule or Nash offered to do it for free would you let them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule yes, Nash no.\u201d</p><p>She sighed in defeat then. \u201cWell fine then. Let me know what lover boy thinks, not that I think he\u2019ll be able to hide his shit eating grin. I swear his mood entirely revolves around how the two of you are going at it.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my long hair out of the collar of my coat and tried not to wince as the movement caused my new addition to move uncomfortably against my bra. \u201cSo how\u2019s he been lately?\u201d I was curious but I also really wanted to know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine, more mellow and maybe more quiet than usual, but good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s good I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged not sure how to explain it. \u201cRule has never really been a mellow guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo he hasn\u2019t but maybe you just have given him a reason to be. Maybe he\u2019s happy and has everything he wants so there isn\u2019t a reason to be all angsty and agro all the time anymore.\u201d</p><p>I would have been thrilled if I thought she was right but I knew Rule and none of it sat right with how he was. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>She gave me another hug, carful of my chest and ushered us out of the shop. \u201cDon\u2019t get your panties all wadded up over it there is nothing wrong with mellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks Cora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime now scram so I clean this up before regular business shows up and the guys have to get here and set up.\u201d</p> <p>Ayden gave me a searching look as we exited into the cold. \u201cHow did you get the guard dogs to let you off the leash this morning? Rules has a fit whenever you try and gallivant around without someone on your heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I had a hair appointment and that you were going with me and wouldn\u2019t let me out of your sight. No guy wants to go spend an hour in a salon, especially a guy like Rule.\u201d She lifted her brows at me when we got to the rental I was currently driving.</p><p>\u201cSo are we actually going to go get our hair done?\u201d</p><p>Since I wasn\u2019t a liar and hated being dishonest with him I had indeed made both of us an appointment to get the works done. \u201cWe are, only it\u2019s my treat this time because we have to make a stop first and it\u2019s kinda out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere at?\u201d</p><p>I pulled out onto Colfax and headed to the highway in the direction of Brookside.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I knew Ayden was curious but when I woke up this morning and Rule had been so cloyingly polite and kind there were two things that I knew I had to accomplish that day. The first was done and the second, well I wasn\u2019t sure but I felt like the second might end up being even more painful.</p><p>\u201cI just need to swing by and see an old friend really quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Brookside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust outside, let me just get through it first and then I\u2019ll explain.\u201d I drove silently through the mountains until we got to the small cemetery on the outskirts of Evergreen listening to The Dawes play melancholy songs that fit my mood the entire way. It looked more like a ranch than a cemetery and I had always thought it was so ironic that Remy was buried so far out of the city on such a quiet piece of land when he had been so buoyant and so full of energy and life. I parked in the visitor\u2019s lot and pulled on a pair of gloves and a hat because I wasn\u2019t sure how long I was going to need and it was even colder up here at a higher elevation than it was in the city.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the keys so you can run the heater and mess with the radio. I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019m going to be.\u201d</p><p>Ayden\u2019s amber gaze was liquid with sadness and understanding. She gave me a quick one armed hug and shooed me off. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine you take as long as you need. You can spring for a hot stone massage if it takes you too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d That\u2019s why I loved this girl.</p><p>My boots crunched on the snow as I made my way to the back of the lot where the grave stone sat so cold and sterile, just one more shade of gray on the barren winter landscape. There was a bright spray of red roses lying on top of the stark white plot and it made me smile. Remy loved red, loved things that were vibrant and eye catching, anything that suited his personality. Not caring that the ground was frozen and covered in snow I knelt down and traced his name with a gloved finger. Tears immediately filled my eyes. I moved my hand along to glide over the huge horseshoe both the surviving Archer boys had insisted go on their siblings headstone. Turned upward it was said to keep all the good luck in, Rome liked the symbolism, Rule liked that it was a visual representation that tied the two of them together for eternity.</p> <p>\u201cHey handsome. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been so long since my last visit but things have been...intense.\u201d I laughed humorously. \u201cI have a feeling if you were here you would be laughing your ass off at everyone and shaking your head at all of us. I miss you so much and every single day I think it would make things so much better if I could just call you, that you would make everything make sense and keep it all together. Doing this is a million times harder without you.\u201d I was crying in earnest now and couldn\u2019t really see the headstone clearly any more. I flattened my palm over his name and concentrated on taking deep breaths in and out. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping with your brother and if you thought I was a silly lovesick fool before you should see me now. I\u2019m freaking out because he\u2019s being too nice. I know, only I would worry about my boyfriend being too nice but we both know Rule and something is up he won\u2019t talk to me about. By the way how weird is it that I\u2019m calling Rule my boyfriend? My heart turns over every time I do it and sometimes I feel like my entire world is in his eyes and yet he still closes me out, still shuts down and makes it so very hard to just love him. If you were here I would make you pull it out of him and he would tell you because he always did.\u201d I sighed and let my head fall forward. \u201cI wish you had told them, Rule and Rome. I wish you had trusted them enough to let them in like you did for me. You\u2019re mother has gone off her rocker because Rule still refuses to be your carbon copy and as a result your family is in tatters. Maybe if everyone knew, if you had tried to let them know everyone deserves to be loved no matter how they choose to live their lives it wouldn\u2019t be like this. Your dad is coming around but still trying to keep Margot out of the loony bin and Rome, poor Rome is just a giant Ping-Pong ball trying to protect everybody and make everything okay but he has no help, he needs you to be the mediator like you always were.\u201d</p><p>My knees were freezing and my pants had long since soaked through. My teeth were chattering and I had quickly learned that super cold weather and nipple piercings were not exactly a great combo.</p><p>\u201cI have a crazy ex that is in turn stalking me and harassing me and it\u2019s making my life hell. My parents are convinced I should marry him and move to Cherry Hills, Rule hates him and there\u2019s a good chance if the ex keeps it up is going to murder him and it just makes things that are already complicated and no fun even more awful. I have a sneaky suspicion that if you had been around you would have seen through all Gabe\u2019s polish and shine to the tarnish underneath and I wouldn\u2019t have ever ended up in this situation in the first place. I miss having you protect me from myself, your brother is all about keeping me safe and I think he really honestly cares but he\u2019s so busy keeping me safe from everyone, himself included that I don\u2019t think he sees that I can be my own worst enemy and he keeps talking about messing things up between us and I don\u2019t have the heart to tell him that he can\u2019t ever mess up bad enough to make me stop loving him, but there is a good chance that like everyone else he\u2019s going to see what I have to offer isn\u2019t all that great and want more than I can give. It\u2019s so convoluted and twisted I can\u2019t even believe we got as far as we have.\u201d</p><p>I laughed a little, real laughter this time and a couple standing by a grave a few feet away gave me a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cI got drunk on my birthday and threw myself at him. I was terrified the entire time he was going to turn me down, to claim that he was taking advantage of me because I was drunk but it happened and I totally gave up the v-card to your twin. Somehow I know you would find that hysterical and never let me live it down. You were right I was always just waiting for him to get with the program and now that he has, well let me just say the program is amazing and I have a hard time seeing a future without it or without him.\u201d</p><p>I pressed a kiss to the stiff leather of the glove and placed it on his name. \u201cEvery day Rem, every single day something reminds me of you, makes me think of things I want to tell you, makes want to cry because of what happened to you. Every day I miss you and right now when I need you more than I ever I try to make decisions, try to go in a direction that I know would make you proud, would make you smile for me but it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><p>I stayed for a few more minutes until the tears were nothing more than icy trials on my cheeks then climbed to my feet. I rested a hand on the top of the gravestone and said a final goodbye while trying to get my composure back in order. When I got into the car Ayden had hijacked the radio and Lady Antebellum was twanging it up but she turned it all the way down as I got behind the steering wheel and peeled off my gloves.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and held my frozen hands over the heater, wishing I had one big enough to dry the legs of my jeans. \u201cYeah it\u2019s just sad. I miss him a lot. We used to talk every single day sometimes for hours and hours. I feel lost without him so much of the time and I think he\u2019s the only one that would make sense of how hard it is to get a handle on Rule. They were very different but still essentially the same at the core, good men with a strong sense of self and loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you cared deeply for him so why didn\u2019t the two of you ever hook up? It seems like it would have been an obvious match.\u201d</p><p>I smiled ruefully and headed back toward the city. \u201cBecause we didn\u2019t feel that way about each other. He knew I was in love with Rule at times he encouraged it, at times he tried everything to talk me out of it but he knew it and for the most part respected it and he was in love someone else, someone very unlike me. Remy was the life of the party, he had a million friends and everyone wanted to be around him all the time but he was really private when it came to his love life. Rome and Rule burned through girls at a rate that is honestly alarming but Remy played it close to the chest and I think he let people believe we had a thing going for so long because it kept them from asking questions he didn\u2019t want to answer. He didn\u2019t want the comparison to his brother\u2019s and his parents loved me so it was just easier for him to play along than deal with the hassle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like it was very fair to you. If he knew you were in love with Rule the whole time why would he purposely let him believe you and he were a couple?\u201d</p><p>Rule asked me that same question all the time even though he wasn\u2019t armed with the knowledge that I had been in love with him for so long and I hated that I couldn\u2019t answer it for him. Remy\u2019s secrets weren\u2019t mine to tell even if it strained things between us.</p><p>\u201cHe had his reasons and at the time I understood them, now I guess I didn\u2019t see how damaging they could be but at the end of the day he saved me from a high school life that would have been miserable and a family that treats me like furniture so I don\u2019t mind suffering for him in the slightest. You would have liked him, everyone did. As moody and difficult as Rule can be, Rem was just the opposite. He was always affable, smiling and happy he just wanted to have a good time and make sure everyone else did too. When he graduated he was supposed to go to California on a football scholarship, he was good, better than good but he turned it down because if he had to play in order to stay in school than that took the fun out of the game for him. Rule moved to Denver with Nash and Remy left with them. The guys went to work in the shop as soon as they had their diplomas, Remy screwed around trying figure out what he wanted to do. Eventually he got hooked up with a high-end event planning company throwing swanky parties and doing black tie events, it was his niche and he never talked about college again. He made good money, loved living in the city, had a great relationship with his brother\u2019s and his family, was involved in a relationship with someone that made him smile and act like a giddy kids, plus I had just moved here for freshman year when he died. It sucked and it totally wasn\u2019t fair, everything was right where he wanted it and he was taken away from it all because of a stupid accident.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just tragic.\u201d I could hear the emotion in her voice.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d I agreed because that was all I could do. By the time we got to the salon we were both beyond ready for a little pick me up and I decided that a hot stone massage was definitely in order.</p><p>We got pampered and all loosened up. Maybe too loose because when it came time to touch up my hair I had him take the chunk in my bangs and make it almost black instead of the subtle light brown it had been. I had him do the same to the underside fall of my long hair so that I had almost a checkerboard effect going on. It was edgy and dramatic, there was no way to miss it and the black made the green of my eyes iridescent. I really liked and so did everyone else apparently because as soon as we got out of the salon I had a bunch of girls around the same age as us stop and ask where I had it done.</p><p>Ayden and I went and got some lunch and decided to grab a cocktail at a bar close to the apartment. I glanced at my phone and notice Rule had texted and asked how I was doing. I frowned and shot back that everything was fine. I waited for him to demand to know where I had been all day, to ask what I was up to but instead he just answered back that was good and wanted to know what time to come over tonight. My stomach knotted and I felt something awful rise up in the back of my throat. He was only being nice, only being thoughtful but I hated it and I wanted it to stop so I texted:</p> <p>I think I have a migraine coming on. Ayden isn\u2019t working tonight so I think we\u2019ll just have a girl\u2019s night at home with a stupid move and some popcorn so you can go out with your friends or whatever.</p><p>I wanted him to tell me that was stupid. That of course he would come over but I got back:</p><p>Alright. Let me know if you need anything for your head. Keep your door locked I still don\u2019t trust Davenport.</p><p>I wanted my Rule back. I wanted him to get mad at me, I wanted him to throw all that attitude he normally toted around at me but I got none of it. All I got was quiet acquiescence and easy agreeability, things that my Rule knew nothing about. Angry and not sure why or what to do about it I tossed the phone into my purse and ordered us another round of drinks.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on Shaw. I\u2019ve been with you all day; tell me what\u2019s really going on, the boobs, the hair and the freezing visit to the grave something is behind it all. You make me talk when I don\u2019t want to so spill it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed dejectedly and twirled the straw around in my drink. \u201cI told Rule not to come over tonight because I was getting a migraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I assume is not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo and it don\u2019t really want him to stay away I just wanted him to do what he normally does and throw a fit, to act temperamental and bossy, to tell me he\u2019s coming over whether I like it or not because he wants to. Instead he just says okay like it\u2019s no big deal and I don\u2019t know what to do with it. It\u2019s not like he can\u2019t be sweet and nice when he wants to but that\u2019s just not his default. He\u2019s complicated and argumentative but lately all he wants to do is smile and nod like I can do no wrong. It weirds me out and it just isn\u2019t like him so I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe try being stoked that your boyfriend sounds awesome?\u201d</p> <p>I tried to smile because I knew she was just kidding but I didn\u2019t have the heart for it. \u201cIt\u2019s not just when we talk or I ask him to do things, it\u2019s in bed too. Normally it\u2019s all out of control passion and mind numbing orgasm after orgasm but lately it\u2019s been a lot more like may I do this, and is it okay if I do that, and how does this make you feel, and are you okay with this? He\u2019s never been the type to ask for permission, he takes what he wants and by the end makes sure you want it twice as bad, it\u2019s starting to really freak me out because I don\u2019t even know how to talk to him about it without sounding like a paranoid lunatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you have to talk to him about it. You can\u2019t just keep expecting him to act one way while he\u2019s doing something entirely different or you\u2019re both just going to be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>I knew she was right but that didn\u2019t mean I had the first clue how to go about it. \u201cWhatever happened between him and Gabe after my car got trashed is what started it. He left the apartment one way and came back as a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a couple people who were walking to class when it happened. They said it looked like Rule was going to tear Gabe apart but then he let him go and a security guard broke it up so I don\u2019t know what could have triggered such a strange reaction in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either but I hate it and it\u2019s just one more reason to curse Gabe and how he has managed to interfere in my life.\u201d</p><p>I was feeling pretty down so we had a few more cocktails than planed and then Ayden decided that since we were already bombed that we should make good on the girls night. We ordered wings to go from the bar and hiked home since we were only four blocks away and I could just get dropped off at the car in the morning. We stumbled in and crashed on the couch. We watched three sappy, romantic comedies back to back, polished off the wings with a bottle of wine, indulged in ice cream and popcorn and laughed hysterically at things that were not remotely funny. It wasn\u2019t until I finally crawled into bed hours later that I realized that I hadn\u2019t called Rule or even sent a message to let him know what I was doing all night long. I think my heart cracked a little when I looked at the screen of my phone and it reflected back no missed calls or new messages. He hadn\u2019t even bothered with a goodnight or an I miss you.</p><p>I tossed the phone somewhere on the floor, careful this time not to hurl it at the wall and crawled under the covers. I assumed since I was pretty plastered that sleep would suck me under in no time but I was wrong. I tossed and turned for over two hours until I finally gave up and realized I wasn\u2019t going to sleep unless I changed something. I had spent the last month cozied up next to Rule\u2019s solid bulk and sleeping in an empty bed when I was feeling shitty just didn\u2019t hold the same appeal. I shoved the covers aside and rummaged through one of the dresser drawers that Rule had started stashing some of his things in when he stayed over. I found his favorite Defiance Ohio t-shirt and striped down and put it on. It was worn, soft and mostly it reminded me of him so when I crawled back into bed I finally fell into a fitful rest knowing that I had to get a handle on whatever was going on before I went crazy or turned into an insomniac lush.</p><p>Chapter 15</p> <p>Rule</p><p>\u201cHey you gotta a minute?\u201d I looked up from the drawing of an old school pirate ship I was working on when my brother\u2019s voice surprised me from the doorway of my room. I was concentrating so hard that I hadn\u2019t heard him come in and my mind was a million miles away because for the second night in a row Shaw had come up with some lame ass excuse to hang by herself rather than with me and it was pissing me off. I was making an active effort to act in a way I thought all good boyfriends were supposed to act. I was being considerate, attentive, deferring to her wishes and not pushing for anything so generally being a giant pussy and letting her call all the shots and it wasn\u2019t getting me a damn thing, even in bed. I wanted to be a guy that wouldn\u2019t give her a reason to walk away, that would make her happy so that she didn\u2019t have to battle my mood swings and crazy outbursts of crazy. I was trying with limited success to be a guy that she wanted to keep around especially since Davenport was still floating around and unhinged but for whatever reason my new and improved attitude seemed to be achieving the opposite result. I had spent the last two nights tossing and turning because I was so used to her soft form curled up next to mine and I was too irritated to just call her and tell her I was over it and just coming over anyway because I knew it was what we both wanted.</p><p>I tossed my pencil at Rome\u2019s head and indicated he could come in if he wanted. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He threw the pencil back at me and dropped heavily on the bed. He stuck his long legs out in front of him and crossed his ankles while reclining back on his elbows making himself right at home.</p><p>\u201cStill no word from Shaw?\u201d</p><p>I bit back a growl because just thinking about it made me want to hurt things. \u201cShe says she has too much homework due tomorrow so she\u2019s just going to head home after work and do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing just huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up Rome, your huh never means nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s just odd that she hasn\u2019t been around much the last couple days. Did you have a fight you didn\u2019t tell me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I scowled at him. \u201cYes I\u2019m sure we didn\u2019t have a fight. Did you just come in here to harass me or did you actually want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to change the subject?\u201d I called him a nasty name and spun back around in my chair.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re just going to be annoying I have to finish this back piece I\u2019m working on for a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got my medical release today. The doc from Carson called a little while ago. That means I\u2019m going wheels up at the beginning of next week.\u201d</p><p>I spun back around. He was trying to look relaxed but I could see the tension around his mouth and eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour shoulder is going to be up to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you? Are you going to be up to going back to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I don\u2019t really have a choice. I would feel better leaving if I knew things with you and Shaw were straight and she didn\u2019t have some lunatic stalking her, and that mom had agreed to get some help but I guess miracles only happen in the movies.\u201d</p><p>I grunted and rubbed my hands over my hair that seemed to be getting longer by the minute. I was tempted to shave the mohawk back but for whatever reason in my head Shaw shouldn\u2019t be with a guy rocking hair like that so I was keeping it normal and natural even though she told me on a regular basis how much she missed the hawk.</p><p>\u201cShaw and I are fine so don\u2019t worry about it, as for mom, well there\u2019s nothing I can really do to help you with that. Promise me that you\u2019re going to be safe. No more driving over bombs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t in the plan the first time. Look I\u2019m going to tell mom and dad, you know they\u2019re going to want to do something since no one knows when I\u2019ll be back or what condition I\u2019m going to be in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRome I can\u2019t go through that with mom again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell dad to set something up at a restaurant or something. I\u2019ll make sure he knows it has to be a family event which means you will be there and so will Shaw. I\u2019m not asking little brother I\u2019m telling you. I\u2019m about to go back to the desert for who knows how long and I deserve a good family memory to take with me. Everyone can just suck it up for one night, I deserve that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw how well it went last time and that wasn\u2019t even with me provoking her.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and pushed to his feet. \u201cDo this for me Rule, please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t want to, not when things with Shaw were weird and not after my mom had made her feelings about me so clear, but there wasn\u2019t much I would deny my brother and there was nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for him when he asked me to please do it. I growled a lot of really dirty words and let my head fall backwards.</p><p>\u201cLet me know when and where. I\u2019ll tell Shaw but you can\u2019t get pissed and go back to the war all mad if mom does what she tends to do and makes it ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t all just be a goddamn family for once. I really don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s too much to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s not and I will do my part. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks bro, you\u2019re only half as bad as everyone thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I laughed and went back to my drawing. \u201cJust so you know I\u2019m going to miss having your bossy ass around.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to me and put me in a head lock. I struggled in vain trying to get loose but he was just too big and easily manhandled me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss your smart mouth and shitty attitude as well. Though this hair you have going on is stupid and not at all you so I won\u2019t miss that one bit.\u201d He finally released me when I got a solid fist into his ribs. He let me go with a grunt and I pushed the nondescript locks out of my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just worried that when I have normal looking hair that people will start to realize I\u2019m so much better looking than you.\u201d</p> <p>He lunged for me again and we wrestled around for a little bit like we used to do when we were kids, only now Rome was giant and had a solid fifty pounds on me so it wasn\u2019t much of a fight. He left with a promise to call and order something for dinner and it gave me a small measure of satisfaction to notice he was rubbing his ribs on his way out.</p><p>I pulled my phone at and stared at the screen. I hated that I was struggling with what I wanted to say to Shaw, that I was worrying over what words to use. I was so used to just saying and doing whatever I wanted that this controlled and locked down version of myself was getting old before it even started. I wrote out a quick message:</p><p>Rome just got his medical release. He\u2019s going back to the desert on Monday.</p><p>I figured since she was working that she wouldn\u2019t respond right away plus it wasn\u2019t like we had been engaging in any kind of deep philosophical conversations as of late.</p><p>Oh no! Are you okay?</p><p>I\u2019d already lost one brother so the idea that my remaining one had a job that constantly placed him in jeopardy most definitely meant I was not okay, but there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it. Rome\u2019s sense of duty was part of what made him who he was and I respected it and respected him far too much to let my feelings cloud any of the fleeting time we spent together.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been better but he seems okay with it so what else is there to do?</p><p>Do you need me to come over after work?</p><p>I thought you had homework.</p><p>I do but if you need me it can wait.</p><p>I did need her. I wanted to hold her and love all up on her but not because she was feeling sorry for me but because she wanted to be with me too. I glared at the phone and at how complicated things seemed to have turned overnight.</p><p>Naw I\u2019m straight, but he wants to do a family dinner with EVERYBODY before he leaves. He\u2019s going to have dad set it up.</p><p>How\u2019s that going to work with things between you and Margot?</p><p>Not just me, you\u2019re coming too.</p> <p>I\u2019m not worried about me.</p><p>Rome seems to think that since he\u2019s shipping back out she\u2019ll behave if he asks her to but I have my doubts. He thinks if we do it some place public she\u2019ll behave.</p><p>It\u2019s so sad you guys even have to worry about that in the first place.</p><p>Not the only one with family problems Casper.</p><p>No you\u2019re not.</p><p>Have a good night.</p><p>There was a long pause and I didn\u2019t think she was going to say anything back but after about five minutes my phone beeped with a new message.</p><p>I miss you Rule.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to that because I wasn\u2019t the one pulling away for once and I was right here so I just clicked the screen back off and went back to my drawing.</p><p>The next night I was the one blowing off spending time with Shaw because I decided it was a great idea to take Rome out and at least attempt to get him laid before he went back overseas only I ended up face down in a fifth of Crown and seeing double so I\u2019m pretty sure I failed and ended up being the worse wingman ever. Rome and Nash dropped me on the bed after practically carrying me home and it wasn\u2019t until well after eleven the next morning when I was attempting to shower and fake being human enough to show for work that I noticed I had three missed calls and five missed messages from Shaw. They were all variations on the same thing, where are you, what are you doing, why aren\u2019t you answering, should I come by, are you going to come by? They all made me cringe and swear. I felt guilty as hell because had things not been so strained between us I would have just called her before I left or asked her to come with, but last night I had enjoyed just being my normal self and not putting any effort into being anybody\u2019s perfect anything.</p><p>I was about to try and call her to explain when Rome came out of the hallway bathroom running a towel over his head. \u201cYou alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely. I need to call Shaw. I was too messed up last night to let her know what was going on.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a sharp look. \u201cI already called her. She texted me last night wondering what you were up to so I told her you were loaded and out of control. She sounds sad, worse than that she sounds sad because of you.\u201d</p><p>I growled a little and rested my elbows on the kitchen counter. \u201cI know but I don\u2019t know what I did wrong. I almost beat her ex to death in a parking lot and realized if I was going to act like a caveman I was going to lose her and not be around to protect her so I\u2019ve been minding all my p\u2019s and q\u2019s and let me tell ya I had no idea how many of those little fuckers there were and ever since I started she\u2019s been acting like I cheated on her or did some other horrible thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule, she liked you just fine when your p\u2019s and q\u2019s were all over the map. Stop trying to be something you aren\u2019t and just let her love you. It\u2019s not hard, besides dad called and dinner is tonight at Ruth Chris downtown at six. I already told Shaw so unless you want to grovel and apologize then you don\u2019t need to call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad thought it would be good for mom. He thought maybe getting her out of Brookside would break some of that hold the past has on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule,\u201d I turned to look at him and was struck by the sincerity in his eyes. \u201cThank you for doing this for me. I know it isn\u2019t easy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m learning easy things never really pay off. It\u2019s the things that make you work that really matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a little punk that can\u2019t hold his liquor but somewhere along the line you really did turn into a man I\u2019m proud to call my brother.\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other for a long moment and I would kill before I admitted it but my eyes totally welled up. I cleared my throat and pushed off the counter.</p><p>\u201cThanks Rome, now I gotta go see if I still have a girlfriend or if I managed to drink myself single last night.\u201d</p><p>I was thinking about his words as I dialed Shaw\u2019s number only to be sent to voicemail. I just had to let her love me; I wasn\u2019t sure how to go about that but I knew whatever I was doing now wasn\u2019t working. After her recorded greeting I left a gruff message, \u201cHey it\u2019s me. I suck and I\u2019m sorry. I should have called. I\u2019m sure you were worried and if you had pulled that shit with me I would have been climbing the walls. Really I don\u2019t have an excuse other than things have been off with us for a little bit and I\u2019m trying to figure it out. Call me when you get this if you want. I\u2019ll see you later tonight. Really I\u2019m sorry and I promise to stop trying to do things different when the old way was working just fine.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what her response was going to be I only knew that I had screwed up and that I hoped it wasn\u2019t too late to fix it. I finished getting ready for work without hearing from her. I burned through my first two appointments with no word from her and I was starting to worry. I knew she had class today but that didn\u2019t normally stop her from hitting me up between sessions. I was tempted to call her again but worried about what getting sent directly to voicemail again would do to me since I was already hanging on by a thread. I was cleaning up my final appointment of the day when I finally got a text from her:</p><p>I\u2019ll see you at dinner.</p><p>That\u2019s was all. There was no I forgive you, no yes you suck now let\u2019s kiss and make up, no everybody makes mistakes, no I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re getting things back to normal, just I\u2019ll see you at dinner. What was I supposed to do with that? This having a girlfriend business was starting to make my head hurt and I longed for the days where we were just cordial enemies that only spent an hour a week together, that wasn\u2019t remotely true but it made me feel a little better as I plodded home and changed into something that wouldn\u2019t give my mom a reason to have a fit. I put on gray Dickies and a button down plaid shirt with pearl snaps on it and changed out of my studded leather belt for a plain black one. I left my boots on and made sure my unruly hair had just enough product in it to keep it in a semi styled mess. I still looked like me only a me that my dad wouldn\u2019t raze and wouldn\u2019t give my mom anything to bitch about and I had to admit to myself that I wanted Shaw to see that I could clean it up when the occasion called for it, but my head was so twisted where she was concerned I tried not to spend too much time thinking about what her reaction would be when we finally saw each other.</p><p>Rome and I climbed into the truck and I could tell he was nervous by the silent ride down to the restaurant and I honestly couldn\u2019t blame him since the last family get together had gone so smashingly and to date mom still didn\u2019t believe that she held any part in the family rift. I wasn\u2019t sure that meeting in public and having all this extra tension between Shaw and I was going to be a recipe for success but I was determined to give Rome the sendoff he deserved and not let him leave disappointed in me or with any extra reasons to worry about those he loved.</p><p>We parked in a crowed lot and shoved a couple dollars in the payment kiosk and made our way to the busy restaurant. Mom and dad were waiting out front with Shaw. My breath quickened and something in my chest flipped over at the sight of her. It had only been a few days but seeing her now I suddenly felt like we had spent years apart. She had changed her hair in the time that had passed; it was now drastically two colors and looked badass next to her pale skin and bright eyes. Her cheeks were red from the cold and her green eyes were guarded as we got close. I could see my mom had a near death grip on Shaw\u2019s arm and that she wasn\u2019t exactly overjoyed with our arrival. Rome leaned in and kissed both them on the cheek and shook dad\u2019s hand before moving to pull open the door. I opted for a chin lift and a raised eyebrow in Shaw\u2019s direction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>The corners of her mouth pulled down and my mom flat out ignored me. \u201cHey. Let\u2019s go inside I\u2019m freezing.\u201d She let my mom pull her along and a little sliver of anger started to spark under my skin but this wasn\u2019t about me so I tried to stamp it down as my dad cupped me on the back of the neck and gave me a little shake. It was a gesture that made me feel like I was ten years old again which was funny since I was about six inches taller than him now.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good thing for all of us kiddo. Just be patient and we\u2019ll all get better at being a solid unit again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just dinner dad. Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell we have to walk before we run, son and as of now the Archer\u2019s are barely managing a staggering limp. All we can do is move forward.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to that so I just kept my mouth shut and watched Shaw\u2019s shapely form as the hostess guided our group to a table in the back of the building. My mom was jabbering nonstop at her and she was occasionally nodding and making noises of agreement but what she wasn\u2019t doing at all was looking at me or acknowledging me in anyway. The anger was starting to turn from a smolder to a burn and if something didn\u2019t break soon I was going to do something I was bound to regret later. When we sat at the table I ended up sandwiched between my brother and my girlfriend, one was looking at me warningly the other was watching me with eyes shrouded in sadness and accusation, two things I didn\u2019t understand and was ready to say the hell with it to get answers about. I never got the chance because as soon as I turned to Shaw the waitress appeared and we were busy ordering drinks and my mom once again high jacked all Shaw\u2019s attention.</p><p>Just to test the waters of how deep I was in I put a hand on her thigh under the table and felt her tense at my touch. I waited for her to move or to pry it off with her own hand but she never even stopped the flow of conversation with my mom. It was obvious that they had missed each other and I felt a stab of guilt that Shaw had missed out on a relationship she obviously appreciated because of her loyalty and feelings for me. I let my dad and brother draw me into a conversation about the Broncos and kept an eye on Shaw as we ordered dinner. She never moved my hand but she never once looked my way either and I just didn\u2019t know what to make of it. I was grateful however that as long as my mom was focused on her she didn\u2019t so much as bat an eyelash in my direction allowing the dinner to go as smooth as it could considering the circumstances and hostile undercurrents. Dad ordered a bottle of champagne with dessert and before it showed up my mom got up to use the restroom finally giving Shaw a chance to turn and look at me. When she did her mouth was tight and her super light eyebrows were furrowed over her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>My own eyebrows shot up so hard they pulled against the hoops pierced there. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of hard to do when you won\u2019t answer the phone when I call you and you make up lame ass excuses night after night to avoid spending time with me.\u201d</p> <p>I saw her flinch and she leaned closer so that our heads were bent near one another. She hissed in a tone low enough that only I could hear, \u201cWell excuse me for not knowing what to say to you considering the last time we didn\u2019t talk for a few days you stuck your tongue down the first willing girl\u2019s throat. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you, but I feel like you\u2019re turning into a stranger and I hate it.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at her and tightened my fingers on her leg. \u201cDo you trust me at all? Geez Shaw maybe I was just trying to be a better boyfriend, one that doesn\u2019t flip out over stupid shit all the time and one that isn\u2019t in jail while your psycho ex is still on the prowl? Maybe I was trying to act right for a change. I was trying to be the kind of guy you deserve.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a hard breath through her clenched teeth and her emerald colored eyes sharpened with an anger that I was surprised to see burned as hot as mine. \u201cMaybe you should have asked me before deciding what I deserve, Rule. Maybe I liked the you that flips out over stupid shit. Maybe I miss the you that is passionate enough about me, about my safety to risk going to jail over my psycho ex and I sure as hell never asked for you to be a better boyfriend, in fact the boyfriend of the last week has done nothing but make me confused and sad.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think either of us realized that we had raised our voices or that we now had a captive audience. In fact it took my mom making a noise low in her throat like a wounded animal as she wobbled on her heels next to her chair to get our attention. She was looking between me and Shaw with huge eyes and had a hand pressed hard into her chest. My dad looked far less surprised but worried about my mom as usual.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just call him?\u201d</p><p>Shaw looked at my mom then back at me. She sighed and answered softly like she was afraid the news would shatter the woman before her. \u201cRule had I have been seeing each other for a little over a month now. I told him he needed to stop acting like he needed to be someone else to be a better boyfriend.\u201d She turned to look at me and I could see her doing some kind of internal warfare with herself. Finally she sucked in a deep breath and turned back to my mom. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with him since I was thirteen, Margot.\u201d</p> <p>I went still at her confession and felt everything inside me turn to jelly. She loved me. This perfect, wonderful, kind young woman loved me and had for a long time. I didn\u2019t know where to put that because my mom started blinking back tears and for the first time that night turned her attention to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough that you took Remy\u2019s life? You had to take the girl he loved from him too?\u201d</p><p>Stunned silence landed on the table like a ton of bricks. My instinct was to push away from the table and storm out of the restaurant but I couldn\u2019t because Shaw clamped a hand over mine on her leg and my dad and Rome both leapt to their feet in outrage. \u201cMargot!\u201d \u201cMom!\u201d Voices were raised and the other patrons in the restaurant were starting to pay all kinds of attention to the scene we were making but I was too stunned to care. I heard Shaw say my name, felt my brother put his hand on my shoulder but I just wasn\u2019t there, at least I wasn\u2019t there until Shaw climbed to her feet put her fingers in her mouth and let out a whistle that has us all looking at her in shock. She put her hands on the table and leaned forward so that she was talking directly to my mom but she made eye contact with all of us.</p><p>\u201cEveryone shut up,\u201d she pointed a finger at my mom and narrowed her eyes. \u201cListen to me Margot and for once you need to hear what I\u2019m saying. I loved Remy, still do but we were never in love. He knew how I felt about Rule and at times both encouraged and discouraged it but at the end of the day he knew we don\u2019t necessarily choose who we fall in love with.\u201d She took a deep breath and I watched her chest rise and fall. She was struggling with something, something big if the flush on her face and the way her hands balled into fists were any indication. \u201cRemy had secrets, I know you boys were close, that you all loved and respected each other but Remy was different than the two of you and he just didn\u2019t know how to tell you. He thought that maybe it was best for everyone to just let all of you assume we were a couple because of how hard Dale and Margot were on Rule and all he did was tattoo himself and wear his hair all crazy.\u201d She turned so that she was fully facing me and I saw she had tears in her eyes and that her bottom lip was trembling. I wanted to wrap her up in a hug and make it all better but even in my emotional shell shock I was experiencing I knew her words were about to change my world forever.</p><p>\u201cI promised him and I owed him so much, I swore on my life I would never tell anyone,\u201d she let her gaze skip around the table and land on all of us. \u201cRemy was gay. He was my best friend, my surrogate family but he was a homosexual. He was involved in a serious relationship with a guy named Orlando Fredrick that he met his last year playing ball. That was the real reason he moved to Denver after school, Lando goes to DU as well.\u201d</p><p>Disbelief foreign and cold snaked up my spine. Rome let out a string of nasty words and my mom started bawling in earnest. Shaw turned sad eyes in my direction and I looked at her like I had never seen her before.</p><p>\u201cNo way. He would have told me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, sending white and black hair sliding across her shoulders. \u201cHe wanted to but he was worried you wouldn\u2019t understand his desire to keep it quiet. He was scared you would push him to come out. It was never about worrying how you would react, he just knew it would kill Margot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were twins god damnit. He would have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule.\u201d</p><p>I pushed away from the table and glared down at her. \u201cThis is bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Rome got to his feet as well and I noticed he was looking at Shaw with hard eyes as well. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to make up lies about the deceased to try and fix things for Rule. That\u2019s desperate and uncalled for Shaw.\u201d</p><p>Tears trailed down her face as she looked back and forth between us she opened her mouth to say something but was cut off by my dad clicking his spoon against the side of his champagne glass.</p><p>\u201cAlright everybody sit down and shut the hell up.\u201d He cut a hard look at my mom and pointed to the seat she had vacated moments ago. She looked like she was going to faint and she looked about as happy to sit next to Shaw as she did when I stopped by a few weeks ago. I sat back down begrudgingly but surprisingly Rome was the hold out. He hovered by the back of his chair until my dad glared at him and pointed, \u201cAss in the chair solider.\u201d</p><p>Shaw was crying next to me and now instead of wanting to comfort her all I wanted to do was get as far away from her as possible. My dad cleared his throat and crossed his arms on the table.</p><p>\u201cThings in this family have been in shambles for a long time. There has been too much dishonesty and too much subterfuge for everyone\u2019s sake and I\u2019m done trying to sweep it all under the rug just to keep my wife happy because she isn\u2019t, none of us are.\u201d He rubbed a hand over his chin and suddenly he looked a hundred years older than he actually was. \u201cMargot don\u2019t pretend to not know that the way you\u2019ve been treating Rule these last few years is cruel and uncalled for. I lost my son the same as you and I\u2019m done watching you try and turn the remaining one into a stranger or into someone that hates us. He\u2019s a good boy; he works hard, loves his family and clearly has qualities that are good enough for our girl to appreciate. I\u2019m finished with freezing him out. We both know Shaw has been in love with him since she was a kid, we saw the way she watched him, the way she defended him and don\u2019t think for one second I didn\u2019t notice that\u2019s why you were always trying to shove her in Remy\u2019s direction.\u201d He heaved a sigh that seemed like it came all the way from my youth and looked at me and Rome. \u201cShaw isn\u2019t lying to you boys. Your brother did in fact live an alternative lifestyle. He might not have wanted your mother and me to know about it but teenagers are crap liars and he wasn\u2019t exactly as discrete with it as he might have thought.\u201d He slid a sideways look at my mom while Rome and I gave each other shocked looks. \u201cMargot thought it was a phase that\u2019s the main reason she was so eager to welcome Shaw into our home and family. At first she was convinced you were going to change him, make him like girls or more specifically like you but like I said it was pretty obvious your interest was in Rule and there was no way even if he had been straight that he would have done that to you. After a while we just adored you so much and saw how much love you were missing and how much you had to give that we couldn\u2019t let you go even though I never approved of the way Rem let everyone just believe there was more between you two than friendship.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I growled. \u201cHe would have told me.\u201d I smacked the flat of my hand on the table and my dad glared at me.</p><p>\u201cNo son, he wouldn\u2019t have. Remy struggled with it, he struggled with who he was supposed to be verses who everyone else thought he was and that\u2019s not something you\u2019ve ever done. You\u2019ve always owned you, and screw anyone that didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Shaw and then at the table. I had tried to change for her and it had been an epic failure. I climbed to my feet again and let my gaze fall on my mom.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve never been able to love me the way I am when you obviously had the capacity to love him regardless of his choices. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. I need to get out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d Rome looked as wild I was feeling on the inside. I looked down when soft hand clasped around my forearm. I flinched involuntarily and I think I actually saw her heart break in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cRule,\u201d her voice was a broken whisper. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She let me go and I almost couldn\u2019t talk over the lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cI understand what you meant about those closest to you hurting you the most now. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d But as Rome and I hurried out of the restaurant I wasn\u2019t sure I was telling her the truth and I refused to think about how much walking away from her like this hurt.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Shaw</p> <p>It had been three weeks give or take a day with no contact from Rule. No text messages, no phone calls, no e-mails, no carrier pigeons, just a whole lot of silence and heartbreak on my end. Rome hadn\u2019t even returned my calls or texts telling him goodbye and that I would miss him while he was gone. He had left for the desert mad at me and as upsetting as that was the daily battle I had with myself to call Rule and beg him to forgive me, to plead with him to understand that it was never my secret to tell regardless of our relationship was soul crushing. Ayden kept saying he would cool off and come around while Margot and Dale firmly believed he wasn\u2019t going to speak to any of us ever again. They were in the same boat as me, neither of the boys was speaking to them and Margot had nearly had a nervous breakdown when Rome had refused to allow them to drive him down to Fort Carson for his send off, instead the brothers went together leaving the rest of us out in the cold.</p><p>I was hurting but I was also sick and tired of my love and affection not being enough for anybody. I had loved Rule longer and harder than anyone else in my life and that still wasn\u2019t enough for him to look beyond his own hurt feelings and sense of betrayal to work things out with me. I was still pissed that he had spent the week prior to the bomb being dropped trying to act and behave in a way I had never asked for or wanted, but when I was alone at night and crying in bed I had to admit that while it was misguided it was still a really sweet gesture and if things hadn\u2019t gone so south we could have totally gone somewhere great with everything. I remembered telling him to beware of how bad things could be if we tried to do this and somehow even finding him in bed time and time again with every skanky girl this side of the Platte River couldn\u2019t hold a candle to this complete freeze out.</p><p>I tried really hard not to worry about what he was doing or who he was doing it with, but every day that passed it seemed more and more fatalistic. Whatever he had felt for me wasn\u2019t enough to get him past the hurt he was feeling and it came nowhere near the heart wrenching emotion I had for him so as much as it nearly killed me, as much as it pained me to let it go after so much time I had to get over him, had to work at moving on because even if he did get back in touch with me there was just too great a chance he had relapsed into his old ways and there was just simply no way I was going to survive that kind of betrayal from someone I cared so deeply about. So instead of languishing about it I forced a smile every day, picked back up the shifts I had dropped at work, threw myself into my school work and spent as much time as I could with Ayden and Cora. I was carful every time I was around Cora to give nothing away and she was just as carful to never, ever mention Rule or anything having to do with him.</p><p>To say my parents were excited that Rule was no longer in the picture was an understatement. My dad was so happy he took my newly repainted BMW and traded it in for a Porsche Cayenne because I was complaining one day about wanting an SUV to have when it snowed. I tried to refuse it, because I didn\u2019t need to be bribed considering Rule had effectively left me, but the title was in my name and the BMW was already gone so I begrudgingly accepted it. My mom was even worse. She called every day to check on me. The woman that had never had the time of day for me was suddenly overly interested in everything I did and everyone I spent time with, I think she was trying to subliminally let me know that as long as I kept unsavory characters out my life I would eventually gain her approval.</p><p>The funny thing was now that Rule was gone I didn\u2019t want it. I would have taken being disowned and disinherited a million times over if it meant I could just get him to talk to me, just get him to feel one half of what I had always felt for him. I think my disinterest made both my parents nervous. They were so used to dangling approval and acceptance in front of me like a golden carrot that now that it held no appeal for me they didn\u2019t know what to do. Having the power now should have felt exhilarating or exciting but instead just left me hallow. I should have fought them sooner, should have felt this way as soon as Rule and I started whatever it was we had been doing. I wasted so much time it just made me pile more sadness and regret on top of what I was already managing.</p><p>\u201cThanks Lou.\u201d I gave him one of the strained smiles that I was becoming a pro at and let him scoop me up in a bear hug as he walked me to my car after my shift. I hadn\u2019t heard a word from Gabe in as many weeks as I hadn\u2019t spoken to Rule, but it made me feel better to know someone still cared enough to make sure I was safe so I never turned Lou down when he offered to see me to my car, plus this was an odd night on for me meaning I had just picked up a shift because one of the girls was sick so Ayden wasn\u2019t working and I was alone. In fact my roommate seemed to have shaken out of her funk and was on a date with a very cute physics major that just happened to be as opposite from a rock and roller as one could get. She had gone out with him twice this week and seemed a little more like her old self so I was happy for her even if it meant it was one more night I spent wallowing in misery by myself. No one said the road to recovery was pretty after all.</p> <p>Lou set me back on me feet and gave me a peck on the forehead. \u201cI miss that young man of yours, Shaw. He was a smartass but a good kid.\u201d</p><p>I sighed because at least once a week I had this conversation with Lou. \u201cI know. I miss him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care girly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always try.\u201d</p><p>My new car was awesome; I\u2019m not going to lie. It purred like all good sports cars should but had no trouble navigating the snowy and icy downtown streets as I made my way all the way across town to my apartment letting The Avett Brothers sing me really sad songs about broken hearts all the way. It was late, well after midnight so there wasn\u2019t really anybody out and about considering it wasn\u2019t a weekend. A dog was barking from somewhere and I shivered involuntarily as I climbed out of the SUV because it was cold and dark so I automatically hated this part of my trip home and it just drove home the point that I was really and truly on my own now and that just burned deep in my gut. I was lucky to get a spot right in front of the building and scurried to the security door because my uniform wasn\u2019t meant to be worn outside even at the tail end of a Denver winter and punched in the code.</p><p>I blew warm breath on my fingers and dug around in my purse for my keys. Normally I had them out a ready to go but lately I had been so distracted by all the noise in my head and the heavy weight in my chest that maintaining my personal safety had fallen somewhere towards the bottom of the priority ladder. I had just pushed the key in the lock and was getting ready to turn the deadbolt when a deep voice said my name from over my shoulder. For a split second I was excited, unbridled relief flooding through me because the only guy that I figured would be waiting at my apartment for me was Rule, plus he knew the code to get in from when we were dating, but before I could turn around and do anything hard hands grabbed me by the back of the neck and shoved me face first into the door. I gasped in shock, some part of my brain flashing that I should be screaming for help right now but the door swung open with the flick of a wrist decked out in an all too familiar Tag Heuer watch and I went stumbling forward as rough hands pushed me inside.</p><p>My purse went flying and I was so stunned to see Gabe standing before looking as pressed and polished as usual, but with crazy eyes and a demented grin on his face that I couldn\u2019t even move.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d I knew this wasn\u2019t good. I wasn\u2019t safe with him, didn\u2019t want to be alone with him at all but the apartment was tiny and there weren\u2019t many options to run to. I had mace in my purse on the floor and the Taser Rule had bought me was resting uselessly in my new car, and right about now I was really regretting I hadn\u2019t let Rule leave his gun over here all the times he had asked when we were seeing each other.</p> <p>Gabe ran obviously agitated hands through his dark hair and watched me like any other predator watched its intended prey. \u201cI told your mother that we were working towards reconciliation and wanted to surprise you. She gave me the code. I followed you home from work since the freak is obviously out of the picture and the military monkey hasn\u2019t been around I figured now was as good a time as any for us to get on the same page.\u201d He was so cold, so matter of fact I didn\u2019t even think he understood he had just forced his way into my apartment and that I was trembling in fear. I crossed my arms over my chest to try and bluff away some of the terror I was feeling but he just continued to watch me like he was mentally taking me apart.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t even reading from the same book, Gabe. You need to go because in like two seconds I\u2019m about to start screaming my damn head off.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and made a tisk-tisk sound. \u201cWell you see Shaw things have really gone to shit for me. Ever since your thug of a boyfriend made me look like a pansy and my dad pulled the plug on my credit cards because of that little stunt you pulled with the restraining order things have been going downhill. I\u2019m failing my political theory class, my fraternity wants me out because apparently it\u2019s not okay to let some guy with the IQ of a sewer rat make you look like a sucker on your own campus, my parents are furious with me over the restraining order and the internship with your mother\u2019s campaign I wanted fell through because she simply didn\u2019t have time to get it together. So you see Shaw, ever since you decided to be a selfish whore and turn your back on all the great things we could have I\u2019ve been having to work double time to get what I deserve.\u201d</p><p>He was crazy, flat-out off his freaking rocker. I was trying to edge away from him because I knew if he moved close enough to get his hands on me things were going to go from terrifying to unimaginable horrible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a hard time with things Gabe but you shouldn\u2019t have messed with my car. It pushed Rule over the edge. I told you to leave me alone or you wouldn\u2019t like what he was going to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrieked because apparently bringing up Rule was the wrong thing to say. Gabe moved faster than I would have thought he was able to. He chased me as I peddled backward trying to keep as much space between us as I could. Unfortunately he caught me in the living room and even though I fought he was just bigger and stronger so he grabbed me by the throat and we struggled all the way to the floor. I kicked an end table over which made a huge racket and earned me a back hand across the cheek that split the side of my lip open. He sat all the way across my middle, pinning my arms to my sides and wrapped a hand around my throat. My eyes were watering from the tears of fear and the struggle I was now having breathing. I clawed at his squeezing hands and flailed my legs but he just bent over me and continued to tighten his hands around my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou think I care what that loser thinks? You think I give a single fuck what that degenerate wants to do to me? He\u2019s nothing. I told you all along that he wouldn\u2019t stick around, now look at you. All alone and finally doing things my way, I told you I would get my way, I always do.\u201d</p><p>I needed to get away from him, he was going to kill me, seriously kill me. My vision was starting to blur in and out and my lungs were on fire, but he just kept squeezing and sitting on me while telling me all about how we were getting back together and how I was going to call my mother and have her reconsider her actions about his internship now that we were a couple. I shook my head back and forth trying to gasp for any air and managed to get my hands between us enough that I jabbed my nails hard into the underside of his biceps making him wince and reel up enough that I could crawl a little bit away from him. I sliced my hand open on a piece of the broken lamp as I scrambled to get my feet under me only to be dragged back down by a cruel hand in my hair. I grunted as his weight landed squarely on my back and had to blink away a steady flow of blood as the side of my head made contact with the leg of the overturned table.</p><p>\u201cAyden is going to be home any minute.\u201d My voice was thready and thin from the pressure he had put on my neck but it wasn\u2019t like it mattered anyway he simply jerked me back to my feet and pressed me so that I was folded in half over the back of the couch. I was trying desperately not to think about how little of a barrier my work uniform offered in the way of deterring him but he bent his face low to mine not seeming to mind in the slightest that blood was getting everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cWho cares? You\u2019re my girlfriend Shaw, you belong to me. If your roommate comes home you\u2019re just going to tell her things got out of hand while we were making up.\u201d</p><p>He put so much of his weight on my back that the way he had my hand wrenched up behind my back couldn\u2019t take the torque and with a sickening pop that made both of us jerk my shoulder found its way out of the socket. I screeched in pain and went limp on that side. Fear and panic rose up hard and fast in my throat as I struggled knowing that I had to get to my purse for the mace or the kitchen for some kind of weapon to use against him. He let go of my hands now that one was totally useless and put one on the back of my neck to keep me bent over the couch while he used the other to start tugging and pulling at the bottom half of my uniform. He was muttering all kinds of broken sentences and talking about how he was going to make sure that I understood we were a couple. He was rambling about getting married and making our families one and I was starting to seriously cry because there was no way I was going to let him violate me in that way.</p><p>Fortunately part of the lamp I had kicked over landed close enough to the couch that a piece was imbedded in one of the cushions. While Gabe was busy tugging and pulling at my clothes I wrapped the fingers of my good hand around it. I could feel the little ruffly shorts I wore under the uniform start to rip and that was enough to spurn me into action. The only thing I could reach from my prone position was the meaty part of his thigh and I wasn\u2019t sure that I had enough strength to do any real damaged but I swung the glass shard as hard as I could and heard him swear as he suddenly jerked back. I slumped to my hands and screamed bloody murder as my weight landed on my injured arm. I crawled across the floor while he struggled to get the glass out and managed to get to my purse. I was just struggling back to my feet as he was thundering towards me but I got the mace out and the nozzle turned toward him and gave him a full dose right in the face while he bellowed like an injured bear. I squeezed the mace in my good hand and bolted out the door. I was sure I looked like an escapee from an insane asylum, I was crying hysterically, had blood all over my face and could barely talk because of the damage to my throat, but none of that mattered because as soon as I made it to the security door I ran smack dab into Ayden and collapsed into a blubbering mess as she caught me.</p><p>She was screaming my name, demanding to know what happened and I heard her dialing 911 on the phone but between the shock and pain I just shut down. I blinked up at her through the blood trailing down over my face and was aware dimly of a crowd coming out of some of the other apartments but it was just too much and everything faded to black. I was pretty sure she caught me before I hit the ground but the next time I was cognizant of anything I was strapped to a stretcher and getting loaded into the back of an ambulance. The lights from all the sirens were making my head throb and the young paramedic was firing a million and one questions at Ayden as she scrambled up into the back with me. She immediately grabbed my hand and squeezed and I noticed she was crying just as hard as I was.</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d My throat was on fire, talking made it feel like I was speaking through a forest of razor blades.</p> <p>Ayden brushed away her tears with shaking hands and I winced as the paramedic turned all his questions to me.</p><p>\u201cThe cops have him. His dad showed up as they were putting him in the back of the police car but the mace you used on him was hard to miss so he couldn\u2019t really deny he was in our apartment. How did he get in through the security gate?\u201d</p><p>I flinched as the paramedic prodded at my shoulder. He turned sympathetic eyes to me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get it reset. It\u2019s dislocated and I think the cut on your forehead is going to be deep enough that it\u2019s going to need to be glued or sewed shut. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell him it was okay because I was alive and at least Gabe hadn\u2019t gotten away with the ultimate violation but talking hurt too much so when asked about needing a sexual assault exam I shook my head no and squeezed Ayden\u2019s had as she started crying again.</p><p>\u201cMy mom.\u201d The words were broken and not just because of my throat. \u201cShe gave him the code because he told her we were getting back together.\u201d</p><p>Ayden let loose with a string of swear words that would have made Rule proud and we spent the rest of the short ride just clinging to one another. The next two hours was a blur of doctors and police officers. After the first fifteen minutes it was clear I wasn\u2019t going to keep up my end of the conversation with my vocal cords being as abused up as they wore so I had to resort to writing everything down for everyone. Gabe was in lock up at least for the night and there wasn\u2019t anything his dad could do to get him out. The detective that took my statement let me know there was a good chance his family would post his bail in the morning so he would be out but there was now a mandatory restraining order in place and there wasn\u2019t a thing his dad could do about it. Not that it mattered, they were keeping me at least a night in the hospital to see how bad the damage to my throat really was and I needed super strong pain killers to dull the migraine I was battling on top of the pain of having my shoulder placed back in the socket.</p> <p>My mom and Jack showed up sometime near dawn and my dad came as well. I told Ayden I didn\u2019t want to see any of them which of course caused a huge scene but when my mom started screaming that it was probably one of the thugs I had met while I was dating Rule Ayden totally lost her cool and informed all of them that if it hadn\u2019t been for my mother giving Gabe the code to the security door of the apartment this would have never happened it shut everyone right up. My dad forced his way in using his medical connections anyway and I spent a solid hour ignoring him and glaring at him while he apologized profusely over and over again. When he went to kiss my cheek I turned my head away and made sure he could see the absolute disgust in my eyes. Part of Gabe\u2019s obsession had to do with all the things these people encompassed and I just couldn\u2019t abide having it around me right now. They all left after a nurse threatened to call security if they didn\u2019t stop disturbing me.</p><p>Ayden pulled up a chair and propped her feet on the edge of the bed and we both fell into a fitful sleep as morning rolled around. I would only doze on and off needing more pain meds as my shoulder started to ache and various other parts of me that had been abused made themselves known. Ayden vanished somewhere around noon which was fine because it was another round of doctors and detectives. Gabe\u2019s dad had managed to get him out on bail but there was no arguing how bad he had hurt me and the police were looking at charging him with attempted murder. They made me tell my story over and over again and I never wavered from the brutal facts. Gabe was sick, he needed help, but more than that he needed to be somewhere where he wasn\u2019t able to do this to someone else. Feeling entitled enough to own another person despite their feelings in the matter was beyond mentally unstable.</p><p>Ayden came back in with yogurt and some granola looking sheepish. \u201cI called Cora to let her know what was going on. I didn\u2019t even think about the fact that she would freak out while she was at work.\u201d</p><p>I went completely still and turned wide eyes to my friend.</p><p>\u201cApparently Rule through a major hissy fit when he heard what happened and needless to say he\u2019ll be here in like five minutes. Sorry, but I figured you should know. I guess I can ask the hospital staff to keep him out if you want, though I have a feeling stopping him when he gets all worked up might be a chore and that\u2019s another ex you might be sending to the slammer for the night.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about him coming here. On the one hand all I had wanted for the last month was to see him, to have him acknowledge me, but on the other it shouldn\u2019t take a vicious and violent wake up call to make that happen. I sighed and rocked my head back and forth, she was right anyway, keeping him out if he had made his mind up to storm the castle was going to more of a hassle than I needed right now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine I can handle him.\u201d My voice was still raw and scratchy but at least it hurt marginally less to use it now.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re in any kind of shape to handle anything.\u201d She wasn\u2019t wrong. My arm was in a sling, I had a three inch gash glued shut and wrapped in a white bandage on my forehead matching the set up on my hand, my lip was split open and crusted with blood, I had a wicked ring of black and blue bruises circling the pale skin of my throat and to top it all off I was sporting a dandy set of black eyes from being shoved face first into both the door and the floor.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. He can come see that I\u2019m alright then go about his day which is all I\u2019m sure he wants to do.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a skeptical look and patted my feet where they were stacked up under the itchy hospital blanket. \u201cAlright then if you swear you\u2019re going to be okay then I\u2019m going to run and find someplace that has coffee that doesn\u2019t taste like tar and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wasn\u2019t going to ever really be okay again, I didn\u2019t think anyone that had been through what I had in the last few months would, but I wasn\u2019t scared of Rule and almost being raped by a lunatic had given me a whole new perspective on what was missing from my life and what I was going to do differently from this point on. I wanted to fidget with my hair, but it was snaggled together with dried blood and who knew what else and it wasn\u2019t like there was going to be any fixing my face. Rule was just going to have to face the horror show full on and deal with it.</p><p>I was messing around on my phone, returning texts from Cora and surprisingly most of Rule\u2019s boys, letting them know I was fine when the door opened and he came in. I looked up and watched him so I saw the initial anger that was stamped all across his handsome face quickly bleed into horror at the sight of me all battered and bruised. I saw his chest inflate and deflate as he sucked in an audible breath and moved to the end of the bed. We stared at each other in silence and I noticed absently that his hair was still normal and unruly as well as it\u2019s natural dark brown color. I still hated it because it made him look like a stranger. His eyes looked wild and too big for his face; a full blown blizzard was sweeping out of the cold depths. He was messing with his lip ring like he did when he was nervous and I realized if I didn\u2019t say anything there was a good chance we would spend the rest of the afternoon watching each other warily.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come. I\u2019m fine just a little banged up.\u201d</p><p>His big hands tightened on the end of the bed and I watched as the snake head bend and flexed with his aggravation.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to see for myself that you were alright. You could have called to let me know you were hurt.\u201d</p><p>I refused to look away from him and he seemed infuriated each time his gaze landed on another part of me that was broken. \u201cWell considering you haven\u2019t spoken to me in almost a month it didn\u2019t seem very logical to let you know what was going on.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I should have been there. You shouldn\u2019t have been alone.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and clenched my hands in the blanket. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you should\u2019ve been there but not because Gabe is crazy and not because I needed protecting from him, you should have been there because you cared about me as much as I care about you but that isn\u2019t the case. No one is to blame for this mess but Gabe, he\u2019s sick and broken and chances are even if someone had been with me he still would have gone all stalker crazy so it is what it is. I don\u2019t hold anyone accountable but him, besides my body is already on the mend it\u2019s my heart that still feels like it went through a food processer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw,\u201d he tried to interject something but I held up my good hand and looked him right in the eye. \u201cI\u2019m tired of my love not being good enough. I thought when this started with you I would be okay with whatever it was you were willing to give, thought I could love you enough for the both of us since I had been suffocating in it for so long, but I realize now that I deserve more.\u201d I blinked back tears that snuck up on me. \u201cI deserve it all because I\u2019m willing to give it all. I would have worked through the darkness with you, Rule. What I won\u2019t do is watch you walk away from me every time something happens that has the potential to hurt you. I\u2019m sorry I never talked to you about Remy but I told you all time and time again we weren\u2019t a couple, you had the undeniable proof on my birthday, you should be mad at him for keeping it a secret, not me. You were right all along; we don\u2019t trust each other enough to ever have had a chance at making this work. I think I wanted it too much and you didn\u2019t want it enough.\u201d</p> <p>I was surprised to see moisture in his eyes when I was done talking. The only time I had ever seen Rule cry was at Remy\u2019s funeral. He reached out a hand like he was going to lay it on my leg but retracted it before he ever made contact.</p><p>\u201cShaw what if I did love you?\u201d His voice was just a hint above a whisper. \u201cSeeing you like this it makes me want to murder Davenport with my bare hands, but it makes something deep inside me hurt. I\u2019ve missed you these last few weeks but I was also furious with you, I just couldn\u2019t get the two to ever line up.\u201d</p><p>I gave my head a sad little shake and let the tears gathered in my eyes fall. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019ve spent my entire life trying to live up to unreachable expectations, you were the only thing I ever wanted for myself and once I got you, you felt like you had to entirely change who you were in order to be with me, I refuse to put the same kind of expectations I always struggled with on someone else, even if I didn\u2019t ask that of them. Parts of us are great together, Rule but other parts of us just don\u2019t work. All this,\u201d I waved my good hand over my reclining form. \u201cWill knit itself back together. It\u2019ll be fine and we\u2019ll just go back to whatever it was we were doing before.\u201d I made sure that he understood I was talking about everything from the gash on my head to my abused heart. I would get over him, there just wasn\u2019t another option.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been in my life Shaw. We should\u2019ve been able to make this work.\u201d I wanted to shrug but I only had one working shoulder so that wasn\u2019t an option. Instead I swiped at my tears with the back of a hand and offered him up a shaky smile.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of things that maybe should have gone one way and didn\u2019t. I know most people thought you and I being together was a long shot anyway so we should just be grateful for what we had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m letting you down, letting everyone down and for once it\u2019s bothering the hell out of me. I just don\u2019t know how to work around what\u2019s going on up here.\u201d He tapped his temple with a finger.</p> <p>I was crying in earnest now and it was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that if he could just love me, just learn to let me love him the way he deserved, the way I desperately wanted to then it would all be fine but that wasn\u2019t the case. we needed to believe in each other, needed to trust that we were enough without trying to be other people in order to be together and that just wasn\u2019t happening so I closed my eyes and for once was the one to shut him out and fall into the dark.</p><p>\u201cSome things just aren\u2019t meant to be. I\u2019m getting tired can you send a nurse in on your way out. I think the pain killers are starting to wear off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too Rule, really I am too.\u201d Because I had spent a lifetime in love with him and as much as I wanted to be strong and pretend I was going to put it all behind me, letting go of what I felt for him was going to be the hardest thing I ever did. We stared at each other for a long, sad minute then he turned on his boot and left. When Ayden came back in the room I was crying inconsolably and she had to crawl up on the bed to wrap her arms around me. I cried longer than I ever had before, I cried until there was nothing left inside me to cry out and when I was all done I let my best friend hold me as I fell apart. The nurse Rule sent in came in with a pain killer but when she saw the state I was in she turned right back around and came back with a sedative.</p><p>I spent one more day in the emergency room but when I got out I realized there was no way on this earth I was going back to my apartment with Gabe out on bail restraining order or not. Luckily Cora had an extra couple rooms open in the house she rented in the Washington Park area because both of her roommates had recently got engaged to each other and had moved out to get their own place so Ayden dropped me off at her place and returned a couple hours later with all my essentials packed up for an extended stay. She said the property management company was working on getting the place cleaned up but even with that it still gave her the creeps to be there alone so it didn\u2019t take more than a week for her to ask Cora if she could crash in the last room at her house as well. They even agreed to let us break the lease without paying a penalty because of what happened to me. Being around the girls did wonders for both my mental health and my physical state. They never let me get down and someone was always there to remind me that everything I was feeling was temporary. They also refused to let me freak out over pressing charges against Gabe.</p><p>Things were moving fast and a few times it looked his father was going to use every trick he had to get Gabe off, but magically Alex Carsten had stepped in and now Gabe was on an ankle monitor and being charged with not only aggravated assault but breaking and entering as well. I didn\u2019t for one second think that was a favor my mother called in, but Rule and I were back to radio silence so I never called to ask him or to thank him. Of course the Davenport\u2019s had the best defense lawyer in town on the payroll, but all signs pointed to a slam dunk for me so I tried to stay positive.</p><p>I was refusing to talk to either of my parents. In fact I hadn\u2019t told either one of them I moved and I had changed my phone number within hours of leaving the hospital. The fact of the matter was I had nothing to say to either of them, all the things I had said to Rule held true for them as well. I deserved better and if they weren\u2019t willing to give me the love I showed them without restrictions or demands then I didn\u2019t want them in my life. I knew my mom was struggling with the fact that she had to be accountable for the fact that she ultimately is the one that let Gabe corner me alone, but like I told Rule the only person I blamed was Gabe. It was more important to me that she recognize that she should have never pushed him on me when I told her I was in love with someone else in the first place. If they couldn\u2019t figure out how to love and appreciate me for me then I would make do without them.</p><p>Ayden and I were settling into a new routine and we both adored Cora. It was nice to be living in a house rather than an apartment and as each day went by it got a little easier to breathe around the hole in my chest where my heart had once been. It had only been two weeks but it felt like a lifespan we had been apart. This time faking it to make it was so much harder, maybe because I knew for real it was the end but there was no fake smiling, no pretending to glide through life. I was struggling and I was struggling hard. I missed him. I loved him. I couldn\u2019t have him and it was killing me in an entirely different way than when I had loved him from afar without him knowing it. Cora was back to keeping all talk of work and the guys at bay but every now and then she would let something about him slip and every time it felt like a shard of glass in an open wound. It should have made me feel better that he didn\u2019t sound like he was doing much better than me but it didn\u2019t. We both deserved happiness, it just sucked that we couldn\u2019t seem to find it together.</p> <p>It was a couple days before Saint Patrick\u2019s Day which not only fell on a weekend this year but also happened to be Rule\u2019s birthday. The girls had decided that instead of sitting around being sullen and grousing about things that we needed to go out and have fun. I didn\u2019t want to go, I mean I really didn\u2019t want to go and not only because my face wasn\u2019t entirely pretty again but because I didn\u2019t think I could handle being in a crowd just yet. I was pretty sure it was going to be an awful time and that I was going to have zero fun but because I loved them I let them bagger me into agreeing to go and to my surprise after a few martinis at an out of the way lounge Cora knew about I relaxed and actually having a good time, strike that it was a fantastic time that I totally needed. Getting up for school the next morning was awful and I was tempted to skip but I had missed so much because of the attack that I couldn\u2019t afford to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was standing in front of the mirror doing my hair and trying in vain to cover up the yellowish remnant of my black eye when I had a startling revelation. Loving Rule had never been easy, it was always hard and painful and the payoff had been years coming, but I had never decided he wasn\u2019t worth it. To me loving him had never been a choice, it was just something I had decided was inevitable, just like I had decided him ever coming to care about me was never going to happen. Last night I had been so sure I wouldn\u2019t have any fun, that going out was going to be miserable and awful but after doing it I had a blast and it was totally worth the risk and harassing I had suffered to get me to go. I had done what I swore I never would, I had walked away because there was no guarantee in the end, no guaranteed happy ending for us.</p><p>I set my curling iron down on the sink and stared at myself in the mirror all the sadness and missing part of myself clear in the reflection staring back at me. Rule was the one thing I had always wanted and when it got hard to hold onto him I had just let go rather than fight to keep ahold of him and that wasn\u2019t right. I deserved love but I also deserved him and whatever form that his love came in. Rule wasn\u2019t a normal guy, there was never going to be hearts and flowers or poetry flowing with words that made me blush, what there was always going to be was give and take, ups and downs and a passion that burned both of us to the core. When he asked me at the hospital \u2018what if\u201d my answer should have been if you\u2019re asking you already do because I knew it now, could see it as clearly as I could see my own face in the mirror, Rule loved me he just didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what it was. Neither one of us really had shining examples of healthy loving relationships to draw from but the second he had told me he wanted to try I should have known he was falling in love with me. He never tried for anyone.</p><p>Someone knocked on the bathroom door and Ayden popped her head in the room. \u201cWe have to head out soon are you almost ready?\u201d</p><p>Considering I only had the right side of my head curled I think the answer was obvious. I turned to her with huge eyes. \u201cWe need to go dress shopping after school.\u201d</p> <p>She propped a hip in the doorway and lifted a dark eyebrow at me. \u201cAny particular reason why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule\u2019s birthday is this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCora might\u2019ve mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gotta be having a birthday party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might\u2019ve mentioned something about that as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell we have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I thought you were done with all that noise or is this martinis from last night talking?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and picked the curling iron back up. \u201cI have to give him a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? What if he\u2019s there with someone?\u201d</p><p>I cut her a look. That possibility hadn\u2019t even occurred to me. \u201cIs that likely?\u201d</p><p>She muttered something under her breath and brushed her long bangs out of her face. \u201cNo. Cora said he\u2019s been pretty much a hermit since you guys split, that and his temper is on fire so everyone that doesn\u2019t want to be flayed alive is pretty much staying the hell out of his way. What are you planning on giving him anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing I think he wants.\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cMore jewelry for his face?\u201d</p><p>I laughed a little. \u201cNo...me. I think the only thing he really wants is me. We were both just too messed up to realize it.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her hands together. \u201cWell it should be interesting either way.\u201d</p><p>Interesting didn\u2019t even begin to cover it but my new leaf was all about self-gratification and Rule was ultimately what I wanted to be gratified. I could only hope he hadn\u2019t gone so far down the tunnel that I couldn\u2019t pull him out.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Rule</p><p>\u201cHey dude, happy birthday.\u201d I traced a finger over the horseshoe on the headstone that I insisted on being there and cleared away the emotion that was clogging my throat. I didn\u2019t come here enough but every year on our birthday I made sure to stop by and let Remy know I was thinking about him. It was hard, being reminded once a year that he wouldn\u2019t be turning twenty-three right alongside me, that I was getting older and he was stuck in time at twenty, his life cut way too short. \u201cI\u2019m pretty pissed off at you right now. My life is all upside down and I can\u2019t seem to find my footing and all the stupid shit I normally do to ignore the hurt and confusion just doesn\u2019t hold any appeal. I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t just talk to me, why you used Shaw the way you did and I really don\u2019t get how you just let me act like a total asshole to her for years and years knowing she had feelings for me. Well here\u2019s a newsflash bro, I have feelings for her too and now things are so jacked up I can\u2019t see any way to make it right. Everyone always gave me hell for being difficult, for being temperamental and complicated, turns out you had more going on under the surface than Rome and I could ever imagine and yet you were still the favorite. Isn\u2019t that just a kick in the balls?\u201d For the second time in a few short weeks I felt tears well up in my eyes. \u201cShaw kept your secret. All this time, even when things got intense between us she kept your secret. She loves you but she loves me too and I just didn\u2019t know what to do with it so I got mad and I shut her out and as a result she got hurt and wouldn\u2019t let me back in when that\u2019s all I wanted. It sucks, love sucks and I feel like if you were here none of this would have ever happened in the first place so you suck too.\u201d</p> <p>There was no answer, just the sound of my shallow breathing and the wind moving the trees. I felt really alone for the first time in a long time and the loss of my twin was really pressing down heavily on me. The last month and a half had been rough; everything with Shaw had left me strung up and stripped bare. My normal response to that overwhelming flood of emotion would have been to drink my liver into submission and screw any and every girl that looked my way. Neither of those things had been on my agenda, booze wasn\u2019t enough to make my conscious stop screaming at me that I should have tried harder, should have handled my shock and anger better and the idea of taking anyone to bed that wasn\u2019t Shaw made everything I had below the belt freeze up. I was working a ton, trying to keep tabs on the situation with Gabe through Mark and Alex because I was determined to keep him away from her permanently even if she didn\u2019t know I was doing it and I was spending a lot of time with the boys licking my wounds. Even though she had been so upset with me for trying to change to be better for her, I think I had affected some major changes on my own despite myself and that wasn\u2019t bad. I was allowing myself to feel everything and while the feelings tied up in the failure of my relationship with Shaw burned at least I was processing them and not drowning them in bad habits.</p><p>I was getting ready to say goodbye when footsteps crunching on the thin layer of snow still covering the ground made me lift my head up. I felt my eyes narrow involuntarily and the corners of my mouth pull down when I recognized the figure making her way towards me. Every instinct I had was to get out there before she could ruin my day but I stayed put because she was looking right at me and for once there wasn\u2019t contempt or hatred shining out of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday Rule.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat because I had no clue what to say to her. I knocked my knuckles on the hard headstone and gave my brother a silent goodbye. \u201cI\u2019ll take off so you can have some time with him. I\u2019m sure today is hard for you.\u201d</p><p>I nearly fell over when she reached out a hand and put it on my forearm. My mom hadn\u2019t touched me voluntarily in years and it was enough to stun me into silence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for all of us but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. I actually called your work to see if I could maybe take you to lunch for your birthday. I figured you wouldn\u2019t answer if I called your cell so I asked your roommate where I might find you and he pointed me here. I guess if I hadn\u2019t been so busy trying to shut you out all these years I might have figured that out on my own.\u201d</p><p>I took a step away from her because I was pretty sure aliens had abducted my mom and that this creature before me wasn\u2019t real. The things coming out of her mouth were almost too much for me to take in. \u201cWhere\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome. He\u2019s working on getting through to your brother and after all that\u2019s happened I needed to be the one to come to you. Can I take you to lunch or maybe for coffee?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go. I didn\u2019t trust her or her motivations but it was my birthday and we were standing at my dead brother\u2019s grave so turning her down just didn\u2019t seem like a viable option or one I could live with later on.</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be alright.\u201d She gave me a smile that was sad, I mean really, truly sad and I realized for the first time that my mom had a dark tunnel she disappeared into as well, that maybe it was a trait I learned from her. We walked back to the parking lot in silence and I followed her back to Brookside even though all I wanted to do was keep in driving back to Denver. We stopped at the Starbucks I always hit up and I let her buy me a coffee while I settled into a semi secluded corner and stretched out my legs. I could tell she was nervous so I tried to relax and not be as guarded as I always was around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to a specialist. Your dad found someone here in town that deals with grief and family issues. I think it\u2019s been really helpful.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s a change.\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully and I caught a glimpse of the woman who had raised me before our relationship had been tainted with tragedy.</p><p>\u201cAfter the way things went at dinner your dad had reached his breaking point. It was go and get help or watch my husband of thirty-six years walk away from me. Dale has always been the only constant in my life, I wouldn\u2019t make it without him and it took realizing how alone I would be if he walked out the door to make me see what I\u2019ve done to my family.\u201d</p><p>I could only stare at her in shock. I didn\u2019t know what to say or do so I just kept sipping on my coffee and watching her.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me how I could love Remy knowing how different he was while I always had such a hard time with you and I want to try and explain things. It\u2019s not an excuse, our relationship has never been easy, we\u2019ve never been as close as I was with your brother and it started when you were both born. You guys were early which is pretty common with twins, only you came out strong and healthy bellowing your little head off, Remy wasn\u2019t so lucky. He had the cord around his neck and was breech, it took a lot of work and effort to get him here alive and well so from the start I think I focused more on him than on you which makes me a terrible mother but didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t love you both. Remy breast fed, you wanted formula and when you were old enough to walk Remy held onto my fingers and tottered all over the house, you pulled yourself up using Rome as a lever and then just took off on your own. Your brother always needed me, always wanted me and you, well you were like you are now; independent, fierce and determined to blaze your own way in the world and I just let you go. Your dad and I both just let you slip away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was having a hard time breathing but I was so focused on what she was saying that it didn\u2019t seem to matter. \u201cWhen Remy brought Shaw home I was so excited. He hadn\u2019t ever shown any interest in any other girl meanwhile your dad caught at least a girl a week sneaking out of your window and we were starting to put the pieces together about him. I was convinced he was just waiting for the right girl and Shaw had it all, she\u2019s lovely, well educated, comes from money it never occurred to me that she was too delicate, too broken down by her own family to be with someone as gentle and sweet as Remy. She needed someone strong, someone not afraid of all things that tormented her day in and day out so of course she picked you, she\u2019s loved you forever. I saw it, your dad saw it and even with that we let Remy use her and snow everyone into thinking they were an item because it was just easier than dealing with the truth.\u201d</p><p>She stopped fidgeting with her cup and met my stunned gaze. She had tears in her eyes which were nothing new, but these ones for once seemed generated by actual regret not overbearing anger and blame directed at me.</p><p>\u201cThe night of Remy\u2019s accident he called me. I knew he was on his way to pick you up and I told him not to go, that you were a grown man that could find his own way home. He got really mad at me, told me I needed to get over whatever it was that kept me from embracing you, from loving you as openly and fully as I loved him. I got angry back and told him he had no place to lecture me on how I interacted with you if he was going to keep living a lie. We had a huge fight, it was ugly and I threatened him. I told him I was going to let you and Rome know exactly who their brother was and he freaked out. He hung up and left to get you and those were the last words I said to my baby.\u201d</p><p>She was crying openly now and all I could do was sit there and let everything she said flow over me. \u201cI said it should have been you; put all my grief and responsibility on your shoulders because I was too weak to be accountable for my part in what happened to Remy. Out of all of us you\u2019re the strongest, you\u2019re the one that handled it the best and it was easier to blame you than look at you and realize what I had done. You never loved me the way Remy did and the farther away I pushed you the easier it was to feel less guilt. I\u2019m sorry I did it, you never deserved it. I felt like you were already lost to me so the idea of losing you wasn\u2019t as crippling as it was with Rome, but I realize now you were never lost I had just shoved you as far and as hard away as I could because of what may or may not happen and that\u2019s not healthy or acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>We sat in silence while I tried to work through all of it. I couldn\u2019t just accept her apology, too much time and too many hurtful words and actions had been exchanged for that, but I could recognize that we were all human and prone to making careless mistakes with people that we cared about and try and work towards a resolution from there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot to take in mom and I\u2019m not sure what you expect from me after telling me all that.\u201d</p><p>She swiped at her cheeks with the back of her hand and gave me a rueful grin. \u201cI don\u2019t expect anything but I do want you to know that your dad and I are committed to putting this family back together, including Shaw. I know you\u2019re mad she didn\u2019t tell you about Remy but I also saw the way you two were looking at each other. I saw the way you were with her Rule and I know you have never been like that with anyone else. She has always thought that you were worthy and in need of love even when you did your absolute best to convince the rest of the world that you weren\u2019t interested in being loved. I just think you should consider that before deciding to walk away from her for good.\u201d</p><p>Was my mom, the woman that had made it her mission for the last three years to make sure I knew I was the lowest form of humanity trying to give me relationship advice? Was she seriously trying to tell me to try again with Shaw?</p><p>\u201cShe actually walked away from me. She told me that trying wasn\u2019t enough, that she needed to know that I loved her for sure and I just couldn\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re ultimately good for each other.\u201d</p> <p>My mom reached across the table and grabbed my hand that was resting by the cup. I nearly jumped out of my skin.</p><p>\u201cShe needs your strength and you need her to teach you how to love. She comes from a really awful group of people; Rule. She needs someone that can stand by her while she deals with that and you need someone that\u2019s not scared of you, someone that can love all the different parts of you and not ask you to change any of them. She\u2019s done it for years even if you didn\u2019t know it. She was loyal to your brother, she kept his secret even though it caused problems between the two of you, and she\u2019ll be loyal to you too.\u201d</p><p>We sat in silence while her words washed over me. I just didn\u2019t know what to say but I did know that things weren\u2019t the same without Shaw in my life. The last couple months had been hallow. I didn\u2019t just miss her in my bed, which I did...a lot, I missed her in the morning when I had breakfast, I missed hearing from her in the afternoon and sending her naughty little text messages that I knew made her blush, I missed her coming by the shop for dinner and hanging out while she did her homework. I just missed her and things weren\u2019t as good as they were when she was around.</p><p>\u201cI have to say this was one of the more surprising birthday\u2019s I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve some peace and I need to be responsible for the part I\u2019ve played in making it so hard for you to recognize true and honest to God love when it\u2019s staring you in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go.\u201d I pushed away from the table and looked down at her. I was grateful she didn\u2019t get to her feet and try and hug me because I was nowhere near ready for that but when she offered me up a small smile I didn\u2019t hesitate to grin back at her.</p> <p>\u201cThanks mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have great things Rule, including a happy and whole family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne step at a time mom.\u201d</p><p>I was walking out of the shop when I almost plowed over the tiny brunette that had been checking me out the last time I was here. I grabbed her upper arms to steady her and let her go so I could move past her. What I needed to do, who I needed to get to was suddenly so clear it was the light at the end of the tunnel and I knew, just knew that if I could make it right the darkness wouldn\u2019t pull me under anymore.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I was going to move around her but she counteracted my move and put herself back squarely in my path. I frowned down at her while she batted long eyelashes up at me.</p><p>\u201cNo girlfriend this time, isn\u2019t that just a shame?\u201d I recoiled because this is what was out there, girls that would flirt with me, girls that would go home with me knowing I was seeing someone. It wasn\u2019t enough anymore. I deserved better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually on my way to go get her now.\u201d</p><p>The brunette tried to pout prettily but it did nothing for me.</p> <p>\u201cI would never have guessed you and Shaw would end up as a thing. She\u2019s been frigid since high school and I thought she was in love with your brother. Doesn\u2019t it freak you out being a replacement?\u201d</p><p>Normally something like that would have made me see red, would have made my damn head explode but I got it now, this girl was nothing, her opinion didn\u2019t matter and her misinformation was just laughable. I was done letting anyone, including a clueless stranger use Remy as a weapon against me.</p><p>\u201cI gotta run. Next time I\u2019ll be sure to go in the opposite direction if I see you coming.\u201d She gasped in outrage but I didn\u2019t care I was too busy sliding around her and sending a text to Cora to find out if Shaw was still hanging around her house. I wasn\u2019t guaranteed an answer back because the girls had bonded and Cora was all for me staying the hell away from Shaw but maybe because it was my birthday she shot back that Shaw and Ayden had both worked a day shift today so they should be at the house. I would prefer to say what I had to say to Shaw without an audience considering Ayden wasn\u2019t exactly my biggest fan right now. I was however willing to pick her up and move her out of my way if she didn\u2019t let me get to my girl.</p><p>It was late afternoon by the time I got back to the city. I was glad I had taken the day off considering all the unexpected and life changing revelations I had been fielding all day. I was supposed to meet up with the guys for dinner and then I was having a pseudo party at Cerberus. Jet\u2019s band was playing and all my friend\u2019s and some of my regular clients were swinging by for a drink or two. It was lame that Rome was already gone, but we had grown so much closer while he was here I told him repeatedly I would just drink his share as well as my own so that he could be here in spirit still. All I knew was that it wouldn\u2019t be any kind of celebration until I got to Shaw and told her what I had to say.</p><p>When I got to Cora\u2019s house my nerves started to act up. If this was the last chance I had to make this work, if she still sent me on my way I wasn\u2019t sure how I would handle it. There was a good chance that Shaw was going to break my heart and that was big and scary because I didn\u2019t even know I had a heart to break before she came along. I skirted past a brand spanking new Porsche SUV and was relieved to see that Ayden\u2019s Jeep was nowhere in sight. I could hear music coming from inside the house. She was listening to The Heartless Bastards and the sentiment made me chuckle as I rang the doorbell. I had to wait a good five minutes before the music went down and I saw the blinds next to the door twitch. I was proud of her for not just opening it without checking to see who it was, but my nerves ratcheted up even higher when after seeing that it was me she took another few minutes to pull the door open.</p><p>When she did I stopped breathing and forgot everything I wanted to say. She was obviously on her way out somewhere. She had on a super tight, super short black dress that made the green in her eyes electric and the pale blond of her hair glow around her head like a halo. I obviously interrupted her because she was bare foot and didn\u2019t have any makeup but had her hair all curled up in a complicated style. She still looked so perfect it was enough to make my eyes hurt. The idea that she might be going on a date with someone else immediately crashed into all my hard won resolve and made my back teeth snap together.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d It wasn\u2019t eloquent or romantic but I was having a hard time not over thinking this and she didn\u2019t seem to mind. She shivered in her almost nonexistent outfit and took a step away from the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in. It\u2019s cold out.\u201d</p><p>I followed her into the house and was relieved when she went into the kitchen and pulled out a beer for me. It gave me something to do with my hands and a minute to get my head together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much of a present but it\u2019s the best I can do on short notice. Happy birthday Rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, are you uhh headed out somewhere?\u201d I let my hungry gaze travel from the top of her shiny head to the tips of her bright red painted toes; she was working towards being all healed up and looked like everything I ever wanted with a few bruises and bumps thrown in to remind me how close I had come to losing her all together. \u201cYou look very nice.\u201d</p><p>She grinned sheepishly and twirled the ends of her hair around her finger. \u201cI was getting ready to go out later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh well I won\u2019t take up too much of your time then. I just wanted to talk to you real quick.\u201d</p><p>She leaned up against the kitchen counter while I took a seat at one of the kitchen table chairs.</p><p>\u201cAyden forgot about something she had to do for her I-Chem class so she won\u2019t be back for a couple hours and Cora doesn\u2019t get off until seven. We\u2019re going to dinner.\u201d</p><p>I was so happy to hear that she didn\u2019t have a date with another guy that I let out an audible sigh that had her raising a pale eyebrow at me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about Rule? It\u2019s nice to see you and all but I have to say I\u2019m kinda surprised you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell her that I needed her, that I wasn\u2019t the same without her, that she was my entire world but what fell out of my mouth was, \u201cI had coffee with my mom today.\u201d</p><p>I saw her eyes get big. \u201cWow. That\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe found me at Remy\u2019s grave. I was alternately chewing him out and telling him how much I miss him. I go every year on our birthday. Did you know that dad threatened to leave her if she didn\u2019t go get some help?\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip and it took every ounce of self-control I had not to climb up and replace her teeth with my own.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what Dale told her but I knew it was bad. They\u2019re used to you pulling away but having Rome shut them out and refuse to let them see him off really did some damage. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s helping. You guys are a family, you need each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing Shaw; I never thought I did until you. I never thought I needed anyone or anything until you got into my head and started breaking down all the walls I had built around all my feelings.\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other in a tense silence. Until she sighed softly and uttered, \u201cI\u2019m not sorry. It\u2019s not a bad thing to feel, it\u2019s not awful to care about other people.\u201d</p><p>I watched her carefully. I couldn\u2019t tell how she was feeling and it made laying it all out on the line for her even more frightening. \u201cNo it\u2019s not bad but it scares the hell out of me. I never had anything to lose before and losing you nearly undid me.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath and I saw a myriad of emotions cross her eyes and face. \u201cIt undid me too.\u201d</p><p>I shoved hands through my hair and met her gaze trying to let her see everything I was feeling. I wasn\u2019t good at expressing this kind of emotion and it was frustrating me. \u201cI want you to know that there\u2019s been no one but you Shaw. You\u2019ve got me running in circles and so wound up there could never be anyone but you. I miss you. I know you want undying declarations of love, I know trying isn\u2019t an option that I just have to do it but I want you and I need you and more importantly I get that you need me too. Not some watered down synthetic version of me that makes being together easier but the fully leaded, hard to handle me that you can lean on because I\u2019m strong Shaw and I\u2019m not going to let anyone, your family especially, devalue all the wonderful things you have to give.\u201d</p> <p>I got to my feet and walked to where she was leaning. She had enormous eyes and I could see her chest moving up and down frantically with rapid breaths. She still hadn\u2019t said anything so I pulled the pen I had stashed in my back pocket out and laid my hand out. \u201cI\u2019m not Jet so I can\u2019t write you a song that makes you understand how important you are to me. I\u2019m not Nash so I can\u2019t find a building and paint you a mural that makes see that it all starts and ends with you for me.\u201d She placed her hand palm up in mine and didn\u2019t look away as I bent my head and began to do a quick sketch with the ball-point across her super pale skin. \u201cI\u2019m a tattoo artist, I\u2019ll probably always be a tattoo artist and I don\u2019t know how that plays into your future or the future you have planned after school and frankly I don\u2019t care. This is what I have to offer you Shaw and just like you let me be your first, I\u2019m letting you be mine,\u201d I covered her entire palm with a detailed drawing of a sacred heart, it matched the one I had inked on the center of my chest. It had flames dancing up the back, a crown of thorns on top of it, a spray of roses along the bottom and in the center I drew a scrolling banner with my name in the center. \u201cHere\u2019s my heart Shaw. You have it in your hands and I promise you\u2019re the first and last person to ever touch it. You need to be careful with it because it\u2019s far more fragile than I ever thought and if you try and give it back I\u2019m not taking it. I don\u2019t know enough about love to know for sure that\u2019s what this between us is, but I know that for me it\u2019s you and only you from here on out and I can only promise to be careful and not push you away again. Life without you in it is doable, but if I have a choice I want to do it with you by my side and I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m not running away from the work it takes to make that happen. Shaw I\u2019m not scared of us anymore.</p><p>When I was done I was breathless but I felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders because even if she rejected me at least she knew how I felt. I let go of her hand and she curled her fingers around the drawing that covered her palm. When I lifted my eyes to hers I was a little surprised to see tears shining in the emerald depths. She put the hand that I didn\u2019t draw all over on the side on my face and ran her thumb over my bottom lip, pausing at the hoop. Her mouth crooked up on one side and just like that I knew everything was going to be alright.</p><p>\u201cI was going to crash your birthday party tonight.\u201d We were close but still separated by a few feet. I couldn\u2019t look away from her and she opened her other hand and put it on my chest over where the heart matching the one I just gave her laid. \u201cThat\u2019s where I was going later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have been happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little brighter. \u201cI decided the other day that I had to stop deciding how things were going to happen before giving them a chance to play out. You shut me out Rule but only because I let you. I was so worried about what you were doing, about what would happen I just let you close the door and when you wanted to pull it back open I was so scared of how bad being without you hurt that I just didn\u2019t want to give it space to happen again. That wasn\u2019t fair to either of us. I\u2019m not afraid of the work or us anymore either and I promise to not let you shove me away again. I do need you Rule and you are the only thing I have ever wanted just for me. I should have tried harder to hold onto you because you\u2019re right, I need to be careful with this,\u201d she tapped her palm with the heart on it against the one pounding under my skin. \u201cIt\u2019s precious and the best gift I could ever ask for.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms tight around her and lifted her off her feet. I wanted to kiss her, wanted to do all the things I had spent two months missing out on doing to her, I wanted to make her forget Davenport\u2019s cruel hands and imprint on her every single thing I felt about her but just as I was about to put my mouth on hers she pulled back and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIf you start that there is no way you\u2019re going to make dinner and your party with everyone tonight.\u201d</p><p>She was right but I didn\u2019t care. I had her and that was the only present I wanted. It must have shown on my face because she pressed a boring closed mouth kiss on my lips and wiggled out of my grasp. \u201cI love you Rule, I really do and I have something I want to give you for your birthday but it has to wait until later when we\u2019re alone and the threat of Ayden or Cora bounding in isn\u2019t a likely scenario so go have fun with the guys. I\u2019ll see you at the bar later and then we can celebrate in private.\u201d</p> <p>I pouted. That\u2019s right I pouted like a little kid denied his favorite toy which in a way I was. We had been apart too long. I needed to touch her, needed to get my hands on her but she wasn\u2019t cooperating at all. \u201cCome on Shaw, just a little kiss. It\u2019s my birthday and I missed you so bad.\u201d I sounded whiny and not badass at all but I could tell she was about to cave in by the way she slithered a little closer to me but the moment was ruined when the lock on the front door jingled and a moment later Ayden came sweeping through in all her long legged, dark haired glory. She took one look at me and Shaw and grinned.</p><p>\u201cHalleluiah! It\u2019s about time you two idiots figured out that you were made for each other.\u201d</p><p>Shaw laughed and shook her head. She gave me another brief kiss and moved away. \u201cTonight. I promise it\u2019ll be worth the wait.\u201d I begrudgingly agreed even though I still wanted to make out but she clearly wouldn\u2019t be swayed and I had to admit my curiosity was peaked as to what kind of gift she wanted to give me in private. I went home and took a shower, a freezing cold one and got ready for the night. I didn\u2019t want to drink too much because there was no way I was letting booze inhibit my reunion with my girl. I had never give much credence to the fact that being with someone you cared about making sex so much better but it was true.</p><p>The guys took me to the Buckhorn Exchange so we could gnaw on giant pieces of wild game like cavemen and act like a bunch of general jackasses and now that things were back on track with Shaw I felt lighter and happier than I had in months and they could tell. They all gave me shit endlessly about my chronic bad mood and advanced levels of dickheadness but I could tell they were relieved and grateful that I was back where I needed to be. Dinner was fun but I was ready to get on with night so I could take Shaw home and have some proper make up sex to cement this as the best birthday ever.</p><p>The bar was packed wall to wall with people trying to wish me a happy birthday. Even Uncle Phil had come out for the occasion. I accepted pats on the back and hugs as I looked for a particular blond head in the crowd. It took some skill to avoid shot after shot getting shoved in my direction but I managed to do it when I caught sight of a shimmer of white and black near the stage. Shaw was posted up front with Ayden and Cora and it irked me to no end that Jet was already at the table getting his flirt on with the beautiful brunette. Ignoring everyone else calling my name and clamoring for my attention I scooped my girl up even though she was in really tall heels and for once almost on a similar level with me and sealed my mouth over hers. I didn\u2019t care that she muttered a startled protest. I wanted a kiss and it was my birthday so I was getting a damn kiss from this girl that was my world.</p><p>She wiggled a little until she could get her hands in my hair and I made sure it was worth her while as I stroked across her yielding tongue with my own. She gave a little moan and I moved a hand to her ass pressing as hard into her as I could until I became aware of the roar of catcalls and applause surrounding us. I lifted my head which left us both breathless and panting and was greeted by a standing ovation from pretty much every single person in the bar. I shared a shocked look with Shaw and we simultaneously burst out laughing. I took a brief bow with she curtsied making everyone else laugh along with us as she pressed back up against me to give me another kiss that turned my head to mush. The combination of a few beers, her soft mouth and that ridiculously short dress was enough to have me cutting out of my own party early. We hung out long enough for Jet to get on strange and sing me happy birthday and for me to instruct Nash to maintain a low profile when he came home as well as grab whatever gifts I had collected from people and then I was hustling Shaw out the door well before midnight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We held hands in the truck on the way home and made small talk about what we had been up to in our time apart. I was glad to hear that she was pretty much doing the same things I was and that she was handling the situation with Gabe in a professional and no nonsense matter. She was amazing and I was truly lucky to have her as mine.</p><p>When I let her into the apartment I was ready to just drag her to the bedroom and have my way with her but she kicked off her sexy heels and padded to the kitchen to grab us a couple drinks. I was anxious and aroused but I didn\u2019t want to push her so I followed her to the couch and took the beer she handed me. She sat facing me and reached out to put her hands in my hair. It felt nice but there were plenty of other places I wanted her hands so I asked her, \u201cWhy are you always playing with my hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you change it so much and it always feels different. This is the first time it\u2019s all natural and I can\u2019t believe how soft it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked the hawk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. I like it however it is but when it\u2019s normal like this it makes you look more approachable.\u201d</p><p>She seemed nervous which was weird. This was an area we had never had any issues with before so I wasn\u2019t sure what to do to put her at ease. I clicked the neck of my beer against hers and gave her a lopsided grin. \u201cHappy birthday to me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back and shifted so that her hair slid forward. \u201cSo I need to tell you something before you get your present.\u201d</p><p>Her tone was pretty serious so my mind immediately went to all the worst possibilities, there had been someone else while we were apart, Gabe had hurt her worse than anyone knew and she wasn\u2019t ready for intimacy yet, she didn\u2019t really want to be in a relationship with me, she was moving to Peru and it took every single ounce of self-control I had not to freak out and ruin whatever progress we made today.</p><p>\u201cAlrighty hit me with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw I\u2019m dying here. Just talk to me.\u201d She put her beer down and scooted closer to me on the couch which pulled the hem of her dress tantalizingly up her pale thighs. If she didn\u2019t spit it out soon I was taking her to bed regardless and we could just hash it out in the morning. She put a hand on either side of my face and pulled me down so that we were literally eye to eye.</p><p>\u201cAll that stuff about being nice and trying to be someone different to make being together easier applies to the bedroom too, right?\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyebrows shoot up and I tugged on her tiny waist until she was straddling my lap. \u201cWhat are you getting at Casper? Just spit it out.\u201d</p><p>She made a face and I saw her skin heat to a pretty shade of hot pink. \u201cNice Rule, the Rule that goes with this hair is boring in bed, I don\u2019t like him. I just want normal Rule back and everything that comes with him. It\u2019s been awhile so I just wanted to make sure we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>I barked out a laugh and gave her a squeeze while working my hands up under the material of her dress to get a handful of her very bitable ass. \u201cI can\u2019t decide if I should be thrilled or insulted.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned forward so that our mouths were almost touching. \u201cI just want you.\u201d</p><p>I grunted in response and decided the time for talk was over. She gave a squeal of surprise when I climbed to my feet with her still in my arms. She shifted her legs so she was wrapped around my waist and twined her arms around my neck in a loose hold.</p><p>\u201cThe present giving can take place in the bedroom I assume.\u201d She didn\u2019t answer but instead started to kiss all along the side of my neck. It made my blood thunder in my ears and I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to make it to the bed when her sharp little teeth clamped down on my ear and she started whispering every dirty thing I ever wanted to hear into my ear. I kicked the door shut with the heel of my boot and kissed her all the way down to the black comforter on my bed. Her legs parted and I found myself cradled in the only place I wanted to be ever again. I hooked a finger in her very tiny panties and striped them off. Had I known how little she was wearing under that short dress I wouldn\u2019t have made it even half way through the party. We both groaned at the first press of skin on skin as she grabbed the back of my t-shirt and pulled it off over my head. We still had enough clothes that I could kiss her and kiss her, and rub against her with delicious friction while winding us both up to the point we were panting and straining against each other in the most enjoyable way. I was glad she didn\u2019t want it soft and gentle, glad she could take whatever I threw at her because it had been too long and I felt like the top of my head was going to come off. I made a guttural noise of protest when she maneuvered free and pushed me over onto my back. Knowing she was naked under her dress had me itching to get my hands on everything that was damp and achy but she had other ideas.</p><p>She was messing with my belt buckle and telling me to take my boots off but apparently I was too slow to comply because she had it all handled and I was spread out below her in nothing but my birthday suit in no time flat. She turned her back to me and asked me to undo the zipper that ran from her shoulder blades to the base of her spine. I was eager to oblige her especially when all the black material covering her satiny skin puddled in a pool on the floor at her ankles. I ran my fingers along the pronounced ridge of her spine and was pleased to watch a trail of goose bumps follow in the wake. She looked over her shoulder at me and I felt my heart turnover at the mischief in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cSo I actually got your present a while ago, before we started having problems which was lucky I guess because now they\u2019re healed and you can actually touch them.\u201d She pulled her long hair up in one hand and turned to face me as my curiosity peaked because she had her arm across her naked chest which made her climb back up on the bed so that she was straddling my waist interesting and fun to watch and had my erection sticking up like a led pipe between the two of us. She dropped her arm and my eyes snapped as wide as they could. I was pretty sure I was drooling because while Shaw was the most beautiful woman in the world to me, Shaw sporting nipple rings, naked and on top of me was enough to make my brain short circuit and all remaining blood in my body shoot right between my legs.</p><p>\u201cOh man that is so fucking hot.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little which turned to a whimper when I circled the cool metal with a finger. \u201cThat\u2019s my birthstone.\u201d The jewel in the center of the ring was a shiny, pretty bluish-green aquamarine, delicate and pretty just like her.</p><p>She hissed out a breath when I tugged on the ring softly and I saw her eyes droop a little in pure unadulterated desire. I knew better than anyone how much intimate piercings could enhance a sexual experience and I would make it my personal mission in life to show Shaw everything I had ever learned. She bent down for a kiss.</p> <p>\u201cHappy birthday Rule, I\u2019m giving you me for now and forever and if you want to give me back I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>I flipped us back over and kissed her like it was the end of the world, kissed her like we would never get to kiss again, kissed her like, well like I loved her and was never going to let her go. The slide of tongues and press of my lip ring imprinted on her how much I missed her. The bite of teeth left marks that let the world know we were claimed, the press of nails into tender skin had both of us breathing hard and by the time I got my hands between her legs and my mouth on that pretty jewelry decorating even prettier nipples we were both a wild tangle of grasping need and less than tender groping. I felt her nails break skin on the curve above my ass as I worked her into a frenzy with my hands and mouth but I wasn\u2019t nearly done. We had been apart too long and the weeks before I was trying so hard to be something I wasn\u2019t that I had tainted something that was amazing between us and I wanted to erase all of that, only my girl had other ideas.</p><p>\u201cRule,\u201d She had one hand pulling on my hair and the other reaching between us in search of my cock that was throbbing insistently between our stomachs. \u201cWhile I appreciate the foreplay and the fact that nice Rule is clearly gone if you don\u2019t fuck me in the next two seconds I\u2019m going to scream. It\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were bright and shiny and while I would have liked to get her off at least once before unleashing all my pent up sexual frustration on her it didn\u2019t look like she was going to give me a choice in the matter. I grunted because her fingers curled around my dick and slid across the skin stretched tight by the barbells and my rampant erection. She wasn\u2019t playing fair so I lifted myself up in a vertical push up so that I was poised at her burning hot entrance and let her guide me home. We both went still at the initial contact, the absolute perfection of the two of us together like this was just a lot to take in and we had to give it a minute to sink in. She hitched her hips up and I slid all the way in until both of us let out a different swear word. It wasn\u2019t slow and sweet, more like frantic and wild but it was wonderful and so damn hot I thought we were going to burn each other up. The brush of the metal in her tight nipples made me growl every time they brushed against my chest and I could feel it every time the top ball on the head of my cock hit her clit because her body bowed up and her breathing got choppy and wild. It was the kind of sex I could only have with her and when I felt her come apart around me I realized I might not really know what love was on my end, but I could recognize it so clearly shining out of her when she looked at me that I couldn\u2019t help but feel she had to see the same thing when I looked at her. I picked up the pace felt her run her hands up and down my back and grab onto my ass and then shattered into a brilliant mess that I didn\u2019t want to ever put back together.</p><p>She turned her head and kissed me on the temple. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my face into the curve where her neck met her shoulder and sucked the skin between my teeth. \u201cI\u2019m going to love you Shaw.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes crinkled at the sides. \u201cYou already do.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to say anything because I figured she was probably right. Me and this girl and spent too much time trying to be too many different things for too many wrong reasons for too many other people now it was just up to us to be ourselves for each other and love each other for all the right reasons. As she curled up next to me and threw her leg across my waist I knew that somewhere, somehow this is how it was always supposed to be and maybe just maybe this was a gift I could share with Remy because I was happy, Shaw was happy and ultimately that\u2019s all he would have wanted for either of us.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>8ish months later</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t lay still and quit wiggling around I\u2019m going to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say that. We do this enough that you know exactly what you\u2019re getting into. I\u2019m almost done so stop complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be gentler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it when I\u2019m gentle. Seriously Casper you are the worst client ever which is a shame because all this white skin takes ink like a dream.\u201d I glared at Rowdy as he peered over the short wall again and leveled him with a death glare. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop trying to get a look at my girlfriend\u2019s ass you\u2019re going to need to find a new job because I\u2019m going to break all your fingers.\u201d Shaw giggled and turned her head where it was resting on her crossed arms propped up on the she was laid out on the table before me. The current piece I was working on for her covered her entire right side from the base of her armpit to the bottom curve where her sweet ass met her thigh and everything in between. It was huge and graphic and arched all long her delicate rib cage. I still had about three hours of color and shading to add to it but since the canvas practically lived at my apartment I wasn\u2019t worried about finding time to finish it up. But while I was working on it now she was practically naked, covered only by my hoodie and a very tiny pair of shorts. I knew the guys in the shop were digging the view, they always did when I worked on her, but it was hard to concentrate and keep the lurkers at bay at the same time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rowdy flipped me off but grinned in good humor. My friends loved Shaw, loved that she made me tone all my crazy down and became an easier guy to live with and be around. It was almost a year in and while I still wasn\u2019t the easiest person in the world to get along with I was making real strides in at least being a more tolerable human being. \u201cThat could be the very best piece I\u2019ve ever seen you do. Are you going to put it in your portfolio when it\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>The piece was a very intricate, very colorful day of the dead inspired grim reaper. The face on the woman was beautiful and tragic and she held onto an exact replica of the heart I had initially drawn on Shaw\u2019s palm all those months ago. Shaw had insisted on two things in the design, she wanted the sacred heart represented and she wanted it to resemble the grim reaper on my side. I never would have thought Shaw was going to get as interested in body modification as I was, but after only a month of us being an official couple she had asked me to draw her a bunch of tiny snowflakes in different colors of blue, gray and white. When I asked her why she said my eyes reminded her of winter and she wanted something to keep with her for always that reminded her of me so she now had a snow storm that started behind her left ear and trailed across the back of her neck to base of her right shoulder. It was one of my favorite places on her body to traced over with my tongue and loved not only that she got something that reminded her of me but that I was the one to put it on her. A couple of months after that she wanted me to draw her up a horseshoe with Remy\u2019s name in it so she was also rocking a memorial tattoo for my brother that made me feel good every time I saw it on her inner arm when she hugged me or we held hands. The piece I was working on today was a hundred times bigger and more detailed that either of those, it made a statement and I had to admit I loved it, loved the design, loved that she trusted me enough to permanently alter her and loved that I was the one that was going to see it every day when she got into bed beside me.</p><p>I ran the paper towel I was using to wipe away excess ink and blood off of her over her hip and cleaned her up. I gave her a light tap on the ass and snapped off my gloves. \u201cThat\u2019s up to Shaw. If she wants it in there I will, if not it\u2019s cool.\u201d I flexed my fingers as she swung her legs around the table so I could slime tattoo goo all over her and wrap her up so she didn\u2019t ooze blood and ink all over the place until I could get her home. The hand that had her name inked across the knuckles folded up and brushed against her cheek as I snuck a kiss. As a professional tattoo artist I knew all the mojo and all the warnings about tattooing a significant\u2019s name anywhere on your body but I didn\u2019t care. I liked looking down and seeing her name there, liked when I held my hands next to each other our names were side by side forever on my skin. I had also had Nash ink a perfect little replica of Casper the Friendly Ghost behind my left ear so that I had something that reminded me of her in the same place she had something that reminded her of me. It was kind of cheesy but she thought it was sweet and the way she had showed her appreciation was enough to keep me smiling for days so who gave a fuck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Thanks love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d I kissed her again as she hopped of the table carful to keep all the good stuff covered up as she went into the bathroom to get dressed. She trailed a finger across the bald side of my head where I had it shaved. The mohawk was back at alternating intervals and she hadn\u2019t been lying, she never cared what my hair looked like and long she could get hands in it our around it she didn\u2019t care what style it was or what color I picked for the month.</p><p>Rowdy shook his head and gave me a sour look. \u201cYou are one lucky bastard Archer.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and started to clean my station up. \u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>Things weren\u2019t always perfect. We were still two very different people on two very different paths but we always managed to take time and work it out. The trial against Davenport had been hard because I hated watching her have to relive it all and there was just too much influence for him to get as harsh a sentence as he deserved but she stayed strong and even when her parents had encouraged her to just drop the charges and let Davenport\u2019s dad deal with him she had pressed forwards and done the right thing and Gabe was getting punished just not as harshly as any of us would have liked. Her parents weren\u2019t any kind of fan of our relationship but once it was clear that Shaw and I were a package deal or they weren\u2019t welcome anywhere near her they had relented slightly. Personally I think it was guilt from the attack and their general shitty parenting that kept them paying her tuition and begrudgingly accepting me in her life but I didn\u2019t care because I was there to protect her from them so whatever the reason as long as they behaved it was all good or at least good enough.</p><p>Things with my folks were better, not perfect but better. My mom and I had reached an understanding, we were never going to have the close relationship she shared with Remy but we at least could talk now and I had even gone along to a couple of her therapy appointments so I had a better understanding of how she was wired. Much to my surprise we were far more alike than I had ever imagined. Shaw and I made it a point to go back home every Sunday for brunch again but now I was an active participant and it was one of my favorite times of the week. Unfortunately Rome was the Archer brother being difficult now. He still refused to talk to mom and dad and he only thawed toward Shaw when I let it be known that if he didn\u2019t I was going to beat his ass when he came home in a couple months. Things were rocky on that front, he felt lied to and betrayed but I had faith that if I could see the light than my brother who was already a way better man than I was would come around eventually.</p> <p>Shaw came out of the bathroom pulling her hair up into a messy ponytail. Cora turned from the front desk to scowl at her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving me for that asshole. I\u2019m going to miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh I\u2019m going to miss you too girl but I\u2019m never there and I\u2019m sick and tired of having my stuff in two different places.\u201d Shaw was moving in with me and Nash this weekend. We had put it off even though she was there five to six nights a week because I didn\u2019t want to burden Nash. It was my best friend that finally told her over breakfast one morning that if she agreed to do most of the cooking then she was welcome to just move in. We were both grateful because I liked our place, it was super convenient for work and I really didn\u2019t want to move or ask Nash to leave. The three of us got along great and Nash was gone enough nights that we never really got on each other\u2019s nerves. The girls were bummed she was going and I knew she was really going to miss Ayden and Cora, but they hung out enough and declared every Thursday girl night that I wasn\u2019t worried at all about her regretting her decision.</p><p>Cora screwed up her face looking like an angry Tinker Bell. \u201cI just hate the idea of moving a stranger in. You and Ayden were like the perfect roommates ever and after what happened to you I don\u2019t trust some random stranger off the street to move in.\u201d</p><p>Shaw sat in the chair I had vacated to clean up and I hid a grin as she sneakily ran her fingers up the inside of my thigh. Nash looked up from the owl he was working on and looked back and forth between me and Rowdy. \u201cIsn\u2019t Jet coming back from tour soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So what?\u201d Artifice had hit the big time, booking a slot on Metalfest and tapped Jet\u2019s band Enmity be on the opening stage for them. He had been gone for over six months and while he was on the road the girl he had been shaking up with had hooked up with some ex con so Jet was out on his ass but we all just figured he would crash with Rowdy or one of the other guys in the band.</p><p>\u201cYou can rent the room out to him.\u201d Nash said it like it was perfectly reasonable. \u201cHe\u2019s cool with Ayden and he\u2019s always on tour our whatever anyway. I bet he would be a good fit.\u201d</p> <p>Shaw and I shared a raised eyebrow look. Jet was cool with Ayden, in fact they had developed an independent friendship outside of the rest of us that often left us all questioning how close the country girl and the metal boy were. They were close but so opposite it was hard to understand how they ever had anything to talk about, if anyone asked me Jet moving under the same roof as the dark haired beauty was just asking for trouble, or a really good time depending on how you looked at it. I cleared my throat and reached out for Shaw\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cMy older brother will be back in a few months too. He\u2019s gonna need a place to crash until he figures out what he\u2019s doing. That might be another option you want to consider.\u201d Cora nodded and turned back to whatever it was she was messing with on the computer. \u201cYou ready to go home?\u201d</p><p>I loved asking her that. I loved that she knew I loved asking her that. She smiled at me and gingerly reached up to give me a quick peck. I knew her side had to be hurting her. Four hours of getting drilled was a lot and she normally sat like a champ, still as stone. I was going to put her in a hot shower and make her feel all better.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>We walked out of the shop hand in hand and headed toward the Victorian. She liked to run her thumb back and forth across her name on my knuckles and it never failed to make me smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to put me in your portfolio Rule?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t expecting that question so I looked at her in surprise. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI dunno. You put all your really big pieces in there, I just didn\u2019t know why you would want to leave this one out.\u201d</p> <p>I wrapped an arm around her neck and pulled her to me so I could kiss the top of her head. \u201cBecause those are work. I put them on people and then they go out into the world where they are hopefully appreciated and loved by other people. Anything I do for you, anything between us isn\u2019t work and it\u2019s for you and I to appreciate. When I work on you I do it knowing what I put on you will be with us forever. Like I said if you want it in there I\u2019ll be happy to put it in, but if not then I\u2019ll be happy to be the one to admire all my handiwork every day.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me in silence for a second and then burst out laughing. \u201cYou give the most backasswards compliments in the world but that was lovely and you\u2019re absolutely right. The only person that I really want to see it is you.\u201d</p><p>I growled and tugged on her hair. \u201cThat thing covers half your butt cheek. I better be the only one looking at it Casper.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes glowed in a way that only I could make them. \u201cI do love you Rule Archer.\u201d</p><p>Every time she said it I had an easier time telling her, \u201cI love you back\u201d and that\u2019s all it was. I didn\u2019t have to question, didn\u2019t have to worry, didn\u2019t have to fall into the tunnel of darkness because whatever Shaw felt for me I just gave it to her back and knew that was enough. I didn\u2019t have to try, I just did and every single day I did it better than the day before.</p><p>\u201cSo what about Jet or Rome going to live with Cora and Ayd?\u201d</p><p>She snuggled into my side as we approached the Victorian.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how that plays out.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone said about us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cAnd look at the show we gave them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough and opposites don\u2019t just attract they freaking catch fire and burn the entire city down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it.\u201d</p><p>Whatever was on the agenda I knew one thing. If any of my boys were lucky enough to find a girl that made me feel the way Shaw did I would do whatever it took to make sure they saw it through to the end. Love like this wasn\u2019t to be missed even for those of us that had never realized it was out there. Look at me being all optimistic and shit.</p> <p>Remy would be so proud</p><p>The End </p>  </body></html>"]
