At least that\u2019s what she told herself. Because only a fool would stand idly by while the man she loved romanced another woman in front of her very eyes. But it wasn\u2019t the first time she had done so, and it probably wouldn\u2019t be the last. Yes, indeed, Roberta Richmond was a colossal fool.</p><p>Time for you to move on, Bobbi, she told herself, grimacing when the aforementioned man placed his hands on his latest conquest\u2019s naked back\u2014how low was the back of that dress anyway? One could almost see the top of her butt crack\u2014and steered her toward the dance floor. It was unacceptable really; he had brought Bobbi to this party. So why was it okay for him to hit on other women?</p><p>Because he\u2019s your friend, her inner voice shrieked at her.</p> <p>\u201cOh shut up,\u201d she said out loud, and a couple of the people standing nearby directed startled glances over at her. \u201cNot you,\u201d she clarified. They moved away anyway, making her feel like even more of a social pariah.</p><p>Great.</p><p>Gabriel Braddock, her longtime best friend\u2014the object of both her teen and adult fantasies\u2014was whispering something into that woman\u2019s ear, and she laughed in response. Beautiful, vibrant, tall, and built\u2014she epitomized femininity, something Bobbi sorely lacked.</p><p>\u201cYou look rather lost over here, Bobbi.\u201d The hostess of the party, her good friend Theresa De Lucci, had moved over to join Bobbi in her Lonely Loser\u2019s Corner. Theresa held up a flute of champagne, onto which Bobbi gratefully latched.</p><p>\u201cGreat party,\u201d Bobbi told her after taking a thirsty sip of the fizzy drink, and Theresa smiled.</p> <p>\u201cI could almost believe you meant that, if not for that glower on your face,\u201d her friend teased, taking a sip of her own drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just . . .\u201d She sighed. Her eyes drifted miserably over to Gabe again. \u201cWho\u2019s the babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of Sandro\u2019s sisters, Rosalie,\u201d Theresa informed her, and Bobbi caught a flash of sympathy in the other woman\u2019s eyes before lowering her gaze back to her champagne. \u201cShe flew in from Milan yesterday. She\u2019s just ten months older than Sandro, so they\u2019re very close. Unfortunately none of his other family members could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains the astonishing good looks then.\u201d Bobbi laughed bitterly.</p><p>\u201cBobbi.\u201d Her friend paused before taking a deep breath and continuing. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you the same advice that Lisa gave me when I was having problems in my marriage\u2014you\u2019re either going to have to do something about the way you feel or you\u2019re going to have to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that obvious?\u201d Her horrified eyes latched onto Theresa\u2019s, and she was relieved when the other woman shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cTo me, yes. I can recognize unrequited love when I see it.\u201d Her friend reached out and gave her a one-armed hug. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here if you need to talk to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Bobbi\u2019s eyes drifted back to the couple on the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, Sandro would probably go ballistic if Gabe messed with his sister. He can be a bit protective\u2014especially over Rosalie.</p><p>\u201cStop looking like it\u2019s the end of the world and try to enjoy yourself, okay? You\u2019re making me feel like an awful hostess.\u201d Theresa\u2019s gentle teasing made her smile.</p><p>\u201cOh heaven forbid.\u201d Bobbi raised a hand in mock horror. \u201cThis is a great party and you know it.\u201d It was Theresa\u2019s husband\u2019s birthday party. It was supposed to be a surprise party, and while Sandro had acted surprised, Bobbi knew\u2014thanks to Gabe\u2014that the Italian had been far from startled. Theresa was terrible at subterfuge and hadn\u2019t been able to hide her plans from her husband. According to Gabe, Sandro had known something was up for weeks, but in an effort not to disappoint Theresa, he had gone all out with the shocked reaction.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t at all surprised,\u201d Theresa confided in Bobbi, a sweet smile tugging at the corners of her lips. Startled that the woman\u2019s thoughts had so accurately mirrored hers, Bobbi directed a questioning glance her way.</p><p>\u201cSandro,\u201d Theresa clarified. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t surprised. I could see through that act a mile away\u2014but it\u2019ll gut him to know that I know that he knew about the party. So I\u2019ll just keep on pretending to believe he was surprised.\u201d Theresa paused for a second, absorbing her words before laughing. \u201cGod, that all sounded like the setup to a terrible joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour explanation did get rather complicated,\u201d Bobbi agreed.</p> <p>\u201cLove often is complicated,\u201d Theresa quipped, and Bobbi sighed as she took a sip of champagne and directed her troubled eyes back to Gabe.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it just?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel Braddock reluctantly relinquished his hold on his gorgeous dance partner and let her go with a lingering kiss to the back of her hand. She was totally off-limits, of course, as his good friend\u2019s sister. There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell he\u2019d indulge himself with this exotic beauty. It would create too many complications in his structured life. She wasn\u2019t his type anyway. He preferred blondes\u2014but this was one brunette for whom he would gladly have made an exception. He glanced over at Sandro . . . yep, the guy was staring daggers at him\u2014so that meant Rosalie was still very much forbidden fruit. Too bad. She was charming. He always enjoyed her company and was naturally attracted to her. Still, he had managed to keep their brief interactions over the years limited to harmless flirtations.</p><p>He shoved his hands into his trouser pockets\u2014uncaring that it ruined the cut of the garment, which was uncharacteristic for him. He liked neatness. He liked to keep his jaw smoothly shaven, his hair conservatively cut and precisely parted, and his clothes immaculately pressed and tailored to perfection. He preferred to keep things as orderly and controlled as possible. Anything else and he started to feel frayed around the edges. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced around the room and spotted a familiar rumpled figure\u2014the one bit of chaos in his otherwise well-ordered life\u2014and made his way over to where she stood. Their friendship surprised most people who didn\u2019t know them. They were complete opposites\u2014Bobbi\u2019s untidiness against his neatness and her free spirit versus his buttoned-down conservativeness\u2014and their friendship sometimes baffled him too. He\u2019d known her for most of his life and was used to having her around\u2014no, more than that, he enjoyed having her around. Gabe didn\u2019t confide in many people, but Bobbi was someone he trusted with most of his secrets. She listened to him and was his one constant. His mother and brother were preoccupied with their own lives; his father was a completely hopeless case. His other friends were mates, good for a laugh and a drink at the pub but not for sharing his deep and darkest secrets. When he worried about his brother, Chase, he knew that Bobbi would be there to listen patiently and offer words of comfort and advice. She understood him, and he appreciated that about her. He would be the first to acknowledge that he tended to take her for granted, but he couldn\u2019t quite imagine his life without her.</p><p>He watched as she tossed back the remaining contents of a champagne flute before substituting the empty glass for a full one from a passing waiter\u2019s tray. She was as dressed up as it was possible for Bobbi to get, wearing a shapeless navy-blue slip dress, one he had seen her in a million times before. It was her go-to party dress. It kind of skimmed her slender body, falling from thick straps on her shoulders, which seemed to have been designed to hide bra straps, to somewhere between her knees and her calves.</p><p>The dress was accompanied by clunky ankle boots that added absolutely no height to her five foot nothing frame, and the entire ensemble was topped off with some ugly plastic tribal jewelry\u2014chunky bracelets that looked horribly out of place on her delicate wrists, a pendant that appeared to weigh heavily on her neck, and truly awful hoop earrings that seemed to tug painfully at her earlobes.</p><p>Bobbi was a tiny waif of a girl, so her ghastly outfit seemed to be wearing her. The top of her head barely came up to his chest. She had slender arms and legs, a flat chest, and no curves to speak of at all. He supposed she was okay-looking as such things went, with luminous, thickly lashed amber eyes that shone like dark gold in the sunlight, a snub nose that was crooked as a result of a childhood fall, and a perfect cupid\u2019s bow of a mouth, which\u2014in addition to her eyelashes\u2014was one of the few feminine things about her. She had beautiful skin though, clear and golden, and her short, silky, straight black hair molded the elegant shape of her head.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Runt,\u201d he said by way of greeting, knowing that it aggravated her to be addressed as such. \u201cYou having a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she groused. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to dance with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d He was?</p><p>\u201cYou brought me here,\u201d she pointed out, enunciating her words carefully, the way inebriated people tended to do when they were trying to convince others of their sobriety. \u201cYou\u2019re my date. You should dance with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your date, am I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop talking to me like I\u2019m a child.\u201d Her words threw him. He did tend to speak to her in the indulgent, paternal tone her dad or older brothers used on her. It was easy for all of them to lose sight of the fact that she was a woman of twenty-six with her own business.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her pretty eyes reflected her surprise at his apology. She shrugged awkwardly, grabbing yet another glass from a passing waiter and downing it in almost one gulp. She swayed and he reached out to steady her, placing his hands on her slight shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Bobbi . . . how many of those have you had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many of whats?\u201d she asked with a frown, and he grinned at her butchering of the language before elaborating.</p><p>\u201cOf those glasses of champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re called flutes . . . like a flute . . . like music. You know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get it,\u201d he said, keeping his tone somber to match the earnestness in her voice. \u201cSo how many have you had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d He decided not to push it when it was clear that she couldn\u2019t quite muddle her way through the conversation. \u201cEntirely too many, as far as I can tell. Come on, let\u2019s find a quiet spot to sit you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired. I want to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can barely stand,\u201d he pointed out patiently. It wasn\u2019t like her to get drunk. She was a lightweight when it came to alcohol and tended to restrict her alcoholic intake to no more than two glasses when she was in company.</p><p>\u201cI can stand.\u201d She looked offended by his words and wriggled her shoulders out from beneath his hands to prove it to him. She swayed only a little without his support. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s dance.\u201d She pushed past him and walked confidently toward the dance floor. When she got there and turned around to find him still standing where she had left him, she spread her hands in a what gives gesture.</p><p>He groaned to himself before making his way to her side. It would be best just to dance with her and get it over with. Arguing with her in her current state would cause a scene. He was being jostled by the crowd and felt a bit harried when he eventually reached her. She smiled up at him before latching her arms around his waist, resting her head on his chest, and snuggling up against him like a contented cat. Floored, he stood with his arms outspread\u2014not quite sure what to do with them\u2014staring down at the top of her silky head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hesitantly closed his arms around her slight frame while trying to maneuver away from her and force some distance between their bodies, but she\u2019d latched on so tightly they wouldn\u2019t have been able to squeeze a sheet of paper between them. He sighed and moved his hands down to either side of her waist and was surprised to discover that it was curvier than he\u2019d anticipated. There was a definite, defined, nipped-in waist that curved out into gently flared hips. His hands spanned the entire length of her waist, with his thumbs brushing the underside of the slight swell of her breasts and his pinkie fingers resting on the flare of her hips. Before this very moment he had thought\u2014when he\u2019d given any consideration to the matter at all\u2014that Bobbi was straight up and down. He never would have guessed at this perfectly proportioned, petite, hourglass figure.</p><p>Curious, he allowed his hands to explore further, moving one to her back and spreading his fingers so that it covered her entire narrow expanse. He angled his hand until the tips of his fingers just brushed at the swell of her butt and then was immediately besieged with guilt, as he comprehended that he was actually trying to cop a feel off Bobbi! What the hell was wrong with him?</p><p>He tried to move away again, but she moved closer, and he tilted his head to see her face. She was nuzzling at his chest, her breath hot against the naked flesh just above his unbuttoned shirt. Strange, he didn\u2019t quite remember unbuttoning that third button or the second for that matter! He had only loosened his tie and unbuttoned his collar.</p><p>\u201cHey, hold up there, sweetheart.\u201d He could feel her fingers busily working on the fourth button. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Bobbi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing.\u201d Her lips brushed against his flesh as she spoke, sending hot darts of pleasure racing from the point of contact all the way down to parts he\u2019d best not be thinking about right now.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Enough, Bobbi. I don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s gone far enough.\u201d He moved his arms back up to her shoulders and moved her away from him, using gentle force.</p><p>She kept her face angled down, and he used a thumb and forefinger to slant her chin up and meet her eyes. She possessed enough of her faculties to look embarrassed; a flush stained her delicate cheekbones and made her look somewhat feverish.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Runt?\u201d She winced at the nickname, and he immediately regretted using it. Not the best timing\u2014not when something was clearly eating at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such a fool.\u201d Her voice was so low that he had to bend his head a few inches to catch the words.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Why would you say that? Did somebody say something to upset you?\u201d</p><p>She raised a slender, slightly calloused hand to his cheek and stroked the flesh softly. He found the combination of soft and hard on his skin disturbing and unthinkingly dragged his face away from her gentle touch, leaving her small hand hovering in midair. Her eyes immediately filled with pain, and he felt like a complete ass for putting that look on her face. He didn\u2019t know what was going on with her tonight, but he had no doubt that the amount of alcohol she had consumed would have her regretting her actions in the morning.</p><p>She dropped her hand down to her side, and he reached up to cradle her delicate face between both of his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sweetheart?\u201d he murmured, and watched with a perplexed frown as her eyes filled with tears. Bobbi hardly ever cried; in fact he could count on one hand the number of times he had seen her cry over the last twenty years. He didn\u2019t know how to respond to this. He watched as a single tear slid down her smooth cheek, until it collided with one of his thumbs and formed a tiny pool beneath the digit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fool,\u201d she repeated, her tone numb.</p><p>\u201cBobbi, I . . .\u201d Every thought fled from his mind when she went up onto her toes and firmly planted her soft, sweet lips on his mouth, catching him in midsentence. The next breath he inhaled was hers. It filled his lungs and he held it in for one long, possessive moment until he had no choice but to relinquish it back to her.</p><p>Oh my God! It was the only coherent thought he had as he found himself taking control of the kiss that she had initiated, sweeping his tongue into the sweet, hot depths of her mouth, relishing the taste of her, the smell, the feel . . . God, she felt good\u2014a small, perfect armful that he couldn\u2019t seem to get close enough to. He moved one hand down to the small of her back, anchoring her to him, bending her backward in an attempt to get even closer.</p><p>Oh my God!</p><p>Every delectable inch of her was plastered to him from chest to thighs, and he wanted her even closer. Some distant part of his mind was making faintly alarmed noises, but most of his higher brain functions had short-circuited the moment her soft lips had touched his. Sure they\u2019d exchanged kisses before, perfunctory pecks that were nothing like this. Where the hell had this come from?</p><p>She tasted like champagne\u2014sweet and tart\u2014and her kiss effervesced through his system, sending his nerve endings tingling with ebullient messages that were hard to ignore.</p><p>He lifted his mouth from her intoxicating lips for a second, needing air, but all he inhaled was Bobbi . . . the heady scent of vanilla and freesias. Why had he never known how good she smelled before now? he wondered absently before angling his mouth to take hers again.</p><p>She murmured his name, and despite the music and noise swirling around them, the fractured sound registered just as he reclaimed her lips, and it was as effective as being doused in ice water. He jerked his head back and shook it to clear his befuddled brain.</p><p>What the hell am I doing?</p><p>He stepped away from her a second after that thought rang through his mind, putting some desperately needed distance between his aroused body and hers. He was still too close to her for his liking\u2014her every gasping breath threatening to bring her chest within touching distance of his ribcage\u2014but the crowd made it difficult to move farther away from her.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had her face tilted up toward his, her heavy-lidded eyes were liquid with longing, her every breath emerged on a hitched sob, and her skin had a flushed, dewy look that immediately betrayed her arousal. It was all he could do to prevent himself from reaching for her again. She was drunk, he reminded himself. He was the one who had to maintain control; he couldn\u2019t take advantage of her. It was unthinkable\u2014this was Bobbi! That thought immediately dampened his arousal and brought his body firmly back under his control.</p><p>He clung to that: Bobbi. It put things into jarring perspective. He didn\u2019t know what the hell had just happened, but it had to have been a temporary aberration.</p><p>This was Bobbi.</p><p>He pushed memories of her as a small girl with a gap-toothed grin and pigtails into his brain, and then as an awkward preadolescent, a gawky teenager, and lastly a permanently disheveled young woman in overalls, with grease smeared on her face, and he immediately felt . . . less. Just less.</p> <p>He forced one of his hands to reach for her elbow and ignored the residual tingling in his fingertips as he latched onto her silky skin. He dragged her to the side of the dance floor and looked around until he found an empty chair in a relatively quiet spot. He led her to it and urged her to sit down. She still looked a bit dazed and thankfully sat down without protest. He sank onto his haunches in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he ordered, and she blinked up at him, looking totally out of it. \u201cBobbi, do you hear me? Do not move from this spot! I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He got up and headed for a refreshment table on the opposite side of the room, intending to get her some water. He glanced back and nearly stumbled when she brought one of her hands to her mouth and traced the outline of her lips.</p><p>Could she still taste him? He could still taste her.</p><p>He felt like his structured, well-organized world was on an express train to hell, and he needed to find the emergency brake immediately or his life would descend into absolute chaos.</p> <p>Bobbi! He reminded himself sternly before turning and continuing his progress to the refreshment table.</p><p>Gabe had kissed her!</p><p>Okay, she was just sober enough to remember that she had kissed him first, but he had kissed her back! He had definitely kissed her back. That hadn\u2019t been her imagination. Had it? She could still feel the pressure of his warm, smooth lips on hers, the scrape of his just emerging stubble against her cheek. And she could taste the whiskey-tinged flavor of his tongue in her mouth.</p><p>But why had he left her here?</p><p>She accepted another glass\u2014flute\u2014of champagne from a handsome waiter and contemplated that question. He had left absolute ages ago. She stood up and swayed before moving in the direction she was sure he had gone. Maybe he was with that woman again. Rosalie. Was he kissing her now?</p><p>She stumbled and bumped into someone.</p> <p>\u201cRoberta?\u201d She didn\u2019t need to see the owner of that dark, accented voice to know to whom it belonged. She grinned up at him.</p><p>\u201cAaah, the birthday boy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Alessandro De Lucci asked in concern, and she squinted up at him. He was a handsome man, but his two noses made him look kind of freakish.</p><p>\u201cYou should have that seen to.\u201d She waved her gl\u2014 flute at him and he frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not making sense, piccola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat second nose . . . where did it come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaah. Too much champagne for you, I think.\u201d He grinned, snatching her half-full gla\u2014 flu\u2014 whatever, and latching an arm around her waist when the unexpected move unbalanced her. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got you, piccola mia. Let\u2019s find my wife and get you put to bed.\u201d Theresa and Sandro had offered rooms to some of their guests who lived farther away, hoping to eliminate any incidences of drunk driving.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I am rather sleepy,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much nicer than you used to be,\u201d she informed him drowsily, and he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>Bobbi was gone! Gabe swore softly and frantically looked around for her in the throng of people surrounding him. He hadn\u2019t been gone more than a couple of minutes. Where the hell had she disappeared to?</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he whispered beneath his breath and pushed his way through the chatting, laughing groups of people. He spotted Max Kinsley, an old university friend standing at the far side of the room. Bobbi may have wandered over to chat with him . . . or dance with him. Would she have kissed him too? The question hit him like a fist to the solar plexus and expelled the breath from his lungs as he visualized Max with Bobbi in his arms, with his mouth on hers and his chest plastered to hers.</p><p>Hell no!</p><p>He told himself that the rage he felt at the vision that formed in his mind\u2019s eye was the same protective instinct Sandro felt toward his sister . . . that had to be it.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bobbi?\u201d He demanded to know when he eventually managed to reach Max\u2019s side. The other man looked surprised by his question.</p><p>\u201cNo idea. You\u2019re her minder, bro. Not me.\u201d Seeing the truth on his friend\u2019s face, Gabe\u2019s eyes roamed the crowded room again. He couldn\u2019t help picturing her flitting from one guy to the next, bestowing her dances and kisses freely on every one of them like some horny, drunken little fairy. She could get herself into some serious trouble if she ran into the wrong guy.</p><p>\u201cLose something?\u201d a deep voice murmured from behind him, and he whirled around to see Sandro smirking at him.</p><p>\u201cI assume you know where Bobbi is?\u201d he asked.

He should have known it would only be a matter of time before she got sick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her and send your wife back down to you,\u201d he offered, and Sandro nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat would be appreciated.\u201d</p><p>They had put her in the room next to his, Gabe remembered. What had seemed perfectly acceptable just a few short hours ago now seemed . . . inappropriate.</p> <p>He rapped on the door before opening it after the briefest of hesitations. Theresa De Lucci, looking stunning in her evening wear\u2014probably by one high-end designer or the other, he wasn\u2019t sure which, he never really paid attention to women\u2019s wear unless he was in the process of removing it\u2014was stroking a damp cloth over Bobbi\u2019s face. She looked up in surprise when Gabe walked in.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he asked, shrugging out of his tux jacket and draping it carefully over the back of a chair so as not to wrinkle it.</p><p>\u201cSomewhat under the weather,\u201d Theresa said with a slight smile. \u201cI think she got most of it out of her system though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t handle alcohol very well,\u201d he stated unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d Her smile widened.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s usually better at managing her alcohol intake. I don\u2019t know what came over her tonight.\u201d Theresa said nothing in response to that and merely continued to stroke Bobbi\u2019s face gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this. Why don\u2019t you head back to the party? I\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Theresa slanted her head questioningly. \u201cAre you sure about that? I don\u2019t mind staying with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandro\u2019s already looking restless without you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed with an indulgent shake of her head. \u201cHe has no patience with parties that serve no function other than an excuse for people to gather in a festive social setting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll business all the time, huh?\u201d Gabe rejoined, and she rolled her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been attempting to change that, and he does try, but he tends to get short-tempered if I\u2019m not around to make sure he maintains his civility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get down there before he tosses everybody out then.\u201d He ushered her out, and after one last look back at Bobbi, she left the room.</p><p>Gabe shut the door behind her. He stood there for a while with his hands braced on the door and his head bent as he steeled himself to turn around and walk back to that bed.</p><p>\u201cGut up, Braddock,\u201d he whispered, thumping his forehead against the wood before pushing himself away from the door and turning back toward the large bed.</p><p>She was so small that she barely made a dent beneath the covers. He removed his diamond and gold cufflinks, slipping them into one of his trouser pockets, and folded his sleeves meticulously up to his elbows. He sat down on the chair so recently vacated by Theresa and forced himself to look down into her unconscious face.</p><p>It was just Bobbi. He nearly laughed his relief out loud. He didn\u2019t know what he had expected, but this short-haired, golden-skinned, sleeping urchin stirred no desire in him\u2014no crazy, ill-advised lust. Nothing close to it. He felt fondness, affection, even love. Every insipid emotion associated with platonic friendship one could hope for. No desire. None at all.</p><p>He shook his head, unable to keep the grin from his face.</p><p>\u201cThank Christ for that,\u201d he whispered. He could only conclude that he\u2019d been more affected by his dance with the stunning Rosalie De Lucci than he\u2019d known. It was past time for him to form a new relationship. His last one had ended months ago and he\u2019d been celibate ever since. The lack of sex seemed to be manifesting itself in seriously weird and unanticipated ways.</p> <p>He linked his fingers and rested them on his torso before dropping his head back on the cushioned chair. He mentally inventoried all the single women he knew, with the intention of calling one or two of them up soon for some sexy times, and fell asleep in the middle of his strategizing.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Something\u2014some small, rodent-type creature\u2014had died in her mouth. Why else would the latter taste so putrid and feel so furry? And some cruel prankster had glued her eyelids together, because she couldn\u2019t seem to open her eyes.</p><p>She groaned and the small sound set a tsunami of pain into motion in her head. Even with her eyes closed it felt like the room was spinning, and the vertiginous sensation made her feel sick to her stomach. She was almost certain she was going to vomit. She gritted her teeth and breathed through her nose, trying to quell the nausea.</p><p>Was she ill?</p><p>\u201cBobbi?\u201d Even though the word was whispered, it sounded like a gunshot in the silence and she winced.</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d she whimpered, managing to unstick her eyelids at last and peer at him. The room was dim, with only one wall lamp spilling the barest amount of light across half of his face. \u201cI\u2019m sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a sip of this water,\u201d he instructed, and his neutral tone set her mind at ease. He slid a hand beneath her neck and gently helped her sit up. She tensed, and shut her eyes again, trying to keep her breathing deep and steady.</p><p>\u201cYou need to puke?\u201d he asked gruffly. She shook her head and clamped a hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second,\u201d she groaned from behind her hand. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, drink the water.\u201d He held a glass up and she took it in both of her trembling hands. He closed his own hand over hers to keep the glass steady and guided it to her lips. She took a sip, then another, and then realized that she had a raging thirst and gulped the rest down eagerly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he praised, still in that quiet whisper. He refilled the glass from the carafe on the pedestal and this time handed her a couple of aspirin to go with it.</p><p>\u201cI drank too much champagne, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she asked as she remembered, and he nodded, his face expressionless. She downed the aspirin and handed the glass back to him. He placed it on the pedestal with that precise economy of movement that she always found so inordinately fascinating about him. How could such a large man keep his every movement so neat and controlled?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You should go back to the party. I think I\u2019m okay now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe party\u2019s mostly over,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a few stragglers still lingering, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before Sandro loses his patience with them.\u201d She smiled weakly at that and sank back against the headboard, shutting her eyes for a second.</p> <p>A sinking feeling of dread was starting to form in the pit of her stomach. Something wasn\u2019t right. She had done something at the party and the exact details remained infuriatingly elusive and couldn\u2019t seem to take any coherent shape in her mind.</p><p>\u201cTry to get some sleep,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>\u201cI just woke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he corrected. \u201cYou had passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming.\u201d She snorted.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I spoiled your evening,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I . . .\u201d And that\u2019s when she remembered. Her eyes flew open to meet his enigmatic stare and her hand fluttered helplessly to her lips. His eyes seemed to darken as they watched her fingers trace the outline of her mouth, but it could merely have been a trick of the light. His face still held very little expression.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d How much had she revealed? Had she said anything? She tried to remember everything that had preceded the kiss, but it was all frustratingly hazy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was . . . drunk.\u201d She had forced herself on him. The very idea of how she must have behaved was horrifying.</p><p>\u201cI know. Forget about it.\u201d There was something off about the cadence of his voice and it worried her. Had she irreparably ruined their friendship? Would they ever get past this? Had she told him she loved him? She had all but violated him and had even fooled herself into believing that he had returned her kiss.</p> <p>She buried her face in her hands, absolutely mortified\u2014after years of self-restraint and hiding the nature of her feelings from him for the good of their friendship\u2014she had probably destroyed that same friendship on some drunken whim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop apologizing, Bobbi, there was no harm done.\u201d</p><p>No harm done? She peeked at him from between a gap in her fingers\u2014not quite sure how she felt about that. Relieved? Or even more humiliated because her kiss had had so little impact on him?</p><p>There was still no expression on his face. Gabe had never been one to wear his emotions on his sleeve. He was the most self-restrained man she knew, but she could usually read him better than this\u2014one couldn\u2019t be a friend to someone for nearly twenty years without learning his moods, but he was a complete mystery to her at this moment and it confused her.</p><p>She needed to get away from him for a few minutes, needed to gather her thoughts and compose herself. She pushed the bed covers down to her hips and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. She sat there for a couple of seconds, swallowing down the nausea when her movements caused the room to swirl sickeningly around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked, and in her disorientated state it almost sounded like there was a slight edge of panic in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBathroom.\u201d She kept her response succinct, not really feeling capable of saying anything more than that. He used his feet to push the chair farther away from the bed, giving her room to maneuver.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She glanced down at him and caught a flash of something dark in his eyes. She paused\u2014not certain of that look\u2014but then his face went back to that maddeningly neutral expression. She sighed quietly and wobbled to the en suite, shutting the door firmly.</p><p>Gabe groaned softly and ran his hands roughly over his face and into his hair\u2014he sat there for a brief moment, hands clenched in his hair before inhaling deeply in an attempt to calm himself. He had been doing pretty well, had had the situation under control. She was his friend, they had grown up together\u2014there was absolutely nothing but friendship and deep affection between them. That was the way it had always been, the way it would always be.</p><p>So why the hell did the sight of her in that tiny white tank top and those skimpy blue boy shorts send his blood pressure sky-rocketing? He\u2019d seen her in similar clothing before, seen her in less really\u2014but he\u2019d never fully appreciated the pert perfection of her small breasts and had certainly never wanted to cup the firm, ripe curve of her butt before.</p><p>And even worse, the inescapable realization that she was wearing absolutely nothing beneath all that innocent cotton had him fighting a losing battle to keep his inevitable hard-on at bay.</p><p>One kiss . . . one damned kiss and he was behaving like a teenager with his first crush. He needed to regain his perspective here. He needed to put these unsettling and erotic thoughts aside.</p><p>With that in mind, he pushed out of the chair and walked over to the bathroom door, listening for a few seconds to ensure she wasn\u2019t sick again. He knocked quietly.</p><p>\u201cBobbi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she called back. \u201cI just need . . .\u201d The rest of her words were said too quietly for him to catch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure you okay, I\u2019m heading off to bed, okay?\u201d He waited, but she didn\u2019t respond. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the next room. I\u2019ll leave the adjoining door open. If you need anything, just let me know.\u201d God, he hoped she wouldn\u2019t need anything. It would be bad enough getting any sleep with that damned door open between their rooms.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he heard her say, the word soft and uncertain.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d Her response was faint.</p> <p>He stood there for another few seconds before shaking his head and striding toward her bedroom door, collecting his jacket along the way. He was in his own room a few moments later and went straight to the adjoining door, knocking once before opening it. Her room was still empty and he heard the sound of running water coming from the en suite.</p><p>He shed his shirt and jacket hurriedly and took less care putting them away than usual. He wanted to be in bed with the lights out when she returned. He didn\u2019t want to see her or speak to her again tonight. Everything would be back to normal in the bright light of day. It had to be . . .</p><p>He had stripped down to his trousers by the time she stepped back into her room, and the shadow her small figure cast on her bedroom wall startled him into pausing while unbuttoning his fly. His hands dropped to hang loosely at his sides. He was facing the adjoining door; his intention had been to keep an eye on her room in case she needed him, but her abrupt reappearance had caught him off guard.</p><p>She froze when she saw him and her eyes dropped to his naked chest. He swallowed audibly as her eyes tracked over his body . . . God, he could feel her gaze brushing across his skin like a brand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The word jerked from him involuntarily.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t not . . . ,\u201d she said hoarsely, taking a small step toward him and then another and another still. He was helpless to stop her and watched her approach until she stood right in front of him. A mere handsbreadth away from him, so close he could feel her heat being absorbed into his naked skin.</p><p>\u201cBobbi.\u201d He tried to instill some sense of warning in his voice, but her name on his lips sounded like a plea. His hands clenched into fists as he fought his desire to touch her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d she whispered in a reverent voice. He watched fascinatedly as she lifted a hand, and in that moment felt absolutely powerless to stop her from touching him. His breath sawed from his lungs in an uneven whoosh as the silky pads of her fingertips traced delicately from the outer edge of his left clavicle straight across to the other end of his right clavicle. Her fingers drifted down to his shoulder before scorching their way over his chest, skimming over his flat nipple in the process. He shuddered and the sound that was torn from his throat was halfway between a long groan and a sigh. The noise startled her into jerking her hand away and she peered up at him uncertainly. He almost howled in disappointment, aching to have her hand back on his skin, but not daring to touch her for fear that he\u2019d be unable to stop until he had her naked and writhing beneath him.</p><p>Her luminous amber eyes searched his sherry-colored ones for an infinite amount of time while he tried to regulate his uneven breathing. He had no idea what she saw because she seemed to nod to herself before returning to the task at hand. Her fingertips began their agonizing exploration again and his knees nearly buckled in response as her hands fluttered to the center of his chest, exploring the texture of the fine hairs sprinkled there before following the trail down . . . past the taut ripples of his abdomen, tracing the faint circle of hair around his belly button before resuming the path even further down . . .</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Unfortunately, reason reasserted itself when he discerned exactly where she was headed. He caught her hand just before it reached the fly of his trousers. He was so damned hard he was straining against his zipper and eagerly seeking her delicate touch.</p><p>\u201cGabe.\u201d This time she was the one pleading.</p> <p>\u201cGo to bed, Runt, before we do something . . . ill-advised.\u201d He used the nickname deliberately, wanting to shock them both out of this erotic haze and it worked\u2014too well. He watched her flinch and pale and steeled himself against the pain he had caused her with his deliberate callousness. She yanked her hand from his grasp and reeled away from him.</p><p>She turned and fled, slamming the adjoining door shut and leaving a turned-on, frustrated, and confused Gabe standing in the middle of his room with one hand absently rubbing at the dull ache in the center of his chest.</p><p>He felt like a man who had just lost his best friend.</p><p>After a restless night, Bobbi felt ill-equipped to face Gabe the following morning. She had been up for hours and had listened to the house come alive outside her door. It was the first week of January, so the guests who had opted to stay the night awoke to a bright, beautiful summer morning. The plan was to have a buffet breakfast and a poolside braai for lunch, and as she listened to her friends\u2019 cheerful chatter when they walked by her closed bedroom door all she wanted to do was curl under the nearest rock and die.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t know what on earth had possessed her to touch him the way she had. Her only excuse was that there had been just enough alcohol left in her system to lower her inhibitions and give in to the overwhelming temptation to caress him. That was most certainly the flimsy explanation she would offer when she summoned up the guts to talk to him about it.</p><p>Bobbi knew that Gabe had vacated his room at seven thirty; she had listened to the quiet rustling coming from the other side of the wall as he had showered and dressed. The tension that had taken up residence in her neck and shoulders had only fled after she\u2019d heard his bedroom door open and then close again. She had held her breath for what seemed like an eternity when his quiet footsteps had halted for a brief moment outside her door before moving on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had tried to formulate a plan of action\u2014an emergency blueprint on how to get through this day and the ones to follow. It wouldn\u2019t be easy\u2014but she stood to lose too much if she messed up these next crucial days. She had to weigh the cost of her friendship with Gabe against the fresh anguish she felt every time he treated her with such casual, impersonal affection. Years of the same had taken its toll and after last night, she knew that she couldn\u2019t do this anymore. She couldn\u2019t stand on the sidelines and watch as every leggy blonde who crossed his path snagged his attention while she never warranted a second glance.</p><p>And really, why would he look at her? She was good old Bobbi, his surrogate sister, the girl who had tagged along behind him and his friends when he was a boy. The girl who had made a pest of herself and who would never outgrow the condescending nickname Gabe and her brothers had bestowed upon her.</p><p>It was after ten before she summoned up the courage to leave her room and make her way down to the pool. Only the De Luccis\u2019 most intimate group of friends remained: the Palmers\u2014Rick, Lisa, Bryce, Bronwyn, and their toddlers\u2014and Max Kinsley, Rosalie De Lucci, Gabe, and Bobbi. Everybody was already gathered beside the pool, either lounging in the sun or splashing about in the water.</p><p>Theresa, who was feeding her fourteen-month-old daughter at the patio table, was the first to spot her.</p> <p>\u201cBobbi,\u201d she called with a warm smile. \u201cGood morning. How are you feeling?\u201d Bobbi cringed when Theresa\u2019s voice drew everybody else\u2019s attention and a multitude of good-natured salutations came her way. She managed a sickly grin and waved back in everybody\u2019s general direction\u2014almost preternaturally aware of Gabe, who was sitting on one of the loungers wearing nothing but board shorts and a pair of sunglasses. His superb body was bronzed and toned, with not a spare bit of flesh anywhere to be seen; he was lean and fit and perfectly proportioned. A quick glance his way confirmed that he was studying her but she couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking, not with those mirrored sunglasses hiding his striking eyes from her. He had a proud nose, just slightly too long but it went beautifully with his bluntly defined cheekbones, which in turn slotted into his narrow, craggy face magnificently. All of that, combined with his thin bow-shaped upper lip and the full sensuous curve of his lower lip, made for an unconventionally handsome man. His dark brown hair, glinting with the faintest hints of auburn beneath the morning sun, was always conservatively cut and brushed and lent him a sophisticated air that went well with his reserved personality.</p><p>He was her complete opposite in every way, and she knew that he would never belong to her. They were friends who came from similar backgrounds but occupied totally different worlds. As she joined Theresa and Lily at the patio table, she knew that it was time to let the fantasy of any kind of romantic involvement with Gabriel Braddock go\u2014and it broke her heart.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Theresa whispered, and knowing that Theresa was asking about more than her physical condition, Bobbi shook her head. She reached for Lily\u2019s chubby little hand and lifted it to her mouth for a kiss, disguising the flash of tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh Bobbi . . . ,\u201d Theresa murmured, trying to hide the distress on her face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lisa ambled over to the table and grinned at them, but the smile faded immediately when she discerned something was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked in concern, as she sat down next to Bobbi.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about it later. Tomorrow maybe, at our girls\u2019 night?\u201d Theresa said, the mere suggestion telling Bobbi that the other woman was aware of how close to the proverbial edge Bobbi was. They usually had their girls\u2019 nights on a Saturday but rescheduled to Sunday because of the party. Lisa nodded but remained by Bobbi\u2019s side, seeming to sense how much her friend needed the emotional bolstering. She started chatting about the party and her wry observations about some of the guests soon had Theresa in stitches and even coaxed a smile or two from Bobbi.</p><p>She tried not to notice that Rosalie De Lucci was in the lounger next to Gabe\u2019s, tried to ignore the way he\u2019d occasionally lean over to say something to the bikini-clad woman, and tried not to cringe when he laughed at something the woman had said. But all the not noticing was taking an emotional toll on her and she excused herself with a bright, completely fake smile about an hour later\u2014saying she needed another nap before lunch. It was obvious that neither Theresa nor her cousin believed her, but they let her go.</p><p>Gabe surreptitiously watched Bobbi leave. She hadn\u2019t so much as glanced at him this morning, while it had been all he could do not to openly study her. She had been wearing the tiniest black bikini he\u2019d ever seen. Nothing fancy, just a simple string bikini that sent his blood pressure soaring and made him infinitely grateful that his board shorts were baggy. It clung to her perfect body in all the right places, and he had found himself fantasizing about untying the bows at her shoulders to reveal those sweet, pert breasts to his gaze.</p><p>God, so much for hoping things would be back to normal this morning.</p><p>She had spent an hour talking to Theresa and Lisa as if everything was perfect in her world, while he felt like his own life had just taken the turn into crazy town. It bothered him that she hadn\u2019t touched the buffet laid out in the chafing dishes on the other side of the pool. She needed to eat and stay hydrated. She hadn\u2019t even had a glass of juice.</p> <p>His conflicting desires to take care of her or throw her on the nearest flat surface and bury himself in her were confusing to say the least, and he felt like he had lost his mind somewhere between last night and this morning. He slowly became aware of Rosalie De Lucci leaning toward him and recognized that the high note, which had entered her melodic voice, signified a question. He had been so absorbed by his thoughts that he hadn\u2019t heard a word of what she\u2019d been saying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d he prompted, focusing his attention back on the lovely woman lounging beside him.</p><p>\u201cI asked if you were okay? You seemed preoccupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine . . .\u201d He nodded, glad that the sunglasses hid the lie in his eyes. He was so far from fine it was ridiculous. He wasn\u2019t sure if he should talk to Bobbi about what had happened the night before or if he should leave it alone. This situation didn\u2019t lend itself to any of the usual precedents. Any other woman and he would have known how to deal with the situation\u2014acknowledge the attraction and do something about it. Despite knowing Bobbi better than most other people, he didn\u2019t know her as a sexual being and it terrified him that he was suddenly so acutely aware of everything that made her female and desirable.</p><p>Sandro and Rick had headed toward the grill and were getting the fire started for the braai. Bryce and Max drifted over to the fire, as men tended to do at barbecues the world over, and a lively conversation about cricket started up before Sandro deftly diverted the conversation to his favorite sport and the men began to argue about the day\u2019s forthcoming Italian Premier League football matches. Gabe made his excuses to Rosalie, who had flipped over onto her stomach and seemed to be snoozing beneath the warm sun, and pushed himself off the lounger to join the men\u2014thinking that the distraction would be exactly what he needed. But after standing there for a few minutes, watching Sandro stoke the fire while Rick, his deaf brother, Bryce, and Max were engaged in a half-spoken, half-signed conversation about exactly how hot the coals should be before the meat went on the grill, Gabe found himself wandering away from the intense huddle of nouveau cavemen and toward the table where the women\u2014who had been joined by Bronwyn\u2014were sitting. They all looked up at the same time at his approach, making him wonder uncomfortably if they\u2019d been talking about him. He briefly considered the notion that Bobbi may have confided in them about the night before but dismissed it almost immediately. Bobbi wasn\u2019t the type of female who had girly chats with other women about man-related problems.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d He nodded casually and moved to sit down in one of the free chairs. The strained silence that greeted him made him reconsider his former opinion\u2014they\u2019d definitely been talking about him and he could feel a flush stain his cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cGabe,\u201d Bronwyn greeted with a regal nod.</p><p>\u201cGreat party last night, Theresa.\u201d He canted his beer bottle toward the pretty redhead and she smiled her thanks. The usually gregarious group remained unusually quiet and Gabe forged ahead uncomfortably. \u201cDo you think . . . uh, Bobbi will be down again? For lunch, I mean. Has she indicated that she\u2019ll be down for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not feeling up to company after last night,\u201d Theresa said in a gentle voice that seemed to be brimming with accusation and Gabe tensed, expecting censure. \u201cYou know . . . after drinking too much? The noise level out here was too much for her to deal with.\u201d</p><p>He slowly and silently exhaled the breath he\u2019d been holding. His own guilty conscience was making his imagination run riot . . . or maybe not? Theresa couldn\u2019t seem to meet his eyes and that pissed him off. He hadn\u2019t done anything to warrant being treated like a damned sex offender.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up and check on her,\u201d he mumbled, happy for a reason to leave the strained company and the excuse to go up and see Bobbi. He leapt to his feet, spilling some of his beer in the process, and rushed inside, not needing to look back to know that the women were watching his ignoble retreat.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>The sharp knock on her door left no doubt in Bobbi\u2019s mind as to whom was on the other side of the wooden barrier. She sucked in a deep, calming breath before walking over to open the door.</p><p>The first thing she noticed was that he had thankfully put on a pristine white T-shirt before coming to her door and had removed the sunglasses. It didn\u2019t stop him from still looking incredible though, especially since his skin had bronzed a shade darker in the morning sun and contrasted attractively with the crisp whiteness of his shirt. She forced that thought from her mind and smiled up at him with just the right amount of friendliness and apology.</p><p>\u201cGabe,\u201d she exclaimed, sounding absolutely thrilled to see him. \u201cI was just coming down to have a chat with you.\u201d She turned her back and walked back into her room, glancing over her shoulder to be sure he followed her inside. He was very careful to leave the door slightly ajar, probably terrified that she\u2019d attack him again. She successfully hid her grimace by heading for the comfortably overstuffed pair of chairs that were situated beside a huge picture window overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and sank down into one, curling her legs and dragging her feet up under her butt, trying to keep her posture as relaxed and nonconfrontational as possible. He warily sat down in the second chair, which was angled to face hers.</p><p>Unlike Bobbi he seemed tense, both feet were braced on the floor, giving him the appearance of someone who would bolt at the slightest provocation, and his hands were precisely placed on the armrests of the chairs with his fingers curled around the edges. He couldn\u2019t seem to meet her eyes, which just about broke her heart.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about last night.\u201d She tried for casual but the words were soft, filled with regret, and the tiniest bit wistful. His throat worked as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Which part?\u201d That threw her somewhat. She hadn\u2019t expected him to ask for specifics.</p><p>\u201cAll of it. Getting drunk, kissing you . . . touching you.\u201d She watched as his fingers clenched the armrests and brought her regard back up to his face. He had his eyes averted and was staring unseeingly out at the horizon, where the shimmering cobalt-blue ocean blended seamlessly with the azure blue of the sky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d He asked, his voice gruff, and she blinked. This wasn\u2019t the way she had pictured this conversation going at all. Gabe was supposed to gratefully latch on to the excuse to maintain the status quo of their friendship. He wasn\u2019t supposed to ask speculative and penetrating questions.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stalled for time, hoping to give him the chance to withdraw the question when he figured out that he was just drawing out the uncomfortable situation longer than was necessary.</p><p>\u201cI asked why you did it?\u201d He repeated, leaning forward to bring his sharp gaze onto her face and watching her every reaction with a maddeningly impersonal expression.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I get drunk?\u201d She deliberately misunderstood, hoping again that he would grab onto this avenue of escape. There was a long pause while he continued to study her with those eyes that missed nothing. She kept her friendly smile pasted to her face but was gradually aware with each passing second how very fake it must look to this man who knew her so well.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I meant, Bobbi, but if you want me to spell it out\u2014why did you kiss me and why did you touch me?\u201d He leaned forward even more, bringing his elbows to his thighs and clasping his hands loosely together in the empty space between his knees.</p><p>\u201cI was drunk.\u201d It was all she could do not to stammer. She kept her eyes up and kept that damned fake smile plastered on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou said I was your date,\u201d he reminded her, and she froze for the briefest of seconds before forcing a laugh out of her tight throat. She managed another one and then another until the sound that emerged almost resembled her natural laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Gabe . . . you had me going. So serious . . . Why did you kiss me? Why did you touch me?\u201d She did a terrible impression of his voice, deepening her own to try and mimic his. \u201cBut the date thing? You know how drunk I was when I said that! Why else would I have said it? I thought you were angry with me or something, but you\u2019re having me on aren\u2019t you? Don\u2019t scare me like that!\u201d</p><p>His eyes had narrowed on her laughing face, but he leaned back in his chair and allowed a small smile to play about his lips. He seemed content to let her latch on to what she considered to be an \u201cout.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry with you, sweetheart,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI was worried about you. I still am . . . you haven\u2019t eaten much today.\u201d</p><p>This was the Gabriel Braddock she had fallen in love with, the one who treated her with a gruff tenderness when he was alone with her, who cared about her well being and always seemed to want what was best for her. When she was growing up, she had loved him like her own brother. In fact, in some ways, she loved him more than any of her brothers.</p><p>Billy, Edward, and Clyde had never listened to her aching desires to be like the taller and prettier girls at school. They hadn\u2019t been the ones to comfort her at fifteen, when she had lamented her lack of feminine curves. None of them had been interested in her disastrous crush on Timothy Carfield, the handsome captain of the rugby team. Gabe was the only one who had been there for her during those painful teenage years, before she had adjusted to the changes in her own body and admitted to herself that she would never be like those girls in school, that she had no desire to be like any of them. He had listened, he had advised and had always known exactly how to cheer her up whenever her adolescent fantasies of fitting in had ended in disaster. So often she had trudged home from school and straight to the Braddock house to tell Gabe about whatever humiliation she\u2019d had to endure that day. Depending on the scope of the catastrophe, he would produce ice cream, take her to the movies or drive her down to the closest junkyard\u2014his least favorite place in the world\u2014where she could happily scrounge around for car parts. And so often, he had simply hugged her and told her that everything would be okay.</p><p>Bobbi had no pride where this man was concerned. She was desperate to keep him in her life and if it meant slowly bleeding to death from every tiny, slashing wound that his romantic indifference inflicted on her, then so be it.</p><p>Still the last day and a half had exhausted her and she just wanted to get home and lick her latest wounds in private.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to stay for lunch. I just want to get home and sleep,\u201d she told him, and he frowned at her sudden mood shift.</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet,\u201d he reminded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry. I feel too sick to eat, and I\u2019d really prefer to go home. If you\u2019re hungry we could stop for some fast food or something.\u201d It was a thirty-minute drive from the affluent coastal suburb of Clifton, Cape Town, where Sandro and Theresa lived to Bobbi\u2019s and Gabe\u2019s homes in Constantia, which was a suburb located in the heart of the Cape Winelands. On a clear day like today, in his sleek Lamborghini, Gabe could do it in less time than that.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked with marked reluctance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve totally ruined this weekend for you, haven\u2019t I?\u201d She felt awful about that. She would have to take a minibreak from Gabe after this weekend, focus on her business, and maybe spend more time with her female friends.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t ruined it,\u201d he said with a slight smile. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Gabe watched the relief flood into her expressive amber eyes and the tension seep from her shoulders. She had tried to be so casual and unaffected but had failed miserably. He knew her too well to be fooled by the lighthearted act she\u2019d just put on for him. Something fundamental had shifted in their relationship, and while she was desperately scrambling to take them back to where they had been before The Kiss, Gabe perversely wanted her to acknowledge that she had kissed him and touched him because she had wanted him. Not because she had been drunk and exercising flawed judgement. He knew that he was being an idiot. He should have grabbed onto the lifeline she had thrown him and their friendship with both hands, but it just grated to see her sitting there trying so desperately to look relaxed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On the positive side, she looked like herself again. She was wearing an old pair of denim shorts that had been hacked off at mid-thigh and her favorite Pink Floyd T-shirt, which was faded and torn in places. Her hair, which he had never paid particular attention to before, was a silky mess that was long in the front\u2014with her side-parted fringe sliding over her left eye\u2014and short in the back, just brushing at the nape of her neck. The glossy black stuff sleekly conformed to the pretty shape of her head, and while it hadn\u2019t been styled in ages, it still gave her an appealing gamine quality, which when combined with her pretty, thickly lashed amber eyes, flawless golden skin, and irregular features, made him want either to ruffle her hair in affection or kiss her senseless. And therein lay the negative side of the situation: she looked like Bobbi again, his familiar and lovable best friend, his unkempt Runt, but damned if he didn\u2019t still want her. It wasn\u2019t an easy thought to adjust to, and it made him feel vaguely uncomfortable\u2014like it was somehow wrong to want a girl he had known for most of his life.</p><p>He cleared his throat and tested a perfectly bland smile on her\u2014it seemed to work because she relaxed even further.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get your stuff packed and meet me downstairs in ten minutes?\u201d he suggested. \u201cWe can say our good-byes and be on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p> <p>They left twenty minutes later, and Bobbi curled up in the luxurious black and red leather bucket seat of Gabe\u2019s gorgeous Lamborghini Aventador. On any other day she would be crooning over the car\u2019s features and begging Gabe to let her drive it, but right now she wanted to avoid all conversation with him. He put on some music, seeming content to let her pretend to doze in the passenger seat. It was classical music of course\u2014Gabe had sophisticated tastes, evidenced by the clothes he wore and the classy women he dated. Bobbi had never really known how she had managed to remain so firmly entrenched in his life despite their differences. She\u2019d always assumed that she was a remnant of his youth that he enjoyed clinging to. After all he still remained friends with her brother, Billy, and most of their other childhood mates.</p><p>She flipped over in her seat to face the window and opened her eyes to focus miserably out at the passing scenery. Gabe handled the car competently of course. He did everything competently\u2014Bobbi didn\u2019t. She was a mess, the only thing she had done properly was open her auto shop and even that fledgling venture was floundering.</p><p>The car was slowing down and she frowned, they were only halfway to Constantia. She sat up in time to see Gabe turn in to the parking lot of a popular franchise restaurant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d he said by way of explanation. \u201cAnd you could do with some food too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d she repeated, pushing her hair out of her eyes and absently noting that she needed a haircut, the fall of hair that kept flopping into her eye was becoming an irritant.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. You\u2019re eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re such a bossy bastard,\u201d she griped; it wasn\u2019t the first time she had made the complaint, and he grinned and replied the way he routinely did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my best character trait.\u201d She rolled her eyes, relieved to have fallen back into their familiar banter.</p><p>They got out of the car, which had drawn a crowd of admiring boys and men. There were a few women too, and they cast speculative looks at Gabe\u2019s tall, handsome frame, but none of them seemed to notice her of course. That was always the case\u2014she often found herself overlooked when she was standing beside him. She would be relegated to nothing more than an insignificant bystander beside someone so charismatic, and yet, Gabe never overlooked her. He\u2019d go off and flirt with the women and laugh with the men, but he always made his way back to her to side to check if she needed anything. More often than not, he hurried to find her in order to share an amusing anecdote or a juicy bit of gossip about someone in the crowd.</p><p>Gabe ignored the people milling around the car and took hold of Bobbi\u2019s elbow in order to safely lead her through them. She ignored the familiar jolt of sensation she always felt when his bare skin touched hers, but for some reason he broke stride after that initial touch and frowned down at his hand where it gripped her elbow. It was a barely noticeable moment, but Bobbi found herself obsessively wondering about it throughout the lengthy seating and meal selection process. Had he felt that current too? Before now it had been wholly one-sided, with only Bobbi feeling that frisson, but after Gabe\u2019s hesitation, she wondered if just maybe he had felt it too.</p><p>She looked up into his familiar features and was disheartened to note that he didn\u2019t look the slightest bit disconcerted and sighed quietly at that ember of hope in her chest that just wouldn\u2019t die.</p> <p>One of his elbows was on the table and his chin was resting in the palm of his hand as he stared unnervingly at her. His free hand was toying with his fork.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you heard from Chase?\u201d She felt the need to break the lengthening silence between them.</p><p>\u201cA couple of days ago. On Skype. He seemed . . .\u201d He sighed and shrugged, his concern for his twin brother obvious. Chase was an award-winning photojournalist and regularly traveled to war zones around the globe. He was currently covering a civil war in the Middle East and a number of journalists had already been kidnapped and murdered in the area. Bobbi knew that Gabe had been urging his brother to come home and leave this one be, but Chase was a stubborn man. \u201cHe seemed tired. Distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that he\u2019s fine,\u201d Bobbi comforted. \u201cHe knows how to take care of himself. He knows what precautions to take.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmmm . . .\u201d Gabe sounded unconvinced, but he forced a smile. Bobbi wasn\u2019t fooled by it and dropped her hand over his larger one on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou know what your problem is?\u201d She asked with a slight grin, and he raised an eyebrow at her.</p><p>\u201cDo tell?\u201d he invited.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bossy and arrogant that not being able to keep everybody you care about well and safe just chafes at your ego.\u201d She kept her tone light and it worked, coaxing a smile from him.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, if everybody just followed my advice, their lives would be so uncomplicated,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cBecause you always know best, right?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a smug, condescending nod.</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to have to let everybody lead their own lives and instead focus on your own because you\u2019re surrounded by stubborn people who hate being dictated to,\u201d she reminded him, glancing up when the waitress brought their drinks. Realizing that she was still holding his hand, she released her hold abruptly and grabbed her Coke\u2014grateful when the cold condensation on the outside of the glass neutralized the annoying tingle in the palm of her hand. She drank thirstily, abruptly grateful for the fizzy, cold drink as it hit the back of her parched throat. She was more dehydrated than she knew. She hated that she was proving Gabe right once again and tried to disguise her thirst from him by reluctantly wrenching her lips away from the straw.</p> <p>When she glanced up at him, he was grinning and she was happy to note that the deep-seated concern he had over his brother\u2019s welfare seemed to have been pushed to the back of his mind for now. Proving him right in this instance was well worth it.</p><p>\u201cThirsty?\u201d he asked casually, and she tossed a napkin at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m thirsty, and once my lunch gets here I\u2019ll probably realize that I\u2019m famished too so you\u2019re right once again. Try not to gloat too hard, you might break your ego bone or something!\u201d He laughed outright at that and she was happy to have coaxed the sound from him when he had been so depressed just moments before. She tried not to think about how pathetic she was: living for the sound of his laughter and proud of her measly ability to tease him into a good mood. She really needed to stop living her every moment for this man\u2014with her only solid accomplishments in life being how often she had made him smile or laugh.</p><p>She watched in exasperated affection as he neatly arranged the condiments on the table to his liking: salt, pepper, tomato sauce, chutney, mayonnaise, and mustard\u2014always neatly lined up from left to right like good little soldiers. It was something he always did and they were all used to it.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come over tonight? For popcorn and movies?\u201d he asked unexpectedly, moments after their food arrived. Bobbi, who had indeed discovered that she was ravenous, paused in the act of lifting her burger from its plate and watched as it messily dripped sauce and melted cheese over her hands. She put it back down without taking a bite and reached for a napkin to wipe the juice from her hands. Gabe had taken a huge bite out of his steak sandwich and was chewing slowly as he contemplated her from across the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rather tired,\u201d Bobbi said after a long pause. She picked up a knife and sliced her burger into four neat sections, which was more in keeping with the way Gabe ate and quite uncharacteristic for her. Bobbi never minded getting her hands dirty, be it with food, soil, or grease. But for some reason right at that moment, with him watching her\u2014she felt self-conscious about getting bacon grease, sauce, and cheese all over her face and hands.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean as soon as we got home,\u201d he clarified. \u201cI thought you might want to get some sleep first, come around later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d she said, and he pinned her with an accusatory glare.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobbi, either we\u2019re okay after what happened last night, or we\u2019re not. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we okay?\u201d she asked in a small and uncertain voice, and he sighed softly, carefully putting his sandwich down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI want us to be. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she prompted, and he sighed again before gesturing toward her plate.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this at some point, Bobbi . . . but right now I need you to finish that burger. You have to eat something, and if we get into this now, we\u2019ll talk and you won\u2019t eat.\u201d Frustrated, Bobbi glared down at the quartered burger on her plate and lifted one of the portions to take a nibble. He went back to his own sandwich and an awkward silence reigned between them until the last morsel had been consumed.</p><p>He paid for their meal and escorted her back to the car, which still had its fair share of teen admirers taking showboating cell phone photos around it. The boys looked both disappointed and awed when Gabe and Bobbi climbed into the car. One of them asked how fast the car went, and Gabe wound down the window to answer him patiently. The questions came thick and fast after that, and after answering a couple more, Gabe excused himself and started up the car, gunning the engine impressively for his admiring audience before pulling away at a disappointingly respectable speed. Bobbi rolled her eyes when she noted a few crestfallen young faces in the rearview mirror and mustered up a bit of empathy for them despite her lack of energy.</p><p>They were back on the road in seconds and there was more silence until Gabe switched the radio back on. They didn\u2019t speak again until the car slid to a stop in front of her front door. He switched off the engine and turned in his seat to face her, one arm curled over the steering wheel and the other across the top of his seat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, sevenish?\u201d he asked, and she played with the seat belt clasp, keeping her eyes down. \u201cBobbi? Don\u2019t do this. Come on, look at me.\u201d The plaintive note in his voice compelled her to obey and she reluctantly lifted her eyes to meet his. He smiled warmly at her when she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming over?\u201d he asked again and she nodded, feeling like an idiot for being unable to stick to her resolution to take a break but unable to deny him.</p><p>\u201cWhat movie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for a classic, what about Aliens?\u201d he suggested, naming one of her favorites, and she sighed before nodding. \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll see you then. You\u2019re fixing the popcorn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll toss a coin for the honor,\u201d she responded casually, taking her cues from him.</p><p>\u201cNope. I called it already,\u201d he said smugly, and she punched his shoulder affectionately.</p><p>\u201cStop changing the rules,\u201d she protested, lining up to take another shot at his shoulder, but he caught her fist in his, preventing her from making contact. It was something he had done countless times and he usually released her hand immediately, but this time his head was bent and his eyes were fixed on the sight of her small fist held captive in his. He turned their hands over and used his other to unfurl her fingers one by one\u2014taking the time to stroke each one as he uncurled it\u2014until he held her open hand palm up. He traced the lines on her pink palm slowly and thoroughly, not missing a single one. His gentle touch made her skin burn, and Bobbi was vaguely aware of the fact that her breath was coming in ragged gasps.</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d Her voice was embarrassingly shaky but it seemed to snap him out of whatever daze he was in; his head jerked up and his eyes met hers in alarm. There was a dull red streak running across his cheekbones and his eyes still looked unfocused.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d His voice was low and rough and shaking almost as much as hers had been. He looked genuinely unsettled, but he still hadn\u2019t released her hand and his thumb was absently stroking back and forth across the callused pads beneath her fingers. He held on for a moment longer before dropping her hand rather abruptly and turning to face front again. Bobbi looked at his profile, aching to reach out and stroke that clenched jaw and smooth out the tense lines that bracketed his mouth. She curbed the impulse and instead held her hands tightly clutched in her lap.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he said curtly. Hurt by the dismissal, Bobbi turned to open the door. She was in the process of shutting it behind her when his words halted her movements. \u201cBobbi . . .\u201d</p><p>She turned back expectantly but he seemed at a loss and she watched his throat work as he swallowed down whatever words might have emerged.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she said, putting him out of his misery. She walked away without looking back.</p><p>As usual the house was as silent as a tomb when Gabe got home. His mother, Lucy Templeton-Braddock Colbert, the sole heiress to one of the most profitable vineyards in the country, had moved out nearly ten years ago after her marriage to Francis Colbert\u2014wealthy entrepreneur and all-round good guy. The same couldn\u2019t be said for the loser who had fathered Gabe and Chase and who had run off to \u201cfind\u201d himself in Southeast Asia when the twins were eight years old. As far as Gabe knew, Leighton Braddock was still blowing his seemingly endless trust fund while emulating Leo Di Caprio\u2019s character from The Beach somewhere in Thailand. Gabe felt nothing but a distant bitterness on the rare occasions that he actually thought of the man whom he had worshipped as a boy.</p><p>Gabe had been mildly shocked when his mother and Francis had produced a baby girl less than nine months after their marriage. He and Chase doted on their ten-year-old half sister, Kim, but saw her very rarely. Gabe was too busy with GNT\u2014Global Network Television\u2014a subsidiary of Bobbi\u2019s father\u2019s multimedia conglomerate, Richcorp, and Chase was usually off working in some far-flung place.</p><p>Gabe headed straight for the den, poured himself a scotch, and downed it in a single gulp. He shuddered as the liquor burned its way down his gullet. He couldn\u2019t think straight and the alcohol hadn\u2019t helped at all, instead he found himself recalling how small and delicate Bobbi\u2019s hand had felt in his and how erotic he had found the contrast between the calluses just below her fingers and the softness of her palm. Naturally that thought was immediately followed by how that same hand had felt trailing across his naked flesh the night before and . . . yeah, he was hard as a rock again. He glared down at his crotch irritated, confused, and aroused all at the same time.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t even know why he had insisted she come round for movies later. Part of him wanted them to get back into their usual routine and another part of him, the one he was staring at right now, was hoping that they would be anything but normal tonight. That part of him was completely okay with more kissing, caressing, and tasting. Yes, a little more and then some of what they\u2019d shared last night, thank you very much.</p><p>He dug into his back pocket for his mobile phone\u2014thinking of cancelling\u2014but the thing started vibrating even as he reached for it. Hoping it was Bobbi wanting to cry off and thus saving him from doing it, he didn\u2019t bother to glance at the caller ID before connecting and lifting it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d His eager greeting was met with a long, crackling silence. It was a bad line and he immediately knew who it was. His stomach sank as he imagined the worst. \u201cChase?\u201d There was more static before he heard his brother\u2019s faint voice at the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Gabe asked, envisioning bombs and snipers and IEDs. His hand tightened around the phone when he heard nothing but crackling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home,\u201d Chase said after a moment. \u201cCan you . . . can you pick me up from the airport on Tuesday? Not sure about the time . . . flying into Joburg. Getting the first available domestic flight from there. I\u2019ll let you know when I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Chase sounded off and it concerned Gabe. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d Chase dodged his question. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mum.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait, Chase . . .\u201d The line was disconnected before he could say anything else and Gabe nearly tossed his phone in frustration. He immediately reached for the television remote and tuned into CNN. If anything out of the ordinary had happened, they would definitely have something about it. He skipped between the BBC and CNN, but there was nothing close to what his imagination had been conjuring up.</p><p>He was still urgently surfing news networks hours later when Bobbi walked into the den. It wasn\u2019t unusual for her to let herself in. The light in the room had changed, dimmed somewhat, and Bobbi\u2019s slight silhouette hovering in the doorway startled him.</p><p>\u201cBobbi? Shit . . .\u201d He\u2019d forgotten to cancel.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what every girl wants to hear when she walks into a room,\u201d she responded wryly before ambling in clutching a covered plate and wearing indecently short denim cut-offs that immediately sent his blood pressure soaring, combined with another of her ubiquitous tanks and a pair of trainers. Like the tiny black bikini that morning, what she was wearing wasn\u2019t anything he hadn\u2019t seen her in previously but he had never truly appreciated the golden glow of all that revealed skin before now. Every naked inch seemed to invite his touch, and he had to curl his hands into fists to prevent them from responding to that tempting invitation.</p><p>\u201cFaye sent dinner; she\u2019s convinced you\u2019ll starve if she doesn\u2019t feed you.\u201d She held up the plate with a grin, referring to the Richmonds\u2019 housekeeper. When Gabe did nothing but look at her from where he was seated in front of the huge TV, the smile slid from her face and was replaced with a concerned frown.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase called,\u201d he replied. Bobbi quickly placed the plate on the coffee table and sat down next to him.</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gabe shrugged. \u201cHe says he\u2019s coming home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong . . . he didn\u2019t sound like himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabe.\u201d She took his hand and he looked over at her. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. You spoke with him. Focus on that. You\u2019ll find out soon enough if something\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s better not to allow your imagination to run riot.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so wise, Roberta Richmond?\u201d She winced at his use of her full name and he remembered that she had once likened it to a \u201csuperhero\u2019s lame girlfriend\u2019s name.\u201d He hadn\u2019t ever given it any thought before but he kind of liked the simple grace of the name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been wise, you guys have just never appreciated my wisdom,\u201d she scoffed. He smiled automatically and\u2014while he was still worried about his brother\u2014at that moment he was even more concerned with the way her shorts had ridden all the way up her smooth, taut thighs and he was pretty damned sure she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra under that tank top. His eyes fell to her pert breasts and his breath hitched when her nipples tightened against the thin material.</p><p>Yep, no bra. She folded her arms over her chest, looking somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d he asked. His throat had gone dry and had hoarsened his voice so that the word was barely a grunt.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she denied from between gritted teeth, keeping her arms tightly folded over her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou looked somewhat cold to me,\u201d he pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cYou were staring at me,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cAnd my staring made you respond like that?\u201d She didn\u2019t reply and he watched as gooseflesh broke out all over her body\u2014with so much of her skin revealed it was hard to miss.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go,\u201d he stated. She chewed on her lower lip, a habit that she\u2019d had for years but had never before made him want to suck on that lip and lick the sting away until now.</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d She asked, her voice laced with frustration.</p><p>You. He looked at her mutely for a moment, the word hovering on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI want to watch a movie and eat popcorn and forget this entire day happened,\u201d he said instead.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do that,\u201d Bobbi said, and he could hear the relief mingled with . . . disappointment? In her voice.</p><p>Well, damn. Could it be that Bobbi Richmond wanted him too? Well wasn\u2019t that just frikken fantastic? Knowing that she may want him in return was going to make it so much harder for him to resist her. That was just one more complication he didn\u2019t need. He needed to fix this fast.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Bobbi found herself outside her auto repair shop bright and early that Sunday morning. The men and Bobbi took turns taking weekends off and this was to have been hers, but she had too much invested in the business to stay away from it for a full weekend, so she usually headed in for a couple of hours on most of her days off anyway. Besides, after the confusing events of the past forty-eight hours, starting with that ill-advised drunken kiss on Friday night, she welcomed the distraction work would offer. Her employees were all at work; the shop was usually open seven days a week with the guys working shifts during the week. Weekends were their busiest times because most people couldn\u2019t find the time to bring their cars in for minor repairs during the week. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In an effort to keep her mind away from Gabe, she had been thinking about the vintage Chevy Corvette that her team was supposed to start overhauling on Monday. It was one of her biggest accounts and her client was an old friend who had allowed her to twist his arm into renovating the old car that had been rusting beneath a drop cloth in his garage. She was excited by the opportunity. Her business was still fairly new\u2014just over a year old\u2014and if they did this well she could make a name for herself in the very exclusive vintage car restoration market. At the moment engine repairs, bodywork, and other small jobs were keeping the business afloat, but this beauty of a car could be the break that she was looking for.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss, didn\u2019t expect to see you in today,\u201d Sean, the youngest of her three mechanics, called when saw her.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I can\u2019t stay away from this place,\u201d she joked, and he laughed, before ducking his head back under the bonnet of a badly dented sedan. Bobbi headed directly to the car that she had so many hopes and dreams invested in.</p><p>\u201cWow, you are gorgeous,\u201d Bobbi whispered reverently, when she came to a halt in front of the faded beauty that graced her auto repair shop floor. \u201cHello darling, I\u2019m going to make you even more beautiful. I\u2019m going to give you a makeover. Would you like that?\u201d She ran her hands worshipfully over the sleek lines of the battered 1970 Chevy Corvette LT-1. Craig Farrow, her head mechanic, grinned when she leaned over the car\u2019s bonnet, spread her arms wide, and lay her cheek against the cold metal. She hugged the car as if it was a living, breathing entity and really to Bobbi it was. Cars spoke to her\u2014they clearly communicated their pain, their suffering, their wants, and their needs. She lay there for a long while before sighing deeply and standing upright to look down at the car regretfully.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that it won\u2019t hurt,\u201d she said solemnly. \u201cBut it\u2019ll all be worth it in the end.\u201d</p><p>Another long sigh before she glanced over at Craig, Sean, and Pieter, her other mechanic. While Sean was cheerful, Pieter, who was only slight older, was skinny as the proverbial rake and surly and uncommunicative. He did brilliant work though and seemed content to let everybody around him do the talking. They were all standing off to the side watching her commune with the car. Craig and Sean\u2014who had stopped what he\u2019d been doing for the moment\u2014looked amused while Pieter merely looked bored.</p><p>\u201cDya wanna start today, boss?\u201d Craig asked. All business now, Bobbi outlined her plan of action and her timeline for the car\u2019s \u201cmakeover.\u201d A lot of the parts had to be imported and the cost for it was coming straight out of her pocket, since she had all but begged her friend for the opportunity to work on this baby. Jason Claiborne hadn\u2019t been willing to foot the expense of overhauling the vintage car and had been quite prepared to leave her to rust, but he was unwilling to sell what had once been his father\u2019s pride and joy. Bobbi had convinced him that she could restore the car to its former glory, agreeing to charge him for only the bodywork and half of the cost of the mechanical repairs if he agreed to drive the car regularly and talk her business up if anyone asked about the car. That meant she would have to pay for the replacement parts and they didn\u2019t come cheap. The project was an ambitious one for a young, struggling business like hers and she sometimes woke up in a cold sweat knowing that she was putting all her eggs into one very rickety basket.</p><p>She hoped to keep the money trickling in with the more minor jobs but her business didn\u2019t have much of a reputation in the area yet. Added to that, she was a woman and most people didn\u2019t trust a female near their cars. She had discovered that women were worse than men when it came to rampant sexism; her small clientele consisted mostly of men. The only women who supported her were her so-called \u201cMommy Club\u201d friends and they weren\u2019t in the area enough to use her services regularly. She\u2019d had women drive into her shop and take one look at her before hastily claiming to have made a mistake and driving right back out again. And more than a few men had had the same reaction. It was disheartening to say the least.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and focused on the task at hand. She had a lot riding on the grand old lady parked in front of her but she was determined to succeed. She had dreamed of owning her own shop since her early teens, when her father had allowed her to help him \u201ctinker\u201d on his cars. The man hadn\u2019t been the most attentive father, content to let his children run wild for the most part while he focused on his business and the only moments Bobbi had felt close to him when she was a child was when he allowed her to help him work on one of his precious cars. It was his hobby, something he did to unwind, and he had always welcomed Bobbi with her questions and her eagerness to help.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t quite known what to do with a girl child and had been quite happy when she hadn\u2019t shown an interest in more feminine pursuits, at least allowing them to have some common ground. He didn\u2019t know that Bobbi had deliberately forsaken more \u201cgirlie\u201d pastimes so that she could have her father\u2019s approval and could have something in common with her brothers. She had been desperate to fit into her testosterone-laden family and so dresses and make-up had been sacrificed in favor of jeans, football, and grease.</p><p>Out of that need for approval had come this genuine love for auto mechanics. Her brothers had all gone to university after high school and had gone on to become a lawyer, architect, and doctor, respectively. Bobbi hadn\u2019t wanted to be anything other than a mechanic and she had worked at an auto shop all through high school. She had halfheartedly pursued an aimless BA degree in English Literature before eventually dropping out to get an automotive certification instead. She had studied and worked hard and had apprenticed at three different auto repair shops. Years later a combination of savings, a small business loan, and some money her mother\u2014who had died of a pulmonary embolism when Bobbi was just five\u2014had left in trust for her had afforded her the opportunity to open her own shop in town at the relatively young age of twenty-five. Her father had been willing to finance the whole shop but she had wanted to do this by herself. Nobody could ever accuse her of being a pampered, spoiled brat whose wealthy daddy bankrolled her life. It was bad enough that she still lived at home. It was her only viable option at the moment, with every spare cent going into the business. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Starting an auto repair shop wasn\u2019t cheap and if not for Gabe\u2019s emotional support and encouragement back when the idea was just a nascent seed floundering beneath mounds of crushing self-doubt, Bobbi would probably not even have tried to get it off the ground. Gabe had always made her feel like what she wanted was equally as important as her brothers\u2019 lofty ambitions. The costs of her state-of-the-art equipment, building rental, and employee payrolls were immense and Bobbi would swallow her pride and live at home if it meant saving money on rent and food. She\u2019d had a lot more privacy since her brothers had all moved out anyway and usually only saw her father at mealtimes. The man was a workaholic and was always closeted away in his office running the multimillion dollar family business that none of his children had wanted to take over. Instead, Gabe was the one who was being groomed to succeed him as Richcorp\u2019s chairman.</p><p>Gabe had been Mike Richmond\u2019s first, last, and only choice as successor once it had become clear that none of his children were interested in learning anything about his huge multimedia conglomerate, which owned five local newspapers around the country, three national radio stations, four glossy multilingual magazines, and a premium cable television that serviced most of the country and a large portion of the continent as well. Gabe had been the one who had asked the intelligent questions on career day when Mike Richmond had graced his classroom\u2014which he shared with his twin, Chase, and her brother Billy\u2014with his formidable presence. Gabe had been the one to dog the older man\u2019s footsteps and beg for a summer job when he was fifteen. While Chase and Billy had flirted with girls and been typical adolescents, Gabe had worked his butt off in the stuffy mailroom of the Cape Town branch of the company. He had eventually obtained his MBA\u2014all the while working his way up through the ranks until he had reached his current status as the CEO of GNT, Richcorp\u2019s most prolific subsidiary. Now he was poised to take over the whole kit and caboodle.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d As if she had unconsciously summoned Gabe with her thoughts, his glossy, expensive shoes suddenly materialized at her feet. Startled, she lost focus and raised her head, hitting it on the underside of the car with a bang. Damn it!</p><p>She swore roundly and he chuckled in response to her colorful curses. He went down on his haunches and she felt his hands wrap around her ankles. Before she could question him, he dragged her out from under the car. The creeper that she was lying on eased his task significantly. He didn\u2019t budge as he pulled her closer and she had no choice but to part and bend her knees so that they were splayed on either side of his thighs. He halted her progress before the creeper\u2014which was long enough only to support her from shoulder to backside\u2014could whack him on the ankles.</p> <p>Disgruntled, she sat up but then immediately realized that the move hadn\u2019t been well thought out on her part. It brought her chest within a hairs\u2019 breath of his much broader one and she could feel the heat poring off him. He also smelled delicious\u2014hints of green forest mixed with his own earthy scent\u2014while she was self-consciously aware of the fact that she reeked of Eau de Grease. Still she was so hyperaware of his proximity that her breath shortened into ragged gasps, and her nipples tightened into hard ingots of excruciating sensation. She was grateful for the fact that she wore her loose gray overalls since they hid the embarrassing development from his all-encompassing scrutiny. After the night before she would rather not have it known that it was a pretty typical reaction to his presence. Once could be written off as a fluke. Twice and he\u2019d be onto her longest-kept secret in no time.</p><p>She licked her lips nervously and his eyes dropped down to her mouth to track the movement. His rapt gaze traveled over her face and his eyes widened for a fraction of a second before he raised his hand to cup one of her cheeks. He leaned in and Bobbi swallowed painfully. Oh dear God, he was going to kiss her . . .</p><p>Of course he was going to kiss her!</p><p>It was inevitable. He had confused her so much over the past couple of days but perhaps he was ready to acknowledge he was attracted to her as well? Her lips parted, her eyes slid shut, and his thumb brushed over her cheekbone before his hand abruptly left her face. She was startled into opening her eyes just in time to see him raise his thumb into her line of vision.</p><p>\u201cGrease,\u201d he said, wrinkling his nose. She gasped and humiliated color flooded into her cheeks as she caught the mixture of laughter and distaste in his eyes.</p> <p>She was mortified that she had once again allowed herself to entertain the notion that Gabe could possibly be attracted to her. Her inability to separate reality from her crazy fantasies was one of the reasons she simply had to keep him at a physical distance. That meant no more ill-advised movie nights. She would start being firmer and saying no to him more often. It was mortifying how very little backbone she had when it came to this man. Bobbi reached for a rag that she kept tucked into her pocket and scrubbed self-consciously at her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here.\u201d Her voice was muffled as she continued to wipe her face. \u201cI mean, aren\u2019t you afraid of getting grime on your lovely suit? Grease is impossible to get out, you know.\u201d She eyed the expensive tailor-made three-piece iron-gray suit disdainfully, desperate to get back into familiar territory with him. She didn\u2019t ask him what he was doing in a suit on a Sunday afternoon; Gabe was a real workaholic and since he\u2019d taken Saturday off it was inevitable that he\u2019d go to the office on Sunday.</p><p>Knowing him, he\u2019d probably swum a few laps this morning, headed out to the office afterward, had a few high-powered business meetings\u2014achieving more in a few hours than most people achieved in a full day at work. Just a typical morning for the industrious Gabriel Braddock, and now he was here with nary a hair out of place and enough time left in his day to torment her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He merely grinned in response to her words before leaping nimbly to his feet. She felt a profound sense of loss when he moved away and ducked her head to disguise her reaction. When she looked up again only after carefully cultivating a blank expression, it was to see him holding out a hand to her. She hesitated before reluctantly taking the outstretched hand. His long, elegant fingers curled around her grubby paw and the muscles in his thighs tensed as he leaned back to tug her up.</p><p>He overestimated her weight\u2014using a smidgen too much strength\u2014and Bobbi lost her balance. For a few awkward seconds she found herself plastered against his hard body before\u2014after a seemingly interminable amount of time had passed\u2014he grabbed her upper arms and shifted her away.</p><p>Dazed, she peered up at him for a moment while she tried to force herself to forget about the burning imprint of his chest against her cheek, his torso against her breasts, and most startling of all\u2014the firm masculine bulge between his thighs against her stomach. For a brief moment, she allowed herself to speculate about that substantial bulge. She had easily felt it through the fabric of their clothing, even though he wasn\u2019t aroused and it made her\u2014very inappropriately\u2014wonder about the size of him when he was erect. She remembered Friday night, in his room, when she had touched him. He had seemed . . . affected then, but she hadn\u2019t considered how affected he might have been until now. Had be been turned on? Hard? The thought sent her face up in flames.</p><p>She lifted the rag and pretended to rub off the grease on her face again in an effort to disguise her inexplicable blush.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d his hand reached out to halt hers. \u201cYou got it all. You\u2019ll scour the skin off your face if you keep that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, anyway?\u201d she asked him sullenly, determined to regain her equilibrium.</p><p>\u201cTaking you to lunch,\u201d he informed authoritatively, elbowing his jacket aside to shove his hands into his trouser pockets. Naturally her eyes fell to where the expensive fabric strained across his muscled thighs and crotch. She cleared her throat nervously and averted her eyes.</p><p>Jesus! Pull yourself together, Richmond, she lectured herself sternly. This was beyond ridiculous. She could get past this; she\u2019d done it before and she\u2019d undoubtedly have to do it again\u2014even though it was becoming increasingly and devastatingly painful for her to deal with Gabe\u2019s affectionate disinterest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy today . . . and I had a big breakfast,\u201d she lied, and he rolled his eyes at her.</p> <p>\u201cA slice of toast isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s idea of a big breakfast,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFaye?\u201d she asked with a resigned sigh. Faye tended to jump at every opportunity to get Bobbi to eat more. The woman often said that Bobbi\u2019s skinny frame served as a very poor testimonial to Faye\u2019s cooking skills.</p><p>\u201cUm-hmm,\u201d Gabe confirmed with a sexy hum that immediately had her stupid nipples standing to attention again. God, this was ridiculous . . . why did she have to be so aware of him?</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I snacked throughout the morning.\u201d</p><p>Gabe raised a questioning brow at Sean and Craig. The other men had their lunch bags in hand and were obviously getting ready to take a break.</p><p>\u201cIf you call a half-eaten apple a snack,\u201d Craig said with a jovial shrug, ignoring Bobbi\u2019s glare before he and the other two men waved and traipsed off to enjoy their lunch in the park opposite her shop.</p> <p>\u201cI guess that settles it,\u201d he said with a charming grin that set her teeth on edge and made her want to slap him and kiss him at the same time. It was the latter impulse that made her snap at him defensively.</p><p>\u201cIt settles nothing! You\u2019re not my keeper, Gabe, and if I choose to have a working lunch it\u2019s nothing to you.\u201d Okay, she sounded like a total bitch and immediately felt awful about it\u2014especially when she saw the flash of confusion in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry with me,\u201d he observed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d She sighed. It wasn\u2019t his fault that he couldn\u2019t see her as anything other than a surrogate sister, while she wanted so much more than just friendship from him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gabe, I\u2019m just tired. Let me get cleaned up and we can grab something to eat.\u201d</p><p>Gabe watched as Bobbi prowled off to the tiny glass cubicle that served as her office. He didn\u2019t know how to deal with her or talk to her anymore.</p><p>He\u2019d thought that coming to her shop and seeing her in her element, with grease on her face and hands, would help him get over whatever was going on with him. But when he had dragged her out from beneath that car and she had spread her legs around his thighs, his thoughts had been so X-rated that if anybody had been able to read his mind at that moment, he would have been arrested for obscenity right on the spot. He had quite frantically searched for a way to get himself back under control and had found it in the speck of grease on her cheek. He had imagined her at any of the social events that he was regularly required to go to as the CEO of GNT, and Bobbi was hardly the type of female he\u2019d want gracing his arm. But then he had tugged her up, she had fallen against him, and all rational thought had fled his mind again.</p><p>He watched, a reluctant smile tugging at the corners of his lips, as she headed over to a sink in her office and rinsed her hands and face before sticking her entire head under the faucet to wet her short black hair. There was really no artifice about her. What you saw was what you got with Bobbi. She reached for a towel and draped it over her head before tugging at the zipper of her overalls and dragging it down. Gabe found himself riveted and took an inadvertent step closer to the office as she revealed a seemingly endless expanse of pale, naked skin to his eyes. What the hell was she wearing under that damned thing? The heavy material eventually parted enough to reveal a tight blue tank top and she dragged her arms out of the sleeves in quick, practiced movements. The top half of her overalls was now bunched at her waist with the sleeves dangling down the backs of her legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Twin rivulets of water streamed from her wet hair and followed the path of her delicate clavicles down over the slight swell of her breasts to merge into a single stream just before disappearing into the shallow crevice of her cleavage and dampening the light cotton of her tank. His eyes widened as he watched her nipples bead in response to the cold trickle of water. She obviously wasn\u2019t wearing a bra, again! And again that knowledge made his mouth go completely dry. For God\u2019s sake, didn\u2019t the damned woman own a bra?</p><p>Her hands went to her hips as she pushed the material of her overalls further down, her slight shimmy as she wriggled her way out of it, making her pert breasts bounce slightly. At last, the overalls dropped to the floor, and his eyes trekked down from her chest over the flat expanse of her stomach to her silky, naked legs as she stepped clear of the discarded pile of cloth. She was wearing another pair of tiny cut-off denim shorts that made her slender legs look impossibly long, which was crazy for a woman whose height barely scraped in past five foot. She turned and bent at the waist to pick up the discarded overalls and Gabe swallowed painfully as he watched the denim go taut over the curve of her butt. The material rode up just enough to give him a tantalizing glimpse of the pouty curve where thigh met arse.</p><p>\u201cChrist Almighty!\u201d he swore shakily. He was\u2014for the umpteenth time that weekend\u2014fully and painfully erect and had been since the moment she had pushed the damned overalls down over her slim shoulders. Shaken, he turned away from the cubicle and tried to compose himself. This was beyond ridiculous . . . He pushed a trembling hand through his hair and inhaled deeply as he tried to get himself under control again.</p><p>This for damned sure couldn\u2019t be healthy. Surely a man couldn\u2019t will away this many erections in such a short time without suffering severe physical and mental repercussions? He was just managing to get it under control when he felt her hand curling around his bicep. He nearly leapt out of his skin at the contact.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said with a slight smile, and he blinked, confused.</p><p>Ready for what? No way in hell was she ready for what he wanted to do to her. She wasn\u2019t ready for him to lift her onto the bonnet of that damned car she\u2019d been under just minutes ago. She wasn\u2019t ready for him to cover her tight body with his own and shove her thighs apart. And she sure as hell wasn\u2019t ready for him to drag those tempting shorts down her thighs before thrusting his full length into her.</p><p>He peered down into her expectant face and found his eyes dropping down to her smiling mouth. Her lower lip had a generous curve to it that made it look as ripe and juicy as a peach . . . and damn it, remembering that it tasted as good as it looked wasn\u2019t helping one bit.</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d Another small taste wouldn\u2019t do any harm would it? He leaned toward her and her hand tightened around his bicep to give him a slight shake.</p> <p>\u201cGabe!\u201d He shook his head and the haze of lust that had obliterated his reason for the past few moments reluctantly dissipated.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Was he? Who the hell knew anymore? He was riveted by her pretty mouth: bow-shaped and bee-stung, it would look more at home on a \u201940s bombshell movie star than the skinny tomboy standing in front of him. He barely stifled a groan as he suddenly pictured those lips wrapped around his length and . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he gruffly assured the still-concerned Bobbi. \u201cSorry about that. I was thinking about a problem at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay . . .\u201d She sounded unconvinced but didn\u2019t push it. \u201cYou ready to go?\u201d He nodded and led her toward his car parked out front.</p><p>\u201cGuys, keep an eye on the place, okay?\u201d she yelled at the three men who were sitting at a picnic table in the park opposite the road. None of them bothered to look up when they heard her voice and the only acknowledgment she got was a lazy thumbs-up from Sean.</p> <p>She headed to the driver\u2019s side of the car and watched Gabe expectantly from across the gleaming red roof. He stifled a grin and merely raised an eyebrow at her. She seemed to recognize the no way in hell look he was giving her, and her shoulders slumped a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to let me drive this baby?\u201d she asked, her hand lovingly trailing over the sleek curve of the Lamborghini\u2019s bonnet. Gabe tried, very hard, not to remember that same hand running over his body with equal reverence. He mostly succeeded and tried to focus on her question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think that the answer to your question lies in a place called Never Land, which is located just east of when hell freezes over and to the north of when pigs sprout wings.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond to that and lowered herself into the comfortable black and red leather passenger seat with a blissful sigh. She took a moment to enjoy the new car smell and turned her cheek to nuzzle the luxurious leather headrest. The last time she had traveled in the car, she had been too hung over to pay the respectful homage she seemed to reserve for this automobile in particular. She made up for that now. Her hands traced every feature on the control panel between the seats and her fingers caressed their way across the dashboard until she was leaning over to stroke the smooth leather of the steering wheel. Gabe had made his way around the front of the car and was now staring at the sensual movements of her hands in fascination. Aware of the fact that his crotch\u2014which was showing embarrassing signs of life again\u2014was in her direct line of sight, he crouched with one arm resting on the roof of the car and the other on the head rest of the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite done groping my car?\u201d he asked, cringing when the words emerged in a growl rather than in the casual tone he was aiming for. She sighed and settled back into her seat. While she fumbled with her seat belt, he lowered himself behind the wheel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, he loved this car. It had been his reward to himself after stepping up as CEO of GNT. He wasn\u2019t one for the usual trappings of wealth\u2014he lived in the house he\u2019d grown up in and rarely traveled unless it was for work. But he had a weakness for sleek, expensive, classy cars and sleek, expensive, classy women, and he frequently indulged himself. He collected sports cars and dated women that Chase loved to call brainy, beautiful, boring babes. Which was somewhat unfair. Sure his ex-girlfriends all tended to be a bit on the . . . dry side, but they weren\u2019t that bad, just a bit serious. Okay, so the last one\u2014a pathologist\u2014had talked about blood a lot. So much so that Bobbi had taken to calling her Vampira behind her back. The name had stuck and all his friends had started doing the same\u2014Gabe had broken it off after nearly slipping up and calling her Vampira while they were on a date. He hadn\u2019t known until that moment that he had started thinking of her by that unfortunate nickname as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so selfish with your toys, Gabe,\u201d Bobbi accused with a pout, and he shrugged as he turned on the car, grinning in satisfaction at the low, throaty purr coming from the engine.</p><p>\u201cManny\u2019s for lunch?\u201d he asked, pulling away from the sidewalk as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cOnly place I\u2019m dressed for,\u201d she pointed out, and his eyes involuntarily dropped to her bare thighs again. He cleared his throat before refocusing his attention on the road. An uncomfortable silence followed and Gabe hunted for a way to fill it.</p> <p>\u201cSo how do you plan to save that old heap of Jason\u2019s?\u201d he blurted out.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not an old heap,\u201d Bobbi protested. \u201cShe\u2019s just a bit faded and I\u2019m going to restore her to her former glory. She\u2019ll look amazing afterward and she\u2019ll handle like a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s business?\u201d he asked, hating how he seemed to be reaching for conversational topics with her\u2014usually conversation flowed naturally between them, but suddenly he couldn\u2019t think of a single thing to say that didn\u2019t feature the words screw you senseless somewhere in the mix. She didn\u2019t seem to notice his discomfort, leaning forward to investigate the speedometer instead.</p><p>\u201cPassable.\u201d She shrugged, tapping at the glass pane. \u201cIs this thing broken or are you really going that slowly? In a frikkin Lamborghini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case it\u2019s escaped your notice, we\u2019re on a busy main road,\u201d he pointed out. She said something less than complimentary beneath her breath. For some reason her disdain grated and he was stricken by the unfathomable urge to gun the engine and disregard the rules of the road. He had never felt this uncharacteristic need to impress her before.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you out on an open, quiet road sometime and let her loose,\u201d he offered, and her pretty eyes lit up as they met his for a few brief seconds before he had to focus on the road again.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Will you let me drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a good driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a reckless driver.\u201d He could feel the waves of fury emanating from her after his words but she said nothing in response. She said nothing at all even when he parked in front of Manny\u2019s a couple of minutes later, and that\u2019s when he realized that she was actually giving him The Silent Treatment. He hid a grin. She could never keep it up for longer than five minutes\u2014so it didn\u2019t bother him at all that she chose to seethe in silence. She was a reckless driver. She loved speed way too much, and while she handled cars competently enough, being in a car with her in the driver\u2019s seat was enough to give anyone gray hairs.</p><p>They walked into Manny\u2019s together, and Gabe curbed the ridiculous impulse to rush forward and get the door for her.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Bobbi,\u201d a chorus of male voices called as she walked in.</p><p>\u201cCome over here and settle a bet will you?\u201d It sounded like Jason, but Gabe couldn\u2019t be sure, there were too many bodies between them and the voice.</p><p>Gabe watched with a frown as she wove her way through the tables that were scattered haphazardly around the pub\u2019s floor to make her way to the bar where a random group of their friends were gathered. The men were all laughing and talking loudly and the tall, bulky frames soon enveloped Bobbi\u2019s slight figure as she disappeared from his line of sight completely. Irritated, he stepped forward, determined to reclaim his lunch date. He could hear her quiet voice above the deeper voices of the men, and they all paused for a beat before an eruption of whoops and groans went up in response to whatever she\u2019d said or done. Money exchanged hands and curious now, Gabe stepped into the throng. Bobbi was grinning impishly.</p><p>\u201cGabe,\u201d Jason eventually noticed him and slapped him on the back enthusiastically. \u201cGood to see you, man! I just wanted Bobbi to do that thing with the dart. My old university buddies are visiting and wouldn\u2019t believe it until they saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat thing?\u201d he asked, hoping it wasn\u2019t the same \u201cthing\u201d he had warned Bobbi against doing years before.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Jason prompted with a laugh. \u201cWhen she balances the sharp end of a dart on the bridge of her nose?\u201d</p><p>Damn it! The crazy woman could put an eye out with that stunt. He found her defiant eyes through the crowd of still laughing men and she angled her stubborn jaw upward, obviously daring him to say something about it. He bit back the words of censure, not wanting to be too predictable and knowing that while she was braced for them they would have little to no impact on her.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for lunch yet?\u201d he asked pointedly and saw the flicker of surprise on her face before she nodded. He made a sweeping gesture with his arm as he sarcastically ushered her toward one of the empty tables in the middle of the room. She kept her head down as she passed him and when he turned to nod his farewell to Jason he noticed that all of the other man\u2019s friends had their stares firmly fixed on Bobbi\u2019s derriere and naked thighs. He barely refrained from shoving the guy closest to him, the one who was actually tilting his damned head for a better view and instead took immense satisfaction in placing his own bulk between Bobbi\u2019s departing figure and the leering gazes of the gathered men.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was already sitting down when he reached the table and took the seat opposite hers, fighting back an irrational surge of anger and frustration when he saw the slight indent and red mark on the bridge of her cute nose. The minute mark marred her pale, smooth skin and seeing it there aggravated him beyond measure. She was watching him warily, but he refrained from commenting and merely called over a waitress and then waited for a long irritating moment while Bobbi perused the familiar menu for ages before placing her order of calamari and chips. He didn\u2019t bother to glance at the menu and instead ordered his usual fare.</p><p>Bobbi snorted when she heard his order and he inclined his head in question.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do have other stuff here, Gabe,\u201d she elaborated\u2014her voice lightly frosted with scorn. \u201cBut you always order the ribs, chips, and salad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know they have other stuff here,\u201d he countered, his tone measured as he arranged the condiments to his liking. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve tried them all but I like the ribs the most. I don\u2019t see why I should order anything else when I know that this is what I like best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome variety wouldn\u2019t kill you, you know?\u201d She groused as she very deliberately rearranged the bottles that he had painstakingly placed in order of preference. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to order the steak instead of the ribs. It\u2019s perfectly fine to get a buzz cut or grow your hair down past your collar.\u201d Her eyes went up to his conservatively cut and parted hair, and it took every ounce of his willpower to refrain from self-consciously raking his fingers through said hair. Instead he focused on putting the bottles back into order, ignoring her snort of amusement.</p><p>\u201cAnd while we\u2019re at it, it\u2019s all right to date a dumb brunette once in a while instead of a brainy blonde. I swear to God, that bloodless parade of boring blondes you date has sucked every ounce of life and fun out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should be more like you?\u201d he murmured scathingly, raking his eyes over her scruffy figure scornfully. It nearly killed him not to linger over her silky smooth legs and pert breasts but he had a point to prove. \u201cMore careless and carefree? You live your life without any structure or order, Bobbi. Sure you\u2019ve managed to open that shop but you have no real business plan and you have everything vested in that damned car of Jason\u2019s. What will you do if, or more likely when, that plan fails? It would behoove you to be less carefree and more responsible. You now have employees\u2014people who, unfathomably enough, depend on you for their livelihood. Maybe it\u2019s time to stop being such a child. Stop balancing darts on your nose, racing motorcycles at the track, and dressing like a two-bit little . . .\u201d He stopped himself before he completed the sentence but her wide eyes told him that she knew exactly what he\u2019d been about to say. He swallowed past the lump in his throat and tried to apologize but the words wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>They sat in silence until the waitress brought their food, avoiding eye contact at all costs, and Gabe felt like a complete bastard for the unspoken word that now hovered between them.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the way I dress?\u201d She suddenly broke the loaded silence\u2014her voice small and uncertain.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook I was being an idiot.\u201d He kept his eyes firmly on his plate.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it if you didn\u2019t think there was something wrong with my clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your clothing,\u201d he snapped.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201d she snapped right back at him.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d This time he did rake a frustrated hand through his hair. \u201cLook, those shorts are just too . . . short okay? And um . . .\u201d He waved his fork at her chest area, trying not to look and then totally looking. God, she had pretty breasts . . . Focus, Gabe! \u201cWear a damned bra, for God\u2019s sake! You keep flashing those nipples at me and I won\u2019t be responsible for my actions.\u201d And then, as if the mere word had conjured them into being, there they were again, tightening against the soft material of her tank top, unfurling like perfect little rosebuds right beneath his very eyes. And this time he couldn\u2019t help but focus directly on them; he couldn\u2019t drag his eyes away from them. He lost his train of thought and felt sweat beading on his brow and above his lip, felt it pooling beneath his arms and in the center of his chest.</p><p>Want! Need! Now!</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>The three words blindsided him and rang like a bell in his mind. His throat went dry with the astonishing realization that this wasn\u2019t some bizarre, fleeting aberration. That he really wanted her and would continue wanting her until he had done something about it.</p><p>Under him, over him, in front of him\u2014he wanted her any way he could have her . . . He wanted her more than he wanted his next breath and it was insane! He dragged his apologetic eyes up to her embarrassed golden regard. How the hell did you tell your friend that you wanted to sleep with her? But that that\u2019s all you wanted from her. He was honest enough to admit that he desperately wanted to have sex with her\u2014why now, after all these years? He had no clue but that was what he wanted. What he didn\u2019t want was anything more than that. He loved her but she wasn\u2019t a woman he could ever envision spending his life with. They were too different. The woman of his dreams was tall, graceful, refined, and had an immaculate sense of style and design. Bobbi was the complete opposite of that woman.</p><p>But how could he propose no-strings sex to this woman who meant so much to him and expect to still retain a friendship after the affair ended? Bobbi would expect more from him and he could very well wind up breaking her heart. That thought was perfectly unbearable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bobbi folded her arms tightly across her chest and lowered her eyes to her plate, she knew that her cheeks were blazing with color but she couldn\u2019t do much about that at the moment. She wished that the floor would just open up and swallow her\u2014she was so embarrassed. Thankfully he wasn\u2019t staring at her traitorous breasts anymore; instead he was focused intently on his plate, with his jaw clenched and his hands curled into fists on the table. He was concentrating so fiercely on that plate that she half expected it to start levitating.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry . . .\u201d The words were so quiet they were practically swallowed up by the buzzing conversations of the crowd around them, and if not for the fact that he had raised his blazing eyes to meet hers, Bobbi would have dismissed it as imagination. \u201cThat was completely out of line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part? Your comment about the way I dressed or your reference to my . . .\u201d She nodded down at her breasts which were still shielded by her crossed arms. She watched as his eyes drifted back down to her chest and lingered for a long moment before jerking back up to her face.</p><p>He cleared his throat uncomfortably.</p> <p>\u201cI made it personal\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have brought your . . . your body into it,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt was already personal when you criticized the way I dressed,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBobbi, we\u2019re surrounded by men, not all of whom know you . . . and those shorts would tempt a saint.\u201d She was riveted by the dull red that stained his cheekbones and narrowed her eyes as an intriguing possibility occurred to her.</p><p>\u201cDo they tempt you?\u201d Right\u2014she needed a filter between her brain and her mouth\u2014because she couldn\u2019t keep saying every single thing that popped into her head. Yet . . . the red stain on his cheekbones darkened and spread inexorably.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not . . .\u201d She kept her eyes trained on his face, fascinated to note that he couldn\u2019t quite meet her eyes and for the first time ever felt in control and powerful around this man who so unsettled her at times. She deliberately dropped her arms and braced them on either side of her plate, before leaning toward him. She was rewarded by the brief, panicked glance he directed down at her cleavage before dragging his eyes back up to her face\u2014and even then he couldn\u2019t seem to look higher than her mouth. Deciding to test him even further, she flicked out her tongue to moisten her lower lip and noted the convulsive movement of his throat as he swallowed while his eyes tracked the slow, deliberate movement of her tongue with ferocious concentration.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not changing the way I dress after all these years, Gabe,\u201d she told him\u2014and his eyes snapped back into focus as they met hers. \u201cIt\u2019s never bothered you before, so what\u2019s different now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d Two blatant lies in as many minutes. Bobbi was starting to enjoy herself.</p><p>\u201cThen why mention it?\u201d she pushed.</p><p>\u201cJust forget I said anything.\u201d He picked up his knife and fork with hands that were trembling ever so slightly. She didn\u2019t respond and kept staring at him until he put the cutlery down again. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand men, Bobbi . . . they\u2019re easily aroused and . . .\u201d Her rich laughter cut him off and the sound halted his awkward lecture mid-sentence.</p><p>\u201cGabe, I\u2019m not na\u00efve. I don\u2019t need you to explain the birds and the bees to me. Trust me, you\u2019re years too late with that particular lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that, exactly?\u201d His voice had taken on a dangerous edge and she merely smiled at him.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing you need to concern yourself over,\u201d she said dismissively, with a flick of her hand. She picked up her own utensils and dug into her meal with relish, suddenly feeling inordinately cheerful. \u201cEat your lunch, it\u2019s getting cold.\u201d He bristled at the dismissal and even though he tried to broach the subject again, she ignored him and raved about the Corvette instead, telling him what she had planned for the car.</p><p>\u201cI know you think I\u2019m being foolish by investing so much into this,\u201d she said after running out of steam since Gabe had contributed nothing more to the conversation than grunts and nods, making her sharply aware of the other criticisms that he had leveled at her business sense earlier before he had distracted her by bringing her lack of dress sense into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI would be less concerned if you had a long-term plan for the business,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean to make it sound like I had no confidence in your ability to make a success out of the shop, Bobbi.\u201d Unfortunately, that was exactly how it sounded and Bobbi was still hurt by his lack of faith in her. Gabe had always made her feel like he had the utmost belief in her ability to achieve everything she set her mind to. That\u2019s why the doubt, the outright cynicism, she had heard from him earlier had cut so deeply. Now, she shrugged and\u2014as she always did when he inadvertently hurt her\u2014brushed it aside in order to make him feel better.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d It\u2019s not okay. Her subconscious was riled. \u201cI know you\u2019re just concerned.\u201d I don\u2019t need your concern! I need your support. I want you to have faith in me and in what I can do.</p><p>She didn\u2019t voice what she was really feeling\u2014as was always the case when it came to Gabe. She remained mute . . . for the sake of their friendship.</p><p>Relieved to have things back on an even keel, Gabe smiled at her. He hadn\u2019t even glanced at her breasts in over ten minutes and he\u2019d barely thought about them in well over a minute. Thankfully she\u2019d left her uncomfortable line of questioning behind and they were back in familiar territory. His unfair\u2014if not unfounded\u2014zinger about her plans for Jason\u2019s car had been forgiven. Things were practically back to normal . . . until Jason ambled over to their table with a tall, smiling guy in tow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey guys, mind if we join you?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an affirmative and dragged a couple of chairs over and waved the guy into one before plonking down into the other.</p><p>\u201cGabe, Bobbi, this is Kyle Foster\u2014an old friend of mine.\u201d The man reached over and shook Gabe\u2019s hand firmly before angling his chair toward Bobbi\u2019s and taking her hand in a gentler grasp and bringing it to his lips.</p><p>\u201cCharmed.\u201d He grinned and Bobbi laughed\u2014clearly enjoying the guy\u2019s smarmy attentions.</p><p>\u201cSo Bobbi, huh? That\u2019s an unusual name.\u201d He kept his voice low and intimate and it grated on Gabe\u2019s last nerve.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s Roberta, actually. Roberta Richmond.\u201d Gabe couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d just heard that. She never told anybody her full name. For her to simply volunteer it was highly unusual.</p><p>\u201cSo Gabe, I wanted to ask for your advice on a couple of investments I\u2019m interested in making,\u201d Jason was saying, trying to gain his attention but Gabe could barely focus on his friend, far too interested in the low-voiced conversation between Bobbi and Foster.</p><p>\u201cHey, mate,\u201d Jason waved a hand in front of Gabe\u2019s eyes, demanding his attention, and Gabe blinked over at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped, his voice low and frustrated. Jason leaned in toward him.</p><p>\u201cWork with me here, bro.\u201d He kept his voice low enough for only Gabe to hear. \u201cKyle wanted to meet Bobbi. Guy\u2019s smitten\u2014so give him a chance to chat her up. He\u2019s a decent bloke.\u201d</p> <p>He was setting Bobbi up with this jerk? Gabe practically choked on a sip of beer and had to do everything in his power not to glare at Jason. He focused his attention back on Bobbi and Foster and was alarmed to note that the guy was whispering in her ear and she was listening to whatever he was saying with a delighted smile on her face. That smile was goddamned radiant and it set his teeth completely on edge. Gabe couldn\u2019t remember the last time she had smiled at him like that. In fact, he couldn\u2019t recall her ever smiling at him like that.</p><p>\u201cBobbi,\u201d he growled. \u201cTime to go.\u201d</p><p>Jason swore, keeping his voice low so that only Gabe could hear him. \u201cCome on, Gabe . . . they\u2019re hitting it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind driving her back to her shop,\u201d Foster volunteered. Gabe was about to tell him what to do with that unwelcome offer when Bobbi agreed to the guy\u2019s suggestion. He was completely outvoted when Jason enthusiastically agreed that it was a brilliant idea.</p><p>\u201cBobbi?\u201d He kept his voice reasonable and his eyes level but she barely glanced at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Gabe, I\u2019m sure Kyle will make sure that I get back safely.\u201d Her casual dismissal stung like hell, and Gabe felt irrationally betrayed by it. He dug his wallet out of his jacket pocket and left enough cash on the table to cover both of their meals. He strode away without a backward glance, ignoring the chorus of cheerful \u201csee you\u2019s\u201d that followed him out the door.</p> <p>When he got to his car, he braced his hands on the roof of the car and dragged in a deep breath. He glanced through the pub\u2019s windows and saw Bobbi laughing at something Foster had just said and barely refrained from kicking at his tire.</p><p>Okay, so he was attracted to her but he couldn\u2019t possibly be jealous, could he? Bobbi hooking up with some other guy might be just what he needed to get over this ridiculous desire he felt for her.</p><p>He shook his head, ran a hand through his hair, and climbed into his car. He was just overtired and horny. He needed rest and a woman in his life. Rest he could take care of immediately, and he had always had a few prospects in the female companionship department. He just wished he could drum up a bit of enthusiasm at the thought of spending time with some other woman when it was Bobbi that he couldn\u2019t stop fantasizing about.</p><p>Bobbi genuinely liked Kyle Foster; he was witty and charming and she found herself enjoying his company on the drive back to her shop. When he drew the car to a stop, she invited him in to have a look around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that,\u201d he enthused, climbing out and hurrying around to the passenger side to open the car door for her. It was a charming gesture that very few men had ever performed for the tomboyish Bobbi, and she was completely flattered by it.</p><p>\u201cWow, this is amazing, Roberta.\u201d He sounded suitably impressed as he walked around the shop, running a light hand over the tools before pausing in front of the Corvette where Craig was currently using the overhead hoist to remove the engine. The older man managed a distracted greeting before focusing his attention back on the car.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured. Kyle turned to her with a warm smile on his attractive face.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . I was wondering if you\u2019d like to go out sometime? Lunch or dinner, maybe?\u201d She was on the verge of making up some lame excuse when she stopped herself. Why not? Gabe would never return her feelings and she couldn\u2019t keep turning down perfectly nice guys in the hopes that he would someday come to the unlikely realization that she was the one for him. But then she thought about his bizarre reaction to the way she was dressed earlier and found herself indulging in a bout of entirely self-indulgent what if\u2019s . . .</p> <p>\u201cRoberta?\u201d Kyle\u2019s quiet voice jerked her from her favorite fantasy of Gabe sweeping her up into his arms and she shook herself. It would do her good to go out with a man as something other than just a buddy\u2014but with the way she felt about Gabe, it hardly seemed right to string along a perfectly lovely man like Kyle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that . . . very much actually,\u201d she said uncertainly. His smile widened and his eyes crinkled appealingly at the corners. He wasn\u2019t as gorgeous as Gabe but then few men were, and Bobbi resolved then and there to stop comparing every man she met to Gabe\u2014it wasn\u2019t fair. Kyle was tall, he had shaggy dirty-blond hair, and kind gray eyes and the masculine craggy features of an outdoorsman. He was a landscape architect and all the time he spent outside had darkened his skin attractively. He also seemed to like her\u2014shorts, tank top, unstyled hair and all\u2014and that soothed her ego after her lunchtime conversation with Gabe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI sense a \u2018but\u2019 in there somewhere,\u201d he observed, watching her carefully.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d But what exactly? But she was in love with her best friend? But she was longing for a guy who was oblivious to her charms? Every thought that popped into her mind seemed stupid and irrational. She was a fool. She wasn\u2019t blind to that truth but she still couldn\u2019t help . . . hoping. She sighed quietly. \u201cBut I\u2019m kind of in a really weird place right now.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to think that over before nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t pressure you but I\u2019d like to know if you\u2019d be open to the idea of drinks some time in the future once you manage to find your way out of that weird place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said with a relieved smile. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my card.\u201d His hand brushed against hers when he handed the slip of paper over and Bobbi was disappointed when she felt nothing close to what she felt when Gabe\u2019s skin accidentally touched hers. She really was a lost cause.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, running her fingers over the raised lettering on the no-frills business card. She really didn\u2019t know what else to say to him and he seemed to sense it and ended his visit soon after that.</p><p>\u201cI really hope to see you again soon,\u201d he said as she walked him to his car and smiled somewhat uncomfortably. Bobbi had been out of the dating game for more than a year, choosing to focus on her business instead, and even before that she had only dated sporadically because most of the guys she knew were the buddies she had grown up with. The few men who had shown a romantic interest in her had always been on the losing end of an inevitable comparison with Gabe.</p><p>So she stood in the parking lot and watched another perfectly fine man drive out of her life and felt like an idiot for yet again closing herself off to other possibilities. It was a cycle she couldn\u2019t seem to break.</p> <p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d Craig teased softly after Bobbi had changed back into her overalls and joined them on the floor again. \u201cLeaving with one guy and coming back with another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe\u2019s not a \u2018guy\u2019 he\u2019s just . . . Gabe,\u201d she muttered, keeping here eyes down and Craig snorted.</p><p>\u201cSure he is.\u201d That sarcastic rejoinder had her head snapping up to meet his regard in alarm.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d she asked, her face hot with embarrassment. Craig darted a quick glance around the room to ensure that Sean and Pieter weren\u2019t listening to their conversation, but both of the other guys were focused on their own tasks.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d the older man said seriously. \u201cYou like him. I have two teenaged daughters and you\u2019re about as transparent as they are when it comes to affairs of the heart.\u201d How humiliating to be compared to adolescent girls.</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d she said beneath her breath. \u201cThis is getting ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to embarrass you, boss. I just liked that you came back with the other guy. Time for you to stop mooning over that Gabe with his fancy suits and shiny shoes. This new guy looks like he knows how to get his hands dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the new guy,\u201d she corrected, wondering miserably why she was still talking about this with him. Craig was the last person on earth she would ever consult on matters of the heart. For his anniversary last year he had forgotten to make reservations at the fancy Italian restaurant his wife had been hinting at for weeks before the big day and had made it up to her by microwaving a pizza and serving it with boxed wine. Needless to say he had slept on the couch that night\u2014a fact that he had lamented over for days afterward. He still couldn\u2019t understand his wife\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d reaction when he had gone all out to serve it with paper napkins and a couple of scented candles. He\u2019d even used paper plates so that she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about washing up.</p><p>\u201cAnyway there\u2019s no old or current guy either, so let\u2019s just drop this ridiculous subject and get back to work.\u201d He shrugged and did as he was told. Bobbi watched him leave and was tempted to call Kyle and take him up on that drinks date.</p><p>Gabe was restless . . .</p><p>There was no other word to describe the way he felt. He couldn\u2019t settle down. The house just seemed empty and huge. It was the first time he\u2019d ever felt that way about his home. While he co-owned the house with Chase, his brother also owned an apartment in Camps Bay and often stayed there when he was in the country. Of course, he had a housecleaning staff, but none of them lived on the premises.</p><p>Gabe hadn\u2019t shared the house with anybody in years and he was usually content with the peace and quiet. Tonight though, his excess energy was driving him crazy. He had contacted a couple of the women in his so-called \u201cblack\u201d book (it was in fact just a folder on his phone) but in the end hadn\u2019t been able to summon up the energy or inclination to arrange a date with any of them. He had ended the calls with vague promises to contact them again \u201csometime\u201d and now found that he was unable to concentrate on anything.</p><p>He glanced at the clock\u2014it was just after eight\u2014and decided to head out to Manny\u2019s for a couple of drinks. A few of games of darts, entertaining company, harmless flirting . . . just what the doctor ordered.</p><p>So he was more than a little confused when he found himself ringing the Richmond doorbell less than fifteen minutes later. There was no answer at first so he depressed the button again and listened to the deep bingbong echo through the house. He was about to ring it for a third time when the door was jerked open by a frazzled looking Mike Richmond. The tall man glared at Gabe over the rims of his glasses for a few moments before stepping aside and allowing him in. He didn\u2019t say anything, merely led the way to the den. The room reeked of cigar smoke\u2014it was the only room where he was allowed to indulge in his habit\u2014and there was a movie paused on the big screen smart TV.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eyeing the older man once more, he saw that Mike was wearing a handsome smoking jacket\u2014a prank gift from Bobbi\u2014and a pair of comfortable slacks. He appeared to be having a relaxing evening in his man cave. Mike Richmond rarely relaxed, so Gabe felt a bit guilty for disturbing him.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, Gabriel?\u201d the older man asked, refilling a Waterford crystal whiskey glass and lifting the matching decanter questioningly. Gabe nodded and unbuttoned the top two buttons of his shirt. He usually changed into less-restrictive clothing after coming from the office but he was still wearing his crisp shirt and suit trousers\u2014at least he\u2019d lost the tie and jacket somewhere along the way.</p><p>He took the filled whiskey glass from Mike, unbuttoning his cuff at the same time and rolling the sleeve up to his elbow before switching the glass to the other hand and doing the same with the opposite cuff. Mike had dropped down into his easy chair again and was watching him with those astute amber eyes that rarely missed much. Gabe avoided his scrutiny and sat down opposite him, taking a sip of the Glenlivet and leaning back on the leather recliner with a slight sigh.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Mike prompted after a long silence, taking a puff from his cigar.</p> <p>\u201cCan I have one of those?\u201d Gabe asked, and Mike waved the blunt cigar at the table between their chairs to the mahogany humidor residing there.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself . . .\u201d</p><p>Gabe grunted a thanks and took his time picking one of the expensive Cubans. When he found one to his liking, he rolled it appreciatively between his thumb and index finger and took a deep whiff before reaching for the cutter and snipping off the end.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d Gabe asked around the cigar that he now had clenched between his teeth. He rarely lit the cigars and he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d indulge tonight either.</p><p>\u201cDie Hard,\u201d the older man answered.</p> <p>\u201cAah. One of the good ones.\u201d Gabe grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me what you\u2019re doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll keep,\u201d Gabe responded, picking up the remote control that was resting beside the humidor. \u201cI\u2019d rather watch John McClane kick butt.\u201d</p><p>It was another half an hour filled with witty one-liners and loud explosions before either of them spoke again.</p><p>\u201cBobbi not in?\u201d Gabe asked casually, blowing on the end of the cigar that he\u2019d lit ten minutes earlier. \u201cShe loves this movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her but Faye told me that she\u2019s gone out with some friends. About damned time, you ask me,\u201d Mike muttered, keeping his eyes on the screen.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean the girl seems to forget she\u2019s female half of the time. It will do her a world of good to spend time with other women. And your buddy\u2014De Lucci\u2019s\u2014wife is a damned fine lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s not out with that guy?\u201d</p><p>The older man\u2019s gaze sharpened.</p><p>\u201cWhat guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe met him at the pub this afternoon and left with him. I thought she might have gone out with him . . .\u201d And the thought had made him feel close to murderous. Mike continued to inspect him with those shrewd eyes. \u201cUh . . . anyway, do you know what time she\u2019ll be home?\u201d</p><p>Mike shrugged, shifting that uncomfortable stare to the television screen and wincing as he watched Bruce Willis drag his bare feet through broken glass.</p><p>\u201cWho knows? These things can go on for hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it safe for her to be out that late?\u201d That pulled Mike\u2019s attention from the on-screen action.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business how late she stays out. I\u2019m well aware that she\u2019d be living on her own by now if not for the fact that she opened her shop. I can\u2019t tell her what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not concerned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t drink and drive, she won\u2019t take risks\u2014she\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything could happen . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this really about, Gabriel?\u201d he asked astutely, and Gabe backed off immediately. How could he answer a question he didn\u2019t know the answer to?</p><p>\u201cNothing, I was just a bit concerned. You\u2019re a wealthy man, Mike. Have you even considered that Bobbi could be at risk because of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have. When my children were small I had security details on them, you know that. Now that they\u2019re adults, my sons take care of their own security and Bobbi is well aware of the dangers. You know my daughter . . . stubborn to her core, that girl. So I compromised\u2014I provide security at her shop but her personal life is just that. No big, bulky men trailing after her wherever she goes. Now do you mind? I\u2019d like to enjoy my movie without this constant chatter.\u201d</p><p>Gabe shut up but he was starting to feel restless again. How could Mike be so damned sanguine about Bobbi\u2019s safety and security? It wasn\u2019t anything Gabe had even considered until just now and he was suddenly petrified that Bobbi would be kidnapped at any moment. He had lost interest in the movie but kept his eyes pinned to the screen even while his mind raced. Why had he never considered the risks to Bobbi before now?</p><p>It was making him edgy.</p><p>He chewed the end of his cigar and glared at the screen without really seeing the action. As soon as he realized the credits were rolling, he glanced at his watch. Just after ten, too early for her to come home yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to watch next?\u201d he asked Mike, and the older man\u2019s brows leapt to his hairline. \u201cOne of the sequels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you were barely paying attention to the last movie, I doubt a second one could hold your interest. Do you want to tell me what the hell is going on in that head of yours now, Gabriel? Something at work?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going on . . .

I\u2019m sure you have friends closer to your own age to hang out with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought Bobbi would be around,\u201d he lied. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to watch a movie, why don\u2019t we play a game of billiards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel, I\u2019m a boring old fogie and I\u2019m headed to bed.

Set the alarm on your way out,\u201d The older man pushed himself to his feet and ambled to the door. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d</p><p>Gabe sighed as the door swung shut behind the man and got up to flip absently through the selection of disks beside the Blu-Ray player. Deciding to stick to another modern \u201cclassic,\u201d he inserted Con Air into the machine and halfheartedly sat back to watch. Ten minutes into the movie he picked up his phone.</p><p>Bobbi glanced down at her vibrating phone and did a double take when she saw who was calling. She ignored the call before refocusing her attention on Bronwyn, who was sitting in the center of their circle, and then blushing furiously when she caught sight of the object in the woman\u2019s hands.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, that thing\u2019s a monster!\u201d Alice squealed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got nothing on Bryce.\u201d Bronwyn waved the thing in her hand dismissively.</p><p>\u201cOr Sandro,\u201d Theresa added loyally.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Rick could give that thing a serious run for its money.\u201d Lisa giggled.</p><p>\u201cHmmm . . . now that I look at it from this angle it\u2019s defintely smaller than Pierre,\u201d Alice said with a barely suppressed smile. \u201cWhy are we doing this again? None of us really need these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anybody ever really need one that big?\u201d Bobbi asked, appalled. Bronwyn was hosting a sex-toy party, and all the goodies were samples from a well-known adult shop in the area. The other four women all swiveled their heads in Bobbi\u2019s direction, varying degrees of pity on their faces.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that answers your question, Alice. God, Bobbi, we need to find you a boyfriend!\u201d Lisa groaned.</p><p>\u201cWe-ell, I kind of met a guy today,\u201d she informed them smugly, and they all squealed, the gargantuan vibrator instantly forgotten. Bobbi really enjoyed these girly sessions with her friends. She had never really had much feminine influence in her life before meeting Theresa a couple of years before. All of her friends growing up had been male, and while Gabe\u2019s mother and Faye had done their utmost to steer her in a more feminine direction, Bobbi had been so determined to fit in with her all-male family that the two women had given up halfway through Bobbi\u2019s teens. It was only after meeting Theresa and the rest of the women that Bobbi had realized how very much she had missed out on in foregoing female friends for so many years.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re only telling us this now?\u201d Bronwyn groused.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t come up before now,\u201d she shrugged, deliberately casual. She winced when her words caused even more squealing. One of the things she would never get used to was how high-pitched other women could be. She really couldn\u2019t fathom why they screamed so much.</p><p>\u201cTell us everything,\u201d Lisa demanded, and everybody else nodded encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to tell . . . I was . . .\u201d Her phone buzzed again and she glanced at the display. Gabe, again . . . what was his problem?</p><p>\u201cIs that him now?\u201d Theresa asked, her voice\u2014like her personality\u2014gentler and less demanding than the other women.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s Gabe,\u201d she said with grimace, ignoring the call again.</p> <p>\u201cIs that wise?\u201d Theresa asked again. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s an emergency or something?\u201d</p><p>Bobbi sighed, conceding Theresa\u2019s point.</p><p>\u201cWell if he calls back she\u2019ll answer it, just in case,\u201d Alice said reasonably. \u201cSo tell us about this guy in the meantime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to tell.\u201d Bobbi smiled. \u201cJason introduced us and he asked me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Alice wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cIs he good looking?\u201d Lisa interjected.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do?\u201d That was from Bronwyn.</p><p>\u201cIs he nice?\u201d Trust Theresa to ask that question.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Kyle, he\u2019s good-looking; tall and blond . . . wonderful gray eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my type,\u201d Bron sighed. Her husband, Bryce, was tall and blond.</p><p>\u201cMine too,\u201d Lisa agreed; she was married to Bryce\u2019s equally blond brother.</p><p>\u201cLet her finish,\u201d Alice prompted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a landscape architect.\u201d They all swooned at that.</p><p>\u201cOutdoorsy,\u201d Alice sighed blissfully. \u201cI love them outdoorsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does rock climbing to relax,\u201d Bobbi continued, ignoring the interruption.</p><p>\u201cWell, Rick would probably love him,\u201d Lisa grumbled. Her husband was an adrenaline junkie who enjoyed any and all kinds of extreme sports. He had toned it a down a bit since the birth of their son the year before though.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very nice,\u201d Bobbi concluded.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . ?\u201d the ever-observant Theresa prompted. She might be quiet and sweet but she rarely missed anything.</p><p>\u201cNo buts . . . he\u2019s nice, interesting, handsome, intelligent. I like him.\u201d Now the rest of them were eying her skeptically as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m with Theresa,\u201d Bronwyn said. \u201cThere\u2019s a but in there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Her phone buzzed again and she shut her eyes for a brief second before lifting it to her ear.</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d Her voice was more abrupt than she\u2019d intended it to be.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d his deep voice sounded uncertain. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine . . . why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing . . .\u201d There was a long pause.

How do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with him earlier.\u201d His voice sounded weird.</p><p>\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll call him and tell him not to worry,\u201d she said, and there was another long silence before he spoke again.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t. He\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Gabe, you\u2019re not making any sense. Are you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . . I mean I had a few drinks but nothing . . .\u201d He sighed, the sound an exasperated huff, and broke off in midsentence. \u201cLook, I just wanted to know when you\u2019d be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? I could escort you home,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Gabe, you\u2019re being ridiculous. I\u2019m hanging up now.\u201d She disconnected the call before he had a chance to respond and switched the phone off.</p><p>\u201cAnd that,\u201d Theresa said, pointing at the phone, \u201cwould be the but we were discussing earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh he\u2019s a butt alright,\u201d Bobbi seethed, and Lisa grinned.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to talk about what happened the other night?\u201d Theresa asked and the rest of them nodded encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cI was drunk and I kissed Gabe,\u201d she said, and more than one pair of eyes widened; only Theresa looked unsurprised.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed me back at first and then he stopped. And later that night, he was in his room with his shirt off and I . . . touched him,\u201d she confessed, trying to keep her embarrassment at bay but failing.</p><p>\u201cTouched him? How? Where?\u201d Bronwyn questioned.</p><p>\u201cHis chest, he has a gorgeous chest.\u201d There was a chorus of agreeing hums from the other women. \u201cI touched him and he let me, before stopping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was this phone call about?\u201d Lisa asked, nodding toward the phone in Bobbi\u2019s hand.</p><p>Bobbi sighed and told them everything else that had happened over the weekend since The Kiss and leading up to the bizarre phone call. By the time she had finished they were all staring at her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cFirstly, Kyle Foster sounds adorable and if it weren\u2019t for the fact that you\u2019re head over heels in love with your idiotic friend, I would totally encourage you to tap that,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cAnd secondly, Gabe really is a butt but he sounds like a totally confused butt.\u201d The other women laughed but Lisa ignored them, keeping her focus on Bobbi\u2019s flushed face.</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I think he wants you and he has no idea how to deal with that,\u201d Theresa stated.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Bronwyn said.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Alice concurred and Lisa indicated her agreement with a thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his type,\u201d Bobbi said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t Sandro\u2019s type,\u201d Theresa pointed out.</p><p>\u201cPierre preferred tall, skinny, flawless models,\u201d the short, slightly plump, and scarred Alice said.</p><p>\u201cRick liked to date adrenaline junkies. A nerdy, bookshop owner was a far cry from his usual girlfriends,\u201d Lisa added.</p><p>\u201cTastes change and what men\u2014or women\u2014think they want, isn\u2019t necessarily the type of person they end up with,\u201d Bronwyn said.</p><p>Sage words that made perfect sense of course, but none of them had had a years-long friendship to lose with the men in question. Bobbi shook her head and pointed to the abandoned vibrator that lay off to the side.</p><p>\u201cWhat else can that thing do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t cuddle you afterward, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Alice said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cOr whisper Italian endearments in your ear.\u201d This from Theresa who had a dreamy gleam in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you guys are the worst! I give up.\u201d Bronwyn tossed the thing to the side just as her husband, Bryce, walked into the room. It landed at his feet and he looked down at it blankly. A flush crept up his face to the tips of his ears. His sharp ice-blue eyes flew up to meet his wife\u2019s, and she had both hands over her mouth either to stifle a laugh or a scream, Bobbi couldn\u2019t be sure which.</p><p>He said something in sign language that made Bronwyn go bright red, and the other women who could all understand sign language as well, laughed. Bobbi, who wasn\u2019t as adept as they were, felt lost.</p><p>Bryce\u2019s stern face melted into a grin, which made him go from scary to gorgeous in a split second.</p><p>\u201cAfter Massive Marvin, nothing you ladies do can surprise me anymore,\u201d he said in his carefully modulated voice, referring to a stripper they had all fawned over the previous year on another girls\u2019 night. Bronwyn groaned and covered her eyes, causing Bryce\u2019s grin to widen. \u201cAnyway, I just came to check when you were wrapping it up? I\u2019ve been getting frantic texts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSandro?\u201d Theresa asked with an eye roll, once Bryce\u2019s eyes were on her and the man shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly not. Gabe.\u201d Every eye in the room focused on Bobbi, who felt her blood pressure rising.</p><p>\u201cThat . . .\u201d Words failed her and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell it is getting late and we all have work in the morning,\u201d Theresa pointed out. \u201cAnd you have a long drive ahead of you, Bobbi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd since none of you are going to buy any of this stuff, we may as well end now,\u201d Bronwyn said.</p><p>\u201cHold on, I didn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t buy a pair of the . . .\u201d Lisa glared up at Bryce, who was reading her lips avidly. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and left the room with a wave. The group disbanded soon afterward and Bobbi was left to seethe on the drive home. The roads were fairly empty, which cut ten minutes off her drive. She nearly bypassed her own driveway to head over to Gabe\u2019s but common sense prevailed; she would confront him in the morning. She\u2019d had just about enough of him this weekend.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>She let herself into the house, annoyed to find that the alarm was off. She sighed at her father\u2019s carelessness. There were security guards all over the premises, and the property was surrounded by a large electrical fence, but he had to do his bit too. As she headed for the stairs, she heard the explosive noise of an action movie coming from the den and changed course, meaning to give her father a piece of her mind for his negligence.</p> <p>\u201cThe alarm won\u2019t just set its . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off when Gabe\u2019s tall figure rose from one of the large leather recliners.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d he stated unnecessarily. She didn\u2019t respond, and a quick glance around the room confirmed that her father wasn\u2019t present.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my dad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for you to come home. I was concerned about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have no right to be concerned about me.\u201d She tossed her bag onto one of the chairs and folded her arms across her chest, trying to appear in control despite the fact that her stomach was swarming with butterflies.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you and that Kyle guy talk about this afternoon?\u201d he asked, choosing to ignore her last statement, as he took a step toward her. She maintained her position, refusing to step back even though the distance between them now seemed too close for comfort.</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but he asked me out.\u201d Her voice was starting to sound shaky; he took another step toward her and Bobbi started to feel like prey.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going out with him,\u201d he murmured confidently, his third step bringing him to within an inch of her. She kept her gaze trained on his chest, refusing to meet his eyes, hating that he knew her so well.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure of that?\u201d She tried to sound strong but instead her voice emerged on an uncertain whisper, and he used his forefinger to angle her chin until she met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause you want me.\u201d</p><p>With just four words one of her deepest, darkest secrets was out in the open. It lay exposed and writhing like a wounded animal between them and Bobbi was absolutely helpless to deny it. She knew that the truth was there to see, on her face and in her eyes. He could hear it in her ragged breathing and feel it in her racing pulse when he reached down to cup her fragile neck in the palm of his hands. He used his thumbs to stroke the underside of her jaw, sending shudders of pure sensation through her already trembling body.</p><p>\u201cGabe . . . ,\u201d she whispered, wetting her lips as her eyes fell to his mouth. She watched that mouth stretch into a beautiful smile and then form the most miraculous four words in the world.</p> <p>\u201cI want you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The sound was a gasp of wonder and disbelief. How was this possible?</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about that kiss,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cOr how your hands felt on me. How in the hell have I not noticed your gorgeous body before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered, and his eyes darkened in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking . . . ,\u201d she clarified, before going on tiptoes and plastering her mouth to his. His breath was half gasp and half groan as he leaned into the kiss and took control of it. His hands left her neck and buried themselves in her hair, tugging her head back so that he could deepen the kiss. She parted her lips and his tongue swept in, bringing with it a tidal wave of sensation. She savored every taste, every smell, every sensation . . . She didn\u2019t know how her hands had gotten under his shirt but they were on his hard chest, exploring the contours, the firmness, the dusting of hair, then around his waist up his strong back until her fingers were digging into his wide shoulders.</p><p>She was vaguely aware of him shifting her until her back was braced against the wall. He lifted his head, his eyes glazed, his cheeks flushed, and his mouth swollen.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he asked, and she nodded. He barely seemed to register the movement before his lips were on her neck, licking and sucking their way down to her collarbone and nuzzling aside the strap of her tank top.</p><p>\u201cThese damned tops of yours drive me crazy,\u201d he said thickly, bringing a hand up to assist with the task. Bobbi watched in a daze as he pushed the strap down her shoulder, around her bent elbow and then picked up her wrist to slip it completely off. He repeated the process with the other strap, until just the slight slope of her breasts held the garment up. He paused to inspect his handiwork for a brief moment before manacling both of her wrists in one of his hands and pinning them to the wall above her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cForget what I said this afternoon.\u201d His eyes ate her up, lingering hungrily on her breasts. \u201cNever wear a bra.\u201d</p><p>He brought his free hand up between their bodies and lightly traced the outer edge of one breast with his fingers. Bobbi\u2019s breath caught and held as she watched that large hand, fascinated by the stark contrast between his dark flesh and the whiteness of her top. One long finger brushed across the sensitive skin above the cotton and Bobbi\u2019s knees weakened.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whimpered, but he was concentrating so fiercely on the task at hand that he barely seemed to hear her. After forever his hand ever so softly closed over one of her breasts, and he squeezed gently, testing the weight and learning the shape of it. The barrier of cotton between his skin and hers added an element of erotic frustration that drove Bobbi wild. She pushed herself into his hand but he released his hold almost immediately. His hands switched tasks and the other breast received the same tormenting treatment.</p><p>\u201cGabe . . . more,\u201d she begged, and this time he listened, and his thumb flicked her excruciatingly sensitive peak\u2014the friction of thumb and fabric against the engorged tip made her arch against him, and he hissed when she pushed up against his straining erection.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he groaned, releasing her wrists and sweeping her toward the recliner that he had been occupying when she\u2019d first entered the room. He sat down and arranged her on top of him until she sat straddling his lap, her wet core very firmly wedged against his hardness\u2014the denim of her shorts and the fabric of his suit doing nothing to disguise either\u2019s arousal.</p><p>He dragged the tank down to her waist and then just stared at her naked breasts for a long while.</p><p>\u201cJesus, they\u2019re perfect,\u201d he said reverently, bringing his hands up to cup and explore, tease and torment. He plumped one up and brought it to his lips, laving the tortured crest gently with his hot tongue before sucking it roughly into his mouth. The combination of tender and tough felt amazing, and when he repeated the process with her other breast, she was helpless to prevent the inevitable from happening. She had wanted him for so long that she was primed for an explosion, having his mouth on her breasts while she instinctively rode the ridge of his erection was more than enough to send her spinning into the biggest orgasm of her life.</p><p>She was coming! The knowledge nearly propelled Gabe down the same blissful path but he somehow managed to keep himself under control. Barely.</p><p>She was so damned hot. Her body tensed, her breath hitched, and the already sexy back and forth movement of her hips became a deep, slow grind as she pushed herself against him, taking her pleasure like a woman who knew exactly what she wanted and how to get it. He tried to prolong it, sucking the hard bead of her nipple into his mouth and flicking it with his tongue to maximize her pleasure, while his free hand played with her other breast, stroking the swollen tip with his thumb.</p><p>She came quietly\u2014with a held breath, a series of soft moans, and then a long exhalation. She wasn\u2019t a screamer, his Bobbi, and damned if he didn\u2019t find that a huge turn-on too. He gave her nipple one last, regretful kiss before grudgingly releasing the firm globe of her breast. She slumped against him with her face buried in his neck.</p><p>He could feel her wet heat against his aching penis and it was all he could do to prevent himself from thrusting against her to achieve his own satisfaction. He wrapped his arms around her waist, allowing his hands to drape over her firm, curvy bum and held her trembling body against his.</p><p>He wanted her more than his next breath, but he wasn\u2019t going to allow this to go any further until they\u2019d established a few ground rules. If push came to shove, their friendship was too important to mess up, and if she felt that it wouldn\u2019t be able to survive a temporary affair then this \u201cinterlude\u201d would have to be the extent of it. He figured that it should be relatively easy to return to normal with Bobbi, whom he already cared for deeply, after they\u2019d gotten this craziness out of their systems. He just needed to know that she would be on board with the mutually beneficial arrangement he had in mind for them.</p><p>After a few painfully long moments, her breathing finally regulated and her limp, sated body started to grow tense as awareness returned to her. She brought her hands between their bodies and pushed against his chest until he loosened his grip around her waist enough for her to slide into a sitting position on his lap. He bit back a groan at the movement, still unbearably turned on and she grimaced apologetically.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured, tucking the damp hair of her fringe behind an ear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel okay.\u201d She deliberately slid herself up and then down against the hard column that she was straddling. \u201cFeels rather uncomfortable to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d His fingers dug into her flesh when she did another sinuous up and down shimmy. Where the hell did this seductive minx come from? He would never have taken Bobbi for such an accomplished tease.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to take care of it.\u201d She pouted, and he couldn\u2019t resist kissing that pout away. He kept the kiss short and sweet, not wanting to get carried away again and this time when she leaned back, he took the opportunity to\u2014quite regretfully\u2014drag her top back up over her pert breasts.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he promised. \u201cBut we have to talk, Bobbi.\u201d Her eyes reflected concern as she leaned back to study his face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said before, I want you . . . very much. It\u2019s weird having these . . . feelings for you but the attraction is so overpowering that getting you naked is pretty much all I\u2019ve been able to think about over the last two days. But there are other factors to consider here, sweetheart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bobbi understood that this was easier for her because she\u2019d felt this way about him for years but for him it was brand new. He probably felt as weird as she had that first time she had looked at Gabe and saw someone other than just a good friend. She would never forget that moment, on her birthday six years before. Gabe had been out of town on business. He had rushed to get back before midnight and had come straight to the Richmond house to present her with his gift\u2014a charm bracelet filled with tiny screwdrivers, cars, wrenches, nuts, and bolts. The trinkets must have taken him months to collect and it had been absolutely perfect. Wholly impractical since she couldn\u2019t wear it to work but perfect nonetheless.</p><p>She had looked up at the man standing in her doorway, so uncharacteristically disheveled, with messy hair, skewed tie, and wrinkled clothing, and had fallen hopelessly in love with him. From one breath to the next he had transitioned from platonic friend and trusted confidante to the single most important person in her life, and she had wanted him with a fierceness that still shocked her to this day.</p><p>They would have to take things slowly. The transition from being friends into a couple would be strange for them as well as their family and friends, who would be blindsided by the match and possibly uncomfortable with it too.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sort it out,\u201d she assured him, linking her hands with his and squeezing encouragingly. She smiled and kissed him, happy that she was free to do so. He tasted faintly of whiskey and cigars. Delicious.</p> <p>He returned the kiss, running his tongue over her lips and then sucking her lower lip gently into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d he groaned, the sound a masculine rumble that she felt against her chest. He dragged his mouth away from hers with obvious reluctance. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to suck on that juicy lip for a while now.\u201d He ran a rough thumb over her lip and she caught it in her mouth, nipping wickedly at the pad.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Bobbi,\u201d he growled. \u201cTime enough for this later. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She rolled her eyes. He clearly needed to get this out of his system. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is awkward because this isn\u2019t a scenario I ever imagined,\u201d he said. \u201cThe women I . . . the ones before, they knew the score. But you and I, that\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s complicated about it?\u201d she asked, a sinking sensation forming in the pit of her stomach. There was nothing complicated about this, they were attracted to each other and now that they had both acknowledged that attraction they were free to be together. Simple.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, good friends, when this ends\u2014when we eventually get this thing between us out of our systems\u2014what happens to our friendship? If there\u2019s any danger of losing you, Bobbi, it just wouldn\u2019t be worth it for a few encounters of meaningless sex.\u201d</p><p>Meaningless sex? That\u2019s all he wanted?</p><p>Bobbi almost laughed but she managed to bite back the impulse, knowing that the sound that emerged from her throat would be filled with disappointment.</p><p>Of course that\u2019s what he wanted! She was such a dolt.</p><p>Be careful what you wish for. That was how the saying went and it had never been truer than at this very moment. Bobbi had always wished for him to want her as much as she wanted him, to look at her with desire in his eyes and that wish had been more than granted. There was so much heat in his regard that she felt scorched by it and his zipper was fighting a losing battle against the hard physical proof of his lust. She had what she had hungered for day after day for years but she wanted more than that.</p> <p>All those years of wishing for him to want her, it had never occurred to her to ask that he love her too. Why would she wish for something she already had? Gabe loved her, he always had\u2014but he wasn\u2019t in love with her.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you suggest?\u201d she asked, her voice sounding hollow even to her own ears, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could come to an understanding. We keep this affair and our friendship separate . . .\u201d</p><p>What? She didn\u2019t understand what that meant. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be better if nobody else knew about it. If we kept it between us,\u201d he said, keeping his face averted. She was thankful for that because she didn\u2019t want him to see the pain in her eyes. \u201cThat way it would be easier for us to go back to being friends afterward. No unpleasant and intrusive questions from family and friends, you know?\u201d She nodded absently in response to the question, feeling a piece of her heart wither and die with every word he spoke.</p><p>How stupid of her to think that he would want a proper relationship with someone like her and that she could show the world how she felt about him. How foolish of her to fantasize about actually staking a claim on him and keeping all those annoying blondes at bay by right of possession.</p><p>Her fantasies were completely laughable in light of that fact that Gabe wanted to hide the attraction he felt for her in a dark and moldy place where it would be unable to flourish. Instead it would shrivel and eventually die and they would walk away and carry on as if it had never existed.</p><p>Their family and friends would remain completely oblivious while Gabe slept with her in secret as if what he felt for her was something to be ashamed.</p> <p>Gabe watched Bobbi closely but her expression revealed nothing\u2014it was as if a porcelain mask had slid over her face\u2014her features perfectly frozen. He was desperate for her to accept this agreement. He didn\u2019t know what he would do if she refused\u2014she simply couldn\u2019t refuse.</p><p>\u201cWe could have everything, Bobbi,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThe sex and our friendship. Nothing has to change; we just have to keep it under wraps. It\u2019s the only way to keep things normal. Once other people get involved, they\u2019ll start placing their own expectations on us. That wouldn\u2019t be fair on either of us. This is our business not theirs. It\u2019s the only way I can think of to protect you.\u201d And he really wanted to protect her. He didn\u2019t want her friends forcing their opinions on her, didn\u2019t want her brothers or his to make her feel like she was doing something wrong by being with him, and, yes, he was protecting himself too. God knew, her brothers, her father, and his mother\u2014everybody would be horrified. They would insist he \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and when he refused it could cause a rift between their families. He was on very shaky ground here and needed to tread carefully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo how would it work?\u201d she asked, and he exhaled shakily, relieved that she had broken her silence. \u201cWill we have some kind of secret password or handshake when we want to sleep together?\u201d</p><p>He laughed uncertainly, not sure of her mood. Her words had been sarcastic but her eyes looked . . . sad. He swallowed past the lump that had formed in his throat. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her, he was suggesting this arrangement so that he could avoid hurting her\u2014full disclosure was essential, that way she wouldn\u2019t form any unreasonable expectations.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d come round to my place as you normally would and we\u2019ll see where the mood takes us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we won\u2019t have to set up some kind of schedule then? Sex tonight, darts at the pub tomorrow . . . that kind of thing? I mean, I\u2019ve never had a friend with benefits before, I don\u2019t know how it works.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is new to me too, Bobbi.\u201d He wasn\u2019t deaf to the cynicism in her voice but was unsure how to respond to it.</p><p>She pushed herself up and off him, rearranging her clothing to the best of her ability. He felt the loss keenly and leaned forward to brace his elbows on his knees\u2014staring at her intently, not sure what to expect next. Her face still had a dewy, post-orgasmic glow to it and her lips were swollen from his earlier attentions. She was so damned sexy\u2014he wanted her back on his lap, wanted to feel her tightness close around him as he pushed himself into her, but he needed her to agree to his terms before he could have her and waiting for her answer was excruciating.</p><p>\u201cWell how does it usually work with your blondes?\u201d she asked pointedly, sitting down on the chair opposite his\u2014the one her father had occupied earlier.</p><p>He usually took his other female companions out to dinner, dancing . . . some kind of event. Followed by a night of sex at their homes\u2014which insured a quick and easy getaway afterward. Bobbi wouldn\u2019t be getting the fancy dinners; he acknowledged guiltily but then appeased himself with the reminder that it wasn\u2019t her scene anyway.</p><p>\u201cOur arrangement will be different,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes, of course . . .\u201d She snapped her fingers as if just remembering. \u201cWe won\u2019t be seen together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobbi,\u201d he chastised miserably, hating her unpredictable mood. She clearly wasn\u2019t receptive to his idea. \u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d</p><p>The question shut her up and she peered at him mutely before shrugging.</p><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s do this.\u201d She held her right hand over her chest and the left hand up as if she was about to swear an oath. \u201cI, Roberta Rebecca Richmond, hereby do solemnly swear to expect nothing more than sex from one Gabriel Andrew Braddock. I promise to not disclose details of our affair to any third parties, promise to not behave inappropriately toward him in public places and, once our affair has run its course, I promise to never speak of it again and to go back to being Gabriel Andrew Braddock\u2019s bestest buddy. So help me God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobbi, you\u2019re making it seem . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d she finished, her voice so icy it nearly froze him on the spot and he nodded. \u201cCynical? Clinical? Maybe because that\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen tell me what you want.\u201d He repeated his previous demand, not bothering to keep the exasperation out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cNothing more or less than you\u2019re willing to offer.\u201d She shrugged before sending him a seductive look that\u2014despite his tension\u2014immediately grabbed his attention.</p><p>She got up and walked to the door, and his eyes remained riveted on the deliberate swing of her tight behind. She threw him a look over her shoulder and combined it with a sultry smile.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gabe . . . I\u2019ll walk you home.\u201d</p><p>Bobbi didn\u2019t know what the hell she was doing. This was going to end in heartbreak and she knew it . . . but she didn\u2019t want to go through her entire life without being with him. She couldn\u2019t force him to love her the way she loved him so she would take whatever meager substitute he was offering her, and when it ended she would try damned hard to keep her end of the bargain and go back to being his friend. She felt weak and stupid and while her brain screamed at her not to be foolish, her heart urged her to accept his sordid little arrangement and be grateful for it.</p><p>In the end her heart had won the fierce battle and so here she was, holding his hand in hers as she dragged him across the lawn toward the fence between their homes. There was a security gate between the two properties that their parents had had installed when the Braddock and Richmond children had still been small\u2014it had been put there to stop the kids from creating shortcuts by climbing the trees that bordered their yards and jumping over the high fences, especially after Chase broke his arm. Once Bobbi had led Gabe through the gate and was safely out of view of her house and numerous security guards, Gabe stopped moving. Bobbi glanced back impatiently but all she could see in the darkness were the whites of his eyes before he tugged on her hand and dragged her into his arms.</p><p>She was enveloped in his scent, by his warmth, and then before she could brace herself, completely devoured by his hungry mouth. She moaned and gave herself over to him. There was no finesse to the kiss, it was a meeting of lips, tongue, and teeth, and it made Bobbi feel wanton, wild, and starved for more.</p><p>\u201cGod, sweetheart, you drive me crazy.\u201d His voice sounded feral in the dark as he forced the words out between gasps. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p> <p>This time he led the way as he tugged her to his house, up the porch steps, and into the foyer. His hands were all over her body as he led her into one of the rooms closest to the front entrance. A quick glance around confirmed that they were in his study and she had no time for any other observation before he sat her down on a large sofa and knelt between her legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGabe, I think . . .\u201d</p><p>He held a finger up to her lips.</p><p>\u201cSsh, sweetheart, no more talk,\u201d he begged gently. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to do all evening.\u201d Bobbi grabbed his finger between her lips and sucked the tip hungrily, watching his face tighten as he moaned shakily. It was amazing how such a simple gesture was able to render a strong man like Gabe as weak as a kitten.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she asked huskily, after running her tongue up and down the length of his index finger before releasing his hand to fall limply to his side. \u201cWhat could that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Bobbi.\u201d He laughed unsteadily. His trembling hands went to the hem of her top and dragged it up and off before she even had time to blink, and then he sat back on his heels and just studied the skin that lay bared to his gaze. She fought the urge to cover her breasts, battling her instinctive shyness and kept her arms down, enjoying the appreciative look in his eyes as they studied the slight curves of her body.</p><p>\u201cI love these.\u201d She drew in a sharp breath as he bent over to plant a reverent kiss on one pointed tip and then the other. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely perfect . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall,\u201d she lamented, and he glared up at her.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he maintained before he lavished each tip with even more attention until she fell back onto the sofa and writhed beneath him, lost in the sensation of his mouth and hands tormenting the overly sensitive peaks. After what seemed like hours, he raised his head to study the wet, rosy crests in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d Bobbi could barely get the two words out but he understood her well enough and his head jerked up, while his eyes narrowed in anticipation. She sat up and tugged his shirttails from his trousers before burrowing her questing hands beneath the expensive fabric to find the velvety warmth beneath. She unbuttoned his shirt leisurely, kissing each wedge of skin as it was revealed, marveling at how hard, muscled flesh could be so satiny to the touch. When she\u2019d unfastened the last button, she parted the two sides and scrutinized his muscular chest in purely feminine appreciation.</p><p>He was gorgeous: all bronzed flesh, hard muscles, and downy cinnamon hair. Her slightly work-roughened hands entangled themselves in the sprinkling of hair on his chest before making their fluttering way to his flat male nipples. When she found the rigid nubs, she thumbed them experimentally and smiled in delight when Gabe sucked in a harsh breath.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d she asked huskily, glancing up to meet his burning eyes. No answer was required . . . he seemed to have relished it! \u201cGreat, then you\u2019re probably going to love this!\u201d She dipped her head and drew one of the stiff crests deeply into her mouth. Gabe made a strangled sound and jerked violently before grabbing her head between his hands and trying to drag her away from her task. Bobbi ignored him and continued to lick and suck seductively, relishing the musky taste of him.</p><p>She shifted her attention to the other peak and nipped at it sharply, before licking away the sting. Gabe\u2019s breath was coming in harsh pants and when he once again tried to drag her away, she complied and latched onto his mouth almost aggressively, relishing this new role of seductress. Gabe\u2019s helpless groan was muffled against her mouth and he allowed her to take the initiative, his tongue playing court to hers.</p><p>Eventually he began to dominate their love play, as she bowed to his experience. His fingers initially fumbled with the button fly of her shorts before he found a rhythm and seductively undid one after the other. He tugged at the waist once he had them all unfastened and Bobbi raised her hips allowing him to wrestle off the tight scrap of material. After he had tossed the shorts aside he leaned back to admire what he\u2019d revealed. He shook his head in wonder as his scrutinizing look traveled down her slender torso to her concave stomach, her tiny waist, and the delicate flare of her hips.</p><p>\u201cDear God, Bobbi, you\u2019re . . . ravishing.\u201d He breathed.</p><p>Damn him, she adored him. She wished she didn\u2019t but it was hard not to when he was staring at her with such reverence in his eyes.</p><p>Gabe smiled at the sight of the plain white cotton bikini panties she was wearing. Bobbi probably had nothing that could be labeled lingerie in her underwear drawer. His Bobbi was a cotton-panties girl through and through. Lingerie was not for the practical mechanic, but he figured she would look pretty damned sexy in silk and lace too and vowed there and then to buy her some lingerie. It would definitely drive him wild to see her in overalls and fantasize about what sexy confections she might be wearing beneath them!</p><p>The very thought now had him so revved up that it was difficult not to rip the aforementioned panties off and bury himself so completely within her that he would be lost forever. He was irresistibly drawn back to her breasts, bending to tug one of her raspberry pink tips into his mouth. She gasped and arched back, offering herself up to him. He maneuvered her until she was lying down on the sofa and he was on top of her with his hips cradled between the welcoming warmth of her thighs. Not once during the move had he lifted his head from her tormented breast and she was groaning and pleading with him to let up on his exquisite torture. He eventually did, but only to create havoc with the other, neglected nipple.</p><p>Despite her pleas for him to stop tormenting her, Bobbi was contradictorily arching her back and thrusting her chest closer to his mouth. He laughed triumphantly and claimed her lips for yet another hungry kiss. The kiss was torrid enough to leave her limp and breathless, and she watched languidly as he got up to divest himself of his already unbuttoned shirt, then his shoes, and lastly his trousers and socks. Soon he wore only his black briefs, which did absolutely nothing to conceal his fierce erection from her. Her hungry eyes were riveted to the straining bulge between his thickly muscled thighs, and she was trembling uncontrollably when he settled back down between her spread legs. He smiled down at her before, without a word, lifting one of her legs and resting the slender ankle on his broad shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGabe . . . what are you doing?\u201d she asked in confusion, but he merely smiled down at her, before kissing her inner ankle. His warm, large hands circled the ankle, then traveled slowly down the length of her leg purposely allowing the back of his hand to lightly brush against the warm wetness between her legs, his knuckles grazing the moist material of her panties, before his hand stroked its way sensuously back up to her ankle. He then repeated the whole agonizing process with her other leg, this time allowing his hand to linger longer at her sensitive core.</p><p>He grinned down at her and he should have looked ridiculous with his face framed by her feet but instead he looked absolutely wicked and oh-so-sexy. He winked mischievously before hooking his thumbs in the sides of her panties and sliding them up over her hips with tormenting slowness. Bobbi was arching her hips impatiently and he bent to kiss her lips gently.</p><p>\u201cPatience, my sweet,\u201d he whispered against her mouth. \u201cThis is going to be so good. More than merely good . . . It\u2019s going to be exquisite.\u201d He\u2019d completely removed her panties by now and had tossed them over his shoulder, uncaring of where they landed. He scrutinized her naked flesh raptly. A gentle hand found its way to her abdomen and down . . . to where the softest sprinkling of curls lay in wait of his touch. His long, blunt fingers entangled in the grasping curls and then moved down even farther, to where there were no curls and only a warm moistness that ached for his touch.</p><p>Bobbi cried out when his fingers found her sensitive clit and she went unbearably tense when he stroked her there. God, it was divine. She sobbed and tried to dislodge the tormenting touch.</p><p>\u201cNo, Gabe. It\u2019s too much . . . ,\u201d she pleaded, but he ignored her and that same finger slipped deftly inside of her.</p><p>\u201cOh Christ.\u201d Gabe was groaning too now and his chest was heaving uncontrollably as he fought to breathe. \u201cYou\u2019re so hot and tight, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Bobbi\u2019s hands were doing some exploring of their own; she was learning his hard curves and angles and kissing every inch of flesh accessible to her. She pushed impatiently at his briefs\u2014needing to have him completely naked and open to her touch. Understanding what she wanted, he pushed the briefs down his hips and kicked them off.</p><p>Bobbi\u2019s eyes widened in awed disbelief at the sight of him. The last time she had seen Gabe in the buff had been on a skinny-dipping adventure when he was ten and she five and he had certainly grown a lot since then. The childhood memory reminded her of exactly whom it was she found herself naked with and she flushed unexpectedly, going crimson with sudden embarrassment. She may have wanted him for years but this was still Gabe and she was seeing him naked. What should have felt awkward felt comfortable and right and the embarrassment was fleeting.</p><p>Her eyes were focused on his erect penis and she shook her head in amazement. Yes, this was Gabe, and God, he was gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cOh Gabe,\u201d she breathed in awe, and he grinned, understanding and appreciating her tone.</p><p>\u201cOh Bobbi,\u201d he mimicked in the exact same tone of voice. His hand fumbled around on the floor beside the sofa before finding his discarded trousers and removing a condom from one of the pockets.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready, right?\u201d he asked, his voice tight with barely restrained urgency, and she smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how ready I am,\u201d she assured him, and he grinned in relief, before tearing the packet with his teeth. He efficiently donned the condom, the back of his hand brushing against her as he did so, and she bit back another cry at her almost unbearable sensitivity down there.</p><p>Without any hesitation at all, Gabe kissed her deeply and entered her with one long, sure thrust. Bobbi stiffened but when there was no further discomfort, she relaxed and began to follow his lead.</p><p>After that initial fast and economical thrust, Gabe began to move almost leisurely. He was hunched over her slender form and moaned whenever she lifted her hips to meet his gentle strokes. His tongue parodied the lazy movements of his body and Bobbi found herself rocking slowly to the edge of an insidiously looming pit. Her fingers dug into his back and both of them were soon sobbing each other\u2019s names. Their pace quickened abruptly and they soon began to fly out of control. They were melded together in more ways than the most basic, their chests were glued together, their lips were locked, and their arms and legs were inextricably entangled.</p><p>\u201cGabe,\u201d Bobbi whispered his name on a note of pleasure so intense, it almost resembled pain. It took her breath away and she shuddered quietly around him as she was catapulted headfirst into a frighteningly deep black abyss, where she felt herself free-falling to an end that she could not see. Gabe\u2019s thrusts were so fast now, one could barely finish before the other started, his face was contorted and dripping with sweat.</p><p>\u201cBobbi . . . ,\u201d he grunted. \u201cGod!\u201d He came with one final, massive thrust. He went completely boneless in her arms and was waiting to catch her when she floated to the bottom of the abyss.</p><p>He withdrew his still throbbing penis from her with a wince, while she sucked in a shocked gasp at his abrupt departure from her body. He immediately dispensed with their protection and gathered her into his arms.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>They were silent for a very long time afterward. The sweat dried and cooled on their bodies, and Bobbi began to shiver despite the warmth of the evening. Gabe tightened his arms around her and turned her so that she was sandwiched between the back of the huge, lavishly upholstered sofa and his hard body. She immediately felt safe and warm and buried her face against his chest with a contented sigh.</p><p>She dozed off but woke with a start when Gabe adjusted his position carefully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMy arm fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She felt inexplicably shy now as she tried to sit up. He reluctantly released her and allowed her to disentangle herself from his arms and legs. She kept her eyes averted as she got up and began hunting for her clothes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, his voice rough. He also got up and ran a hand through his hair, dishevelling it thoroughly in the process. He looked way too appealing and Bobbi found that she couldn\u2019t look at him for too long without wanting to run back into his arms again.</p><p>\u201cFine . . .\u201d She found her shorts but couldn\u2019t find her panties or her top. Wanting only to get herself covered as quickly as possible, she tugged on the shorts and grimaced at the uncomfortable sensation of rough denim against her overly sensitive flesh. She found his shirt instead of her top and, deciding that it would do, dragged it on and buttoned it up only high enough to cover her breasts, leaving a deep V of exposed flesh from neck to cleavage. She didn\u2019t know how sexy she looked with her messy hair and the masculine shirt that was so long on her it completely hid the shorts from view.</p> <p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked stiltedly, and she shook her head. God this felt so uncomfortable suddenly. How did one behave after something like that? What did one say to your secret lover slash best friend after you\u2019d had amazing sex for the first time? Bobbi was at a complete loss.</p><p>\u201cNo. I have an early start tomorrow morning,\u201d she said, searching for her shoes and finding them beneath his discarded trousers. She slipped on the trainers without socks and blasted him with a bright, insincere smile. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave yet,\u201d he protested. \u201cHave a snack . . . or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry and I\u2019m rather tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you regret what happened?\u201d he asked, a surprising amount of uncertainty in his voice. She sighed and made direct eye contact for the first time since getting dressed.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t,\u201d she said truthfully. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what happens next. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he confessed. \u201cBut we could find out together.\u201d She smiled at him before closing the distance between them until she stood directly in front of him. She cupped his jaw with her hands and tugged his head down, going up on her toes to meet him halfway. The kiss she gave him was sweet and filled with aching promise, but she moved away before he could deepen it. His eyes remained shut for a heartbeat longer before he sighed and looked at her regretfully.</p><p>\u201cThat felt like a good-bye kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, a good-night kiss,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he denied. \u201cYou could stay the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe, that\u2019s not how we keep this thing between us secret,\u201d she said with an incredulous laugh. \u201cThe first person who spots me making my way home in the morning would know exactly what we\u2019d been doing all night.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes were filled with mute frustration, and she watched the muscles in his tight jaw bunch as he bit back whatever he\u2019d been about to say in response to her words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d she assured before turning away and heading for the door. She just needed to keep it together long enough to get out of this house. She refused to allow him to see how much he had hurt her, and if she stayed much longer he would surely notice her eyes shining with the tears that she absolutely refused to shed. She wasn\u2019t a crier. Crying never solved anything. He let her leave without any further resistance, and Bobbi fled. Only when she was halfway across her own yard did she succumb to an extreme bout of trembling as the shock finally crept in.</p><p>Gabe felt like punching something. This felt so . . . wrong. It shouldn\u2019t have been so difficult to let her leave. But he\u2019d had the best sex of his life tonight and he wasn\u2019t done with her yet. Not by a long shot.</p><p>And yet . . . afterward, the distance between them had left him feeling sick to his stomach. He wanted to have sex with her again, but he could do without the extra dose of scorching guilt that came after he came, so to speak. He felt like he was cheating on someone and he didn\u2019t understand why.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been thinking clearly when he had suggested that she stay the night, but from the moment the words had emerged he\u2019d wanted it desperately. He had wanted to make love with her again, fall asleep next to her, and wake up with her in his arms. It had been all he could think of and when she had\u2014quite justifiably\u2014shot him down, the blow had been pretty damned devastating.</p><p>Sleeping with her would complicate things. It was better to keep the sex impersonal but even as he nodded in response to the thought, he felt that hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach again.</p><p>But this was still new to them\u2014they\u2019d get used to the arrangement, more comfortable with it. They just needed time to adjust that was all. The words provided scant comfort but they were all he had.</p><p>Work the next day wasn\u2019t quite the distraction Gabe had hoped it would be. He glared at his computer screen without really seeing the information on display.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Braddock.\u201d His executive assistant\u2019s face popped up on the screen, providing a welcome diversion. \u201cI have Mr. Richmond on the line for you.\u201d</p><p>Gabe scowled; just what he needed. How the hell was he supposed to look the man in the eye after all the raunchy things he had done with his daughter the previous night?</p><p>\u201cPut him through. Voice only.\u201d He lifted the telephone\u2019s handset to his ear.</p><p>\u201cMike, good morning.\u201d He tried to keep his tone light but sounded stilted to his own ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMorning, Gabe. Glad you decided to go the old-fashioned route with this call. I hate those face-to-face calls, you know? Having my every expression analyzed can be a bit disconcerting,\u201d the older man greeted jovially.</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t want people to see the gleam in your eyes when you go in for the kill,\u201d Gabe scoffed, and the other man laughed appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to know if everything was still on course for next month.\u201d</p><p>Gabe rolled his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Violet or Stephanie?\u201d he asked, referring to their assistants.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re in charge of the event, and I want to be sure that you\u2019re keeping an eye on those two\u2014no need for the whole thing to get too frou-frou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing; it\u2019s not their first major event,\u201d Gabe pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ll be handing my company over to someone else.\u201d Mike Richmond would officially hand over the reigns to Gabe at the company\u2019s annual Valentine\u2019s Day Ball. Gabe knew that the older man felt ambivalent about retiring, even though his eldest son, Edward\u2014who also happened to be his physician\u2014insisted on it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure Stephanie reminds Violet to keep it elegant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo hearts and flowers everywhere,\u201d Mike stipulated.</p><p>\u201cNot a single one,\u201d Gabe assured.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I suppose we can\u2019t have a party without some flowers,\u201d Mike conceded. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have to overdo it. It\u2019s not a funeral. I\u2019m not dying, just retiring.\u201d Gabe grinned, happy that the cantankerous old man couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight then. Anything else I need to know?\u201d Gabe had a moment of blind panic and cold sweat as he imagined Mike Richmond looking out of his bedroom window last night and seeing Bobbi leading Gabe across the lawn toward the fence. Or worse, had he come back down to the den last night? Gabe and Bobbi had been so wrapped up in each other they wouldn\u2019t have noticed a herd of stampeding elephants passing through the room. Logic reasserted itself as he figured that this conversation wouldn\u2019t be quite so amicable if Mike Richmond had seen them last night.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d the older man prompted, and Gabe cleared his throat.</p> <p>\u201cNothing. Everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, I have yet another meeting with Clyde and his crew of bloodsuckers in a couple of minutes.\u201d Clyde was Mike\u2019s second son, a corporate attorney whose firm handled all their contracts. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you later.\u201d He disconnected the call abruptly.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Gabe muttered, and replaced the handset carefully. He glanced at his desktop monitor\u2014the spreadsheet was still there, looking even more boring than before. A quick look at the clock told him that it was barely after ten. He wondered what Bobbi was doing. How did she feel after last night?</p><p>He might not have wanted things to change, but there had been a fundamental shift in their relationship last night and he should have known it would happen. He had been an idiot to expect things to remain the same. There was an emotional element that he hadn\u2019t considered and he was concerned about her. It wasn\u2019t something that he had ever felt for any of his former lovers\u2014he had never wondered if they were okay physically, mentally, and emotionally. They had known the stakes and had remained detached, but this was Bobbi, and despite everything he had said last night, separating emotion from sex when it came to someone he knew so well wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>He glanced at the clock again: barely two minutes had passed since he\u2019d last checked the time. Was it too early to call her? Or perhaps he should have called earlier? Maybe he looked like an insensitive jerk for not contacting her first thing this morning? He didn\u2019t know what to do and that was a weird sensation for him. He was always so sure of what to do. Maybe he should go to the shop and take her out to brunch?</p><p>He cracked his knuckles as he considered his options. He had to call her, not knowing what was going on in her head was driving him crazy. He reached for his cell and speed-dialed her number. It rang for ages before going to voice mail. He peered at the phone\u2019s screen contemplatively before trying again.</p><p>This time it went straight to voice mail.</p><p>Was she avoiding his calls? Why would she do that? Was she angry? Sad? Hurt? The possibilities were endless, and he decided to find out for himself. He grabbed his jacket and headed out of the office.</p> <p>\u201cPostpone my afternoon appointments, Stephanie,\u201d he told his assistant on his way out.</p><p>\u201cOh, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t call my cell, I\u2019ll be busy.\u201d He interrupted what he knew would be a protest. \u201cAnd remind Violet to keep things classy at that damned Valentine\u2019s Day Ball. She knows what the Old Man likes.\u201d The last was yelled over his shoulder as he exited her office and all but ran to the elevator before she could stop him.</p><p>He felt strangely exhilarated as he climbed into his car and headed for Bobbi\u2019s shop. He told himself that it was because he was skiving off work, but a larger part of him admitted that he was excited about seeing Bobbi again.</p><p>Bobbi felt a tad out of sorts. Her morning had gone from bad to worse. She had slept through her alarm and then rushed into the shop forty minutes late. Pieter was off with measles of all things, leaving her shorthanded. The parts that she had ordered for the Corvette had arrived but they were all wrong and she had been on the phone for half an hour trying to reach the supplier to sort the mess out. Added to all that her entire body was buzzing with sensation after her encounter with Gabe last night. Her nipples were so sensitive that even the brush of cotton against them was uncomfortable, her muscles ached, and her hips and inner thighs were bruised from the friction of his hips and the clutch of his fingers. But none of those things compared to the extreme discomfort she felt . . . down there. She had had one really terrible sexual encounter before Gabe\u2014during her first year of university\u2014and the miserable experience hadn\u2019t really prepared her for the full effect of a man as large as Gabe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All those jokes women made about not being able to \u201cwalk right\u201d after great sex? Bobbi totally got it now.</p><p>But that was really no big deal in light of how emotionally devastated she felt after Gabe\u2019s demeaning stipulations on how they conduct this new aspect of their relationship. Her decision to have sex with him despite that had seemed like a brave step forward last night but now seemed absurdly na\u00efve.</p><p>If she felt this awful about herself after just one night, how much worse would it get if they continued to have sex on a regular basis? She didn\u2019t know if she had the stomach for this. Gabe had made her feel small and cheap. No that wasn\u2019t fair . . . she had allowed Gabe to make her feel small and cheap. She bore half of the blame for this dreadful situation and she knew that.</p><p>She exhaled impatiently as she listened to the ridiculous \u201chold\u201d music while she waited for the supplier to come onto the line.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ignoring my calls, sweetheart?\u201d The dark voice coming from the doorway of her tiny office nearly shocked her into dropping the receiver, and she fumbled frantically to keep it from falling.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYou nearly scared me half to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, sounding not at all remorseful. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to sneak up on you.\u201d</p><p>She watched him warily as he stepped into the tiny glass booth and shut the door behind him. He dominated the tiny space and she immediately felt boxed in and claustrophobic.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d she snarled. \u201cI\u2019m working.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you answered my calls?\u201d he asked, using his pristine white handkerchief to wipe down the chair opposite hers before seating himself and raising his eyes to hers expectantly. She merely stared back at him with a raised eyebrow and he smiled at her. The sincerity on his face nearly undid her, and she had to bite her lip to keep from smiling back at him.</p><p>He glanced down at his handkerchief and his nose wrinkled fastidiously when he saw that it was covered in a layer of gray dust and grime from the chair. Nonetheless he folded it meticulously before dropping it into one of his jacket pockets. He was a classic fish out of water in this environment, and it saddened her to realize exactly how far removed his world was from hers.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he prompted, and she looked at him blankly, forcing him to elaborate. \u201cMy phone calls? You\u2019ve been ignoring them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t, the line\u2019s just been busy all morning.\u201d She held up the receiver pointedly and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling your cell,\u201d he told her, and her brow furrowed as she patted herself down with one hand, before glancing around her cluttered desk.</p><p>\u201cI must have forgotten it at home,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been having a bit of a Monday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot hungry.\u201d She shrugged. The music in her ear paused and she perked up, only to slump back down when it resumed again. \u201cOh my God, maybe they figure if they keep me on hold long enough I\u2019ll simply give up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to have brunch with me?\u201d he asked, and she glared at him irritably.</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018I\u2019m working\u2019 did you not understand?\u201d she asked sarcastically. \u201cAnd why aren\u2019t you at work for that matter? Does my dad know that you\u2019re slacking off like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am one of the bosses you know?\u201d he pointed out levelly. \u201cI can take some personal time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, color me impressed,\u201d she rejoined caustically, and he grinned at her sarcasm. One thing about Gabe, he always seemed to enjoy her sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see if you were okay,\u201d he said, the grin fading. \u201cYou know? After last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You want to have this conversation now? Here?\u201d she asked in disbelief, gesturing expansively toward the glass walls and the phone in her hand.</p> <p>\u201cNo time like the present,\u201d he stated, and she sighed long-sufferingly.</p><p>Gabe watched her struggle with whatever she wanted to say to him and waited with baited breath for her response. She looked gorgeous this morning, her skin glowed with good health and vitality and her lips were still swollen from his kisses. God, she was so damned exquisite he could spend hours just watching her. He was resentful of every second he had wasted in the past\u2014all those moments when he had simply not seen her. Had he been completely blind?</p><p>\u201cLook Gabe, I . . . ,\u201d she began seriously, only to tilt her head toward the telephone receiver that she held pressed against her ear. \u201cHello? This is Roberta Richmond from Richmond\u2019s Auto Repair Shop. You sent me the wrong shipment and I . . . no, wait! Don\u2019t put me on hold again. Don\u2019t put . . . damn it.\u201d The last two words emerged in a frustrated whisper and her shoulders slumped in despair. Her eyes darted back up to meet his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cNo need to worry about me. We had some fun and today it\u2019s business as usual right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he concurred, feeling nauseated at the thought of returning to \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d It felt dishonest.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d she asked angrily, keeping her voice low. \u201cThis behavior is not the way we usually operate. You\u2019ve never come to my shop on a Monday morning before to ask me if I\u2019m okay. We don\u2019t do brunch. Ever. I don\u2019t go to your office and you don\u2019t come to mine. At least you didn\u2019t before last week. That\u2019s not the way our friendship operates. So what the hell is going on? What do you want from me?\u201d She had a point. Gabe was the one who had insisted that they behave normally, yet here he was, acting completely out of character. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut if you had answered my calls, there wouldn\u2019t have been any need for me to come over here to check if you were okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gabe,\u201d she derided. \u201cLast week you would have tried to reach me, failed, and thought nothing of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, last week was before I\u2019d had you pinned down and writhing beneath me in desire. Last week was before I\u2019d had my tongue in your mouth, your breasts in my hands, and your breathless voice in my ear begging me for more.\u201d His voice rose with every word until he was practically shouting and she frantically shushed him.</p><p>\u201cFine, okay.\u201d She held up a placating hand. \u201cBut after today I\u2019d appreciate it if you stopped contradicting yourself. It\u2019s confusing the hell out of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoted,\u201d he murmured, feeling confused himself. He leaned forward, trying to catch her eye again. She was downright cagey this morning and still hadn\u2019t told him if she was okay or not. Despite that magnificent glow she had about her, she still looked somewhat strained around the eyes and he wondered if she had managed to get any sleep the night before. He certainly hadn\u2019t\u2014he had been turned on and miserable because she had left him before he had had his fill of her.</p><p>\u201cWill you come over tonight?\u201d he asked softly, but she didn\u2019t seem to hear him, keeping her eyes glued to the order form on her desk and her attention focused on the telephone receiver clamped to her ear. Gabe wasn\u2019t used to being ignored by women, and he now discovered that he didn\u2019t like it at all. But he swallowed down his anger as he reminded himself that Bobbi wasn\u2019t just any woman and that she habitually ignored him when it suited her. She was just being . . . Bobbi. He had wanted things to remain the same between them but hadn\u2019t counted on the status quo being frustrating as hell.</p><p>\u201cBobbi?\u201d he prompted, and she lifted her eyes to his. They were so damned pretty they literally took his breath away and he struggled to form the words for a brief moment. \u201cWill you come over tonight?\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her lower lip, plumping it up invitingly, and he coughed to cover up a groan. God, this was torturous\u2014he wanted to kiss her so badly he had to curl his hands into fists to prevent himself from dragging her across the damned desk and into his lap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she responded at last and he nearly swore in frustration. She was clearly trying to drive him insane. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>He had to content himself with that vague response and pushed out of the chair.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you change your mind about getting something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said, with a brief shake of her head. He was about to respond to that when her body language changed and she looked away from him again. Effectively dismissing him. \u201cYes? I\u2019m Roberta Richmond from Richmond\u2019s Auto Repair Shop and I received the wrong goods . . .\u201d</p><p>He gave her one last glance but it was as if she had forgotten he was there. Feeling rather despondent, Gabe left.</p><p>Bobbi watched as he gracefully made his way back out of the shop, exchanging a few laughing comments with Craig as he left. She listened to the dial tone in her ear\u2014her call had been dropped about three minutes ago but she had clung to the handset like it was a shield, knowing that if she put it down she would have to give him her undivided attention and she hadn\u2019t been quite ready for that. She replaced the handset carefully. She would have to call them back but she didn\u2019t have the energy just yet.</p><p>Suddenly the weight of problems the day had dumped onto her shoulders felt unbearably heavy and she slumped in her chair, wanting to do nothing more than bury her face in her hands and weep.</p> <p>The day had seemed interminable; after several more frustrating phone calls, Bobbi had finally managed to sort out the shipment error but the setback had cost her valuable time. Pieter\u2019s measles would put him out of commission for at least a week and the loss of manpower would result in a forfeiture of revenue that she really couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>The only good thing about the seemingly insurmountable heap of complications was that it had pushed the situation with Gabe firmly to the back of her mind. But by the time she closed shop after seven that night, thoughts of him came creeping insidiously back into her head.</p><p>By the time she made her way home, all she could think of was heading over to his place. God, she was so tempted. So what if she felt awful afterward? She could work around that . . . what he made her feel during was pretty damned spectacular. If she rationed her time with him wisely\u2014maybe she could keep her already broken heart shielded from further harm?</p><p>She bargained with herself all through the late dinner that Faye had left in the microwave for her. She had had a stressful day and needed something to help her relax . . . just a couple of hours to help her take the edge off. They had already had sex after all; so one more time wouldn\u2019t make that much difference, would it?</p><p>God, she sounded like an addict! She laughed bitterly when she recognized that that was exactly what she was and that Gabe was her drug of choice.</p><p>She barely tasted her dinner and trudged upstairs afterward to grab a shower. She took extra care with shampooing her hair and shaving her legs and armpits, telling herself that she was just doing it because she needed to pamper herself a bit. She brushed her teeth and used the expensive body lotion that Theresa had given her for Christmas. She hadn\u2019t even opened the bottle before now but she applied it generously, relishing how smooth her skin felt afterward. Why hadn\u2019t she ever used the stuff before? It felt and smelled amazing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She dragged on her usual sleepwear of boy shorts and a tank top and went back downstairs to the library for a book. She was surprised to find her father asleep on one of the comfortable leather sofas, an open book lying facedown on his chest. The sound of the door opening startled him out of his light snooze and he smiled at her sleepily.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t seen you in days,\u201d he said warmly, and she returned his smile, curling up on the sofa next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t,\u201d she replied, dropping a kiss on his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ve had quite the active social life lately,\u201d he said, and she flushed guiltily.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He looked surprised by her reaction and question and his gaze sharpened.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I mean?\u201d he asked pointedly.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She tried not to look too uncomfortable with his line of questioning.</p><p>\u201cRoberta, do you have a male friend you\u2019re not telling me about? Gabe mentioned something about a guy yesterday? Someone you met at the pub?\u201d The sound of Gabe\u2019s name startled her, but her father misinterpreted her reaction and grinned gleefully. \u201cYou do have a male friend! I\u2019d like to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s uh . . . it\u2019s not that serious yet,\u201d she whispered, aghast by the awful turn the conversation had taken.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cK-Kyle Foster, he\u2019s a landscape architect.\u201d Oh God, what the hell was she doing?</p><p>\u201cAnd you like him? He\u2019s a good man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very nice.\u201d Stop talking, Bobbi! her conscience was shrieking at her. Just shut the hell up!</p><p>\u201cYou should consider bringing him to the Valentine\u2019s Day Ball,\u201d her father said, and her mind went completely blank as she thought about that horrible annual event. She usually managed to avoid it but her father, who so rarely made any demands on his children, had insisted that Bobbi and her brothers attend this year. Since he planned to announce his retirement, Bobbi knew that she had no option other than to show her support. But she had forgotten that she would probably have to bring a date to the event. That thought was followed by an even worse one . . .</p><p>Would Gabe be bringing a date? God, she wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it. Not with everything that had happened\u2014was still happening\u2014between them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider it,\u201d she said absently\u2014her mind on Gabe and the gorgeous woman he would probably bring to the formal event.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d her father said. \u201cAnd bring him to dinner sometime, I\u2019d like to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, still on autopilot. Her father dropped an arm around her shoulder and planted a swift kiss on the top of her head. The show of affection was so rare that it startled Bobbi out of her reverie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off to bed,\u201d he told her. \u201cGood night, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Daddy,\u201d she replied, warmed by the endearment. He left the room in his usual brisk manner. Bobbi sat immersed in her chaotic thoughts for a long time. She had lied to her father, dragged poor Kyle into this mess, and now had to find a date to the damned Valentine\u2019s Day Ball.</p><p>Maybe Gabe would ask her. Once the wistful thought had entered her mind it continued to float around in there like a hopeful sprite. She tried to bat it away, knowing that it was ridiculous to even consider the possibility, but the part of her that liked to wish for impossible things couldn\u2019t help but hope.</p><p>\u201cGabe won\u2019t ask you,\u201d she said out loud, and flinched at the inescapable truth in the words.</p><p>Gabe stared blankly at the television screen, not really absorbing what he was seeing as he tried to swallow past the lump of bitter disappointment that had lodged in his throat. She wasn\u2019t coming.</p> <p>It was nearly one in the morning and he had held out hope until about an hour ago when the huge grandfather clock in the foyer had struck twelve. After that he had simply gone numb and continued to sit here unable to summon up the energy to head up to bed. So maybe the night before hadn\u2019t had quite the same impact on her as it had on him? The thought was humbling and hard to accept, but there wasn\u2019t much else he could take away from this resounding rejection.</p><p>He buried his face in his hands. This was probably for the best; he already felt like he was in too deep. They would simply forget that it had ever happened and go back to normal.</p><p>He winced at that thought. As if it would be that easy. He could never unsee the perfection of her naked body, or untaste the honey of her mouth, or unfeel her clenching heat around him. He was so screwed . . .</p><p>He reached for the remote and switched off the television and the sudden echoing silence unsettled him. He sat there for a moment longer, willing himself to get up and go to bed. He had just pushed himself out of the chair when he heard the quiet knock on the front door. His breath caught in his throat and his heart stuttered to a stop before resuming its rhythm erratically.</p><p>The knock came again, louder this time, and he leapt into action running to the front door, skidding on the foyer\u2019s polished floor and nearly falling on his butt, in a bid to get there before she changed her mind and left. He was breathless by the time he wrest open the heavy door and barely took in the fact that she was in her nightclothes before dragging her into his arms and planting a hungry kiss on her lips.</p><p>She kissed him back, wrapping her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist. He staggered back and kicked the front door shut before pinning her to the heavy wooden door and taking his fill of her mouth.</p><p>He lifted his head and cupped her face with his hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming,\u201d he gasped, fighting for breath. She grinned at him, her legs tightening around his waist.</p><p>\u201cReally? I was kind of hoping that I\u2019d be coming.\u201d It was a silly play on words that barely made sense but it delighted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work on that for you,\u201d he promised, thrusting his hardness against her core and she moaned, burying her face in the hollow of his neck as she pushed herself against him, establishing a quick rhythm that nearly had them both spending in seconds. Luckily reason reasserted itself and Gabe groaned before dropping his hands to her hips to stop her sensual grinding.</p><p>\u201cStop that, damn it! I want to get you to a bed this time,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you waiting for?\u201d she asked impatiently, and he wrapped one hand around her back and cupped the other beneath her butt to support her as he clumsily made his way upstairs with her still clinging to him tightly.</p><p>When he reached his room, he stumbled his way to the bed, dropped her down on the soft mattress and climbed up with her in the same motion. He studied her appreciatively as she lay spread out beneath him and growled ferally before hunching down and unceremoniously dragging down her top and sucking one tight nipple into his mouth with a rough finesse that had her arching her back off the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she cried out, clamping her thighs against his hips and curling her fingers into his hair.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to last long,\u201d he muttered against her breast.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she sobbed, reaching down between them to fumble with his belt and fly. He hissed when she managed to get everything undone and finally wrapped her hands around his length. She stroked him with both hands and he shuddered in response.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother removing her shorts; he merely pushed them aside and positioned himself at her entrance before shoving his way in. The contrasting sensations of the cotton of her underwear and the wet silk of her intimate flesh against his responsive shaft nearly made him come before he\u2019d gotten more than the head in and he swore gutturally when he realized that the reason he was feeling so damned much was because he wasn\u2019t wearing a condom. He never forgot to put on a condom and he was momentarily disconcerted by the lapse.</p><p>\u201cShit, shit, shit. No condom. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d It nearly killed him to withdraw and Bobbi wailed when he left her but he took care of the protection as quickly as he could under the circumstances and was back with her seconds later.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that to me again,\u201d she rebuked, and he apologized with a kiss before thrusting his way back in. They didn\u2019t last long. It was rough and fast and over in less than four minutes.</p><p>Gabe watched her come in that erotic way of hers, so quiet with just a gasp and a moan and then a long release of breath. He couldn\u2019t imagine ever tiring of that or of feeling her orgasm around his shaft. The way she pulsed around him pulled his own climax from him.</p><p>\u201cBobbi,\u201d he groaned as he poured himself into her. Just that. Just her name. It was all that needed saying.</p><p>She had stayed longer this time, Gabe reflected hours later as he watched her slight figure walk across the lawn toward the high fence between their properties. Long enough for them to have a round two\u2014which had been slow, sensual, and utterly devastating\u2014and round three in the shower. She had left immediately after the shower, ignoring Gabe\u2019s entreaties for her to stay longer. She hadn\u2019t even wanted him to walk her to the gate, insisting that she would be fine.</p><p>As he reflected upon the past few hours, he realized that she hadn\u2019t spoken much at all. She had told him what she liked and where she liked it. Had expressed her appreciation when he had done something that she enjoyed. Had said his name in so many different ways that he\u2019d lost count of them but she hadn\u2019t spoken of anything else. Hadn\u2019t told him how work on the Corvette was progressing, hadn\u2019t said if she\u2019d solved the delivery mix up of that afternoon.</p><p>The animated chatter that he was used to from her had been completely missing and the absence disturbed him.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Gabe groaned and blindly reached for the cell phone on the nightstand. Who in the hell would be calling before six in the morning? He glared at the display but it read \u201cunknown\u201d and he dragged his thumb across the screen to answer.</p><p>\u201cGabriel Braddock,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Chase. Gabe pushed himself up and winced when he felt a burning sensation on the skin of his shoulders. He reached up gingerly with his free hand and investigated. There were three deep scratches scored into the flesh of both shoulders. He remembered Bobbi dragging her fingers down his back during their second bout of lovemaking and grinned at the memory\u2014half aroused as he recalled exactly why she had made them. He had taken her to the brink and then eased off, she had been pissed off but he had made it up to her, prolonging the encounter until she had been out of her mind with lust.</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d Chase\u2019s voice brought him back down to earth with a jolt.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. I\u2019m here . . . When are you arriving?\u201d Despite everything that had happened over the last few days, thoughts of his brother had remained very firmly in his mind. He was happy that Chase was returning home and would be out of immediate danger for the moment at least.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be landing in Cape Town at eight thirty this morning. Can you pick me up? Or send a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. See you later.\u201d His brother still sounded off. Gabe couldn\u2019t put his finger on it but something was very wrong. Chase disconnected the call before he could respond and Gabe put his phone aside and lay there for a while. He wondered if Bobbi was awake yet. She usually got an early start to the day. He decided to check and sent her an SMS. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Up yet? When she didn\u2019t immediately respond, he threw the bed covers off and padded\u2014naked\u2014to the closet to drag out his jogging shorts and T-shirt. When his phone buzzed, he all but dove for it but it was buried somewhere beneath the covers and he swore irritably while he hunted for it. When he found it he was rewarded with a single word.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Well . . . hell.</p><p>I\u2019m going for a run. Wanna join me? This time he didn\u2019t have to wait too long for the response.</p> <p>Sure. Meet me at the gate in ten mins.</p><p>He grinned, feeling ridiculously happy that she\u2019d agreed and dragged on his running shoes before doing a few perfunctory stretches, keeping an eye on the clock. He didn\u2019t want to be late.</p><p>He left the house within seven minutes and was at the gate a minute after that. Bobbi wasn\u2019t there yet. He did a few more stretches, enjoying the fresh air and early morning birdsong. It was a perfect summer morning and still cool enough for a leisurely jog around the neighborhood. Bobbi didn\u2019t enjoy jogging as much as he did and joined him on his morning runs only occasionally. He heard a voice and looked up through the bars of the two-meter high gate. She was waving and shouting out a greeting to one of the security guards on the Richmond property. She made her way toward Gabe with that usual insouciant amble of hers and he looked his fill, appreciating the sensuous roll of her hips. He drank in the skintight running shorts and racerback sports bra that she usually wore for jogging and couldn\u2019t quite fathom how he had managed to run with her before without wanting to lick every expanse of silky flesh on display. She was toned and tanned all over and while she didn\u2019t have the most generous curves, the shape she did have was tight, sexy, and undeniably feminine.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d She grinned when she reached him.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve gone jogging together,\u201d she noted, executing a graceful overhead stretch that emphasised the flatness of her belly and pert roundness of her breasts. She then turned and placed her hands on the gate to do a calf stretch and Gabe bit back a groan at the sight of her firm butt in those indecent shorts. God they clung to her like a second skin and just barely covered the lower curve of her behind.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been jogging in a while.\u201d He was so completely distracted by her sexy, sinuous stretches that he could barely concentrate on what he was saying. \u201cBusy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to kick some serious butt today, Braddock.\u201d They were back in friend mode, he realized. It was as if last night hadn\u2019t happened at all. She was her usual teasing and playful self and it created a disconnect in Gabe who couldn\u2019t transition from lover to friend as easily as she apparently could. This was the same woman he had held and kissed and touched and pleasured just hours before and it was crazy not to be able to acknowledge that fact with a caress or a kiss or even an endearment.</p><p>But these were his rules and if she could play by them, then so should he.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it, Richmond,\u201d he countered, trying to inject some humor into his voice. \u201cI have a couple of secret weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And what would they be?\u201d She slanted her head curiously and looked damned adorable in the process.</p> <p>\u201cLonger legs and . . . stamina,\u201d he responded before taking off at a sprint and laughing when she shouted a protest.</p><p>He got a good head start before slowing down and allowing her to catch up with him. He shortened his stride so that she could keep pace with him and they settled into an easy jog. After less than a kilometer she glared up at him.</p><p>\u201cI hate running,\u201d she groused. \u201cWhy do you make me do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop complaining, I didn\u2019t make you do anything. I just invited you along. You didn\u2019t have to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you keep letting me do this to myself?\u201d She puffed and he grinned again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being pathetic, Richmond, stop whining so much and focus on your breathing.\u201d She was a good runner but hated the exertion. She needed coaxing and teasing to keep going. He\u2019d been half coaching, half haranguing her during their jogs for years. It usually worked and she always finished the entire seventeen-kilometer course around the neighborhood in under an hour.</p><p>They ended up back at his place about fifty minutes later and did a few cool-down exercises in silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m picking Chase up in an hour or so,\u201d he told her, after taking a sip of water. The day was going to be a scorcher with the morning temperature already in the mid to upper twenties. He handed her his water bottle and she drank thirstily.</p> <p>\u201cDid he say anything about his reasons for coming home?\u201d she asked, running a hand through her damp hair. A few tendrils stuck to her forehead and he had to stop himself from reaching out and brushing them back.</p><p>\u201cNothing yet . . . but something\u2019s definitely wrong.\u201d He frowned as he recalled his brother\u2019s uncharacteristically subdued voice on the phone that morning.</p><p>\u201cAt least he\u2019ll be at home, so you\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what the problem is,\u201d she said, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ve got to get showered, call Stephanie to tell her not to expect me this morning, and hit the road,\u201d he said, wiping the dripping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cMe too, we\u2019re short-staffed. Pieter has measles and there\u2019s a lot to do.\u201d She turned away but his voice halted her progress.</p><p>\u201cBobbi?\u201d He waited until she had turned back to face him before hooking a hand around the nape of her neck and dragging her over until she was plastered against his sweaty body. He dropped a hard kiss on her delicate mouth before she could utter a word of protest and before she could even think to push him away, he had already released her. She swayed and he put a hand on one of her shoulders to steady her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEasy there,\u201d he crooned, amused when she fixed a bemused look on his face. She looked completely dazed and incapable of speech.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . right,\u201d she finally said. \u201cThanks. I mean . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ve got to go . . .\u201d She still looked completely discombobulated when she turned away from him again.</p> <p>\u201cHave a good day,\u201d he called to her back and she acknowledged the sentiment with a wave. \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d So maybe he had presumed too much with that last statement, but aside from straightening her shoulders, she said nothing in response to it.</p><p>She had already disappeared through the gate by the time Gabe realized that he was still standing on his front steps with a ridiculously goofy grin on his face and made his way back into the house. The grin didn\u2019t fade until after his shower.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t grinning an hour later when he watched Chase make his way through the domestic arrivals gate at Cape Town International Airport. Chase looked haggard. That was the only word he could think of to describe his twin. He looked like he had lost at least ten kilograms, his hair was a shaggy mess, he obviously hadn\u2019t shaved in days, and his cheeks were sunken hollows.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Gabe whispered in shock when he first caught sight of the man. He plastered a smile onto his lips when Chase saw him and heartily embraced the man who was a mere ten minutes older than Gabe. When they had been younger even their own mother had had difficulty telling them apart. Their mother would burst into tears if she were to see Chase right now. Gabe, himself, felt like weeping.</p><p>He held onto his brother longer than he usually would and Chase seemed content to let him. They eventually moved apart and Gabe cleared his throat awkwardly, kind of embarrassed to note the sheen of tears in his brother\u2019s eyes but then even more self-conscious when he realized that he was doing a lot of blinking to clear his misty vision as well.</p> <p>\u201cMissed you, bro,\u201d he muttered. He grabbed Chase\u2019s tog bag, knowing that Chase would prefer to carry his precious camera equipment.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been too long between assignments,\u201d Chase agreed. He hadn\u2019t set foot in the country in more than six months. He had inherited their father\u2019s wanderlust and sense of adventure but had channelled it more productively. They chatted about the flight and airline food on the long walk back to the car\u2014keeping things simple and impersonal.</p><p>Chase whistled appreciatively when he saw the Lamborghini.</p><p>\u201cThis is a gorgeous piece of machinery.\u201d He grinned boyishly, giving Gabe a glimpse of his old self. He did a slow circle around the car before coming to a halt at the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cKeys?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYeah right,\u201d Gabe scoffed. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m letting your travel-weary butt drive this baby, you can think again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou suck,\u201d his brother groused.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Bobbi,\u201d Gabe chuckled, his heart doing a bizarre loop-the-loop in his chest at the mere mention of her name. What the hell? He busied himself with loading his brother\u2019s gear into the car, hastily stifling that weird reaction. Luckily Chase traveled light\u2014an occupational hazard\u2014or they would have run into trouble. The car wasn\u2019t exactly designed to carry a lot of luggage.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t let her drive it yet?\u201d Chase asked, after they had left the airport.</p><p>\u201cYet?\u201d Gabe snorted. \u201cTry ever. She\u2019s too reckless, she could get herself killed.\u201d He went ice cold at the very thought.</p><p>\u201cCome on, she\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Chase dismissed. \u201cShe\u2019s actually damned good at racing\u2014competent and in control\u2014you\u2019re too much of a nervous ninny to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not encourage her,\u201d Gabe warned, and Chase shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will you be staying at your flat?\u201d he asked Chase, referring to the luxury apartment in Camps Bay. When Chase didn\u2019t immediately respond, Gabe glanced over at him in concern and saw that his brother was absently staring out at the passing scenery. He looked lost and haunted.</p> <p>\u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer to stay at home this time round, bro. If that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s okay with me,\u201d Gabe reassured. \u201cIt\u2019s your house too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I don\u2019t wanna cramp your style or anything. I know you always have some brainy blonde on call.\u201d Gabe froze as he thought of Bobbi. How the hell were they going to work this with Chase staying under the same roof? The house was huge but . . .</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a weighty silence.\u201d Chase\u2019s voice intruded in his thoughts and Gabe glanced over at him. \u201cI take it things are more serious with this latest one then? What is she? An astronaut? A professor? No, you\u2019ve already dated a professor . . . an astrophysicist? Neurosurgeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not seeing anyone right now.\u201d Gabe ended the speculation and the look of blatant disbelief on Chase\u2019s face was almost comical. Gabe grinned reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly Don Juan, you know. I do occasionally find myself between relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie,\u201d Chase mocked. \u201cNo, say it ain\u2019t so! My baby brother always has a bevy of beautiful blondes at his beck and call. Don\u2019t tell me my hero has feet of clay. Don\u2019t tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Gabe laughed, enjoying his brother\u2019s banter. He had been watching Chase grow more relaxed with every passing kilometer as if whatever emotional burden he was carrying grew lighter and lighter the closer they got to home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bobbi got through the morning somehow, but it was hard when she couldn\u2019t think of anything other than Gabe and the things they had done to each other the night before. Then there was that morning\u2019s kiss, which had been hard and fast and filled with so much promise that all she could think about was going back for more. It was seriously distracting.</p><p>Her cell phone rang just before lunch and her heart leapt in excitement as she reached for it, wondering if it was Gabe. She doubted it since he probably wanted to spend time with Chase but she was hopeful. She rolled her eyes when she read the name on screen.</p><p>\u201cBilly, hi,\u201d she greeted. He was five years her senior, the closest brother to her in age and the one who had given her the most grief growing up. They were pretty close though and often hung out together. Edward and Clyde were closer to each other in age\u2014they had been fifteen and seventeen when their mother had died and had handled the sudden loss a lot better than their younger siblings had.</p><p>The younger Richmond siblings, feeling abandoned by the adults and near-adults in their family at such a confusing time in their lives, had instead adopted the Braddock family as their own and had spent many long hours playing with the twins. Lucy Templeton-Braddock had taken them under her wing and had provided the stable maternal influence that they had lost. She had often referred to them as her \u201clost little lambs\u201d and had treated them like they were her own.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Bobbi, I have a huge favor to ask you.\u201d Her brother started his conversation without preamble and her eyes widened in surprise. He hardly ever asked her for favors.</p><p>\u201cJase told me that you met Kyle Foster the other day?\u201d That wasn\u2019t at all what she had been expecting and she couldn\u2019t do more than make a soft sound of confirmation. \u201cI was hoping you could introduce me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. Ask Jason, Kyle is his buddy.\u201d Why were people constantly asking her about Kyle Foster? It was bizarre. \u201cI don\u2019t even know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Jason, the guy has the hots for you,\u201d Billy pointed out and Bobbi went bright red, grateful that her brother couldn\u2019t see her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to meet him anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best landscape architects around and in high demand. I\u2019ve wanted to work with him for years.\u201d Billy was an architect. A really great architect.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a professional, Billy, your reputation speaks for itself. You don\u2019t need me to make your contacts for you, just call him up and tell him you want to work with him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll jump at the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already tried that. I need him for a project in April, but he\u2019s booked through to November. I figured if I could chat with him in a less formal setting, dinner maybe, and tell him about the project he\u2019ll be interested enough to work on it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like a double date kind of thing; you bring Foster, I bring one of my female friends and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I sleep with him to sweeten the deal?\u201d she asked sarcastically.</p> <p>\u201cBobbi!\u201d Her brother sounded so scandalized that for a moment she gave in to the impulse to grin. \u201cOf course not, that\u2019s not what . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBilly, my answer is no. Do the professional thing and have your secretary call his secretary or whatever. Just leave me out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad tells me you\u2019re bringing him to the Valentine\u2019s Day thing.\u201d Her jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! What?\u201d Her voice was so shrill Sean and Craig looked up from the shop floor to peer at her through the glass of her office door. \u201cI met the guy once, why the hell is everybody asking me about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you hardly ever go out with guys, I\u2019m pretty sure Dad was starting to think you batted for the other team,\u201d he said, and Bobbi sighed and dropped her head back on the headrest of her chair, staring at the ceiling in frustration. She absently noted a daddy longlegs sitting idly in its web in one of the corners and her eyes automatically tracked across to the other corners to ensure that they were spider-free. \u201cDad seems to think you\u2019re totally in love with the guy.\u201d</p><p>Her father had completely gotten the wrong end of the stick on that one, Bobbi thought with a sigh. Right emotion, wrong guy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not,\u201d she denied. \u201cNow leave me alone, I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww come on, Bobbi,\u201d he reproved. \u201cThrow me a bone, won\u2019t you? You used to be a better sister than this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you and Dad need to stop talking about me behind my back,\u201d she added. She disconnected the call while he was in mid-plea and glared at the screen irritably.</p><p>\u201cBe seen with one guy in public,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cAnd they\u2019re planning your wedding and naming your first-born child.\u201d Their peaceful berg was too small and the Richmond and Braddock families were too well known for any juicy bit of news to slip by unnoticed. She knew that it was one of the main reasons Gabe wanted to keep their affair, if that\u2019s what it could be called, secret. They would never be able to get away with just sleeping together, the pressure on him to do the \u201crespectable\u201d thing with the daughter of such a prominent family would be immense. And Gabe being Gabe wouldn\u2019t allow himself to be forced into anything and that could have some pretty major repercussions for him\u2014personally and professionally\u2014if her father decided to take offense.</p><p>But even while she understood his reasoning, it just really hurt to be nothing more to him than an itch that needed scratching. She ran her hands over her face and groaned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop thinking about it,\u201d she told herself, her voice muffled behind her hands. Just enjoy it while it lasts.</p><p>She picked up her phone again, wanting to touch base with Gabe and genuinely concerned about Chase.</p><p>Hey. Chase ok? She tapped out the message swiftly and then put the phone aside to pick up a couple of requisition forms. She hated the paperwork aspect of her job; it kept her away from what she really loved which was being elbow deep in the innards of an automobile. Unfortunately owning a business meant that she had to deal with the boring stuff too and sadly the boring stuff seemed to completely outweigh the fun stuff. Her phone buzzed.</p><p>I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m worried. Something wrong. I didn\u2019t talk to him about it yet\u2014had to come to work.</p> <p>Give him time, she responded.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>She watched her phone for a while longer but no other message was forthcoming so she put her head down and went back to her paperwork. The phone buzzed a minute later and she grabbed it eagerly.</p><p>So . . . are you wearing a bra today? She was equal parts embarrassed and amused by the question and not sure how to respond to it. She was saved from making that decision when the buzzer went again.</p><p>Sorry. Out of line but . . . are you?</p> <p>She laughed out loud at that bit of nerve, bit her lip and tapped out a quick message, and pushed \u201cSend\u201d before she could change her mind.</p><p>YEAH you\u2019re out of line . . . and no. I\u2019m not. His next reply made her breath catch.</p><p>SO hard I hurt right now. Thanks!!!</p><p>Wish I was there to kiss it better. Her response was more risqu\u00e9 than she\u2019d intended. It was like her fingers had taken on a life of their own.</p><p>OMG!! You\u2019re killing me. Can\u2019t concentrate on work now cos that\u2019s all I\u2019ll be thinking about. She grinned. She was still thinking about how to respond when a new message buzzed its way to her screen.</p><p>Crap. Gtg\u2014your dad\u2019s on his way to my office!</p> <p>Bobbi choked back a laugh as she pictured him jumping like a guilty schoolboy just because her father had nearly caught him indulging in a bit of PG-13 sexting. Okay, so maybe Mike Richmond wouldn\u2019t take it too well if he knew that Bobbi was the recipient of the racy messages\u2014but it was still a funny thought. Gabe respected her father so much, Bobbi knew that he would hate to do anything to upset or disappoint the man. She shook her head and put her phone down.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she was doing here. The lines between the role of friend and lover were becoming less distinct. That morning, the jog, it had started off friendly and then he had ended it with that kiss. The SMSs they\u2019d just exchanged\u2014her initial inquiry had been that of a concerned friend and it had turned into a mild sexting session. How was she supposed to keep these two roles straight when Gabe was the one who kept mixing things up? She was going have to talk to him about it and try to reestablish some of the ground rules.</p><p>Gabe had wanted to eat in and have a talk with his brother, but Chase had insisted they head down to the pub for dinner. Gabe knew his brother well enough to recognize the delaying tactic. Chase was aware that Gabe had questions and he didn\u2019t want to answer them. He had even asked Gabe to delay telling their mother that he was back in Cape Town. She knew that he was in the country but thought he was staying in Johannesburg for a couple of days.</p><p>When they walked into the pub, the friends they had known all their lives flocked around them to welcome Chase home with back thumps and pints of beer; it took a while before they could make their way to a table and order some food, and even then somebody was always stopping by for a chat.</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s good to be home,\u201d Chase said during one of the rare moments they were alone at their table.</p><p>\u201cYou should come home more often,\u201d Gabe told him, trying to keep his tone light.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u201d Chase\u2019s tired response had Gabe leaning forward intently.</p><p>\u201cThinking about what exactly?\u201d he prompted.</p> <p>\u201cStaying home and working on that book.\u201d Chase had been thinking of compiling a book of photographs for years. He always tried to capture the beauty hidden beneath the ugliness of the war torn places he found himself in and that was what his book would focus on. A single rose blooming on a battlefield, a glorious sunrise over a minefield. He had once told Gabe that he took those photos to maintain his sanity.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you get bored at home?\u201d Gabe asked, taking a sip of beer.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see the beauty anymore, Gabe.\u201d His brother\u2019s voice sounded completely desolate and Gabe\u2019s throat tightened. \u201cI look around me and all I see is ugliness, despair, fear, poverty . . . violence. There\u2019s no beauty. Not even here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, man,\u201d Gabe shook his head, blinking away that sting in the back of his eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMovie?\u201d Chase asked when they got home an hour and a half later and Gabe nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, lemme get some chips and beer. You pick the movie.\u201d Gabe moved toward the kitchen and then turned back. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Chase paused on his way to the den and looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cNo chick flicks!\u201d Gabe instructed, and Chase blinked, studied him for a second, and then, for the first time since returning, truly laughed. The sound was deep and spontaneous and just a tad rusty and made Gabe feel rather sentimental.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Chase bantered. \u201cI was so looking forward to watching Pretty Woman again. Or Titanic maybe.\u201d</p><p>Chase chose a comedy, one they had seen several times before, but Gabe recognized that his brother was seeking the familiar and that a violent action movie wasn\u2019t what Chase needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The movie had been on for less than half an hour when the doorbell rang. Gabe tensed, knowing instantly who it was. He had forgotten to tell her that Chase would be staying with him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve.\u201d Chase sat up with a frown and paused the movie. \u201cWho would be visiting at this time of night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an inkling,\u201d Gabe replied. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>He left the room before Chase could question him any further and hurried to the front door. The sight of Bobbi standing there in nothing but a pair of skimpy Snoopy pyjama shorts and a matching pink tank top made him groan. She looked good enough to eat and that had been his plan for the night before Chase had come to stay. She smiled at him and took his breath away.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d she whispered, and stepped into his arms. She reached up and entangled her hands in his hair before tugging his head down for a kiss. He wrapped his arms around her slender body and captured her lips in a tender embrace that was filled with longing and desire. Her soft moan as she wound her arms around his neck undid him and he deepened the kiss, stroking his tongue into her mouth for a brief instant before reason reasserted itself and he dragged his head back. She made a disappointed sound and tried to capture his lips again but he brought his hands up to her arms and moved her firmly away, turning his head to avoid her kiss. He winced at the hurt confusion that clouded her eyes.</p><p>\u201cChase is here,\u201d he muttered, and the pain deepened for an instant before she stepped back.</p><p>\u201cBobbi,\u201d he whispered, uncomfortable with the brief flash of rejection that he had seen in her eyes and despising himself for putting it there. \u201cI\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please don\u2019t . . .\u201d She held up a hand in entreaty. \u201cJust don\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just part of the agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabe,\u201d she warned, and he sighed deeply.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t easy for me either, Bobbi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not.\u201d But she sounded bitter and unconvinced and it was killing Gabe not to reach for her and drag her back into his arms. \u201cCan I say hello to Chase? It would look weird if I didn\u2019t. I won\u2019t stay too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay as long as you want,\u201d he said, ill at ease. He hated how badly he was mishandling the situation and hated the awful certainty that in his quest to keep her from getting hurt, he was not only wounding her but irreparably damaging their friendship in the process.</p><p>She brushed past him and padded into the den, the soles of her trainers squeaking on the tiled floor. He absently rubbed at the gnawing ache in his chest as he followed her in. Chase looked up when they entered the room and his face lit up when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cWell, look who it is.\u201d He sounded delighted and leapt to his feet to envelop Bobbi in a tight hug. She laughed and returned the embrace, squealing when Chase lifted her off her feet and swung her around.</p> <p>\u201cPut me down, you giant oaf.\u201d She giggled and he complied, smacking a big kiss on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, sweetie,\u201d he told her and she stood on her toes to ruffle his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, you sexy beast,\u201d she said affectionately, cuddling up to his chest again. Gabe could feel his brow settling into a scowl as he watched the excessive kissing and cuddling between the two. Had they always been this physical? He found himself wanting to wade between them and push them apart. This was ridiculous. When Chase planted yet another kiss on Bobbi\u2019s cheek, Gabe felt a growl building in his chest. Enough, for God\u2019s sake!</p><p>\u201cBobbi\u2019s not staying long,\u201d he said loudly enough to interrupt the snuggle fest. Chase looked into Bobbi\u2019s upturned face with a mock frown.</p><p>\u201cRidiculous, you\u2019re watching the movie with us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked Bobbi, who darted a tentative glance at Gabe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Gabe winced at the small waver in her voice, knowing that he had put it there. God, he was being a total dick. He just didn\u2019t like seeing Chase\u2019s hands all over her. And that thought was shocking in its own right. It was as if he was jealous . . . of Chase.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Talladega Nights,\u201d Gabe informed her, gentling his tone. \u201cStay, I\u2019ll get you a beer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course we don\u2019t mind,\u201d Chase scoffed, dragging her to the sofa and planting her next to him. \u201cWhy would we mind? You sit with me, I\u2019ve missed the hell out of you and I\u2019m keeping you close.\u201d</p><p>Gabe tried to keep another frown from settling on his face and turned away from the cozy pair, heading for the kitchen. When he returned, Bobbi had her shoes off and her feet curled under her butt on the sofa. Chase had an arm around her shoulders while she had her head on his chest and was absently playing with his free hand as she told him about the Corvette she was renovating for Jason. Chase was giving her his full attention and neither of them noticed Gabe\u2019s return until he slammed the beer bottle onto the coffee table in front of them. Chase looked up in surprise, and Bobbi eyed him with that awful look of uncertainty on her face again.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Gabe muttered. \u201cIt slipped.\u201d</p><p>Chase seemed to accept that and rested his cheek on Bobbi\u2019s head, but she still kept a wary eye on Gabe as he slumped down on the recliner next to the sofa.</p><p>Bobbi felt incredibly awkward, it was clear that Gabe didn\u2019t want her here. Maybe he didn\u2019t trust her to keep her mouth shut about their sexual arrangement, maybe he wanted to spend time with his brother and resented Bobbi\u2019s presence, or maybe he just plain didn\u2019t want to be in her company right now. Whatever it was, it made her feel uncomfortable and for the first time ever, she felt unsure of her welcome in this house. She could sense the waves of disapproval wafting off him even after he\u2019d put the movie back on and she couldn\u2019t relax, despite Chase\u2019s solid and reassuring presence beside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t concentrate on the movie and was lost in her thoughts when a soft snore in her ear startled her out of her reverie. She twisted her neck to look up at Chase and came to the gradual realization that his arm was heavy across her shoulders and his body was becoming uncomfortably heavy. She tossed a glance over at Gabe, who was staring at the television screen grimly\u2014he seemed as lost in his thoughts as she had been.</p><p>\u201cGabe,\u201d she whispered. He didn\u2019t seem to hear her and she escalated her voice to an urgent hiss. \u201cGabe!\u201d</p><p>He was startled into jerking his head around to where she and Chase were sitting on the sofa. The questioning look on his face was immediately replaced by amusement when he saw her predicament.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting heavy,\u201d she grunted, and Gabe chuckled before coming over to prod his brother.</p> <p>\u201cChase, you\u2019re crushing Bobbi.\u201d There was no response, and he shook Chase more firmly. Chase sat bolt upright and one hand wrapped around Gabe\u2019s throat while the other arm drew back to deliver a punch. Bobbi screamed and the sound seemed to snap Chase out of whatever daze he was in, because his grip immediately loosened. His arms fell to his sides and his hands clenched into tight fists.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he swore shakily, his entire body trembling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was . . . I was having a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome dream.\u201d Gabe kept his voice light, even though Bobbi could see the concern in his eyes. \u201cNo harm done. You\u2019re knackered though. You should get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Chase ran a trembling hand through his hair and nodded. He cast an apologetic glance at Bobbi.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, sweetie,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d she said with a wobbly smile. \u201cYou just get a decent night\u2019s sleep. We can catch up tomorrow.\u201d She got up and hugged him again, her concern for him making her grip tighter than usual. He returned the desperate hug with equal fervor before reluctantly releasing her. He spared a brief shamefaced glance for Gabe before saying a hurried good night and leaving the room. There was an odd and uncomfortable silence after Chase\u2019s departure and Bobbi darted a quick look at Gabe. There was a troubled expression on his face as he looked at the door through which Chase had exited the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too thin,\u201d Bobbi said, and Gabe turned his moody regard on her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cI can see why you\u2019re worried about him. He looks terrible,\u201d she observed, and Gabe sighed deeply, thrusting his hands into his trouser pockets and hunching his shoulders. He didn\u2019t bother replying.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d she said after another prolonged silence and watched Gabe\u2019s jaw tighten in response. She looked around for her trainers but could find only one. Frustrated, she went down on her knees to have a look beneath the sofa. Of course it wasn\u2019t within easy reach and she fumbled around for it\u2014swearing softly beneath her breath when it kept evading her grasp. When\u2014after a long while\u2014she managed to snag a shoelace and drag it out, her cheeks were flushed with both embarrassment and exertion and she tugged her shoes on self-consciously, acutely aware of the fact that Gabe had been staring at her the entire time.</p><p>\u201cAnyway . . .\u201d She tucked back a strand of her hair and focused her eyes on the wall above his left shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll see you. Good night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d The words sounded torn from him and his voice was filled with enough urgency to bring her eyes up to meet his. The entreaty she saw there stole her breath.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want me here,\u201d she said, and hated how needy she sounded. He held out an unsteady hand to her. She hesitated before stepping toward him. He entwined his fingers with hers and gently tugged her closer until he had her loosely clasped in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI want you here.\u201d His voice was soft and his eyes gleamed with sincerity as they burned into hers. He cupped her face in his hands and just looked at her for the longest time, his gaze running from her hair, down to eyebrows, nose, mouth\u2014it lingered there\u2014and then back up to her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so damned beautiful, Bobbi mine. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here and I\u2019m sorry if I made you feel unwelcome.\u201d</p><p>Stunned by the intimate endearment\u2014had he really just called her his?\u2014it took Bobbi a moment to gather her thoughts enough to answer. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want Chase to know about us, I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to spend time with him. I didn\u2019t mean to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d His thumbs were starting a slow, seductive sweep from her jaw, up to the corners of her mouth and back again.</p><p>\u201cThen, I don\u2019t understand . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to spend time with you.\u201d He totally dumfounded her with those words and she reached up to his wrists, meaning to stop the distracting stroke of his thumbs so that she could concentrate on his words, but not really succeeding. Instead her hands explored the bones in his wrists and then swept up his strong, veiny forearms and further up to his hard biceps.</p><p>\u201cYou had a funny way of showing it,\u201d she murmured, and his face was so close to hers that her lips brushed against his as she said the words.</p><p>\u201cI hated seeing Chase\u2019s hands all over you,\u201d he confessed. \u201cAbsolutely hated it.\u201d She drew her head back so that she could look into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Chase and I hugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hug, you cuddled and caressed and damned near crept into each other\u2019s skins.\u201d He looked and sounded completely pissed off and Bobbi felt her eyebrows lift into her hairline. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGabe, it\u2019s Chase, he\u2019s like a brother to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI was like a brother to you,\u201d he pointed out grimly. \u201cAnd there\u2019s not a hell of a lot of difference physically between Chase and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous,\u201d she breathed, unable to believe it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he denied. \u201cI just don\u2019t like sharing. Especially not with my brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm, but I don\u2019t want Chase, I want you,\u201d she whispered, stroking her hands over his triceps and down to his waist, where they found the bottom edge of his shirt and crept under it to the warm, muscular flesh beneath. She felt the taut muscles in his abdomen jump against her questing fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His question astonished her and her hands stopped their exploration.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d she asked warily.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want me? Why not Chase, who happens to look exactly like me?\u201d Bobbi hesitated, terrified of revealing too much. Gabe knowing that she wanted him physically was one thing but him discovering that she was in love with him was something entirely different. It would complicate an already stressful situation and add even more strain on their already overburdened friendship.</p><p>\u201cBecause Chase isn\u2019t you,\u201d she said after a thoughtful pause. She could see that her answer didn\u2019t satisfy him and went up on to her toes to kiss him, hoping that it would provide a distraction from his searching questions. It worked, Gabe moaned into her mouth and returned the kiss with a sweet intensity that blew her mind. He had never kissed her like this before. It was almost . . . worshipful and quite loving.</p> <p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Bobbi\u2019s entire body was humming when she floated her way home across the lawn in the early hours of the morning. Gabe had spent hours making gentle, almost reverential, love to her and that\u2014combined with his display of jealousy earlier\u2014had left her feeling cherished. And hopeful.</p><p>She quashed that feeling; it would lead to expectations, which would lead to disappointment and eventually heartbreak. She kept leaving her heart wide open and it would be her downfall. When this thing ended, she would be left alone with her broken heart and unable to talk to anybody because nobody would know about it. It was a difficult position to be in. But nevertheless\u2014while her body still buzzed with the aftereffects of Gabe\u2019s expert ministrations\u2014it was easy to fool herself into believing that what they had was real.</p><p>She snuck into the house, knowing that the entire security staff knew about her nightly visitations to the Braddock house, but she trusted them to be discreet. Unless her actions put her or her family into direct physical danger, they wouldn\u2019t utter a word. In fact she didn\u2019t see a single one of them on her return walk home but counted on the fact that they knew exactly where she was. They were being tactful, and she thought it was kind of sweet.</p><p>She fell into bed with Gabe\u2019s scent still all over her, his taste in her mouth. She could still feel the hot, hard thrust of him inside her body and the scrape of his stubble in her neck and on her breasts. She fell asleep with a smile on her lips.</p><p>Gabe was whistling cheerfully when he drifted down to breakfast that morning. He felt amazing, well rested and in a brilliant mood. He had been utterly sated by the time he had reluctantly let Bobbi leave his bed last night. He wished she had stayed longer though, he may have been unable to perform after their four bouts last night, but he\u2019d still wanted to have her curl up next to him and fall asleep. He\u2019d wanted to open his eyes and see her face in the morning light, but she had gently extricated herself and planted one last kiss on his mouth before creeping out of the room with her shoes clutched to her chest.</p> <p>Gabe grinned when he saw the housekeeper, Letty, who smiled in return.</p><p>\u201cMr. Chase requested a buffet breakfast on the patio,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Letty.\u201d She nodded and went back to doing whatever it was she did to keep his home running smoothly. He appreciated the work she did and paid her handsomely but wasn\u2019t one of those people who got too chatty with the household staff. Chase probably knew her entire life story, including how many children and grandchildren she had and their names. That\u2019s just the way he was\u2014warm and approachable for the most part, which was why Chase\u2019s sudden unapproachability and unwillingness to talk was so disturbing. He was the complete opposite of Gabe\u2014who tended to keep people at a distance until he got to know them. Only his inner circle ever saw Gabe joke and laugh and play.</p><p>When Gabe got to the sunny patio, Chase was staring pensively at the gleaming swimming pool.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d Chase\u2019s head jerked in surprise. He looked up, his expression so tormented for a moment that Gabe\u2019s breath caught. The look lasted for only an instant before he shook himself and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get a decent night\u2019s sleep?\u201d Gabe asked, as he sat down opposite his brother after helping himself to scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast.</p><p>\u201cHmm . . . you know how it is after you\u2019ve been on a long-haul flight. I was up at some ungodly hour again, feeling refreshed but frustrated.\u201d Gabe suspected that it was more than that disturbing Chase\u2019s sleep but before he could ask about it, Chase blindsided him with a question of his own.</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of which, Bobbi left pretty late, didn\u2019t she? Did you guys watch another movie after I went up to bed?\u201d Chase was buttering a slice of toast and didn\u2019t see Gabe\u2019s expression freeze for a panicked instant. He glanced up before Gabe could reply and whatever he saw on Gabe\u2019s face made his eyes widen in shock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he breathed. \u201cOh my God, Gabe, are you out of your ever-loving mind?\u201d Gabe swallowed and felt his face flush with heat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d he said lamely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not having sex with Bobbi?\u201d his brother asked, his voice absolutely crawling with disbelief. \u201cWith Bobbi, for Christ\u2019s sake! What the hell are you thinking? Who else knows about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody,\u201d Gabe admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s damned business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe it had been only three nights and the more he had of her the more he craved. This need he had for her seemed to grow with every touch.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are your . . .\u201d Chase shook his head and then snorted. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m asking this, but what are your intentions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy intentions?\u201d Gabe asked, meeting his brother\u2019s disapproving stare head on. \u201cMy intentions are to have breakfast and go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Chase growled.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only answer you\u2019re getting though,\u201d Gabe retorted, shoveling a forkful of eggs into his mouth and glaring at his brother defiantly.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t end well,\u201d Chase predicted. \u201cHow the hell could you allow this to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d Gabe hated how his brother automatically assumed that whatever was going on between Bobbi and Gabe would end, even though he knew it would as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making it my business,\u201d Chase responded. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Gabe said heatedly. \u201cYou\u2019re making assumptions based on what? You don\u2019t know what the paradigms of my relationship with Bobbi are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So what are they? You guys are involved in some secret romance that will eventually lead to marriage and kids? Is that it? Because if that\u2019s not it, then I\u2019m going to have to kick your dumb arse!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re attracted to each other. That\u2019s it. We\u2019re working it out of our systems. It\u2019s between us and nobody else needs to know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobbi isn\u2019t the type of woman you work out of your system, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Because I happen to have known her longer than the women I\u2019ve dated and slept with before? They were all daughters, sisters, and friends too, you know? It\u2019s hypocritical of you to insist I treat Bobbi differently. We have a mutual respect for each other and we\u2019re indulging in an adult relationship with clear-cut boundaries that we\u2019ve both agreed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit,\u201d Chase lambasted him. \u201cYou never hid your relationships with those other women like they were dirty little secrets. If Bobbi is no different than any of them, why are you hiding this from everybody? Have you been out with her in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re always out in public,\u201d Gabe replied, knowing that it wasn\u2019t what Chase had meant.</p><p>\u201cOh cut the crap, Gabriel,\u201d Chase derided. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant. Bobbi doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated like some second-class citizen, good enough for warming your bed but nothing else. You\u2019re embarrassed to be seen with her, that\u2019s what this is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Gabe said, feeling guilty as hell. Bobbi wasn\u2019t the type of woman he was usually seen with. She didn\u2019t have the dress sense, the gloss, or the elegance he enjoyed in a woman. Where would he take her for Christ\u2019s sake? When she didn\u2019t seem to own more than that one ugly dress?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt her,\u201d Chase repeated.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a cruel man, Chase,\u201d Gabe said, annoyed by his brother\u2019s self-righteous attitude.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Chase agreed, leaving Gabe waiting for the \u201cbut\u201d to come. \u201cYou\u2019re not cruel, you\u2019re merely indifferent. Your previous lovers knew the score, when you got bored or they got bored, you both walked away. No ill feelings on either side. You were okay and they were okay. Everything was just . . . okay. So what happens when you grow bored with this relationship? When the novelty wears off and you feel the need to move on to the next woman? How do you cut Bobbi out of your life? Because that\u2019s what you do, Gabe. It\u2019s almost surgical\u2014once you call it quits, you never mention them again. No pictures, no fond recollections\u2014it\u2019s as if they were never a part of your life. You\u2019re a good guy, Gabe. The bloody best man I know and you treat women with the utmost respect when you\u2019re with them, but you\u2019ve never been in a relationship that lasted longer than a month or two. And this thing with Bobbi can\u2019t really even qualify as a relationship, can it? Not when you\u2019re skulking around pretending that it doesn\u2019t even exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rich, coming from you, Chase! You\u2019re not exactly Mr. Reliable when it comes to women,\u201d Gabe retorted, feeling his temper bubbling to the surface.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s shagging my best friend, you idiot!\u201d Chase\u2019s own temper was always quicker to rise than Gabe\u2019s, and Gabe could see it sparking in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt her but you\u2019re too blinded by your own lust to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobbi knows the score.\u201d He felt driven to make his brother understand that this wasn\u2019t as bad as he seemed to think it was. \u201cAnd one of the main reasons we decided to keep this quiet was because we feared reactions like yours. The less people who know, the less external pressure from family and friends, and when it ends, there\u2019ll be no awkwardness from people who would feel compelled to take sides.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re doing it for all of us?\u201d Chase asked sarcastically. \u201cHow big of you!

He was pissed off and hurt by his brother\u2019s low opinion of him. \u201cNone. This thing between Bobbi and me sprang up out of nowhere; it\u2019s not something I went looking for. It just happened and I\u2019m trying to deal with it as best I can. So, I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d butt out. This is between Bobbi and me.\u201d</p><p>Chase looked like he was about to respond but he clamped his lips together and said nothing. His eyes were stormy and he still looked royally pissed off, but he thankfully said nothing further. Gabe knew better than to think that his brother would let it go though and he already dreaded the next confrontation.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s day didn\u2019t improve. Mike was being difficult and insisted on knowing every single detail about the Valentine\u2019s Day Ball. Since Gabe didn\u2019t know a single damned thing about the ball, trusting their assistants to get it done, his replies to the older man\u2019s questions hadn\u2019t satisfied Mike and had led to a heated debate about what each man believed leadership roles entailed. Accusing Mike of micromanaging hadn\u2019t helped the escalating argument and the man had hung up in a huff, leaving Gabe frustrated and bad-tempered. He and Mike often disagreed, but this was a petty argument, which had escalated because of Mike\u2019s misgivings about retiring and Gabe\u2019s already foul temper after that morning\u2019s argument with Chase.</p> <p>An hour later, while he was instructing Stephanie to set up a meeting with one of the GNT accounting executives about restructuring the company\u2019s pricing packages, his cell phone rang. He glanced down and grimaced when he saw his mother\u2019s photo on the screen.</p><p>\u201cI have to take this,\u201d he told his assistant and the woman politely excused herself. Gabe watched her leave before picking up the call.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mum,\u201d he greeted.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling,\u201d his mother greeted warmly. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll good here, Mum.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d His mother wasn\u2019t one to waste time before getting to the point and that was the case now. \u201cI\u2019ve been concerned about your brother. When will he be back in town?\u201d</p><p>Great. Gabe winced. He didn\u2019t want to lie to his mother, but Chase had put him in an impossible situation. If he came clean now, they\u2019d both be in the crapper.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to talk to Chase about that, Mum,\u201d he said carefully and there was a long pause before his mother replied.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a straightforward question, Gabriel. Why can\u2019t you give me a straightforward answer?\u201d Full name. Fabulous. This wasn\u2019t going to end well. Their mother knew that something was up.</p><p>\u201cI thought I did give you a straightforward answer,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you tried to divert me back to your brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your brother, Gabriel?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cMum . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018mum\u2019 me, young man. Just answer the question.\u201d Lucy Templeton-Braddock Colbert could be downright terrifying when she wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cAt home,\u201d he confessed miserably.</p><p>\u201cAnd why did neither of you see fit to inform me before now?\u201d She sounded unsurprised, which meant that she had known beforehand but had decided to put him in the hot seat for the sheer hell of it.</p><p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d he accused.</p><p>\u201cRoberta told me.\u201d Their mother had never called her Bobbi. \u201cI called her earlier to ask her about her new boyfriend and she tried to distract me too, by saying that I must be happy to have Chase back in town. This time the distraction worked because I wasn\u2019t aware that my own son was home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum, you should talk to Chase about . . .\u201d He paused as his mother\u2019s words sank in. \u201cWhat new boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject, Gabriel,\u201d she said, but he barely heard her.</p><p>\u201cMum, what boyfriend are you talking about?\u201d he asked urgently, wondering if there were any rumors floating around about Bobbi and him.</p><p>\u201cThe landscape architect she\u2019s seeing, Kyle something. I heard about him from Suzie Claiborne,\u201d his mother said dismissively before continuing on her original course of chastisement, but Gabe wasn\u2019t listening anymore. He was wondering why the hell Jason\u2019s mother seemed to think that Bobbi was seeing that Kyle guy.</p><p>\u201cGabe, are you listening to me?\u201d His mother\u2019s voice had elevated shrilly and he shook himself and refocused on her tirade.</p><p>\u201cSorry mum, I was distracted by . . . stuff.\u201d He grimaced at the lame excuse but his mother wasn\u2019t paying attention.</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019re coming around for dinner,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMum, look . . .\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t tell you that Chase is home but you have to prepare yourself. He looks . . . he doesn\u2019t look great. He\u2019s lost a lot of weight and he just seems exhausted. I think he knew that it would worry you, so try to lay off the guilt tripping, okay? I can take it but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in a great place at the moment.\u201d He and Chase may be at odds, but that didn\u2019t mean that Gabe was going to hang his brother out to dry.</p><p>His mother was quiet for a long while after he had spoken and a shuddering sigh on the other end of the line told him that she was crying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy he\u2019s home,\u201d she said, punctuating the sentiment with a wet sniff. \u201cI won\u2019t say anything about his appearance. Thank you for the warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said. \u201cLove you, Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, darling,\u201d his mother said softly. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Gabe disconnected the call and then glared off into the middle distance, thinking about Bobbi\u2019s boyfriend. What was that all about?</p> <p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re seeing that Kyle guy.\u201d Gabe\u2019s deep voice sent a shudder of longing down Bobbi\u2019s spine before she registered his words.</p><p>\u201cOh my God . . . ,\u201d she groaned. \u201cNot you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo truth to the rumor then?\u201d He asked in a strained voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a stupid question,\u201d she shot back. \u201cWhen exactly was I supposed to squeeze in a budding romance with Kyle Foster when I\u2019ve been spending my free time in dead-end shagfest with you?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence at the other end of the line.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother, Frank, and Kim are coming round for dinner tonight,\u201d he said after a while. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a late night, so it\u2019ll probably be best if you didn\u2019t come around.\u201d</p><p>Wow. That hurt more than it should have. Under normal circumstances, he would have included Bobbi in what was essentially a family gathering. So this was what it would be like after they ended their thing. They would remain friends, of a sort, but he would start excluding Bobbi from more and more of the family meals and outings until they would simply have \u201cdrifted apart.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be intentional but it would be the inexorable result of an impossible situation.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll chat with you tomorrow then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah . . . ,\u201d he said, sounding reluctant, and she winced. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got to go. Take care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d she said, forcing the words out, hating how thick with tears they sounded.</p><p>\u201cBobbi,\u201d he said, just before she disconnected, and her heart leapt hopefully. \u201cChase saw you leave this morning. He knows about us . . . our having sex. I thought you should be aware of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Chase knew? How did he feel about it? What did he think of her? Of Gabe? She wanted to ask Gabe but he didn\u2019t seem open to discussion at the moment.</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d God, he sounded so cold that it sent an icy tremor through her body. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected before she could reply, and she carefully put her phone down and unseeingly stared at the shop floor through the windows of her office. Sean and Craig were working on the Corvette and she was taking care of the paperwork as always. She bowed her head over another of the endless order forms that was piled in front of her and desperately tried to keep her tears at bay. She never cried. Never. And she refused to cry now. She had gone into this knowing full well how it would end; so crying over it would be stupid.</p><p>She picked up her pen and started to write again. She was stronger than this. She knew she was. She wouldn\u2019t cry. Not now. Not for this.</p><p>Gabe was miserable throughout dinner. He shouldn\u2019t have told her not to come around. As the time came for his mother, Frank, and Kim to head home, all he could think about was that he wouldn\u2019t be seeing Bobbi later. He thought about calling her and telling her to come by after his mother left, but he wasn\u2019t sure if she was even speaking to him at the moment. He knew that he\u2019d been a bit abrupt with her that afternoon. But once he explained the strain he had been under she would surely understand? Hearing that everyone thought that she was dating Kyle Foster hadn\u2019t really helped the situation, not when Gabe suddenly and inexplicably found himself wanting to go out and tell everybody who she was really involved with.</p><p>He ignored the small voice in the back of his mind that told him he was a selfish arsehole and instead tried to figure out how to get her to come around. He was still trying to figure it out when he kissed his mother and hugged his stepfather and sister good-bye. Chase had been quiet throughout the evening and their mother had been extremely tactful around him. All in all it had been a relatively successful evening.</p><p>He dragged his phone out of his pocket, hoping to see a message from Bobbi, but there was nothing. His heart sank in disappointment and he knew he\u2019d probably have to apologize for his earlier dickishness.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to tell Bobbi to come sneaking over?\u201d The unexpected sound of Chase\u2019s voice startled him into nearly dropping the phone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your damned business,\u201d he growled over his shoulder and Chase glowered at him.</p><p>\u201cStop telling me it\u2019s none of my business!\u201d he retorted, coming around to face Gabe. \u201cI love that girl like a sister and you\u2019re my brother. Not only is this extremely weird for me, it is totally my business. I don\u2019t want to see either of you get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice of you to show some concern for me too,\u201d Gabe said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been around the block a few times more than she has, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t stand to lose as much as she does,\u201d Chase pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Gabe asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cIf . . . when this thing goes south, you\u2019re going to lose Bobbi,\u201d Chase said.</p><p>\u201cNo, we have . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn arrangement,\u201d Chase completed. \u201cYeah, I know. You\u2019re still going to lose her and I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re unable to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Gabe maintained stubbornly, and Chase sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said tiredly. \u201cI can\u2019t decide if you\u2019re being willfully blind or deliberately stupid.

Why can\u2019t you trust me to know what\u2019s best for both Bobbi and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think you know what\u2019s best, right now, Gabe,\u201d Chase said, laying a gentle hand on Gabe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t have a low opinion of you. I just think you\u2019ve lost sight of the bigger picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d Gabe said, shrugging off his brother\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bobbi is safe from my nefarious attentions tonight. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>Bobbi didn\u2019t hear from Gabe the next day, and she tried to keep her mind occupied with work. She was running on empty from lack of sleep and food. She felt like a zombie and was functioning on autopilot. She felt alone and desperately needed to talk to someone. So when Chase walked into her shop at five that afternoon, she felt a warm tide of relief and gratitude flood through her entire being.</p><p>\u201cChase,\u201d she murmured, and dropped what she was doing to walk straight into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie.\u201d He kissed her head and it was all she could do not to melt into a messy puddle of tears. \u201cWant to get a drink somewhere?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and his arms tightened for a brief moment before he looked down into her miserable face and dropped a swift kiss on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just tell the guys to close shop early and grab my things,\u201d she said, feeling somewhat embarrassed. It was a relief that Chase knew about her and Gabe because it gave her someone to talk to, but it also made her feel incredibly shy and self-conscious. His eyes were filled with gentle understanding though and not in the slightest bit judgmental, which was something she had feared after Gabe had told her that Chase knew.</p> <p>Sean and Craig had watched the scene unfold and both looked concerned when she told them that she would be leaving early. Craig followed her to her office and watched as she shut down her computer and straightened up her desk.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, boss?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cWe noticed that you seemed off today. We were worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for asking, Craig,\u201d she said, touched by their concern. \u201cI\u2019m fine, just feeling out of sorts. You know how paperwork depresses me.\u201d</p><p>He looked unconvinced and shoved his hands into his overall pockets and swayed back and forth on his heels.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked, and she felt a surge of affection for the tough, no-nonsense man. He had a rough exterior but he was a huge softie, a family man devoted to his wife and daughters. That paternal instinct sometimes carried over in his dealings with Bobbi.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure . . .\u201d She went onto her toes and pressed a quick kiss on his cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He looked embarrassed and cleared his throat before backing away.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Anytime you need to talk . . .\u201d He left the statement open-ended and hastened out of the room. Bobbi grinned at his retreating back before unzipping her overalls and hanging them up on the hook beside the door. She rinsed her face and hands before heading back out to meet Chase.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Chase asked, when she joined him again and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou drive,\u201d she suggested. \u201cWe can come back here later to pick up my car.\u201d He nodded and led her toward the Jeep that he always drove when he was home. The Jeep belonged to Gabe, but he was always happy to let Chase use it.</p><p>Chase automatically ran ahead to get the passenger door for her and she smiled at him in appreciation as she clambered into the seat. The Jeep was like a comfortable old friend. She always felt a fuzzy sense of homecoming when she slid into its passenger seat.</p><p>When Chase climbed into the driver\u2019s side, Bobbi turned to speak to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we avoid Manny\u2019s tonight?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the mood to hang out with everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me either.\u201d He grimaced at the thought. He drove them to the nearby Hout Bay instead, which had more choices when it came to restaurants and pubs. They agreed on a place that neither had been to before, less chance of running into chatty old friends that way.</p> <p>Once they were seated and ordered their drinks, they stared at each other for a long while.</p><p>\u201cI guess you think I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d Bobbi broke the silence between them, toying with the basket of cutlery on the table.</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI think Gabe is the idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor getting involved with me?\u201d she asked miserably.</p><p>\u201cFor not telling the world that he snagged you,\u201d Chase corrected, and she raised hopeful eyes to his, not sure if he was joking. His eyes were serious and met hers without flinching, and he only broke eye contact when the server brought his beer and her gin and tonic.</p><p>\u201cYou mean that?\u201d she asked, after the smiling server had left, hating the wavering note in her voice.</p><p>\u201cDamned right I mean that,\u201d he growled. \u201cHe\u2019s made a complete mess of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry not to judge him too harshly, he\u2019s doing what he thinks is right,\u201d she said softly, fishing the lime out of her drink and dropping it onto a paper napkin. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know how to handle the attraction between us. It shocked the hell out of him, and he\u2019s still not sure how to cope with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou seem to be handling it just fine,\u201d Chase pointed out, and Bobbi flushed miserably. She focused on swirling the plastic swizzle stick around her glass, making sure her drink was thoroughly mixed, before raising her eyes back to his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had more time to get used to it. I\u2019ve been attracted to Gabe for years and I\u2019ve learned how to deal with my feelings. Gabe . . . hasn\u2019t yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears?\u201d Chase asked in disbelief, and Bobbi nodded.</p><p>\u201cYears.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never let on, not once,\u201d he said, sounding staggered.</p><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t. He thinks this is as new to me as it is to him and I feel dishonest because of that. And he would still quite happily be treating me like his little sister if I hadn\u2019t gotten drunk at a party last Friday and kissed him, so don\u2019t go thinking he seduced me or anything,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cStill, he finds that he has a previously undiscovered passion for you and his first instinct is to cover it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase, one day I was his best buddy, and the next day he was fighting to keep his hands off me.\u201d She was trying to be logical and hated herself for defending Gabe despite knowing that it would be unfair to blame him for every wrong choice. \u201cI should never have kissed him. I didn\u2019t know how he would respond and I\u2019m pretty sure I wrecked our friendship because of one reckless and stupid decision.\u201d</p><p>Chase took a long, thirsty swig of his beer before he replied.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the secrecy, Bobbi,\u201d he said, and she sighed.</p><p>\u201cI knew what I was doing when I agreed to his terms, Chase. I just didn\u2019t expect it to be so difficult. One minute I\u2019m floating on cloud nine and the next I feel . . . small and unworthy and just so stupid.\u201d Chase swore roughly and she flinched.</p><p>\u201cI want to kill him for making you feel like that,\u201d he growled, and she reached over to stroke his hand, where it rested beside his drink.</p><p>\u201cThank you but . . . he\u2019s not the one who made me feel that way. I am. I agreed to his terms, I thought I could handle it. A quick affair, that is all he has to offer. At first I thought\u2014\u201d She broke off what she\u2019d been about to say, knowing that it would only infuriate Chase further. Admitting that she\u2019d expected Gabe to want a proper relationship with her after discovering his attraction to her still made her feel ridiculously na\u00efve.</p><p>\u201cAt first you thought . . . ?\u201d Chase prompted, and she shook her head, sipping her drink to avoid replying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said with a dismissive wave of her hand, and Chase\u2019s face was a study in sheer frustration.</p> <p>\u201cBobbi, you do know that you deserve more than this shoddy treatment, right?\u201d Chase asked, and she sighed.</p><p>\u201cI know. I just spent years mooning over the guy and this seemed like the only way I could get him. I knew that it would be temporary; I knew that it would place an enormous strain on our friendship and I kind of knew that it would probably hurt like hell when it ended. Knowing all of that doesn\u2019t make the process any easier though,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cThis is such a mess,\u201d Chase said.</p><p>\u201cHmm, but it\u2019s not your mess, Chase. Gabe and I will deal with it. I need you to be my friend though, and Gabe needs his brother. We don\u2019t need you to take sides . . . please don\u2019t take sides,\u201d she said, her voice soft with entreaty.</p><p>\u201cBoth you and Gabe keep saying that you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Chase observed in a low voice. \u201cBut from where I\u2019m sitting you both look totally clueless. It\u2019s frustrating the hell out of me because it\u2019s like I can see the road ahead of you and it\u2019s leading straight off a cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see the cliff,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Gabe sees it too . . . but sometimes falling is just inevitable.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>Gabe kept checking his phone for messages from Bobbi but of course there were none. He knew that she wouldn\u2019t call or SMS\u2014not after the way he had blown her off the night before\u2014but he didn\u2019t know what her reaction would be to a call from him.</p> <p>He missed her.</p><p>Not just the sexy woman who had become his lover but the endearing friend who brightened up his days with her endless chatter about cars, her silly pranks in the past, and her quirky\u2014often insightful\u2014observations about life in general. It was after ten and he was sitting in the den, morosely staring at his phone, unsure of his next move.</p><p>Chase ambled into the room and Gabe\u2019s first instinct was to tuck the phone beneath the sofa cushions. Chase raised an eyebrow at him and Gabe flushed, feeling like a defensive teenager.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His brother shook his head and sat down on one of the recliners. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding your phone from me? Just call her. It\u2019s better than having you mope around the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moping,\u201d Gabe responded automatically, and then felt even more adolescent. Sometimes his brother brought out the worst in him.</p><p>\u201cCould have fooled me.\u201d Chase rolled his eyes, reached for the TV remote, and started to rapidly flick through the channels and every microsecond of noisy color that flashed onto the screen irritated the hell out of Gabe.</p><p>\u201cPick a damned channel,\u201d he snapped, but Chase ignored him, continuing to cycle through the channels at the speed of light. Swearing irritably, Gabe vacated the room, seeking solitude.</p><p>He settled for the patio and dropped into a lounger beside the lighted pool. For a few minutes he just sat there, listening to the sounds of the night insects and frogs chirping, croaking, and whirring as they went about their business. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just call her. He repeated Chase\u2019s words to himself. What was the worst she could do? Hang up on him? He winced at the thought. God, he hoped she didn\u2019t hang up on him. He had no Plan B.</p><p>He pushed the \u201cCall\u201d button and listened to the phone ring for a few endless moments. It rang for so long he was almost certain it would switch to voice mail, but when her breathless voice answered, he found himself both relieved and panicked.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d His mouth had gone dry and he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to respond to her greeting. He considered hanging up but . . . \u201cGabe?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Caller ID screwed him over. Of course she knew who it was.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Bobbi,\u201d he croaked, ridiculously nervous. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said after a long silence. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . .\u201d The fine hovered on his tongue and he opened his mouth to say it. \u201cI\u2019m a jerk. An idiot. A complete dick. And so, so sorry, Bobbi mine. I shouldn\u2019t have been so abrupt with you last night. But . . . I was. And that\u2019s no excuse. I have no excuse. I just hope you\u2019ll forgive me?\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cBobbi? Are you there?\u201d he asked nervously.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he told her softly, wishing he could see her. It frustrated him, not being able to see her face and read her mood.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, Gabe.\u201d There was another long silence.</p><p>\u201cAre you still angry with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t angry with you,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cWill you come around tonight?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t think so, Gabe,\u201d she said after another endless pause and Gabe\u2019s entire world started crumbling around him at the rejection. \u201cI\u2019ll be there for the football tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he responded numbly. He\u2019d forgotten about the Friday night game. The guys and their significant others would be descending on his house the following evening. \u201cFootball. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he repeated. He held the phone to his ear for a long time after she\u2019d disconnected the call before dropping his arm. He sat on the lounger, hands clasped between his knees, elbows resting on thighs, and head down as he tried to figure out what to do next.</p><p>\u201cGabe.\u201d Chase\u2019s voice startled him and he looked up to see his brother standing in front of him. Chase sat down on the lounger opposite his. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he responded honestly, and Chase sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to know she\u2019s not coming around tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing you like this doesn\u2019t make me happy, Gabe.\u201d Chase\u2019s voice was almost gentle.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, you know? I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing, Chase.\u201d Gabe hated how his voice cracked. \u201cI should never have touched her . . . but she\u2019s just so damned alluring, so completely irresistible with that quirky smile, those lively eyes, and that wicked sense of humor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do realize that you don\u2019t sound like a man who\u2019s just physically attracted to a woman, right?\u201d Chase pointed out, and Gabe frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile? Eyes? Sense of humor?\u201d Chase repeated. \u201cI was expecting tits, arse, and killer legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Gabe warned. \u201cAnd she does have all of those as well, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe, you need to figure out what you want from her and fast, before you muck things up even more than you already have.\u201d</p><p>Gabe snorted. Like he didn\u2019t know that already.</p><p>Twenty-four hours later, Bobbi nervously made her way across the lawn toward the gate. She hadn\u2019t heard from Gabe since his phone call the night before and she wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect from him tonight. She had felt awful after that awkward telephone conversation. It had been so tempting to just say yes and rush to his side again\u2014but he couldn\u2019t keep blowing hot and cold like that. It was too emotionally draining.</p><p>She crossed the threshold of the gate onto Braddock property and followed the echoing sound of masculine laughter coming from the back of the house. Gabe had a standard-sized football field, complete with lines and goalposts in his huge backyard. He\u2019d even had small bleachers built on either side of the pitch. Their friends and family only ever used the stands closest to the house and there were never enough people to actually fill them but Gabe liked symmetry\u2014so of course he had to have two sets of bleachers.</p><p>The group of men were standing around, chatting and stretching, a couple of them had pregame beers clutched in their hands. Their original group had grown to include Rick and Bryce Palmer, Pierre De Coursey, and Rick\u2019s business partner, Vuyo Mashego. Bryce was more of a rugby player and didn\u2019t take the Friday night games as seriously as some of the other men. He was one of the guys with a beer in hand, and so was his brother and Max Kinsley, a joker who didn\u2019t seem to take anything seriously.</p><p>They usually played five a side: goalkeeper, two defenders, a midfielder, and a striker. Chase saw her first and ran over to meet her halfway.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He grinned when he saw her all kitted out in her usual football gear.</p><p>\u201cHi. Are you playing tonight?\u201d she asked. With Chase there they had eleven players.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of substituting.\u201d He shrugged, not seeming particularly concerned about it. \u201cOr refereeing, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everybody here?\u201d Bobbi casually glanced around the field. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s inside,\u201d Chase told her, and she rolled her eyes, hating how obvious she was. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for Sandro. Everybody else is here. Except Billy, who called to say he\u2019d be a bit late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say wh\u2014\u201d She stopped mid-word when she caught sight of Gabe exiting the house with Sandro and Theresa in tow. He had his arm wrapped around Rosalie De Lucci\u2019s slender shoulders, and Bobbi felt like she took a blow to her solar plexus. She fought to catch her breath and couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the gorgeous couple.</p><p>Bobbi hadn\u2019t given the other woman any further thought after last Saturday. When the stunning woman hadn\u2019t been at the girls\u2019 night out, Bobbi had assumed that Rosalie De Lucci had returned to Italy. But no, here she was, showing up again like the proverbial bad penny. Gabe had his head bent toward hers, giving her his full attention as she said something to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Chase asked, following the direction of her gaze. She was vaguely aware of him tensing beside her. \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSandro\u2019s sister, Rosalie,\u201d she supplied, her voice sounding hollow even to her own ears. Theresa and Sandro finally reached the gathering beside the stands and everybody shouted out friendly greetings. Sandro was toting their sleeping toddler on his hip, he had his free arm around his wife\u2019s waist, and he drew her in for a hug and a kiss before transferring the baby to her.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Theresa prompted her husband with a laugh. \u201cRun. Be free.\u201d Sandro grinned and jogged onto the field lazily, doing a series of stretches along the way. Like Gabe, he tended to take football more seriously than Bryce and Max did.</p><p>Bobbi couldn\u2019t drag her eyes away from Gabe and Rosalie though. They had paused halfway to the field, and he was brushing her hair off her brow with a grin. The wind kept catching the silky strands and blowing it back into her face, so Gabe was fighting a losing battle. They looked like the cover of a romance novel standing there, leaning into each other with the wind in her hair and the backlights from the house delineating their shapes in silver. Bobbi would never look that perfect standing next to him. People would constantly wonder what he was doing with her. With Rosalie De Lucci they\u2019d only nod and think, Of course those two are together.</p><p>She felt Chase\u2019s arm creep around her waist and she leaned against his solid frame, needing the support.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell that\u2019s about,\u201d Chase murmured in her ear. \u201cBut it\u2019s probably not what it looks like. Turn away, before he sees that look on your face. You look like a woman who\u2019s just had her heart ripped out of her chest.\u201d</p> <p>How apt. Since that was how she felt. She allowed him to turn her toward the field and watched the men warm up. Some of them, like Sandro, Vuyo, Pierre, and Rafael Dante looked almost professional, while the rest goofed around, kicking the ball to and fro and bantering while they did it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get warmed up,\u201d Chase suggested, and she nodded, needing to find some way to distract herself from the fact that Gabe still hadn\u2019t joined them on the field. She maintained such total focus on her running and stretching that she barely noticed when someone came up to jog beside her until he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d His voice made her break stride and stumble. She would have fallen if he hadn\u2019t reached out to steady her.</p><p>\u201cGabe, I\u2019m surprised you were able to drag yourself from Rosalie De Lucci\u2019s side,\u201d she said, and then winced at how bitter she sounded. She had promised herself she wouldn\u2019t say anything but there she was putting her foot in her mouth again. She self-consciously wiped her sweaty face on the shoulder of her T-shirt before realizing how completely unsexy that must have looked. Especially in comparison with the ever-fresh, ever-polished Rosalie De Lucci.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be childish, Bobbi. Rosalie is a friend and a very nice woman on top of that.\u201d And he obviously found her attractive.</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019s beautiful though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause she is,\u201d he said impatiently, clearly done with the conversation. \u201cYou\u2019ve been warming up for a while, the guys are ready to play.\u201d He nodded toward the group of tall men standing in the middle of the field, and she felt her face flush in embarrassment. \u201cBilly isn\u2019t here yet, so Chase is subbing for whichever team picks him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded brusquely and jogged toward the waiting group, leaving him standing there. When he joined them seconds later, the team captains, Sandro and Gabe, flipped a coin to see who would have first pick of the players. Gabe won and immediately picked Bobbi. She didn\u2019t know how she felt about that; he\u2019d never picked her first before. Neither of the men ever had. She wasn\u2019t the strongest player, but she made up for it with speed and agility. Still the guys usually chose the bigger men first and the last choice always came down to Max and Bobbi, and she generally always got picked before poor Max.</p><p>They were well into the first half of the game when Billy came jogging out of the house and toward the field. He was followed by Jason, who joined their football game only occasionally and . . . Bobbi stopped so abruptly that she got a ball kicked straight in the face. The impact made her reel for a second, before she actually lost her footing and sank down on her butt. The game came to a halt as everybody gathered around her to check if she was okay. Gabe muscled his way through the huddled men and went down on his haunches in front of her, looking pale and shaken.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked in an unsteady voice, wincing as he reached out to touch the enflamed skin of her cheek. Bobbi grimaced and shied away from his hand before he could make contact. She didn\u2019t want him touching her in front of an audience because\u2014despite the stinging pain\u2014she knew that she would totally embarrass herself by leaning into his touch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She dismissed all the concerned queries and instead focused on her brother and Jason and the creative ways she planned to murder them both. They had brought Kyle Foster. Of course they had brought Kyle Foster! God, could her life be any more complicated? Last Friday she\u2019d been just another woman mooning over her handsome best friend. A week later and she was involved in a supersecret affair with said best friend and had an admirer who all of her friends and family thought was her new boyfriend.</p><p>Gabe looked like he was about to help her up, but Chase leapt in and took Bobbi\u2019s hand to tug her up. She smiled at him gratefully.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay to play?\u201d Gabe asked. She waved off his concern and trotted off to the sidelines for a quick drink of water. Billy, Kyle, and Jason joined her.</p><p>\u201cThat was quite a hit,\u201d Billy said with brotherly glee. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna look like hell tomorrow.\u201d She glared at him, or she would have if the left side of her face didn\u2019t felt so numb and swollen.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Bobbi,\u201d Kyle greeted, while Jason not so subtly elbowed Billy in the ribs and the two backed off like pubescent teens.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kyle, nice seeing you again.\u201d He winced as he looked at her face and reached out to run a gentle finger over the stinging area.</p><p>\u201cLooks painful,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts like hell,\u201d she managed cheerfully. \u201cBut you know, it\u2019s all part of the game. I lost focus for a second and took my eye off the ball. It\u2019s my own fault, really.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and she returned the smile, but when she happened to look over his shoulder it was to see her brother making kissy faces at her. She diverted her attention to the bleachers, where Bronwyn and Lisa were winking at her suggestively. Bobbi sighed and directed her eyes down at her feet, knowing that she probably appeared coy but was too afraid to meet anybody else\u2019s eye. Seriously, what was wrong with everybody?</p> <p>Gabe was furious. When he saw Bobbi go down, his entire body had constricted with fear, and he just couldn\u2019t seem to reach her fast enough. He had felt like he was running through a lake of molasses to get to her. When he had eventually fought his way through the seemingly impenetrable wall of men surrounding her, he had nearly howled at the sight of her red and swollen face. He had wanted nothing more than to sweep her up into his arms and transport her to some place where he could protect her, spoil her, and take care of her, but she had flinched away from his touch, and that more than anything else had cut him to the core. He had no claim on her. He would never have any claim on her. Some other man would one day have the right to do everything Gabe had wanted to do. But that didn\u2019t mean that Gabe had to like the thought of that future man.</p><p>He watched her walk off the field and frowned when he saw Billy, Jason, and a third man make their way over to her. Billy and Jason backed off and the third man . . .</p><p>A growl worked its way up to his throat as he watched the guy touch her. Exactly the way Gabe had wanted to touch her earlier. This guy had even less claim on her than Gabe and yet he had the utter gall to touch her? And worse she was allowing it? That well and truly pissed him off, and he stalked over to the sidelines toward them. The closer her got, the more about the stranger he recognized\u2014it looked like that Kyle Foster guy from the pub, but why the hell was he here? Who had invited him?</p><p>A fulminating glare at Billy and Jason, who were quite merrily watching Bobbi and Kyle exchange awkward pleasantries, confirmed that one\u2014or likely both\u2014of them was the culprit.</p><p>\u201cBobbi,\u201d he snapped when he reached them. \u201cAre you ready to join the game again?\u201d</p><p>She looked surprised to see Gabe standing right beside her but she nodded, and Kyle took her water bottle from her, with a promise to \u201cguard it\u201d with his \u201clife.\u201d Did the idiot think someone would steal her damned water bottle? Gabe glowered at the jerk, who merely looked back at him impassively.</p> <p>\u201cBraddock.\u201d He nodded, a small smile on his lips. Gabe refused to acknowledge the greeting, no matter how damned petty he seemed and trotted onto the field after Bobbi. The game resumed moments later.</p><p>Bobbi didn\u2019t see the hit coming. One second she was skillfully maneuvering the football through a duo of hapless defenders, and the next she was flat on her back, blinking up at the star-filled night sky and battling to suck in her next breath.</p><p>Panic set in when she realized that she was unable to draw in that breath and a distant, detached part of her brain recognized that she\u2019d had the wind knocked out of her. It was a highly unpleasant sensation that she hadn\u2019t had the dubious privilege of experiencing since childhood. Man, she was having a really terrible night.</p><p>\u201cBobbi?\u201d A group of concerned faces popped into her field of vision, and she tried to assure them that she was fine, but only a wheeze emerged from her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Kinsley?\u201d Gabe\u2019s face was hovering on her left and he fixed a glare on Max, who seemed to be hovering on her right. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the frikkin body check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slipped,\u201d Max explained defensively. \u201cIt was totally unintentional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could have been seriously injured, she\u2019s just a tiny thing,\u201d Gabe pointed out insultingly. If Bobbi had her breath back she would have taken exception to that, but she was barely getting in a decent gasp of air every few seconds and it took all of her concentration to breathe normally again.</p><p>\u201cOh come, Gabe. She can handle herself.\u201d Bobbi lifted a limp hand and gave Max a thumbs-up in agreement.</p> <p>\u201cSee?\u201d Max pointed toward her. Bobbi mentally rolled her eyes and cursed them for worrying about her in theory but not in practice. Neither of them had even bothered to ask her if she was okay. Feeling neglected, she pushed herself up into a sitting position and gingerly prodded her ribs to ensure that they were still intact. She grimaced. They were a bit sore but it was nothing major. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabe and Max were so focused on each other they barely noticed when she shakily made her way to her feet. The other players were all too caught up in the unfolding drama of Gabe and Max squaring off to pay much attention to her. She always felt like a little person in the land of giants when she stood amongst all of them like this. It didn\u2019t help that she found herself practically sandwiched between Gabe and Max. They were the tallest guys there.</p><p>The men were both bristling with outrage and an overabundance of testosterone, and Bobbi hissed impatiently before placing a small, restraining hand on each of their chests. She wrinkled her nose in disgust as her hands settled onto equally sweat-soaked T-shirts and tried not to appreciate the well-defined musculature of the chests beneath the revoltingly wet shirts. Especially not Gabe\u2019s; she was trying very hard not to appreciate Gabe\u2019s chest too much. It felt like every time she took one step forward she took about eighty-seven steps back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she asserted firmly, trying very hard not to sound wheezy, knowing that it would set Gabe off again. He looked down at her and his eyes went flat with fury.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he gritted. \u201cShe\u2019s bleeding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am?\u201d she asked blankly, hesitantly reaching up to touch her face. She blanched when her fingers came away covered in blood. \u201cOh my God, I am!\u201d Bobbi was tough and could withstand quite a lot of things, but she couldn\u2019t stomach the sight of her own blood. Anybody else\u2019s? Sure! Her own? Not at all.</p><p>She swayed woozily and Gabe reached out a hand to steady her. He ducked his head to peer into her eyes intently.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d he advised, and she complied with a shallow gasp.</p><p>\u201cDeep breath, Bobbi,\u201d he repeated authoritatively. Nope. She couldn\u2019t get her lungs to work and she swayed again, as black dots swirled in front of her eyes. God, how embarrassing! She felt like she was about to faint. She vaguely wondered how she knew that, when she had never fainted in her life before. Gabe swore beneath his breath and shifted one of his arms to her back and the other to the back of her thighs before hefting her up to his chest like a sack of potatoes. He carried her to the sidelines, where the other women had all anxiously gathered around and lowered her gently to the grass.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Gabriel, is she okay?\u201d Bobbi blinked up into the worried faces around her, recognizing the voice as Theresa\u2019s. Her friend knelt down on the grass beside her and pressed a towel to the profusely bleeding cut on Bobbi\u2019s eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Gabe reassured. \u201cThe sight of her own blood makes her a bit queasy.\u201d Of course he would know that embarrassing fact about her.</p><p>\u201cTake care of her, will you?\u201d Gabe handed her care over with one last grim look down at her before trotting back out onto the field.</p><p>Theresa sucked in a shocked breath, and Bobbi looked up at her in alarm. Was the cut worse than it seemed? Was that why her friend seemed so appalled? But Theresa wasn\u2019t even looking at her; the other woman\u2019s eyes were fixed on something on the field. Bobbi watched as her friend cringed and followed the direction of her stare to whatever was happening out on the field. The guys were all huddled in a tight circle, and Bobbi couldn\u2019t quite make sense of what was going on.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she asked, her injury forgotten.</p><p>\u201cGabe and Max just got into a bit of a shoving match.\u201d Theresa, usually so kind and gentle, seemed to find that fact hilarious.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. That idiot,\u201d Bobbi moaned, pushing herself up unsteadily before standing up on wobbly legs. Theresa held on to her arm, obviously afraid Bobbi would lose her balance. She shook off the remnants of her dizziness like a dog shaking off water and marched purposefully back onto the field.</p> <p>The other guys had managed to separate the two men and Gabe was standing off to the side with Sandro. He was still glaring at an unconcerned Max, who was ignoring him and calmly chatting with Chase. It was clear from the handsome Italian\u2019s stance that Sandro was trying to keep Gabe calm.</p><p>\u201cSandro, would you excuse us please?\u201d Bobbi planted herself between the two men, and Sandro shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the grill started. I think maybe my Theresa is hungry. I say this match is probably over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, getting the braai started is a good idea. I doubt any of us are in the mood to finish this game,\u201d Bobbi agreed, and Sandro walked off to where Theresa stood waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Bobbi turned on Gabe, who was watching her with a moody expression on his face. His brow lowered at the sight of the blood on her forehead and the rapidly forming bruise on the left side of her face. Bobbi knew she looked awful but wished that fact wasn\u2019t so clearly reflected in his disgusted expression.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust look at the state of you! How am I supposed to even consider having a real relationship with a woman who wears overalls to work, hasn\u2019t styled her hair in years, never wears makeup, and has grease under her fingernails? And then there\u2019s this tendency of yours to get into the weirdest bloody situations. You get hurt and bruised and scuffed up. How am I supposed to deal with that, for God\u2019s sake? I can\u2019t keep you insulated against the entire world. I just can\u2019t. How would you fit into my life? Where would I even put you?\u201d The words were despairing and made no sense to Bobbi. She was just so astonished by this meltdown from a man who was used to keeping his cool. \u201cI need someone else, someone who knows how to dress and handle herself in public, someone who won\u2019t show up at events with questionable bruises . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease just stop, Gabe. Before you say something that we can\u2019t come back from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d His voice was edged with panic. \u201cWe\u2019re already done . . . When we were just friends, your rough and tumble ways didn\u2019t bother me half as much. The way things stand between us now? I just can\u2019t watch you get hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop hurting me.\u201d Her quietly wailed plea seemed to register and the panicked glaze left his eyes to be replaced by a different kind of alarm. She shoved against his chest with both hands with enough strength to send him staggering back a step. The rest of the group was trying to maintain a discreet distance but she could see that they were all hovering close by, probably not sure if they should intervene or not. \u201cJust stop hurting me! Because that\u2019s all you\u2019ve been doing. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough for you. Did you think I was ever unaware of that fact? But, I swallowed my pride and allowed you to hatch this insane arrangement\u2014God I hate that word so much\u2014between us. Any romantic notions I had about you died that night in my father\u2019s den. Because I was imagining a real relationship with you, while you were trying to fix it so that we could shag regularly without anybody ever finding out.</p><p>\u201cI felt small and cheap and stupid but I allowed it because I knew that it was the only way I could have you. I knew it was my one chance to be with you.\u201d Her eyes were burning with the tears she refused to shed. Gabe looked completely shell-shocked and his own eyes were suspiciously bright. \u201cAnd that\u2019s on me. I should have refused but I was in love with you. I had been for years and I knew that it was the best damned offer I would ever get from you. I told myself if that was all I could get of you then I\u2019d take it, but you know what? I deserve more than that. More than you and I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken me this long to figure that out.</p> <p>\u201cI deserve a real relationship with a man who loves me for who I am. Grease, calluses, unstyled hair and all. I\u2019ll never be good enough for you and I refuse to twist myself up in knots over that anymore\u2014because you know what? You\u2019re not good enough for me either. If our so-called friendship has to be sacrificed as a result of all this, then so be it because right now I don\u2019t know why the hell I ever considered you such a good friend in the first place.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the look of slack-jawed distress on his handsome face and turned on her heel to stalk off the field. She brushed past the men who still stood around in stunned silence, then toward the women\u2014her friends\u2014none of whom she dared look at for fear of bursting into tears. Billy and Chase both looked like they wanted to say something, but she held them off with a shake of her head. They retreated tactfully and she was grateful for that.</p><p>She was so distraught that she was halfway home before she noticed the tall man silently shadowing her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not great company at the moment, Kyle,\u201d she whispered, trying very hard to keep herself together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that,\u201d the man said calmly. \u201cI just figured that if you wanted to talk it would be best to do so with someone who won\u2019t feel obligated to see \u2018both sides of the story\u2019 so to speak. Someone who\u2019s one hundred percent in your corner and has no loyalty whatsoever to the other guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re that guy, are you?\u201d she asked softly. If she didn\u2019t feel so completely gutted, she would have been charmed by him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that guy,\u201d he affirmed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk though. I\u2019m just walking you home.\u201d They were at the gate and out of sight of the football pitch when she turned to the tall stoic man with a wobbly smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome.\u201d The three words were delivered so gently that Bobbi couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. This man didn\u2019t know her; he didn\u2019t know that she never cried . . . so it was perfectly okay to cry all over him. When her tears came, he made a deep, comforting sound in the back of his throat, folded her in his arms, and simply let her weep.</p><p>Gabe watched her walk away . . . and felt a staggering sense of loss that nearly sent him to his knees. There had been a chilling finality to her words that terrified him.</p><p>She was in love with him? How could she be in love with him? They were friends. They had always been friends. Even after this physical thing between them had popped up out of nowhere, Gabe had never doubted that one truth. So how the hell could she have been in love with him? For years? How could his friend have hidden something like that from him for so long? Did he even know her at all?</p> <p>If he had had access to that one important piece of information, he would never have suggested a no-strings sexual arrangement between them. He would have known that it would hurt her too much. He would have backed the hell off . . .</p><p>He would have run scared.</p><p>And that was why she had kept it from him. She knew him better than he knew her. She knew that he wouldn\u2019t have handled the whole love thing well at all. Why would she tell him when it would probably have destroyed their friendship? He sighed heavily\u2014the deep inhalation of breath intensifying the ache in his chest\u2014and acknowledged that the friendship was pretty much destroyed now anyway. Neither of them had handled the situation particularly well and Gabe knew that he bore the brunt of responsibility for it. He had just lost it when he\u2019d seen her take that body blow from Max and then the blood. He felt vaguely nauseated just recalling it. He had absolutely hated the sight of her blood. It had brought out a primal protective instinct that had made him want to pummel Max into the ground. He didn\u2019t understand it, but it had made him irrationally angry with both Max and with Bobbi for constantly putting herself in harm\u2019s way. How the hell was he supposed to take care of her when she was always doing things that could get her hurt? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t know what was going on with him. He had never felt more lost and confused than he did at this moment. He was still standing in the middle of the football field and staring off in the direction Bobbi had taken. Kyle Foster had gone with her. He felt irrationally angry about that. Who did that guy think he was? He blindly moved to follow them, but Chase moved into his path. His brother\u2019s stance was nonconfrontational but immovable, nonetheless, with arms crossed over his chest and legs braced shoulder length apart.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Gabe. You\u2019re not thinking rationally and whatever it is you\u2019re planning to do right now will most likely be ill-advised. Let her go for now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hurt her,\u201d Gabe confessed helplessly. \u201cI tried so hard not to hurt her but I did anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Chase said, and his body language changed, softened. His hands dropped to his sides and his chest heaved.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do I do now?\u201d Gabe asked, and Chase hooked a hand around the back of Gabe\u2019s neck and tugged him closer until his mouth was next to his brother\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cYou leave her alone until you figure that out,\u201d Chase advised\u2014his voice a low growl. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t figure it out, then you let her go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p> <p>The Corvette looked amazing and she handled like a dream. Bobbi stood back and examined the grand old dame with misty eyes. Jason would be picking her up in half an hour, and Bobbi felt like a parent sending her child off to school for the first time. Her proud sense of accomplishment was accompanied by a bittersweet pang of loss. She had put so much into this project, both financially and emotionally.</p><p>It had helped keep her mind off Gabe, who hadn\u2019t called, e-mailed, or SMS\u2019d since that awful night nearly two weeks before. Bobbi couldn\u2019t believe that she hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to him in so long. She felt so empty, like she was missing a piece of her soul. The longest they had gone without speaking before had been a week and that had been because Gabe had been in a part of Africa that had little to no cell-phone reception and dodgy Internet connections.</p><p>She saw Chase quite often, but even that was starting to get painful because he was looking healthier by the day, which meant that he and Gabe were starting to look identical again. Even though Bobbi hadn\u2019t ever confused one for the other, the physical resemblance was still hard to deal with. She tried her best not to let Chase see how much it hurt her sometimes to look at him.</p><p>She wiped away a smudge on the car\u2019s gleaming red bonnet, talking to it all the while.</p><p>\u201cHe has promised to take really good care of you this time. He\u2019ll take you out on lovely scenic drives, and he\u2019ll have you washed and serviced regularly. I know you\u2019re scared that he\u2019ll just leave you to gather more rust and dust, but when he sees you he\u2019s going to fall in love with you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss?\u201d She turned around to see Pieter, fully recovered from his unfortunate case of measles. He was slouching as usual with his hands shoved into his overall pockets.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a phone call.\u201d He jerked his head toward her office, and Bobbi gave the Corvette one last polish before retreating to her office. She had managed to clear some of the paperwork off her desk over the past few weeks\u2014one of the very few perks of having a broken heart.</p><p>\u201cBobbi Richmond,\u201d she greeted absently, preoccupied as she remembered that she had wanted to check the radiator hose on the Corvette one final time. She was sure that it was fine but even new hoses could be flawed and Bobbi was a perfectionist when it came to her work.</p><p>\u201cHello, Bobbi.\u201d She was so busy hunting for a pen to write down a reminder to check the hose that the voice didn\u2019t register at first. When it did, she forgot all else and sank down into her ancient office chair, her legs suddenly losing their ability to support her.</p><p>\u201cGabe,\u201d she murmured. She wasn\u2019t sure how else to respond.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked, his voice revealing absolutely nothing of what he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Busy.\u201d There was a long pause.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to ask you something,\u201d he said, only after the silence had stretched past the point of painfully awkward. There was more excruciating silence as he waited for a response from her. She swallowed and refused to make this any easier for him than it had to be.</p> <p>\u201cUh . . . anyway. I was wondering if you would do me the honor . . . I mean, if you would grace me . . .\u201d His voice faded away and her eyebrows leapt up into her hairline, she was so stunned by his uncharacteristic lack of eloquence. He cleared his throat. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d go to the Valentine\u2019s Day event . . . with me.\u201d The words emerged on one breath and practically merged together he said them so swiftly.</p><p>Bobbi\u2019s jaw had dropped and she wasn\u2019t quite sure she had heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked unsteadily.</p><p>\u201cWill you go the Valentine\u2019s Day Ball with me?\u201d he repeated, his voice more measured now but still with a slight wobble. Bobbi\u2019s fingers tightened around the receiver uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she whispered, her throat tight with tears.</p><p>\u201cI . . . miss you. I want you back in my life. I want us to, you know, do it right this time and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She interrupted whatever he\u2019d been about to say, her voice vehement. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more about what you want, Gabe. I can\u2019t go to the ball with you. I have a date. And even if I didn\u2019t have a date . . . I wouldn\u2019t have gone with you.\u201d She paused for a moment to allow that to sink in. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019m busy right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She replaced the receiver back in its cradle with the utmost care and blindly turned away from her desk. She wouldn\u2019t allow him to creep into her life only to make her feel inadequate again. She was determined to be stronger than that.</p><p>A date? The knowledge filled Gabe with panic. Was he too late? Had somebody else snatched her up while Gabe had sat around feeling sorry for himself? The thought was unbearable.</p><p>He studied the surface of his meticulously arranged desk. Just the way he liked it\u2014everything neatly stowed away. Not a paperclip out of place. Bobbi had been the only bit of chaos in his life, but he now found that without her, his well-ordered life was . . . bland. He missed his lover and he missed his friend. He had foolishly tried to keep those two facets of her in separate boxes and it had naturally backfired on him. He was damned well going to do this thing right from now onward. Amateur hour was coming to an end.</p><p>Bobbi started monitoring her calls after that. After that football night, she hadn\u2019t expected him to hear from again for a long time and that phone call to the shop had rattled her immensely. She had Craig on phone duties, knowing that he would be vigilant about not letting any calls from Gabe slip through the cracks. She ignored any calls to her cell phone from him and simply came home too late for him to call the house.</p> <p>His messages started to pile up over the next few days. Voice mails clogged up her cell-phone inbox and handwritten notes from her father were left outside her bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cPlease call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed you. Please call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you again. Please call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me.\u201d</p> <p>And on and on it went. The voice mails he left on her cell phone were more detailed:</p><p>\u201cI know I hurt you. I just want a chance to make it right. I miss you. Please call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobbi, I miss you. Call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d answer my calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this (he never elaborated on what \u201cthis\u201d meant) in a message. I need to speak with you. Let me know when it\u2019ll be convenient for me to call you or see you.\u201d</p><p>It was driving her crazy. At her previous girls\u2019 night a few days before, each woman said she\u2019d had at least one message from Gabe. They never urged her to call him though. They merely relayed the messages and then carried on as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Nobody had forced her to talk about it. They respected her silence on the matter. And she was eternally grateful for that.</p> <p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re home.\u201d Her father met Bobbi at the door when she let herself in that evening. He looked flustered and annoyed.</p><p>\u201cDad? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d She stepped past her agitated father and tried to drop her messenger bag carelessly onto a side table in the foyer, as she usually did. A huge bouquet of white roses resting on the tiny table thwarted the automatic gesture. She frowned and glanced around, looking for a different table, but they were all covered in gorgeous bouquets of white roses.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said blankly.</p><p>\u201cYes, oh,\u201d her father groused. \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did they come from?\u201d she asked, wondering if there had been some kind of planning mishap with the Valentine\u2019s Day thing. She knew that their theme was red and white\u2014so original\u2014maybe they had miscalculated the number of white roses they needed?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re for you,\u201d he said pointedly, and her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you and Gabe have had some kind of tiff and if this is any indication, he feels terrible about it.\u201d Her father knew nothing about what had happened between Gabe and Bobbi. Thankfully Billy had kept his mouth shut about the incident at the football match, even though her brother had futilely tried\u2014on numerous occasions\u2014to open up a dialogue with Bobbi about it.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re from Gabe?\u201d She knew her voice sounded flat and if her father\u2019s frown was any indication, he didn\u2019t understand why she wasn\u2019t more enthusiastic about the floral \u201capology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are . . .\u201d He nodded. \u201cGabe called after the first delivery and asked me to grab the card out of one of the bouquets and to be sure that you received and read it.\u201d</p><p>That sneaky rat! He knew that if it had been up to her the card would have been tossed into the bin unread, but by involving her father, Gabe had made it impossible for her not to read it. She took the pretty cream card from her father and glanced down at it. Gabe\u2019s bold handwriting slashed across the surface of the small square of paper, and it took her a second to decipher the elegant cursive script.</p><p>Did you know that white roses signify new beginnings? I was hoping you\u2019d appreciate that sentiment. Please turn over for more . . .</p><p>She refused to smile at the polite instruction on the bottom of the tiny card. Anybody else would have been satisfied with an abbreviated PTO, but Gabe, of course, had to write a properly structured and well-mannered sentence. She turned over.</p><p>These roses are white</p><p>Most violets are blue (well they\u2019re actually violet but for the purposes of this poem we\u2019ll say blue)</p><p>Bobbi, my sweet</p><p>I really miss you</p><p>(I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really bad at poetry\u2014G)</p><p>She covered her mouth with a hand as she tried to stifle the half laugh, half sob that threatened to bubble up from her throat. This was . . . what was this? She didn\u2019t even know what he meant to achieve with this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going up for a shower, I\u2019ll see you at dinner,\u201d she said, folding her hand around the card and feeling the expensive bond paper cut into her palm. Her father\u2019s face fell when she made no mention of the card\u2019s contents. After she reached her room, she put the card onto her dresser and meticulously smoothed the creases out of the stiff paper. She read the words one last time before tearing the card up into four squares and tossing them into her dresser drawer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a quick shower, she decided to call Chase. He answered his cell phone almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cTell him to stop this,\u201d she said, seething, before he\u2019d even had a chance say hello.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cChase, tell him to stop! I\u2019m not amused.\u201d She hung up and tossed the phone aside.</p> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d Chase asked Gabe, who was sitting in the den, staring at the muted television.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Gabe asked, looking up from the dancing couple on the screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you watching?\u201d Chase was momentarily diverted by the garish costumes and blindingly white smiles.</p><p>\u201cSome competition about vaguely famous people learning ballroom dancing, I think.\u201d Gabe shrugged listlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you watching it with the sound turned down?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe music is terrible,\u201d Gabe said before going back to Chase\u2019s original subject. \u201cWhat did you mean by that first question?\u201d</p><p>Still staring at the screen in horrified fascination, Chase stumbled around the back of the sofa and sat down next to Gabe.</p><p>\u201cBobbi just called me.\u201d That snagged Gabe\u2019s interest and he sat up\u2014wondering how pissed off she had been by his gesture. He knew her well enough to know that she wouldn\u2019t have been happy, but it would have gotten her attention at least.</p><p>\u201cShe wants you to stop. She\u2019s not amused.\u201d Pretty much what Gabe had expected and he felt a reluctant smile tug at the corners of his mouth. He hadn\u2019t felt like smiling in weeks, but one angry message from her and he felt like a drowning man who had been thrown a lifeline.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Chase asked curiously\u2014his eyes glued to the screen. The whirling couple had stopped dancing and now seemed to be standing in front of a panel of excitable judges.</p><p>\u201cI sent her flowers,\u201d Gabe said, and Chase choked before turning to stare at Gabe in complete disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d His brother seemed at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cRoughly twelve dozen white roses. I imagine she\u2019s pretty pissed off right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew she\u2019d be angry why did you send them?\u201d Chase looked baffled.</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew that it would prompt a reaction from her,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cShe\u2019s been ignoring my calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSending flowers was a pretty public thing to do,\u201d Chase commented.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope so,\u201d Gabe said fervently. Chase merely studied him for a beat before allowing another gaudily outfitted couple on TV to distract him as they took to the dance floor.</p> <p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve seen that guy before,\u201d he said, grabbing the remote control from the coffee table. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy from that early nineties archery action movie. Remember? We loved that movie when we were kids. What was the title?\u201d</p><p>Gabe squinted at the screen and snorted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember. We begged Mum to enroll us in archery classes after that,\u201d Gabe recalled.</p><p>\u201cAnd she stuck us in bloody ballet classes instead.\u201d They both winced at the memory. Thankfully the ballet classes had only lasted a couple of months; their mother had been forced to remove them after the instructor complained about the eleven-year-old twins\u2019 obstructive behavior. They had spent more time ruffling tutus and switching up everybody\u2019s toe shoes than they had paying attention to the lessons.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the title of that movie?\u201d Gabe wondered aloud. Bobbi would know\u2014she was awesome at remembering movie trivia and she had loved the movie as much as they had. At six years old she had still been young enough to score a plastic bow and arrow set with sucker cups on the ends of the arrows. She had had a fabulous time pretending to be the lead in her own action movie, constantly ambushing them when they least expected it. Gabe smiled at the memory. God, he missed her so much.</p><p>\u201cDamn, how much work has this guy had done?\u201d Chase leaned forward to peer more closely at the C-list actor who had once been a hero to them. Gabe grimaced at the plasticky sheen to the man\u2019s skin. Chase turned the sound up and they both recoiled at the terrible rendition of \u201cYesterday\u201d that the live band was offering up as an accompaniment to a halfway-decent waltz.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not too bad.\u201d Chase was completely riveted by the dancing on the screen and Gabe left him to it. The music was too distracting and Gabe wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to sit and watch television.</p><p>He went up to change into his swim trunks and spent a couple of hours relentlessly swimming laps in the hopes that it would tire him out enough to sleep through the night. He hadn\u2019t had a decent night\u2019s sleep since that last night with Bobbi and it was starting to wear him down.</p><p>On his way up to bed two hours later he passed the open door of the den and was surprised to see Chase still sitting there watching that same god-awful dancing show. It amused him enough to go into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still watching this?\u201d he asked. Chase barely acknowledged him, keeping his eyes glued on the screen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a marathon. Ssh,\u201d he shushed urgently. \u201cThey\u2019re leading up to a double elimination!\u201d Rolling his eyes, Gabe turned and exited the room. The dramatic music reached a crescendo and the announcer\u2019s voice rang out to be instantly followed by both boos and cheers.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, that\u2019s crap. She was the better dancer out there!\u201d Chase yelled, and followed that diatribe up with a string of colorful curses. Gabe left him to it and made his way upstairs, his mind back on Bobbi and his next plan of action. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh dear God.\u201d Bobbi watched helplessly as an endless stream of deliverymen carried in basket after basket of fresh flowers. She had tried to send them back, but the guy in charge had shrugged and told her that since the flowers were paid for there was nothing he could do except deliver them. If she wanted to return them or send them elsewhere she would have to take it up with his boss. Craig and Sean flanked her and Pieter stood slightly behind her as they watched every surface of their workshop get covered with pretty purple hyacinth and pink rose bouquets. The only reason the flower-illiterate Bobbi even knew the purple flower was a hyacinth was because of the card one of the deliverymen thrust into her hands. She had glanced down instinctively and had been caught off guard by the distinctive script on the paper:</p><p>Did you know that purple hyacinths are the perfect flower for begging forgiveness? And pink roses signify my admiration for you (I\u2019m not making this stuff up. Google and Wikipedia are truly my allies here) \u2014G</p><p>His handwriting had gotten increasingly cramped as he ran out of space on the small square of paper and this time only an arrow was there to indicate that she should turn over. She stubbornly refused to do so. And shoved the card into the breast pocket of her overalls instead.</p><p>\u201cThis is pretty embarrassing, boss,\u201d Sean groused. \u201cWe\u2019re an auto shop, not some flower shop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that!\u201d Bobbi snapped. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Sean backed off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell you don\u2019t have to say everything that pops into your head, Sean! Especially not something so perfectly obvious.\u201d She glared at him and he shrugged again, wisely choosing not to respond.</p><p>\u201cSo what are we supposed to do with this stuff?\u201d Pieter asked in that surly way of his, sending death stares at the pretty flowers cluttering up their workspace.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss, do you suppose I could have one of these bouquets for Ellie?\u201d Craig asked hopefully. \u201cShe\u2019s a bit angry with me at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do this time?\u201d Sean asked, and Craig shook his head, lifting his baseball cap to scratch at his slightly receding hairline.</p><p>\u201cTake my advice, son, there is no right answer to the question, \u2018how big is my bum in this skirt?\u2019 especially not if she asks you to rate the size from one to ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if you say one?\u201d Sean asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best to lie through your teeth. Whatever you think the answer is, subtract at least a hundred from it. I thought three and a half was being generous. I mean the woman had three children, for chrissakes! You\u2019d think she\u2019d have been happy with a three and half.\u201d</p><p>Bobbi was too distracted by the stupid flowers and Gabe\u2019s message to pay any attention to the back-and-forth banter between the two men. She told them to help themselves to bouquets for their girlfriends, mothers, or wives and then retreated to her office. It wasn\u2019t quite the escape she\u2019d hoped for, not while she could still see the flowers brightening up the place. Gabe\u2019s card was burning a hole in her pocket, and she resisted it for a few more minutes before tugging it out. She reread the message on the front before reluctantly flipping it over to have a look at the back:</p><p>Violets are purple</p> <p>You know that it\u2019s true</p><p>Without you in my life</p><p>I truly am blue</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d she whispered. The words blurred as she fought back angry tears. She itched to call him, even if just to beg him to stop this, but that was what he wanted. He wanted her to call him, to acknowledge him, and she needed more time to get over him. It was going to take a while before she had hardened her heart enough to be in his proximity again.</p><p>She knuckled away the stupid tears and decided to have the flowers delivered to old-age homes and hospitals. Maybe if she just continued to ignore him he would stop whatever it was that he thought he was doing.</p><p>Two nights later she came home to find the house inundated with the garish combination of iris and orange rose bouquets. Her father glared at her when she trudged in wearily after a tough day.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on between you and Gabriel\u2014you\u2019re both being so stubbornly close-mouthed about it\u2014but I am getting sick of the both of you languishing around me in despair and this . . . endless procession of flowers has got to stop. It\u2019s wreaking havoc with my allergies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have allergies, Daddy,\u201d Bobbi pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cI damned well will by the time the two of you come to your senses. I don\u2019t know what this fight was about, but Gabriel is running a multimillion-dollar corporation, and he\u2019s worse than a damned teenager these days. I want my efficient and cold-as-ice CEO back right now. And I tell you what: I\u2019m getting damned sick of your moping around too. So you and he had better fix this ridiculousness as soon as possible. Watching the two of you carefully avoiding each other is depressing as hell.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything and her father threw up his hands in frustration before thrusting the inevitable card into her hand.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your card,\u201d he growled before stalking off toward his man cave.</p><p>I know this combination is a bit loud but did you know that irises represent eternal friendship? And the orange roses embody my desire for you.</p><p>I know I\u2019m a terrible poet but I hope you\u2019ll read my latest attempt on the other side of this card \u2014G</p><p>Friendship and desire? That left them in pretty much the same boat as before. The separation between the two roles was too large and Bobbi was so done with being torn between the role of good friend and lover. She sighed, bowed down to the inevitable, and flipped the card over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Your eyes are pretty</p><p>Your lips are too</p><p>Bobbi, my darling</p><p>I\u2019m miserable without you</p> <p>She examined the card for a long time before carefully tucking it into one of her jeans pockets. A headache was forming above her brow, and she slunk up to her bedroom, deciding to forego dinner in favor of a good night\u2019s sleep.</p><p>\u201cBobbi,\u201d her name was whispered directly into her ear and Bobbi sighed, before murmuring a protest and turning over in bed. \u201cBobbi, wake up.\u201d</p><p>She groaned and batted at the person hovering above her. Her hand made contact with warm flesh.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d She frowned at the muffled exclamation and opened her eyes in confusion. The light was still off and she could just make out the dark silhouette of the man in her room outlined against the slightly lighter backdrop of the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . .\u201d She sat up and clutched her comforter to her chest, staring at the large figure in fright. \u201cWho . . . ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSsh, don\u2019t panic,\u201d the very familiar voice whispered frantically. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe? What are you doing here? Who let you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to come in through the window, like in the old days.\u201d He and Chase had often climbed the rose trellis below her second floor window and snuck into the house when they were children, and the three of them would then slink into Billy\u2019s room and they would spend the night playing. By the time Faye would come to wake them up in the morning, the four of them would be piled on Billy\u2019s bed, fast asleep, which had always resulted in a severe scolding from their parents, but it had never deterred them from doing it again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d She gasped, and could just make him shaking his head in the gloomy light.</p><p>\u201cI think your security guys would probably have had me arrested if I\u2019d attempted it. No I came in through the front door and your dad very happily told me where to find you\u2014after ordering me to get rid of the orange and purple \u2018monstrosities\u2019 that were stinking up his house.\u201d His voice was warm and engaging, clearly inviting her to join in his amusement, but Bobbi was too appalled by his presence in her room to feel anything other than alarm.</p><p>\u201cMy dad knows you\u2019re up here?\u201d she squeaked. \u201cOh God!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Gabe soothed. \u201cFirstly, you\u2019re not exactly a teenager sneaking her boyfriend into her room, and secondly, your dad doesn\u2019t know that I have licentious designs on your hot little body, now does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t,\u201d she agreed bitterly. \u201cWhy would he? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s anything you wanted people to know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond to that and the silence seemed much too oppressive in the dark room. Bobbi reached for the lamp switch and flooded the area directly around the bed in a small pool of warm, yellow light. She still couldn\u2019t see him clearly because he sat just outside the tiny circle of light, but she knew that he could see her and she immediately felt at a disadvantage.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked, keeping her voice cold as she folded her arms self-consciously across her chest.</p><p>\u201cTo see you.\u201d The unspoken duh following those three words was so clear that he might as well have said it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you. I want you to leave,\u201d she said in her most authoritative voice. It lost its impact somewhat when the speaker was wearing a Daisy Duck nightshirt.</p><p>\u201cWho are you going to the Valentine\u2019s Day Ball with?\u201d he asked unexpectedly, and she lifted her chin defiantly.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d she informed haughtily.</p> <p>\u201cKyle Foster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if I am?\u201d She wasn\u2019t going with Kyle; she had politely informed the man that while she liked him, it just wasn\u2019t fair of her to keep seeing him when she was in love with another man. It would be like doing to someone else what had been done to her, and she understood the pain of unrequited love and passion too much to inflict it on someone else. He had very graciously conceded her point and had backed off.</p><p>\u201cI would rather you went with me,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not. I\u2019d hate to embarrass you in front of your colleagues with my lack of dress sense and grimy fingernails,\u201d she said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored to have you by my side,\u201d he said, after a pause.</p><p>\u201cWould you now?\u201d she scoffed. \u201cWhat if I chose to wear a tank top and jeans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why you would,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cYour dad wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh so you\u2019re banking on me looking semi-respectable because I wouldn\u2019t want to embarrass my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobbi, I know that what I said the other night hurt you, but you have to admit . . . the way you dress sometimes just wouldn\u2019t suit my lifestyle.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed painfully.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s best if we just aren\u2019t together,\u201d she said pragmatically, attempting to disguise the pain in her eyes by lowering her gaze to the comforter. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly fit into your life and you won\u2019t fit into mine. I was never interested in the elegant dinners and the fancy events that my dad hosted when we were growing up. I\u2019m still not. I wouldn\u2019t have the faintest idea how to speak to some of the people you deal with. You were right, we were just never meant to be more than friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cYou implied it when you said that the way I am never bothered you when we were just friends. If being with you in a more intimate capacity means changing who I am, then I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too big a sacrifice for me to make.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo I am the one who has to make all the changes? That hardly seems fair,\u201d he declared.</p><p>\u201cWhat changes? I haven\u2019t asked you to change a single thing about yourself for me!\u201d She was outraged that he\u2019d implied as much.</p><p>\u201cOf course you have,\u201d he dissented. \u201cExpecting me to not care about the appearance of the woman by my side goes against everything I believe in. I like order and you know that. I like everything to be neat and in its place. Where would I slot you in, if your role in my life changed? And don\u2019t get me wrong, Bobbi, I want your role in my life to change. I want to give us a real chance . . . but we have to come to some sort of compromise here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by compromise you mean I change my hair, my clothes, my way of life just for the honor of what exactly? Being your girlfriend? Your mistress? And you, of course, would compromise by . . . ?\u201d She left him to fill in the blank but he remained silent, and she snorted in bitter amusement. \u201cI suppose your great compromise would be getting to tolerate a less than perfect bit of arm candy for the couple of months it\u2019ll take you to work me out of your system. And when it does end, you go trotting on your merry way to pick your next conquest in your search to find a woman perfect enough to be Mrs. Gabriel Andrew Braddock and I go back to my shop feeling publicly humiliated for not being good enough to snag the great Gabriel Braddock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it would be.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound very convincing at all. \u201cI think we have a real chance at something special, it just took me a while to see it. I want us to be together and I want us to go into a relationship with hope for a future together rather than the expectation of failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d she asked, and despite the gloom, she could see that he was visibly startled by the question.</p><p>\u201cOf course I love you,\u201d he blurted, sounding offended by the question.</p><p>\u201cOkay, allow me to rephrase the question. Are you in love with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly a fair question, Bobbi,\u201d he retorted. \u201cYou know that your confession that night threw me. You can\u2019t expect me to return your feelings just because you actually happened to verbalize them to me. It\u2019s not something that can be switched on just like that. What I\u2019m asking is that you give me the chance to fall in love with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd while you\u2019re busy deciding if I\u2019m someone you can fall in love with, I\u2019m just supposed to put my feelings on hold? What sort of timeline are you looking at? Will a month or two be enough for you to figure out whether I could be worthy of your love? Six months? A year? And what if\u2014after all that time\u2014you didn\u2019t fall in love with me? Do you think it\u2019s fair that I risk even more heartbreak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of questions that I just don\u2019t have the answers to,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll work, I\u2019ve never found myself in this position before. You\u2019re so damned important to me and I\u2019m terrified of losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give me a chance to get over this thing we had and we can go back to being friends,\u201d she said after a very long moment. \u201cThat way everybody\u2019s a winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that,\u201d he snapped, losing patience. \u201cI want more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to give you more. I won\u2019t change who I am for you, Gabe. I just won\u2019t, and if I\u2019m really as important to you as you claim, you wouldn\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to change . . .\u201d He seemed to be speaking through clenched teeth. \u201cI just want you to wear a damned dress on occasion, go to a bloody hairdresser, have your nails done. You\u2019re a woman, for God\u2019s sake. These things aren\u2019t hardships.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be equating a visit to the salon with selling your soul to the devil.\u201d He threw his hands up in despair, and she stared back at him with equal misery. He didn\u2019t seem to understand that she was afraid that in the middle of all this makeover crap, he would fall in love with someone who simply didn\u2019t exist, a Bobbi of his own invention. The prospect scared the hell out of her. If that happened she would be trapped playing a role for the rest of her life. She couldn\u2019t do it, not even for Gabe.</p><p>\u201cI think you should leave,\u201d she said tiredly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t achieving anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cJust stop the Campaign of Crazy with the flowers, please. You\u2019re driving everybody nuts. I can\u2019t be held responsible if my father or the guys at the shop hunt you down and force feed you roses.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled in response to that quip.</p><p>\u201cI really do miss you,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just in my bed . . . I miss you in my life. Please come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease just go, Gabe,\u201d she softly commanded, hardening her heart against the quiet plea.</p> <p>He got up and wavered for so long that she feared he would come over and kiss her. He did take one hesitant step forward before abruptly turning on his heel and leaving.</p><p>Bobbi fought the impulse to run after him and surrender to his terms. It was the way she had always lived her life. She had gone from girl desperate to please and impress her father and big brothers to a woman futilely focused on trying to please just this one man, and she had to fight against the instinct to give him exactly what he asked for, even if it was detrimental to her own heart and sanity.</p><p>It took everything she had and then some, but she managed to fight against her instinct and emerge triumphant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>When the delivery van showed up at the shop two days later, Sean and Pieter groaned and Craig rubbed his hands together at the prospect of more free flowers with which to butter up his wife. Apparently she had been very forgiving after that last time. Bobbi, in the meantime, was utterly dismayed that Gabe had so completely ignored her plea that he stop sending her flowers.</p><p>She stood waiting with her arms folded defensively over her chest. It was the same delivery guy as the last time but he didn\u2019t have a cavalcade of trucks following him or an army of guys to carry in the flowers this time. When he saw Bobbi\u2019s stance, he shrugged and grinned.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d just sign the delivery slip I\u2019ll get your stuff and be on my way.\u201d Bobbi heaved an exasperated sigh and reached for the clipboard.</p> <p>Bobbi watched him turn back to his truck and withdraw a cellophane wrapped basket from the back of the van. The thing was huge and looked heavy, but he managed to carry it into the shop and drop it onto one of the closest work surfaces with a heavy thud.</p><p>\u201cI was told to personally hand this over to you,\u201d he said, stopping in front of Bobbi on his way out and holding out a familiar card to her. \u201cYou should tell your boyfriend to put these cards into envelopes, ma\u2019am. More private that way.\u201d Which meant that\u2014she peered at the faded stitching on the breast pocket of his shirt\u2014Quinton here had probably read the card. Along with whoever else had handled the order. She had a feeling that Gabe didn\u2019t put them in envelopes because he knew that once she caught even the slightest glimpse of what he had written she wouldn\u2019t stop reading. If it were in an envelope it would be too easy for her to toss it thoughtlessly aside.</p><p>She ignored Quinton, who shrugged and whistled as he returned to his truck. Pieter, Sean, and Craig had gathered around the cellophane-wrapped basket curiously.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a fruit basket? Or chocolates maybe?\u201d Sean asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping for perfumes and lotions and stuff. Ellie would love that,\u201d Craig inserted. Pieter cracked his bubblegum and glared at the basket like it had mortally offended him.</p> <p>\u201cYou gonna open it, boss?\u201d Sean asked when she just stood staring at the gigantic basket with dread. What if it was \u201cperfumes and lotions and stuff.\u201d How would she cope with something so obvious? She absently looked down at the card in her hand and read it slowly.</p><p>I fully confess to making the following up but since it\u2019s what I want them to mean, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll grant me some leeway. So, did you know that pliers are symbolic for two people coming together? And (true story) wrench is something my heart does every time I see you? \u2014G</p><p>She was baffled by that message and turned the card over, hoping for some clarity.</p><p>Drill bits are sharp</p><p>Handsaws are too</p><p>A grease streak or two</p> <p>Are beautiful on you</p><p>She rapidly blinked away the tears that suddenly flooded her eyes and glanced up at the large basket at which the guys were still poking and prodding. Tucking the card safely into her pocket, she walked over to where they were trying to discern the contents through the layers of dark-blue cellophane.</p><p>She dragged off the ridiculous pink bow, tore off the crisp plastic, and gasped when she saw what he had given her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned.\u201d Craig sounded both awed and disappointed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool,\u201d Sean whooped. Pieter snorted and turned away to amble back to the old hatchback VW he was servicing. The other two men also drifted off to their tasks and left Bobbi to stand and gape at the tool bouquet in front of her. Brand-spanking-new hand tools\u2014probably worth thousands\u2014arranged quite prettily in one of those round baskets usually reserved for floral arrangements. A complete set of screwdrivers were fanned out in the back, with pink\u2014pink for heaven\u2019s sake\u2014rubberized handles facing up and sizes arranged from small to large. There were wrenches, levels, hammers, pliers . . . everything a girl could ever ask for from a set of tools. Everything accentuated in the prettiest pink. Gabe must have gone to great lengths to obtain them, and Bobbi found herself ridiculously touched by the gesture.</p><p>And then there was that silly little rhyme. It had hit all the right notes, and it scared Bobbi how quickly a part of her heart had melted. He could so easily sneak past her defenses when she wasn\u2019t looking, especially if he kept doing things like this.</p><p>When Gabe drove up to Bobbi\u2019s shop later that day, the place was busier than usual. He could barely find space to park amongst all the cars in the lot waiting to be serviced. He had seen the masterful work she had done on Jason\u2019s Corvette\u2014the car was unrecognizable from the heap he had seen on her shop floor a month ago and Jason was like a new dad with the damned thing. As Jason promised he told everybody who asked and, even those who didn\u2019t, where his car had been restored and had even put a sticker endorsing her shop in the rear window of the car. It looked like the advertising was paying off, judging by the amount of cars in the lot. Gabe was proud of Bobbi and ashamed for doubting her. He had known how much his skepticism had hurt her and that his misgivings had read as a complete lack of faith. It was probably another thing she had added to his list of flaws.</p><p>He walked into the bustling shop; Craig, Sean, and Pieter were busy with a different car each and Bobbi was in her office in earnest discussion with a debonair-looking older man. She didn\u2019t see him, and not wanting to interrupt the flow of her conversation, he wandered over to Craig, who was peering into the innards of an ancient-looking Jeep.</p> <p>The man glanced up when Gabe came to stand beside the car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d Craig said tersely before tugging at something beneath the bonnet of the sick old beast. A spark plug maybe? Gabe was unashamedly clueless when it came to the inner workings of cars.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Gabe returned the greeting, and then stood in silence and watched him work.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the flowers,\u201d Craig said after a conversational hiatus that had been filled with nothing but the sound of hammering and grinding machinery and rock and roll coming from the CD player stashed in a corner out of harm\u2019s way.</p><p>Gabe grinned at the man\u2019s temerity.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m glad you liked them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife, Ellie, did. It got me off the sofa that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you on the sofa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks I said her bum was big,\u201d the man glowered and tugged at his ear. \u201cDidn\u2019t. I gave her a three and a half on a scale of ten. Ten apparently being gigantic.\u201d</p><p>Gabe winced.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brave man, Craig. I would have gone with a zero or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured three and a half was a good size, not too big and not invisible. No man likes an invisible bum.\u201d Gabe wondered why they were standing here discussing the man\u2019s wife\u2019s behind, and he had a feeling that if the inimitable Ellie ever heard about it, Craig would be back on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the flowers helped. I caught a glimpse of the card too,\u201d he unapologetically admitted. \u201cYou should put those things in envelopes if you want privacy. I liked the forgiveness and admiration stuff. Used that on the missus. She was very impressed. Figured I owed you a thank-you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I could be of some help,\u201d Gabe said with a complete lack of sarcasm. He had known that Bobbi would find some way to disperse of all those flowers; it naturally followed that she would have offered some to every person she knew. He had hoped that she would keep at least one bouquet of each for herself though, but a quick glance around the shop told him that he had hoped in vain.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not into the flowery stuff,\u201d Craig said, accurately reading Gabe\u2019s glance around.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Gabe admitted, irritated that Craig seemed to think he knew Bobbi better than Gabe did. \u201cBut the messages that came with the flowers were what I really hoped to get across.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow the stuff you sent her this morning,\u201d Craig muttered, leaning into gaping maw of the Jeep again and twisting at something. He grunted with effort as he continued to twist for what felt like hours, leaving Gabe hanging in suspense. Craig finally stood upright again and nodded down at the car in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the stuff I sent this morning?\u201d Gabe prompted impatiently and Craig looked at him with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat was a stroke of genius.\u201d He nodded in approval. \u201cShe loved it, even though she tried to pretend that she didn\u2019t.\u201d He gave Gabe a perusing glance before sighing and removing his filthy baseball cap. He rubbed a hand briskly back and forth over his short, messy hair before sticking the cap back onto his head.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I ever liked you,\u201d he admitted, his voice gruff. \u201cWith your fancy suits, always waiting outside on the rare occasions that you picked our girl up from work. Figured you were scared of getting your posh shoes and pretty clothes dirty. I can\u2019t trust a man who\u2019s afraid of a bit of grease . . .\u201d Gabe strove to remain unoffended by the less than sterling character assessment, hoping that there was a \u201cbut\u201d in there somewhere. \u201cBut I reckon you\u2019re not so bad.\u201d</p><p>Gabe waited for the rest, but Craig seemed to be done talking. Well, faint praise was better than no praise he supposed as he watched Craig turn back to the car. It seemed that the man was done talking to him and, feeling comprehensively dismissed, Gabe walked over to the where the youngest guy, Sean, was working.</p><p>\u201cHe-ey,\u201d the young man said with the exuberance of a puppy. \u201cIt\u2019s the boss\u2019s boyfriend. What\u2019s up, bru?\u201d</p><p>He unselfconsciously held out a grease-covered hand and Gabe took it with barely a flinch. He reminded himself that he had hand-sanitizer in the car and if he was going to be squeamish about this stuff he\u2019d lose major points with Bobbi and just prove her point about them being unsuited.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d Sean was leaning in conspiratorially. \u201cI was thinking: Miz R loves chocolates and dried fruit and stuff. You should totally consider sending her stuff like that.\u201d Gabe bit back a laugh at the transparency of young Sean\u2019s ploy. He was just hoping for the bounty to spill over onto him, as it no doubt had with the flowers.</p> <p>\u201cDid you give the flowers to your girlfriend as well?\u201d Gabe asked, smiling, and Sean grinned before nudging Gabe with a friendly elbow.</p><p>\u201cI have three girlfriends, and they all loved the flowers.\u201d Three. Gabe could barely cope with (or keep, for that matter) one. Ah, the vitality of youth. He stifled a laugh and glanced up to see that surly Pieter guy staring daggers at him. Wondering what that was all about, he excused himself and walked over to Pieter\u2019s workstation.</p><p>\u201cHave I offended you in some way?\u201d he asked directly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the boss is a nice lady; she don\u2019t need some player playing her!\u201d The words were delivered with a bit of heat and a lot of ice.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I\u2019m not playing her,\u201d he told the skinny man, who had a three-inch height advantage on him.</p><p>\u201cYou can use your fancy words and all, but she\u2019s too good for you.\u201d</p><p>Gabe reflected on his previous sentence, wondering which of the seven words had been too \u201cfancy\u201d for Pieter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cShe is too good for me, but I\u2019m trying to become someone worthy of her.\u201d</p><p>Pieter\u2019s pale-blue eyes narrowed assessingly, and Gabe kept his stance open and his eyes level. Gabe watched the fight go out of the other man\u2019s bearing.</p><p>\u201cYou should stop sending her flowers. It\u2019s not her thing,\u201d Pieter said. Yet another guy who thought he knew Bobbi better than Gabe did. If Gabe weren\u2019t so heartened by the fact that her employees obviously liked and respected her enough to fight for her, he would have been beyond annoyed. Besides, Bobbi had never received flowers from anybody precisely because they thought that she wasn\u2019t someone who would appreciate them. But she was a woman underneath the overalls, he knew that better than anybody else, and despite everything, he suspected that deep down inside she had loved the flowers\u2014maybe not the excess of them, but definitely the sentiment behind the gesture.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been mentioned before,\u201d he said. He heard her voice and leaned to the side to see her past Pieter\u2019s lanky bulk. She was leading the customer out of her office, her voice brimming with excitement. He wasn\u2019t close enough to hear her words above the noise of the shop but whatever she was saying, she was damned enthusiastic about it.</p> <p>She shook the man\u2019s hand and waved him off as he climbed into his car and drove off. After the car had turned the corner that would take him out of sight of the shop, she pumped her fist in the air and did a happy shimmy.</p><p>He could tell exactly when she first caught sight of his car, because her body language tensed immediately. She turned slowly and even with the light behind her he could see her flinch.</p><p>\u201cGabe,\u201d she said, her voice wobbling a bit.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he asked without preamble, and she nodded warily, indicating that he should follow her into her office. He dusted off the same chair he\u2019d occupied the last time and saw that his handkerchief came away slightly less grimy this time. He noticed, as he sat down, that she had put the tool bouquet on a low filing cabinet next to her desk. She saw his attention drift to the basket and cleared her throat awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tools,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t keep them. They must have cost a fortune.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cI have a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want you to spend it on me. That\u2019s not your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into this right now,\u201d he dismissed. \u201cI\u2019m not taking the tools back; I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with them. Use them or don\u2019t. Give them away to your employees like you did the flowers, although I don\u2019t imagine they\u2019d be happy using pink tools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were way too many flowers,\u201d she said, blushing guiltily. \u201cI had to do something with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the men certainly appreciated them. Did you know that kid has three girlfriends?\u201d He shook his head in disbelief, and she grinned in spite of herself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to get caught at some point and it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d She laughed, sounding so much like her old self that his heart constricted with longing. She caught herself and the laughter faded in her throat. \u201cSo what can I do for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy car needs a tune-up,\u201d he lied, and her eyes flew to the Lamborghini. She had been itching to get her hands on\u2014or rather inside\u2014it for months now. He could see that she was torn. He had never used her shop in the year that it had been in business and even before that, when she had been tinkering with cars just for fun, he had never allowed her to lay a finger on any of his vehicles.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s making this weird knocking noise every time I change gears.\u201d Another lie. The car handled like a dream, but he was willing to let her take it apart from top to bottom if it would make her happy and score him more brownie points with her.</p><p>\u201cIs it like a hollow clunking sound?\u201d she asked with a thoughtful frown.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, it could be worn gear linkage, but that seems like an unlikely problem for a car under a year old,\u201d she speculated. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve ever tested her capabilities much on the road, so it can\u2019t be from wear and tear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll take a look?\u201d he asked, trying not to sound too eager. Her eyes were watchful but she nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Craig to have a look,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d rather you did,\u201d he said, because he knew how much she was itching to.</p> <p>\u201cI have other things to take care of,\u201d she maintained, her eyes filled with longing as they tracked back to the car. But it was clear that she wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of accepting this latest gift\u2014because that\u2019s what it was. He was giving her something that she had dying to have for months and . . . she was throwing it back in his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you that I trusted only you to take care of my car?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you that it\u2019s too late . . . you should have placed your trust in me long before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being this way?\u201d he asked in frustration. \u201cWhat the hell did I do to you that was so damned awful? Okay so I wanted to keep our relationship a secret at first, I handled the situation badly, but punishing me for having human failings is petty as hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m being petty? When you were ashamed to admit that you found me attractive and that I was your lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just be completely honest here, Bobbi! You\u2019re punishing me because I\u2019m not in love with you. I have the audacity to want you without craving all that romantic and sentimental bullshit as a side dish to the incredibly hot sex. I respect you and I care about you, but that\u2019s not enough for you. I don\u2019t love you the way you want me to so to hell with me, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re absolutely right. I expected too much from you. But, what do you want from me, Gabe?\u201d she asked gently. \u201cWhy have you been sending me flowers and poems and presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to . . . romance you, I guess,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cTo what end?\u201d she asked logically, and he watched her mutely. He wasn\u2019t sure how to answer that question. \u201cTo get me back into bed? To get me to forgive you for hurting me? To apologize for what you said at the football match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s say you succeeded in romancing me, what would the next step be? We go to the ball together, right? And then start a relationship that we both know would be doomed from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this,\u201d he suddenly hissed. \u201cStop talking to me like I\u2019m a preschooler. Yes, I wanted to romance you, I wanted to apologize, and I wanted to have a proper relationship with you. One that involves spending time together, enjoying each other\u2019s company, and sex. Because I believe that we can be good together. And if it doesn\u2019t last, it\u2019s because that\u2019s the way relationships go sometimes. Grow up, Bobbi. Sometimes all a couple has going for them is the sex, which can grow into mutual fondness, which can then become that damned Grand Passion that all women seem to aspire to. We\u2019re lucky, we used to have a pretty good friendship to build a solid foundation on, in addition to better sex than most people have in a lifetime. Everything else will either fall into place or it won\u2019t. But you want that happily ever after right now. And if you don\u2019t get it, like a petulant child, you\u2019re hell-bent on spoiling the chance we have to explore something that could actually be quite good between us.\u201d</p><p>He had a valid point, Bobbi realized. So he wasn\u2019t in love with her, but he did love her and that really was more than most couples had going for them. He looked hurt and disgusted with her and she could understand how he felt, but all the concerns that she had voiced that night in her room were still there. There was the fear that he would expect her to change too much in order to conform to his idea of the feminine ideal. The fear of more heartbreak\u2014but she acknowledged that the chance of heartbreak was a risk in every relationship\u2014it was part of life. But while most other relationships had a chance of ending well, this one was almost doomed to failure, despite Gabe\u2019s grand talk about it possibly growing into something more. But balancing out the fear was the hope that even when it didn\u2019t work out, the relationship would die a natural and relatively painless death and leave them both still with a mutual respect and love for each other. Gabe wanted to try and despite all her misgivings\u2014Bobbi now knew that she wanted to try as well.</p><p>\u201cI have been punishing you,\u201d she admitted, and his eyes jerked up to hers. \u201cYou mean the world to me, Gabe, and I hated that I didn\u2019t mean the same to you. I just . . .\u201d She choked up and bit her lip as she tried to get herself under control again. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the ball together and see where that takes us, but I\u2019m not promising anything beyond that.\u201d He nodded, his face remarkably grim for a man who had just received what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cThe other thing I can\u2019t promise you is some major change in appearance,\u201d she warned. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do this, you\u2019re going to have to accept me the way I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBobbi, you\u2019re beautiful the way you are,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou always have been. I apologize if I ever made you feel less than that. But I hope you\u2019ll deign to wear a bra at the very least\u2014there will be a lot of stodgy old men in attendance, and we wouldn\u2019t want any coronary incidents.\u201d</p><p>That startled a laugh out of her and he looked pleased. Which sparked an epiphany in her: all these years of trying to make Gabe laugh or smile and she only now realized that he had put an equal amount of effort into surprising laughter and smiles out of her as well. And, she acknowledged to herself, he enjoyed doing so.</p><p>\u201cSo do you really want your car checked? Or was that just an excuse to come here?\u201d She asked, and he smiled. One of those full-on, genuine smiles that she loved so much.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted to see how you liked the tool bouquet and the car was my foot in the door. Besides, I know you\u2019ve been itching to get your hands on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want her checked?\u201d She couldn\u2019t quite hide her disappointment and Gabe\u2019s smile gentled.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I hear you have quite the reputation for restoring and fixing vintage and exotic cars,\u201d he teased, and she felt a surge of pleasure at his words.</p> <p>\u201cDid you see her?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to that former clunker of Jase\u2019s, then yes, I saw it. You did an amazing job. Congratulations.\u201d She could see the unmistakable gleam of pride in his eyes and it warmed her from top to toes.</p><p>\u201cThat man who was in my office earlier?\u201d She had to share the news with someone and she was suddenly excited to tell Gabe. \u201cHe has a 1969 Mustang convertible. She\u2019s in decent condition but he wants me to service her, and even better? He belongs to an owner\u2019s club! If I treat his baby well, he\u2019ll recommend the shop to some of the other owners in the area. Isn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is bloody brilliant, sweetheart.\u201d He grinned, taking a step toward her and unexpectedly capturing her chin between his thumb and forefinger. He kissed her then, in full view of her employees and anybody else who might walk into the shop. It was a gentle kiss but filled with a longing and desire that matched hers\u2014just his lips on hers and the tip of his tongue tracing along the parted seam of her mouth. He lifted his head with a soft sigh and dragged his eyes open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI needed that,\u201d he said, and she smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cI did too. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Roberta Richmond, are so very welcome.\u201d He spontaneously wrapped his arms around her and gathered her up in a tight hug. She returned the hug fiercely, so happy to have him back in her arms and in her life. They still had a list of problems a mile long, but she refused to worry about them right now. She just wanted to enjoy the perfection of this moment.</p><p>\u201cHave dinner with me tonight?\u201d he asked, and she lifted her head from his chest to meet his hopeful eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He smiled, looking relieved, and dropped another sweet kiss on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at five thirty,\u201d he informed before reluctantly releasing her. He turned to leave and Bobbi studied his broad back dreamily for a moment before remembering something.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>His wide shoulders tensed, and he slowly turned back to face her. His expression was filled with anxiety, and she wondered if he expected her to change her mind. \u201cYou need a replacement car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course.\u201d The naked relief on his face was telling and Bobbi felt a pang in her chest at his uncertainty. They were each going to feel unsure around the other for a while yet. She hoped it was something they could overcome soon.</p> <p>\u201cYou can drive mine until yours is ready to be picked up. Sean can drop me off at home tonight.\u201d She tugged the keys from her baggy overall pockets and tossed them at him. He caught them with a grimace of distaste. \u201cOh come on, she\u2019s not that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobbi, you\u2019ve had that thing since you were eighteen,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd she still runs like a dream,\u201d Bobbi lifted a challenging eyebrow and Gabe sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve kept her in perfect condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being such a snob.\u201d She grinned. \u201cShe may not be as pretty as your Lamborghini but she\u2019s got quirk and character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit to finding quirk and character a lot more interesting that mere good looks these days,\u201d he said with a warmth that left no doubt as to his sincerity.</p> <p>Gabe\u2019s heart melted when Bobbi\u2019s entire face lit up like a beacon in response to his last comment. He hadn\u2019t meant the words to be a metaphor for his changing attitude toward superficial good looks but that was certainly how she had taken it, and he found himself thinking of ways to keep that radiant smile on her face forever if he could.</p><p>After Gabe rang the doorbell at the Richmond house later that evening, he nervously smoothed down his hair, adjusted his tie, and did a breath check while waiting for someone to open the door. It wasn\u2019t long before the door was yanked open by Billy. Gabe tried not to look too dismayed to see his friend; he hadn\u2019t expected Billy to be visiting his family. He usually only visited Constantia on weekends. For him to be there on a Thursday night was unusual.</p><p>Billy stared at Gabe for an arrested moment before stepping aside to let him in. Gabe hadn\u2019t seen him since that football night nearly a month ago, and he soon discovered why. Billy slammed the door shut and turned to face Gabe with a furious expression on his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly know what the hell went on between you and Bobbi that night, Gabe,\u201d he hissed without any preliminaries. \u201cBut you hurt her and it was only because Chase asked me to back off and give you both space that I haven\u2019t pushed the issue or kicked your arse before now! I\u2019m warning you . . . hurt her again and, years of friendship aside, I will rearrange your face in the most painful way possible.\u201d Billy had always had such a colorful way with words.</p><p>\u201cI know I hurt her . . . It was never my intention to do so. You know how much she means to me,\u201d Gabe murmured. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying to figure this out, we both are, and I\u2019d like to ask you to give us the opportunity to do so without any interference from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure what out? What exactly is going on between you?\u201d Billy asked, and Gabe inhaled unsteadily, acknowledging that this was it\u2014the point of no return.</p><p>\u201cBobbi and I are . . . um.\u201d He coughed. \u201cWe\u2019re dating.\u201d Billy\u2019s jaw dropped and he shook his head as if to clear it before gaping at Gabe in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the . . . Gabe, she\u2019s like a sister to you, man!\u201d Billy looked horrified, repulsed, and frankly disbelieving.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not,\u201d Gabe responded succinctly. \u201cShe\u2019s not like a sister to me. At all. I don\u2019t feel anything remotely brotherly toward her, and you\u2019d better resign yourself to that fact before she comes down those stairs. I won\u2019t have you making her feel uncomfortable about our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am uncomfortable with it,\u201d Billy admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s weird as hell. Where did this come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know,\u201d Gabe confessed. \u201cBut that\u2019s how it is, so get over it and don\u2019t even think about showing that appalled face to Bobbi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes my dad know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think he\u2019ll feel about it?\u201d Billy asked pointedly, and Gabe fixed a grim look on him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really give a damn how he feels about it or how you feel about it. This is between Bobbi and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Billy growled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Gabe responded. \u201cBut Bobbi does . . . so try not to put unfair pressure on her, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my own counsel, for Bobbi\u2019s sake,\u201d Billy said after a pause. \u201cBut what I said before? About rearranging your face? Forget that. You break my sister\u2019s heart and I\u2019ll destroy you, Gabe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabe nodded curtly.</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>Bobbi had heard the doorbell five minutes ago but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to go downstairs. She checked her appearance for the umpteenth time and morosely concluded that it was still the same. She was wearing her navy-blue, all-purpose dress combined with her favorite tribal jewelry and a pair of flat sandals, which were the only pair of shoes she owned that looked even remotely feminine.</p><p>\u201cThis is a mistake,\u201d she whispered, feeling sick. \u201cOh God, what are you doing, Roberta?\u201d</p> <p>There was a soft knock on her door, and her stomach sank into her ugly sandals.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she called faintly. When the door opened to reveal Billy instead of Gabe, she slumped in relief.</p><p>\u201cGabe\u2019s here for you,\u201d her brother said, his voice strangely gentle.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming down?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSoon,\u201d she whispered. He turned as if to leave but changed his mind and came to stand beside her, staring at her reflection in the full-length mirror.</p><p>\u201cThis must seem odd to you,\u201d she said, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with him, you know,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI have been for a long time. He doesn\u2019t feel the same way about me and that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it okay?\u201d Billy asked softly and her lips trembled.</p><p>\u201cHe loves me and he . . .\u201d She blushed, this was her brother after all. \u201cHe uh . . . likes me in that way, but he\u2019s not in love with me. For now, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen will it stop being enough?\u201d Her brother, usually such an obnoxious joker, was being remarkably sweet and understanding and his concern brought a sting to her eyes and warmed her heart.</p><p>\u201cWho knows? Maybe it will always be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you content with merely enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d she repeated with a decisive nod.</p><p>\u201cJust be happy, Runt.\u201d Her brother smiled and gently leaned his shoulder against her until she lost her balance and nudged back with a laugh. \u201cNow are you coming downstairs or not? Your date seems rather nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d That thought was so far beyond the realms of possibility that it boggled her mind for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYep. I left him in the den with Dad. Last I saw, he was trying to explain that he was here to take you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, what did Dad say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he got it. He asked Gabe where he was taking you; I left Gabe to sweat it out and came up here to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date?\u201d Gabe was getting the full, formidable Mike Richmond death stare and he finally knew what all the man\u2019s business competitors had felt like just before their downfall. The man was certainly a force to be reckoned with, but Gabe had never had that force turned on him before.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you sent her all those flowers? You were courting her?\u201d An old-fashioned word that made Gabe wince guiltily when he thought about what those flowers had really been about. Courting? That would have been like shutting the gate after the horse had already bolted.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Gabe admitted, keeping his hands folded respectfully in front of him and his eyes level. Don\u2019t show any sign of weakness, he reminded himself. Mike Richmond pounced on weakness.</p><p>\u201cSo what was that if not a courtship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn apology,\u201d Gabe confessed. \u201cWe\u2019d had an argument about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a lover\u2019s spat?\u201d he asked genially, and Gabe swallowed, sensing a trap.</p><p>\u201cJust an argument,\u201d he maintained.</p><p>\u201cHow long has this thing been going on between you and Bobbi?\u201d The older man came right out and asked the question Gabe had been dreading.</p><p>\u201cNearly a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is the first time you see fit to come to my door like a gentleman and take her out? What have you been doing before now?\u201d The man\u2019s voice had turned to ice, and Gabe cleared his throat uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened before now is in the past, Mike. I see no reason to revisit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou treat my little girl with respect, Gabriel.\u201d Mike looked absolutely furious with him and Gabe knew that the man\u2019s anger was completely justifiable. \u201cYou\u2019ve both been carrying on doing God knows what for weeks now and she\u2019s clearly been miserable! So you show her the respect she deserves from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Gabe nodded. \u201cYou have my word on that.\u201d</p><p>They heard the murmur of Bobbi\u2019s and Billy\u2019s voices outside the door, and after giving him one last warning look, Mike turned to face the door as it swung inward to reveal his two youngest children.</p><p>Gabe looked up too and was helpless to prevent the smile that curled his lips when he caught sight of Bobbi. He kept his eyes on her pretty face, not wanting to acknowledge that familiar, ugly dress of hers until he absolutely had to. She looked nervous and when she met his eyes; he winked at her to put her at ease. He made his way to her side and put his arm around her waist, laying an unmistakable claim before he looked up to meet first her father\u2019s and then her brother\u2019s eyes, arranging his expression to show them nothing but absolute possessiveness. His message was unmistakable: Mine.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>He took her to a four-star restaurant at the Hidden Valley wineries in Stellenbosch. Bobbi had heard about the place, of course. It was one of the top ten restaurants in the country, with excellent food, wine, and absolutely incomparable scenery. It was nearly an hour-long drive to the place, but they managed to get there in time to be seated, just before sunset, at a table that overlooked the entire valley. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty here,\u201d she said reverently, and he reached across the table to cover her hand with his. They sat in silence and watched the sky catch fire and go from gold to scarlet to deep crimson and then fade into shades of pink, purple, and violet. The clouds were daubed in lighter pinks and lavenders and looked like a painter\u2019s palette above the spectacular Helderberg Mountains.</p><p>The waitstaff remained at a discreet distance, allowing them to enjoy the sunset and only after twilight had fallen over the valley, did they come and take their order.</p><p>Gabe kept staring at her, throughout their starter course of delicious chilled asparagus velout\u00e9, and Bobbi self-consciously fiddled with the stem of her wineglass. She took a sip of the refreshing Semillon to calm her nerves and was aware of the fact that her hands were shaky.</p><p>\u201cStop staring,\u201d she whispered, and he grinned.</p> <p>\u201cI was waiting for you to call me out on that,\u201d he admitted with that irresistible charm that she found so lovable about him.</p><p>\u201cWell, why do you keep doing it?\u201d she demanded, keeping her voice low.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so damned gorgeous and I\u2019m still trying to figure out how I never saw it before.\u201d He shook his head in disbelief. She smiled shyly and rolled her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe because you were always too busy staring at all the beautiful women in the room,\u201d she said pointedly, and he thought about it for a moment before nodding.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d he acknowledged, before quite deliberately looking around the room at all the elegant, lovely women seated at the other tables. \u201cWell, none of those present here tonight, so I guess I\u2019m stuck staring at you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a liar,\u201d she groaned, and his eyes went deadly serious.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cThere\u2019s really no other woman here tonight that I\u2019d rather be looking at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lay it on so thick,\u201d she said, trying to keep the cynicism out of her voice. \u201cI know you\u2019re trying, Gabe. But there\u2019s no need to pretend I\u2019m something that I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Gabe bit back a frustrated groan and smiled at her. It was going to take work to convince her of his sincerity, he knew that\u2014but it was worth the effort. He wanted this to succeed. He had honestly thought that her dress and the ugly jewelry and the truly horrific sandals, all of which he had seen on so many other occasions, would bother him. But after that first glance, he had barely given them any other consideration\u2014all he saw was her radiant skin, her luminous amber eyes, and her pink mouth with that plump lower lip. And, of course, that short and messy cap of hair that he always longed to run his fingers through. He wondered how out of line it would be to drag her home with him tonight\u2014mere hours after her father had warned him to treat her with respect. He respected her all right: her mind, her heart, her sexy body, and her ability to drive him crazy in bed.</p><p>They finished their starter and for her second course Bobbi had ordered the mushroom vol-au-vent with a pinot noir, and Gabe, who absolutely despised mushrooms, went for the gnocchi, sweetbread, and sage saut\u00e9, accompanied by a delicious chenin blanc.</p><p>\u201cChase has become weirdly obsessed with some reality TV show about B- and C-list celebs learning how to ballroom dance.\u201d He remembered what he\u2019d been dying to tell her before. She choked on her wine before looking up at him with wide eyes.</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s even rooting for some of the contestants. He\u2019s been watching marathons and back seasons.\u201d Bobbi did a slow, disbelieving blink that he found inordinately adorable before she dissolved into unladylike snorts of laughter. Gabe loved watching her laugh, she always put her whole body into it\u2014he used to tickle her when they were kids just to hear it. He especially enjoyed the cute snorts that went with the convulsive giggling. As he watched her erupt, he realized that he hadn\u2019t heard her laugh like this in too long and that it had been wholly his fault.</p><p>\u201cI know that show,\u201d she said between gasps. Her giggles were starting to attract glances from the other tables. Some people seemed entertained by her amusement; others looked haughty, and Gabe found that he didn\u2019t give even the slightest damn about what any of them thought. She was a bloody delight to behold, and people could bask in her radiance or go to hell.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s totally hooked,\u201d Gabe said dryly. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll come home one of these days to find him practicing the cha-cha-cha with Letty.\u201d That set her off again and this time her laughter was so infectious that Gabe joined in with a few wry chuckles.</p><p>\u201cTruth be told, I\u2019m happy he\u2019s found a diversion,\u201d Gabe said after the laughter had faded to just the occasional snicker from Bobbi. \u201cI think he has lacked focus since he\u2019s been home and I\u2019ve been concerned about him going into some kind of depression, but weirdly enough this TV show seems to be the distraction he requires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs a break, Gabe, and maybe this is his way of switching off his brain for a bit,\u201d she offered and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I thought,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s hard to imagine him watching something so fluffy.\u201d Chase had always been into the hard-hitting news programs and documentaries.</p> <p>\u201cI prefer it to him watching anything remotely connected to the Middle East right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrified he\u2019ll leave again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she observed, and Gabe sighed. She knew him so well she could almost always read what was on his mind. It was something that he had taken for granted before\u2014just one of the many things about Bobbi he\u2019d never truly appreciated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cHe\u2019s been telling me a little about what had happened on this last assignment and it\u2019s not pretty. He had lost his objectivity and had gotten too closely involved with a woman and her young daughter. He tried to help them get out and from what I can gather\u2014he finds it difficult to go into too much detail\u2014it ended badly. He\u2019s in such a truly dark place right now, that I don\u2019t think he\u2019d come back alive if he left again in his current frame of mind. So if all he does all day is watch terrible reality TV for the next few weeks or months until he\u2019s figured out what his next step will be, then I\u2019m all for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll start taking ballroom dancing lessons,\u201d she said, striving to lighten the mood, despite her own concern for Chase. She forced a laugh that soon became genuine, as she recalled something from their childhood. \u201cRemember that time your mum forced you guys to go to ballet classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny you should mention that,\u201d he chuckled, before telling her the related story about their former hero participating in the same show Chase was hooked on. The rest of the evening passed swiftly and was filled with good food, banter, and ever-increasing sexual tension as their delightful dinner dawdled to an end. By the time Gabe escorted her to the Jeep, which he preferred driving to her old clunker, she was tipsy and just aglow with happiness. He held out a hand to help her climb into the passenger seat and felt a dart of ever-present awareness when her fingers closed around his. He couldn\u2019t resist tugging her close to plant a quick kiss on her luscious lips before handing her into the car and shutting the door behind her. He took a moment to draw in a calming breath before darting around the front of the car and climbing into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>The long drive home was conducted mostly in silence, the Jeep\u2019s radio was broken and neither of them seemed inclined to fill the quiet with inane chatter. It was a companionable silence that was both familiar and welcome.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never asked you this before,\u201d Bobbi said twenty minutes into that comfortable silence, when they were still quite a distance from home. He spared her a quick glance and noted that she was curled up on her side and facing him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you rearrange the condiments everywhere we go?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering for years and I can\u2019t believe I never got around to asking you before now.\u201d Gabe watched the road as he considered her question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . I just like to have the bottles lined up according to size, it just looks neater and feels less cluttered. You don\u2019t know this about me, but I have the pens and pencils in my desk organizer at work arranged according to size as well. My shoes and ties according to color . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to alphabetize the toys on your room shelves,\u201d she recalled, and he grinned self-consciously, feeling like a freak. \u201cYou went crazy once when Billy put your GI Joe doll next to your Spiderman doll.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirstly they weren\u2019t dolls, they were action figures,\u201d he corrected, and she snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhatever floats your boat.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd secondly GI Joe was sandwiched between my Frankenstein jigsaw puzzle and my Houdini magic set . . . there were at least eight toys separating GI Joe from Spiderman. There was a clear system and he deliberately messed it up. And thirdly, I didn\u2019t freak out . . . I merely kicked him out of my room and told him to play in Chase\u2019s room if he wanted to mess stuff up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let him back in for a month!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you even remember this?\u201d he asked in disbelief. \u201cWeren\u2019t you like five or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was six.\u201d The boys had been eleven and had drifted onto more mature interests just a year after that spat.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, I like to have everything in its place.\u201d</p><p>Bobbi reflected on those words for a moment, remembering what he had said that terrible night at the football game.</p><p>How would you fit into my life? he had asked. Where would I even put you?</p><p>He needed to have everything in its place and that night he had had the equivalent of a panic attack not knowing where she slotted into his life anymore. And with her standing in front of him, bruised and bleeding, his panic had ratcheted up several notches. It was odd how clearly she could see that now.</p><p>\u201cI always figured it had something to do with my father leaving,\u201d he volunteered. Surprised by the additional information, she sat up straight. Gabe, never spoke about his father. Neither did Chase for that matter. Bobbi had known that he had left, of course, but she had never asked for the details. She didn\u2019t press him now, merely sat and waited. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say good-bye, you know? Just snuck out like a thief in the night. One day he was there and the next he wasn\u2019t, and Mum spent day after day closeted away in her room crying.</p><p>\u201cChase and I were only eight.\u201d It was the year before the Richmonds had moved in next to the Braddocks. \u201cAnd our world just fell apart. One day everything made sense and the next it didn\u2019t. Nothing felt permanent or safe and according to my mum, I started rearranging things in the closets and kitchen cupboards a couple of months after that. When it proved too hard to control the communal areas in the house, I focused only on my room. The habit stuck with me. If I don\u2019t maintain complete governance over every minute detail of my surroundings, I feel like things are spiraling out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever hear from him again?\u201d she asked softly, and he flicked her a sideways glance.</p><p>\u201cWho? My father?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get a Christmas card and a birthday card\u2014one between the two of us\u2014from him every year.\u201d Bobbi couldn\u2019t help the surprised sound that emerged from her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou never mentioned that before,\u201d she said, and he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important. He\u2019s a narcissist. He never makes any kind of polite inquiry as to how we are, but always assumes that we must be dying to know what his latest adventure is. The reality is that both Chase and I lost interest years ago, but it would never occur to Leighton Braddock that maybe his sons don\u2019t want to know about his awesome trips to far-flung places. I\u2019m sure he imagines we think he\u2019s the coolest dad in the world.\u201d A reluctant laugh huffed from him. \u201cHe\u2019s such an arse. I don\u2019t even think he realizes that Mum has divorced him and remarried. I\u2019m pretty sure if he ever swans back here someday he expects to reconcile with his lovely wife and have amazing relationships with his adoring sons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOoh,\u201d Bobbi said, wincing, keeping her tone light. \u201cIt would almost be worth it just to see him get a huge dose of reality smacked in his face.\u201d</p><p>They lapsed back into silence for the remainder of the drive as Bobbi reflected upon what she had just learned. She knew Gabe better than most people but had never known how badly his father\u2019s abandonment had affected him. Learning that she didn\u2019t know everything there was to know about him was kind of exciting. It was like listening to a much-loved CD for the hundredth time only to unexpectedly discover a beautiful, hidden track at the end.</p><p>She glanced out of the window when the car took a turn and saw that they were on their street. Her heart sank when Gabe bypassed his gate and drove to hers. Security let them in and he didn\u2019t say anything as he maneuvered the Jeep up the long drive toward the house and drew it to a stop in front of the steps leading up to the front door.</p><p>\u201cShould I come over later?\u201d she asked in an unsteady voice, and his hands tightened perceptibly on the steering wheel, while he kept his face forward.</p><p>\u201cI would love that,\u201d he muttered before turning to face her. \u201cBut . . . I don\u2019t want us to rush this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabe . . . that cat\u2019s been out of the bag for a while now,\u201d she teased, and his teeth gleamed in the dark as he grinned.</p><p>\u201cAnd what a pretty cat it is. One that I would love to pet and stroke and play with.\u201d</p><p>She choked and blushed furiously. \u201cUh . . .\u201d She was at a complete loss for words.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re doing it right this time, Bobbi. So you stuff that gorgeous little pussy . . . cat right back in the bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough with the cat analogies,\u201d she groaned.</p><p>\u201cYou started it,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI merely ran with it.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head and slammed a palm to her face.</p><p>\u201cYou going to give me a good-night kiss?\u201d he asked huskily, and she dipped her head coyly.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you walk me to the door,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be my pleasure.\u201d He leapt out of the Jeep and hurried around to help her down like she was one of his elegant blondes and Bobbi thrilled at the gentlemanly treatment. He took her hand and placed it in the crook of his elbow before walking her up the short flight of stairs and onto the well-lit porch.</p><p>He stopped right in front of the door and turned to face her, maintaining a frustratingly polite distance between their bodies.</p><p>\u201cI had a great evening,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll be willing to go out with me again?\u201d he asked, and she rolled her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His eyes dropped to her mouth and his tongue wet his lips. Her eyes followed the movement hungrily. He stepped closer to her and inhaled deeply, then exhaled on a shuddery breath before cupping her neck with his palms. He used his thumbs to tilt her jaw and she barely had time to reflect upon how much the masterful gesture turned her on before his lips dropped onto hers for a drugging, sucking, gentle kiss that obliterated her thought processes until all she could do was enjoy the sensuality of his expert mouth.</p><p>The kiss demanded nothing and left her wanting so much more. When he lifted his mouth, hers followed his blindly until he stood upright and removed the temptation from her reach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick up my car at lunchtime,\u201d he said, and she was in too much of a daze to do anything other than nod. \u201cAnd we can have lunch together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch. Yes.\u201d She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Bobbi mine,\u201d he said, and the endearment had her smiling radiantly and truly feeling like his after the wonderful evening they had just enjoyed together.</p><p>\u201cYes, good night,\u201d she repeated. He stood there unmoving and she gazed up at him dreamily.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going in?\u201d he asked, and she snapped out of her haze and flushed.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes. Of course!\u201d She fumbled with the lock and opened the door . . . eventually.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d She stepped inside and he nodded. \u201cGood night.\u201d She closed the door before he could respond, quickly reset the alarm, and then stood on tiptoe to peer out of the peephole, wanting to see what he did next. He was smiling as he turned away and when he went down the stairs, he did so with a bounce in his step that she recognized as happiness.</p><p>She hugged that knowledge to her chest as she floated up to her room. He was happy. She had done that. Even if this relationship of theirs was doomed, she would not have exchanged tonight for anything else in the world.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Gabe was slightly embarrassed by the singsong quality in his voice when he joined his brother for breakfast the following morning. Chase, who had been staring broodingly into his coffee, looked up and smiled when he saw Gabe\u2019s grin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d Gabe said after sitting down opposite him. \u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous summer morning. The sky\u2019s blue, the birds are out, everything smells fresh and awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t join me for our jog this morning,\u201d Chase said.</p><p>\u201cSlept in,\u201d Gabe informed before crunching into a slice of whole-wheat toast.</p> <p>\u201cGood evening last night?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cThe best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you see her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch.\u201d He couldn\u2019t wait. He had enjoyed her company so much the night before that he had disclosed more about himself than he ever had to anybody else. It had been revelatory\u2014he felt like he could tell her anything because she already knew him so well and wouldn\u2019t judge him.</p><p>Their conversation had been interesting, easygoing, and had flowed as readily as the wine, and it hadn\u2019t been filled with only the fluff and banter that had characterized their previous discussions. It had felt more significant, like he was really getting to know her for the first time, and the more he learned the more he liked and respected her.</p> <p>\u201cJeez, look at you,\u201d Chase groused good-naturedly. \u201cYou\u2019re beaming so damned brightly, you\u2019re practically blinding me.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s grin merely widened and he winked at his brother before diving into his breakfast.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss, your boyfriend\u2019s here for his car.\u201d Sean\u2019s embarrassingly loud voice rang out across the shop floor where Bobbi was consulting with one of her few new female clients about fixing the brake line on the woman\u2019s Mini Cooper.</p><p>Bobbi winced and smiled apologetically at the woman, who returned the smile politely. Her client was one of those young twenty-somethings who had the sleek and pampered appearance of a woman who had money and enjoyed spending it on herself. The kind of woman Bobbi should probably have been when one took her background into consideration.</p><p>She ignored Sean, knowing that Gabe wouldn\u2019t interrupt her while she was in consultation with a client, but a quick peek over the woman\u2019s shoulder told her that he had a clear view of them both. He waved at her and she waved back self-consciously. The woman glanced over her shoulder to see who Bobbi was looking at, and her entire body went on alert\u2014shoulders up, chest out, chin up, and a sexy hair flick. She stopped listening to Bobbi and spent her energy projecting \u201cI\u2019m available\u201d vibes toward the other end of the large workroom. Didn\u2019t she hear Sean call Gabe Bobbi\u2019s boyfriend for God\u2019s sake? Or did she think Sean had meant someone else?</p><p>Bobbi grimaced as she gathered that that was probably exactly what the woman thought. She wouldn\u2019t for a second think Gabe was the \u201cboyfriend\u201d in question.</p> <p>Bobbi kept talking and explaining what would be done to her car, but the woman was a lost cause, and in the end, Bobbi just told her how much the service would cost and offered her a replacement car while they fixed her Mini.</p><p>\u201cAll good.\u201d The woman dismissed her as her eyes hungrily followed Gabe, who was inspecting his Lamborghini and chatting amiably with Sean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the keys,\u201d Bobbi mumbled.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll just . . . have a look around while you do that.\u201d Bobbi watched as the woman made a beeline for Gabe.</p><p>\u201cThis is some car,\u201d she said when she joined the two men. Sean looked immediately lovestruck, but she ignored him and focused her laser-like attention on Gabe. Bobbi had to admit that he looked even more gorgeous today. In that charcoal pinstriped suit, with a pale blue shirt and dark-blue-and-gray-striped tie, he oozed that conservative elegance Bobbi found so irresistible.</p><p>\u201cI noticed it from across the room,\u201d the woman was saying, and Bobbi rolled her eyes. Yeah, right. She hadn\u2019t noticed the car until Gabe had been standing right beside it. Some more hair flicking followed combined with a ridiculous amount of eyelash fluttering. Bobbi snorted and tried not to feel insecure. Smelling of engines and looking grubby, when Bobbi stood beside a woman like that, it would be hard not to find her lacking.</p><p>Bobbi made quick work of getting the keys to the woman\u2019s replacement car and joined them a moment later. The woman was asking Gabe all these breathless and interested questions about his car, ignoring poor Sean, who looked crestfallen.</p><p>\u201cHere you are, Ms. Simms,\u201d Bobbi announced, holding up the keys. \u201cShe\u2019s just a Fiat but she\u2019s quite reliable.\u201d</p> <p>The woman looked irritated by the interruption, and when she took the keys, she wrinkled her nose when her fingers brushed against Bobbi\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you but I always find the whole garage experience to be such a chore,\u201d she told Gabe in a confiding voice. \u201cEverything and everybody\u2019s just so . . . dirty. No offense of course.\u201d The last was directed to Bobbi and absolutely devastated Sean. Gabe\u2019s eyes narrowed as he took in Sean\u2019s face before they shifted to Bobbi, who maintained a carefully and politely blank expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, reaching out and grabbing Bobbi\u2019s hand before yanking her over until she was plastered against his side. She had had a bit of an oil spill that morning and her overalls were somewhat the worse for wear, but he didn\u2019t hesitate and kept her firmly tucked beneath his arm. \u201cSometimes a bit of dirt isn\u2019t so bad, is it sweetheart?\u201d he asked Bobbi before dropping a long and very hot kiss on her surprised mouth.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d he whispered when he lifted his lips and she blinked, completely flustered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh, hey yourself,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for lunch?

But don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what again? Kiss you? I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t make that promise, sweetheart,\u201d he teased, and the other guys chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you three laughing at? Get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\u201d Sean, the smart arse, snapped to attention and actually saluted. Pieter and Craig just grinned and went back to their respective tasks.</p><p>Gabe followed Bobbi into her office, where she peeled off her overalls and cleaned her face, arms, and hands. When she looked back at Gabe, it was to find him staring at her with some pretty intense heat in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love watching you strip off those overalls,\u201d he groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s always so damned sexy seeing you reveal more and more skin\u2014it\u2019s like witnessing a butterfly emerge from a cocoon.\u201d It was such an absurdly flattering thing for him to say that Bobbi was completely taken aback for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d he continued huskily. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna do a private striptease just for me. You\u2019re going to peel away that outer layer to ever-so-slowly reveal your soft, naked skin beneath it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked skin?\u201d she repeated, her voice embarrassingly husky as she fought to control her arousal.</p> <p>\u201cNaked, or maybe in some hot lingerie\u2014God even those plain cotton boy shorts you fancy will do. I\u2019m not picky. It\u2019s the execution and what I plan to do to you afterward that count.\u201d His breath was coming just a bit faster and he shifted his stance in a way that told her he was as physically affected by his words as she was. His eyes dropped to her chest and she resisted the urge to cross her arms over her hard nipples. A smug smile flirted with his lips.</p><p>\u201cTold you to start wearing bras,\u201d he murmured, and she scowled at him before shaking her head and tossing his car keys at him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said bossily, and led the way out. She could feel his eyes on her butt all the way to his car and put a deliberate wiggle in her walk. She grinned when she heard him groan. Two could play this game.</p><p>Just before they walked into Manny\u2019s, Gabe deliberately took Bobbi\u2019s hand in his.</p><p>\u201cI want them to know that you\u2019re with me,\u201d he said in response to her questioning look. He couldn\u2019t quite decipher her expression, but she squeezed his hand, took a deep breath, and walked into the pub with him close behind.</p><p>Because it was a weekday, most of the usual crowd wasn\u2019t there\u2014which disappointed Gabe slightly. Still, there were enough recognizable faces around to ensure that word about him and Bobbi would get out. At first nobody seemed to pay any attention to the hand-holding, and figuring that a more drastic course of action was required, he looped an arm around her shoulders as they made their way to an empty table and dropped a kiss onto the curve of her neck. That caused a few speculative glances to be cast their way, but nobody seemed to think too much about it.</p><p>\u201cUnless you plan to throw me down on the floor and ravish me in full view of everybody here, nobody\u2019s really going to figure it out for a while yet,\u201d Bobbi said dryly, her tone alive with amusement. Gabe heaved a frustrated sigh and acknowledged the truth in her words with a nod.</p><p>They sat down and he unconsciously started rearranging the condiments. He caught himself in the middle of moving the pepper to the spot he preferred and stopped, after their conversation the night before he was suddenly self-conscious about the habit.</p> <p>Bobbi\u2019s smile was gentle and filled with understanding. She reached over and pushed the pepper grinder toward its spot next to the salt grinder with her finger.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where it goes, right?\u201d she asked softly after she had inched it into place, and he nodded jerkily in reply. He slowly lined up the sugar and toothpicks as well before sitting back and watching her. She had her elbows on the table and her chin resting in her palms and was staring down at the menu like it was the first time she\u2019d ever seen it.</p><p>When their server came over, she ordered a beer and pork chops with mashed potatoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the fish and chips,\u201d Gabe said, and Bobbi\u2019s head snapped up.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just order?\u201d she asked after the server had left.</p><p>\u201cFish and chips,\u201d he muttered, feeling embarrassed again. Even the server had given him a shocked look before leaving their table.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can change, you know?\u201d he said defensively. \u201cI do like trying new things that are out of my comfort zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gabe,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI know that. You don\u2019t have to prove anything to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked with just an edge of sarcasm in his voice. \u201cBecause sometimes I feel as if I do. Do you think I don\u2019t know you were expecting me to find you somehow lacking in comparison to that woman in the shop earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was really pretty.\u201d Her words made Gabe feel like taking her by the shoulders and shaking some sense into her.</p><p>\u201cShe was also a total bitch. Why the hell would I find her more attractive than you just because she happened to be wearing makeup and a dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she was wearing makeup and a dress,\u201d Bobbi seethed furiously. \u201cMaybe if you hadn\u2019t made a such big deal about my crappy dress sense before, I wouldn\u2019t think you were comparing me unfavorably to every pretty girl in a dress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well sometimes I\u2019m an idiot who doesn\u2019t always know what the hell he\u2019s talking about,\u201d he snapped, and her mouth slammed shut as she absorbed his words. He could tell the moment they sank in because her eyes went suspiciously bright with suppressed laughter.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019m so not going to let you forget you said that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned sheepishly before lifting her hand from the table to toy with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sometimes I need to be reminded of the zero point seven percent of the time that I\u2019m wrong. It keeps me grounded.\u201d The words startled a laugh out of her and he looked pleased with himself for eliciting the response from her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Gabe said, laughing, and Bobbi shook her head, enjoying his astonishment.</p> <p>\u201cI love knitting. It\u2019s my secret hobby.\u201d Nobody else knew about that but they had been discussing embarrassing hidden talents. Gabe had confessed to being able to wriggle his big toe independently from his other toes, only the left big toe mind you\u2014which Bobbi actually thought was kind of awesome.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly an embarrassing talent, you know,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt is when you can\u2019t really knit more than scarves\u2014and ugly ones at that. Worse, the wool keeps snagging on my hands.\u201d She held them up for Gabe to inspect. \u201cBecause of the hideous calluses.\u201d</p><p>He took her hands in his and placed a sweet kiss in each palm.</p><p>\u201cI love your hands,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe combination of rough and smooth on my skin sends me out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Okay . . . blush. Bobbi was outrageously flattered and quite turned on.</p> <p>They lingered over lunch for much too long, but in the end they reluctantly got the bill.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to the game tonight?\u201d he asked after paying for lunch. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come if you promise not to get into any fights or freak out when I get scraped or bumped or bruised. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then don\u2019t get scraped or bumped or bruised,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>\u201cGabe . . . ,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBobbi, I can\u2019t make that promise. I don\u2019t like seeing you in pain and I will probably overreact if you get hurt. That\u2019s just the way it is when you have a . . .\u201d He paused before shrugging. \u201cA boyfriend who would like to see you remain unscathed.\u201d</p><p>A boyfriend. The word was so damned juvenile, and yet Bobbi felt like she was floating on air for the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p> <p>So you guys are an item now?\u201d Bronwyn asked after the game that night. The women sat on the bleachers, watching the men, who stood around the grill, staring intently down at the smoldering coals as if they held the answer to all of life\u2019s problems.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we are,\u201d Bobbi admitted shyly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Bobbi,\u201d Theresa said warmly and hugged her. \u201cYou two are such a perfect couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a polite liar, Theresa,\u201d Bobbi laughed, and Theresa frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not exactly the perfect couple. We\u2019re totally mismatched. I mean it\u2019s all good now, but the very first time he has to take me out to some business thing, I\u2019ll be an embarrassment to him. And I refuse to change who I am just for the sake of a few superficial business events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was quite the outburst,\u201d Lisa observed, scooting closer. \u201cWhy do you think you\u2019ll be an embarrassment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDresses and those things don\u2019t matter to me, but they do to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t matter to you, then what\u2019s wrong with wearing the occasional dress to the occasional party?\u201d Theresa asked, and the other women nodded. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like you hate them or are morally opposed to them, is it? You just can\u2019t be bothered with them.\u201d</p><p>Bobbi thought about that for a second, feeling a bit confused.</p><p>\u201cBobbi, you\u2019re in love with a man whose career sometimes requires him to attend formal events. It\u2019s not something he can change; it\u2019s a fact of his life. Would it really be such a sacrifice to wear a dress for a few hours every so often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried that he\u2019ll expect me to be this woman I can never be, someone elegant and always perfectly dressed and made up,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love him so much that it would be easy for me to lose sight of who I really am in an effort to keep him happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you wearing to your dinner last night?\u201d Alice asked.</p><p>\u201cMy navy-blue dress, you know the one?\u201d They all nodded. Of course they knew it, it was all she ever wore when there was any kind of formal or semiformal event.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Lisa asked. Bobbi stared at her blankly, confused by the question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he chuck his jacket over your shoulders in an attempt to hide what you were wearing from everybody else?\u201d Lisa elaborated, and Bobbi laughed.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he look at all embarrassed to be seen with you?\u201d Bobbi thought about Bronwyn\u2019s question for a while before shaking her head slowly.</p> <p>\u201cSo what more do you want from him? He\u2019s clearly not ashamed of you,\u201d Theresa said. \u201cHe wants to be seen with you.\u201d Bobbi thought back to that afternoon when he had taken her hand before entering the pub, she\u2019d been wearing frayed shorts and a tank top combined with a baseball cap and ankle-high biker boots. They had been the quintessential odd couple, but he hadn\u2019t seemed to care.</p><p>\u201cHe has to present a certain image to the world,\u201d Theresa continued. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s just the two of you, or you\u2019re going out to the pub or hanging out with us, nobody cares about the way you\u2019re dressed. That\u2019s just packaging. But there will be times when your usual getup of jeans and T-shirts, or even that navy-blue dress, just won\u2019t cut it. You\u2019d humiliate both yourself and Gabe. Who would take him seriously in the business world if you appeared on his arm dressed like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should the way I dress reflect badly on him?\u201d Bobbi asked defensively, even though she could see the sense in what Theresa was saying.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse, Bobbi,\u201d Bronwyn said grimly. \u201cAnd stop being so damned stubborn. Obviously it would reflect badly on him; how could anybody trust a businessman with bad judgment? And that\u2019s what it would look like to everybody else. Bad judgment if he showed up with you on his arm and you were dressed as if you were still back in your workshop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable. I wouldn\u2019t feel like myself,\u201d Bobbi whispered.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because you haven\u2019t found anything that you like yet.\u201d Theresa reached over to give Bobbi\u2019s hand a supportive squeeze. \u201cYou don\u2019t go shopping; you get the easiest things off the rack and you\u2019re done. Wearing a dress won\u2019t change who you are, Bobbi. It couldn\u2019t possibly do that, it\u2019ll merely add a bit of embellishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we turn our girls\u2019 night into a girls\u2019 day tomorrow and do some shopping?\u201d Lisa suggested, and the other women hummed their approval.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want some Cinderella makeover,\u201d Bobbi said in a panic and they all laughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Theresa said dismissively. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a makeover. Don\u2019t you know that you\u2019re gorgeous? You just need some guidance, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Bobbi said. \u201cI have work and other stuff.\u201d</p><p>She was nervous at the thought of a shopping trip. Shopping wasn\u2019t her strong suit, and she had never really had another woman\u2019s guidance when going out to buy clothing. It meant the world to her that these four women, who had become such close friends in so short a time, wanted to guide her through the process, but Bobbi really couldn\u2019t imagine shopping being anything other than an ordeal. Still, the idea was tempting, and if anybody could turn a day of tedious shopping into something fun, it would be these four.</p> <p>\u201cBobbi,\u201d Theresa said. \u201cI promise you we will make it as painless and fun as possible. All we\u2019re doing is finding some clothes that suit your awesome personality. I mean, what do denim shorts and T-shirts say about you, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like comfort?\u201d Bobbi ventured.</p><p>\u201cYes, but how about the fact that you have a sense of fun and an adventurous spirit too?\u201d Theresa responded. \u201cClothes don\u2019t have to be just practical, you know, and evening dresses don\u2019t have to be intimidating, sexy sheaths. They can be fun and flirty and edgy and cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop watching Project Runway,\u201d Bronwyn said with an eye roll.</p><p>\u201cI just watch it for the accessories.\u201d Theresa went to her stock-in-trade answer.</p><p>\u201cSure you do,\u201d Lisa said.</p><p>\u201cAnyway . . . we\u2019re going shopping,\u201d Theresa repeated</p><p>\u201cYes, we are,\u201d Bronwyn confirmed, as did Alice and Lisa.</p> <p>Comprehensively outvoted, Bobbi shrugged and bowed to the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re going shopping.\u201d</p><p>Sandro was the first man, as always, to break free of the hypnotic effect of the grill, and he climbed up the bleachers to slide in behind Theresa and drag her back between his spread thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou ladies look so serious,\u201d he observed, nuzzling Theresa\u2019s neck in between words. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls\u2019 stuff,\u201d Lisa said enigmatically, smiling at her husband, who had come to join them. Bryce and Pierre soon followed Rick and all three men sat down close to their wives. That was the way it usually went. The men huddled by the grill for a while, and then the married guys would drift over to join their wives in the stands. The single men usually remained trapped by the fire\u2019s enthralling spell. That\u2019s why Bobbi was heartened when Gabe glanced up them, smiled when he caught her eye, and, without a backward glance to the siren song of the flames, made his way over to her. He sat down beside her and wrapped an arm around her waist until she was practically melded against him.</p><p>She leaned against him with a contented sigh and rested her hand on his thigh and her head on his shoulder. One of his hands was resting on her leg, just above her knee, and when it went down to cup her kneecap, she twisted her head to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d he asked gruffly, gently brushing a finger across the grass burn on her knee. She had taken a tumble during the game, which he\u2014fortunately\u2014hadn\u2019t seen, but she had scraped her knee pretty badly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a grass burn,\u201d she explained. \u201cI tripped over my own feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood game tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough having both Chase and Kinsley on my team wasn\u2019t exactly ideal.\u201d Chase wasn\u2019t great at football. Cricket was more his sport.</p><p>\u201cDid you like my goal?\u201d She smirked, and he glowered at the brightly lit field.</p><p>\u201cI would have liked it a hell of a lot better if you were on my team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being such a sore loser,\u201d she chastised. Gabe\u2019s team had lost 3\u20130 and he was clearly still moody about it\u2014despite the therapeutic fire-heals-all-wounds postgame session at the grill.</p><p>\u201cMeat\u2019s done,\u201d Chase called from the grill, and Bobbi moved to get her food, but Gabe\u2019s hand tightened on her leg.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it. I don\u2019t want you straining that leg too much.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him.</p><p>\u201cGabe, it\u2019s a grass burn,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll still sting,\u201d he said. He kissed her quickly before lithely jumping off the stands and heading toward the grill.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are really sweet together,\u201d Bron pointed out after the others had drifted down for food as well. Most of the children were asleep on picnic loungers and covered with blankets just next to the bleachers, but Bronwyn had her sleeping two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Kayla, tucked against her chest, which meant Bryce had gone for their food. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because you were such good friends that I expected a bit of awkwardness, but it\u2019s like you\u2019ve been a couple forever and he clearly adores you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d Bobbi asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cThe guy was watching you like a hawk throughout the entire game, every time it looked like you would fall we could see him tensing up, ready to fly to your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t see this happen,\u201d Bobbi pointed to her knee, and Bronwyn laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, he saw it all right, and if not for Chase grabbing the back of his collar and yanking him nearly off his feet, he\u2019d have come dashing over to rescue you. Whatever Chase said managed to calm Gabe down enough to stop him from carrying you off the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that would have been embarrassing,\u201d Bobbi groaned. \u201cI warned him not to overreact to every tiny scrape, but he wouldn\u2019t give me his word.\u201d</p><p>She watched him climb back up the bleachers, carefully carrying two loaded plates. He stuck one on her knees before sitting down beside her again.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHappy to do it.\u201d And he really seemed to be happy. Bobbi studied him for a long moment, reflecting on how eager he was to please her, and thought about her own reluctance to do the one thing guaranteed to please him. It left her feeling petty and selfish.</p><p>After everybody had left that night and Chase had made his way back to the house, Gabe took her hand and led her to the gate.</p><p>\u201cI could stay,\u201d she whispered, after a long and deeply satisfying kiss.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d he murmured, his hands busily drifting up under her loose shirt, stroking up and down the skin of her back. When they moved around to cup her breasts through the thick cotton of her sports bra, she moaned and pushed herself more fully into his hands.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay?\u201d she asked, more urgently, her arms winding around his neck. He didn\u2019t answer, sucking and licking at the sensitive skin on her collarbone instead. Bobbi sighed and planted urgent kisses all over his strong jaw, the tip of her tongue tasting the salt on his skin with every caress.</p> <p>\u201cGabe,\u201d she said softly, rapidly losing her ability to think beyond the next drugging kiss. \u201cGabe, I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and looked down at her with hot eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked, his voice rough. \u201cBecause if you stay it\u2019s through the night. There\u2019s no negotiating on that. Are you ready for everyone to be aware of the fact that we\u2019re sleeping together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase knows,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never had to face him over the breakfast table the next day,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cIf you stay, there\u2019ll be no sneaking out in the middle of the night like we\u2019ve done something to be ashamed of, and no rushing off in the morning either. Are we clear on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs crystal,\u201d she said, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d He held out his hand and she took it without any hesitation, happy to follow him home.</p><p>Gabe gathered her into his arms the moment they set foot in his room and his lips immediately descended over hers. His rapacious mouth swallowed up a small sigh of pleasure, and after that she was just lost. His strong hands moved, one down to the small of her back and the other to the back of her head, where his fingers wove themselves into her short, silky hair. Her mouth opened helplessly beneath his and his hungry, searching tongue eagerly responded to the invitation. The kiss was better than anything else that had ever come before it, and it consumed her completely.</p><p>She was burning from the inside out and reveling in it. She pushed herself closer and closer, wanting to crawl into his skin, wanting to fuse herself to him and become a part of him. Bobbi could not remember ever surrendering so completely to anyone before. Not even that first time they had made love. This time felt different, it felt more significant, more loving. In that moment Gabriel Braddock was her reason for living and the sum total of her existence.</p><p>Bobbi protested when Gabe dragged his lips from hers and tried to pull him back down toward her. He laughed and said something beneath his breath before bringing his hands to the hem of her T-shirt and dragging it up over her head. He tossed it aside and focused on her sports bra. He pushed the straps down the slender slopes of her shoulders, his eyes intently focused on the golden flesh his large hands were revealing. Bobbi sucked in a shocked breath when she felt nothing but air on her breasts, and she groaned painfully at the first tentative touch of his finger on the sensitive peak of one mound. Her nipple surged to swollen life and he smiled in satisfaction before lowering his mouth to the aching bud and suckling it deeply into his hot, velvety mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bobbi squeaked in shock, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of sensation that raced through her body like an addictive narcotic. She was flat on her back in the middle of his bed by this time and had no clear idea of how she had gotten there. Her baggy football shorts were gone and she was wearing just white cotton panties\u2014their only concession to her femininity being the tiny pink lace borders that were hemmed around the edges.</p><p>Gabe was balanced above her with one of his muscular, naked thighs thrust between hers. He continued to do amazing things to her with his clever mouth and his industrious hands. His mouth moved back and forth between one painfully distended, raspberry-red nipple and the other before finding her lips again, plundering ruthlessly, taking as much as he was giving.</p><p>\u201cBobbi.\u201d He lifted his head, his voice was thick, slurred, and almost unrecognizable. \u201cMy darling Bobbi . . .\u201d He flipped over onto his back and dragged her with him so that she was straddling his thigh.</p><p>Gabe knew that Bobbi was unaware of the sexy picture she made, with her breasts spilling over the top of her bra, her nipples and lips swollen and red. Her eyes looked drugged with pleasure and she smiled widely, delighting in her new position.</p><p>His hands framed her face and tugged it closer to his own, he lifted his head to claim her lips but she pulled back at the last second and instead struggled to tug his T-shirt off. He sat up and helped her drag it up over his muscular, tanned chest, impatient to feel her hands on him.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed contentedly, when she finally managed to stroke his skin. Her small hands found his hard nipples and her fingers tugged a bit too enthusiastically. Gabe yelped in pain and her eyes filled with remorse. She lowered her head and kissed away the sting, licking and sucking almost delicately, until Gabe thought that he would go out of his mind with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, sweetheart,\u201d he groaned, his hands framing her face again. \u201cYes . . .\u201d</p><p>Bobbi moved over to the other nugget and paid it homage as well, savoring the salty taste and warm, musky scent of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous,\u201d she whispered against his flesh.</p><p>\u201cGod, I want you so much, Bobbi mine.\u201d She lifted her head to meet his tormented regard and nodded slowly, her eyes alive with warmth.</p><p>\u201cI want you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he confided, sitting up, so that she was wantonly cradled in his lap, her legs wrapped around his waist and her bottom snugly tucked against the swollen flesh pushing against the confines of his shorts. Her eyes filled with tears as the emotion of the moment overwhelmed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispered, kissing away the errant tears that had slipped down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t seem to stop,\u201d she confessed, a sob catching in her throat.</p><p>\u201cSsh, sweetheart,\u201d he said, kissing her again. The caress so gentle it just prompted more tears from her. He lifted his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s this now, sweetheart? Why the tears?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, unable to verbalize what she was feeling and buried her face against his chest, leaving moisture on his skin. She planted hungry kisses all over his chest before inching her hands down to the hard column sawing up against her cleft. Her lips followed her hands down until she was bent over his shorts, her breath washing against his flat abdomen as she tugged at the drawstring.</p><p>Gabe groaned when she managed to undo the knot and he lifted his hips to make it easier for her to tug his shorts and briefs down past his thighs. He lifted his head from the bed to watch what she was doing and Bobbi enjoyed the ripple of muscles on his abdomen and torso at the movement.</p><p>\u201cBobbi, what are you doing?\u201d he asked, his voice a tormented whisper. She didn\u2019t bother to reply, allowing her actions to speak for her when she took hold of his length in both of her hands and stroked it slowly from top to bottom.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet Jesus,\u201d he grated, his hips coming off the bed at her touch. She smiled at him from where she was crouched at his center before dropping an experimental kiss on the sensitive tip of his shaft. \u201cStop! Bobbi . . . don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But she did, her mouth enveloped him, and what she couldn\u2019t fit, her hands took care of. Gabe felt like the top of his head was about to blow off, and he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to last long if she continued this. It nearly killed him, but he dragged her off and back under him. They were both completely naked in no time at all and he placed his hands on her inner thighs and opened her up to his ravenous gaze. His throat went dry at how perfect she was and he was soon repaying the favor that she had so surprisingly bestowed on him moments before.</p><p>Bobbi squealed, tears long forgotten, as Gabe used his very talented tongue on her to maximum effect. It wasn\u2019t long before her entire body clenched and she came with a moan and quiet gasp. He gave her no time to recover; he dragged a condom from his nightstand drawer and put it on, while Bobbi drank in the sight of his splendid nakedness. She was intoxicated by him and aware of nothing more than Gabe and what he could to her with his hands, mouth, and body.</p><p>She joyfully welcomed him back into her body, loving how absolutely perfect it felt to have him inside of her again. He moved slowly, gently, and allowed them both to fully savor the physical and emotional closeness of the moment.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he whispered, and she wrapped her arms around him in response and held him even closer. She could feel his thrusts in every part of her body and it drove her wild. She softly moaned every time he withdrew, lamenting his departure, but gasped happily with every return stroke. Her orgasm snuck up on her and sent her spinning madly out of control before she was fully prepared for it. Her breath caught and held. She didn\u2019t think she could physically stand the oh-so-exquisite torture! How could anybody stand it? But suddenly he was there, calming her down, whispering endearments in her ear and setting her crazily tilted world to rights again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she found herself lazily drifting back to earth, she felt it happening to him too: the madness. He was sobbing into her neck as he impaled her wildly, without any rhythm or control. He harshly called out to her, seeking an anchor to hold him steady, the way he had for her and she kissed him gently, whispering reassuringly when he convulsed for what seemed an eternity before collapsing limply on top of her. She soothed him with her words, the same three words over and over again, while her tears overflowed into his already damp hair beneath her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Gabe,\u201d she whispered as she clung to him, the words barely audible. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Gabe heard the emotional words and they meant a hell of a lot in that moment but as much as he wished he could respond in kind, he just didn\u2019t want to deceive her or raise her hopes unfairly. So he said nothing, merely removed the condom and was grateful for the moment\u2019s respite as he left to discard it. He took an extra minute in the bathroom to compose himself but even so, when he returned to that bed and took her into his arms again, he was still trembling almost uncontrollably.</p><p>She was a sweet, warm weight in his arms, and he relished tucking her close to his heart, enjoyed entangling his longer legs with her shapely ones and absolutely straight out loved the feeling of her growing heavier against him as sleep claimed her. He forced himself to stay awake for a while, just to watch her sleep and hear her occasional delicate snores. His heart felt full and when he eventually fell asleep, it was with a contented smile on his lips.</p> <p>\u201cMorning.\u201d The soft voice was spoken directly into her ear and Bobbi sighed before turning over onto her stomach in an effort to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Bobbi, it\u2019s time for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019 wan\u2019,\u201d she groaned into the pillow, batting at the annoying presence beside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten how adorably grumpy you are in the mornings.\u201d The voice, which she now recognized as Gabe\u2019s, was laden with laughter, but Bobbi didn\u2019t see what was so damned amusing about being awoken at the crack of dawn. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s not something you outgrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither, apparently, is obnoxious cheerfulness at some god-awful hour in the morning,\u201d she groused, lifting her head to glare into his handsome, grinning face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s eight a.m. Not quite as god-awful as you seem to think it is. Aren\u2019t you working today? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d appreciate being late.\u201d He was sitting on the bed wearing sweatpants but nothing else. She blushed as she recalled the nasty, sexy things they had done to each other the night before. She still couldn\u2019t believe that she had allowed that first time to happen before a shower. At the time they had both been so carried away that cleaning up after their football match been the last thing on either of their minds. Still . . . ew. If it hadn\u2019t been such a transcendent experience, she would have been just a bit more squicked out by it.</p><p>They had had a shower . . . of sorts, after waking from the initial best-sex-of-their-lives coma. They had managed to clean themselves up, but Bobbi had emerged from that shower feeling like the dirtiest woman in the world. Right now, Gabe was sweeping a soothing hand up and down her naked back, from between her shoulder blades, down to just above the swell of her butt, and then up again. Bobbi arched her back and he applied some more pressure until it was a full on, if one-handed, massage.</p><p>\u201cI take it you have to go home and get changed before going to work?\u201d he asked, and she yawned.</p><p>\u201cNot going to work,\u201d she remembered. \u201cMeeting the ladies instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you all going to be doing today?\u201d he asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cStuff,\u201d she said cryptically, hiding a wince as she remembered their mission for the day.</p> <p>\u201cHmm, intriguing,\u201d he responded, bending over to kiss her back lingeringly. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re in an immediate rush to leave then, are you?\u201d</p><p>She stretched and turned over onto her back, deliberately allowing the covers to drop away from her breasts. Gabe\u2019s eyes were riveted on the pretty sight before him and she smiled, feeling powerful.</p><p>\u201cNo rush,\u201d she confirmed, reaching her arms up toward him. He smiled happily and responded to the sweet invitation with a hungry kiss.</p><p>\u201cGood, because something\u2019s come up that I need to discuss with you.\u201d</p><p>She groaned good-naturedly.</p><p>\u201cGod, we need to work on your terrible innuendos,\u201d she teased, and he laughed, kissing her again until all thought of laughter fled.</p><p>An hour, a shower, and a change of clothes later, Bobbi made her way downstairs to see if there was any breakfast left. The house seemed empty and Bobbi remembered that Gabe tended to give his household staff the weekends off. She wandered onto the patio and found Chase sitting on a garden chair with his long legs stretched out in front of him and a newspaper folded in his hands. He seemed to be reading the sports page. He glanced up when she moved uncertainly in the doorway, and she blushed a fiery red when he took in the miles-too-big T-shirt she was wearing with a pair of Gabe\u2019s old board shorts, which fortunately had a drawstring that she could cinch at the waist to prevent them from falling down around her ankles.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she mumbled, and sat down opposite him.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he greeted, fumbling with the newspaper. She noticed that he was also flushed with embarrassment, and she lowered her eyes to the table and helped herself to some fruit juice and cereal.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . did you have a good night?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was okay. Did you?\u201d The question was automatic and her hand halted in the act of reaching for the jug of milk. Her eyes flew up and she saw that his face had gone an even brighter shade of red, and when their eyes met, they both froze for a horrified instant before a hysterical sound burbled up from Bobbi\u2019s throat and spilled out in the form of a giggle. Chase\u2019s face relaxed into a grin and a soft chuckle burst from his lips. Before they knew it they were both convulsed in laughter, and when Gabe walked out onto the patio he frowned at the sight of them bent over in amusement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d he asked, and that just set them off again. In the end Gabe gave up on getting a straight answer from them and just sat down and watched them with a bemused smile. By the time their laughing fit had faded into nothing but intermittent chuckles, they had both overcome their initial embarrassment and had rediscovered their camaraderie.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing the answer to that question was yes?\u201d Chase smirked, and Bobbi tossed a grape at him, unable to prevent the slight flush that crept back into her face.</p><p>\u201cShut up before I decide to share details,\u201d she threatened, and he winced.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t?\u201d He looked horrified, and she smiled smugly.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t test me.\u201d</p><p>Gabe rolled his eyes at the banter and sighed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to know,\u201d he admitted, and Bobbi turned a beatific smile on him before blowing him a kiss.</p><p>The rest of breakfast passed pleasantly and before she knew it, Bobbi was waving good-bye to Chase and Gabe was walking her home.</p><p>When they reached the gate, she told him she could manage the rest of the way herself, but he insisted on walking her to the door, and she cringed at the thought of her father being at home and seeing her in the state she was in. She wasn\u2019t only obviously wearing Gabe\u2019s clothes; she had whisker burns on her face and neck and a couple of bruises on her arms that the shirt didn\u2019t cover. To his credit, Gabe had been horrified when he\u2019d seen the bruises all over her body that morning.</p> <p>He held her hand all the way home and when she let herself into the house, it was so quiet she immediately knew that her father wasn\u2019t around. She heaved a small sigh and gifted Gabe with a gorgeous smile of relief.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to find out eventually, Bobbi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know that, but at least it\u2019s not today.\u201d She hugged Gabe happily. \u201cI mean we just told him that we were dating and then two nights later we\u2019re sleeping together? Better to get him used the whole dating thing first.\u201d</p><p>Gabe kissed her cheek before reluctantly letting her go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you today. Stay safe okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheresa, Alice, and Bron all have security details. I\u2019ll be perfectly fine while I\u2019m with them,\u201d she reassured brightly, and while he didn\u2019t look completely happy, he looked somewhat mollified.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t speed,\u201d he warned as he turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he stressed, obviously not convinced.</p><p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d He sighed and gave up, leaving with a frustrated wave.</p><p>Bobbi watched him go, keeping that bright smile plastered to her face until he had turned toward the back of the house as he headed for the gate. The smile fell from her lips to be replaced by devastation the moment he was out of sight.</p><p>She had told him that she loved him so many times last night and he hadn\u2019t come close to responding. It was terrifying to feel so much for someone and have them feel nowhere near to the same emotion in return. At least he couldn\u2019t bring himself to lie to her, which was somewhat comforting, she supposed.</p><p>She shook her head and went upstairs to get changed for her outing with the Mommy Club ladies. If nothing else, they always cheered her up.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p> <p>As the Valentine\u2019s Day Ball grew closer, Bobbi became more and more of a nervous wreck. She had a dress all picked out for the occasion, one of the many she had bought the week before when she had gone shopping with her friends. She had been astonished to find that after she had been dragged from one boutique to the next that she had a clear fashion point of view that was uniquely hers. The dresses she had chosen made her feel like Bobbi. In a dress.</p><p>They weren\u2019t conventional or conservative or anything remotely similar to what any of Gabe\u2019s former lady friends had worn, and Bobbi was anxious about what he would say. As a couple, they were growing closer by the day, and they spent as much time together as possible. Bobbi had slept at his place every night, and while her father obviously knew about it, he never mentioned it to Gabe or to Bobbi.</p><p>Bobbi told Gabe that she loved him often and while he accepted the words and even seemed happy to hear them, he never reciprocated. And every time it felt like a barb through Bobbi\u2019s heart. Still, she was unable to stop and often said it while carried away in the moment.</p><p>In the meantime the flowers had started coming again, one a day, every day when she was at work. At least there weren\u2019t heaps of bouquets anymore, which Quinton, the sarcastic delivery guy, was grateful for and Craig and Sean were grumpy about.</p><p>The cards, which were now in envelopes since he knew she would read them, contained information on what the flower meant along with a really bad \u201cpoem,\u201d which always brightened up her day.</p><p>On Monday she received a single aster\u2014which apparently meant contentment.</p><p>Tuesday (after a particularly raunchy night) it was a snapdragon\u2014desire.</p><p>Wednesday\u2019s white iris had meant that she inspired him.</p><p>On Thursday a pretty gardenia had told her that she brought him joy (that had made her choke up a little).</p><p>And Friday\u2019s flower was hand delivered by the man himself, who had decided to take her to lunch. She was sitting flat on her butt next to the left front tire of a car and working on replacing a broken CV axle joint when he walked in.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart,\u201d he greeted as he crouched down next to her. He brought his hand out from behind his back. \u201cI brought you a hibiscus. It commends your delicate beauty.\u201d She laughed helplessly at that one, knowing she looked far from delicately beautiful at the moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks. Hold on to it for a while, will you? I\u2019m rather busy right now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna grab some lunch once you\u2019re done wrestling with that beast?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHmmm, maybe. This might take a while,\u201d she grunted.</p> <p>\u201cI can wait. I\u2019m going to have a chat with Sean,\u201d he informed, and she watched him turn and leave, admiring his butt as he walked away.</p><p>She went back to the task at hand and was halfway done when the drift chisel slipped as she was trying to hit the end of the CV joint and angled sharply downward toward her leg. The sharp end sliced through her overalls and scored into her thigh just above the knee. She sucked in a breath as the pain hit her, and the chisel and hammer clanged to the floor as she clutched at her thigh and bit back a scream. She clamped a hand over the wound as she tried to stem the flow of blood and immediately began to feel a bit woozy at the sight of all that red.</p><p>Sean was busy telling Gabe about girlfriend number two dumping him when they heard Bobbi cry out, followed by the sharp sound of metal hitting the floor. Craig and Pieter looked up too, and they all took an instinctive step toward her that broke into a full-out scramble to reach her when they saw her listing to the side.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s heart stopped and he dashed over to where Craig and Pieter were already crouched next to her. Craig was swearing profusely and Pieter confirmed Gabe\u2019s worst fears by yelling at Sean to call an ambulance.</p><p>Gabe slid to his knees beside her and all he could see was red . . . so much damned blood.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked, but everybody was bustling and panicking and Bobbi was unconscious and nobody would tell him. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Craig looked up grimly; he had a hand clamped over her thigh and an arm supporting her back.</p><p>\u201cChisel slipped, I think,\u201d he said succinctly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, there\u2019s a lot of blood. It may have nicked an artery.\u201d</p><p>And in that instant Gabe\u2019s own life flashed before his eyes\u2014a future life . . . the one he should have with his Bobbi by his side. A future filled with laughter, joy, love, and children. One that he might lose before he even properly recognized that it was what he desperately wanted.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he ground out between clenched teeth. He would not lose her like this. It just wasn\u2019t acceptable. He yanked off his tie and leaned in beside Craig, feeling sick at the sight of all that blood. It was actually starting to pool beneath her, and he tried not to think about how much she was losing and how dangerous it was. \u201cMove your hand a bit but don\u2019t let up on the pressure.\u201d He instructed Craig, who did as he was told without question. Gabe used his tie to fasten a tourniquet around her thigh, just above the wound.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart,\u201d he urged. \u201cYou stay with me. Don\u2019t you dare leave me.\u201d</p> <p>He kept talking to her while Craig kept his hand clamped over the wound and Pieter and Sean both stood by helplessly clutching their hats in their hands. The ambulance took forever to arrive, and Gabe was in a state of complete terror by the time the paramedics took over. He watched her closely for signs that she wasn\u2019t breathing, and he said a grateful prayer with every shallow movement of her chest.</p><p>When the paramedics loaded her into the ambulance, he climbed into the back with her. The female paramedic tending to Bobbi said something about the bleeding slowing down and commended him on his tourniquet. Gabe kept his focus on Bobbi, willing her to live as he held tightly onto her hand.</p><p>When they got to the hospital, Mike and Billy were already waiting; Sean had called them after calling the ambulance. Mike looked pale and old and Billy looked furious and terrified all rolled into one.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Billy asked, his eyes trained on his sister as they wheeled her past him and straight into the emergency room. Gabe ignored him and moved to follow the gurney but they were all strong-armed out by doctors and nurses, who directed them to a waiting room. Gabe hated not being with her and couldn\u2019t stop prowling up and down the confines of the room.</p><p>Mike sank into a chair and sat there looking more feeble than Gabe wanted to think about right now. Billy was still demanding answers, and Gabe filled him in as succinctly as possible. Edward and Clyde came in a few minutes later, and Edward, the doctor, immediately went to see if he could get additional information.</p><p>Chase strode into the room soon afterward, and when Gabe looked surprised to see him, he said that Billy had SMS\u2019d him. Edward returned and everybody looked at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cThe good news is that she\u2019s out of danger,\u201d he informed, and everybody breathed a sigh of relief. Gabe\u2019s legs gave out and he sank down next to Mike. \u201cShe\u2019s very lucky, it didn\u2019t hit her femoral artery, thank God . . . but it was literally millimeters away from doing serious damage.\u201d Edward\u2019s face went gray at the thought. \u201cOne of her veins was nicked though which is why there was so much blood. The tourniquet and applied pressure kept the blood loss under control.\u201d He glanced at Gabe as he said this, and Gabe ran a shaky hand through his hair as he tried very hard not to fall apart. \u201cShe\u2019s in surgery to have the vein stitched up\u2014but she\u2019ll recover quickly and there\u2019ll be no lasting damage. They also . . .\u201d</p><p>Gabe didn\u2019t hear the rest, his head was throbbing and he felt nauseous. He needed fresh air, he needed to get out . . . things were too chaotic in this place. Too much noise and craziness, it made him feel boxed in\u2014there was no order here. He shoved to his feet and was vaguely aware of the astonished looks he was getting before he slammed out of the room and walked away.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He got as far as the parking lot and then stood there, feeling lost when he realized that he had no car. He looked around at the sea of cars gleaming in the parking lot and caught a glimpse of his reflection in one of the windows. He was covered in blood. His face, his chest, his hands . . . Oh God! He leaned over, bracing his hand on one of the cars, and brought up his breakfast, and even after he had emptied his stomach completely, he just couldn\u2019t stop heaving.</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d It was Chase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m covered in blood,\u201d he said, hearing a faint edge of panic in his voice. \u201cTh-there was so much blood, Chase. I thought she would die right there in front of me. And do you know the only thing I could think about? Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Chase asked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cMe,\u201d Gabe said, his voice rife with self-disgust. \u201cAll I could think of was how empty my life would be without her. How much I\u2019d miss her. How I hadn\u2019t even told her . . .\u201d A despairing sob escaped from his lips and he fought for control. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even told her I loved her for God\u2019s sake! What kind of man am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man in love,\u201d Chase said simply, and another sob hitched from Gabe\u2019s throat. \u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself. And Bobbi is going to be fine. You still have the opportunity to tell her how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll marry me?\u201d Gabe asked uncertainly, and Chase studied him intently before dragging him into a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one you should be asking that question, baby brother,\u201d Chase told him.</p><p>Bobbi opened her eyes and blinked for a confused instant, not sure where she was. She had gotten used to waking up in Gabe\u2019s bed and this certainly wasn\u2019t his room. It was bright and clinical and smelled vaguely antiseptic. There were balloons everywhere and flowers. If she didn\u2019t know better, she\u2019d think she was in a hospital. But why would she be in a hospital?</p> <p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re awake.\u201d She turned her head to see Billy sitting in an uncomfortable-looking chair beside the bed. He got up and shocked the heck out of her by dropping a kiss on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou had an accident in your shop and stabbed yourself . . . dumbo.\u201d His words were teasing but his eyes were serious.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I remember the blood. I felt so dizzy at the sight of it, there was just so much of it and you know how I feel about my own blood. Surely they didn\u2019t rush me to hospital because I fainted? Was this Gabe\u2019s doing? He tends to overreact when I get hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou nearly died, Runt,\u201d Billy said somberly, and then stunned her by bursting into tears. It was that macho crying of a strong man, where every sob capitulated looked like an epic internal struggle of good versus evil and every tear shed was very reluctantly surrendered. It was all the more powerful because of how short-lived it was\u2014the macho always won out in the end.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she confessed. \u201cWhat do you mean I nearly died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe damned chisel thing nicked a vein and nearly sliced your femoral artery. If that had happened you would have bled out on your shop floor. As it was you merely bled like a stuck pig on your shop floor,\u201d he elaborated.</p><p>Bobbi was stunned. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGabe?\u201d He hated it so much when she got minor scrapes and bruises that he must have lost it completely to have her nearly die right in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHe was a wreck.\u201d Billy confirmed her worst fears. \u201cFast thinking enough to tie a tourniquet around your leg though. He and Craig probably saved, if not your life, then a large quantity of your blood for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout eight hours. Now I can\u2019t hog all your time. Dad will want to see you, and Ed and Clyde have been waiting their turns as well.\u201d</p><p>What about Gabe? Surely he wanted to see her too?</p> <p>In the end just about everybody she knew had come to visit her, but by the time she was released the following day, Gabe still hadn\u2019t been to see her. Chase had told her to give his brother some time to get over the horrifying experience, but that had pissed her off, since she had been the victim of the so-called \u201chorrifying experience.\u201d</p><p>She was none the worse for wear after her short stint in the hospital, and Clyde, who was really her nicest brother, carried her up to her room. Edward was so self-righteous sometimes and Billy could often be intolerable, but Clyde, despite the terrible things often said about lawyers, was sweet and rarely got on her nerves. He stayed with her for a while after depositing her on her bed and then left her to her moody thoughts.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Gabe come to see her? Was he angry with her after what had happened? He could be so weird about stuff like this sometimes, like when he\u2019d been furious with her for being injured during that football game.</p><p>She sighed and picked up her cell phone to check for messages. Nothing.</p><p>She missed him, the idiot. She just hoped that he didn\u2019t let this incident scare him off again.</p><p>She was staring broodingly at her wall a couple of hours later. She was sick of TV, which had nothing much to offer in the form of entertainment and had already called the shop a half dozen times to make sure the guys weren\u2019t slacking off. Of course they weren\u2019t. She trusted her guys to do their jobs and knew that Craig would keep an eye on things. So that left her with nothing to do but brood about Gabe and all the possible reasons he could have not to call. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t come up with a single plausible one and she thought about calling him herself to give him what for. She was about to do that when her door creaked open and he stepped into her room.</p><p>She folded her arms over her chest and glared at him, not willing to reveal how happy and relieved she was to see him. Not until she had given him a piece of her mind first.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d he said softly, stepping farther into her room and approaching her bed cautiously. She noticed for the first time that he was clutching a large bouquet of flowers in his hands, and pursed her lips. If he thought his flowers were going to cut it this time, he had another think coming.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked bad-temperedly, and he flinched before sitting down on the chair beside her bed. His eyes drifted down to her elevated leg and the clean dressing wrapped around her thigh.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d He answered her question with a question, and that just pissed her off even more.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I feel?\u201d she snapped. \u201cI was careless at work. I\u2019m never careless at work. I feel like an idiot. I also feel bored and my leg hurts and I wish I could walk around but everybody keeps telling me I should take it easy. And I feel angry. With you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said, leaning forward, the flowers still clasped in his hands.</p><p>\u201cDo you? Because I don\u2019t understand. Chase told me to give you time to get over the horrific experience, but you\u2019re not the moron who stabbed herself in the leg with a chisel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d he said, still without heat. \u201cI am the one who had to stand there and watch you bleed half to death. I\u2019m the one who was terrified you would die right there in front of me while I was helpless to do anything and afterward . . . I was absolutely covered in your blood, so I had a few things to work out, okay?\u201d</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t considered how extremely traumatic the experience must have been for him or the guys in the shop and felt immediately contrite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, and he sighed.</p><p>\u201cI am too. I should have come sooner, but . . . it was hard.\u201d He looked down at the flowers in his hands and held them up for her to see. \u201cI also had to find these. It took a bit of research finding the perfect ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Is there some flower out there that says, \u2018sorry you sliced yourself open with a drifting chisel. Hope you feel better soon\u2019?\u201d His lips twitched and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve found. I\u2019ll keep searching for that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do these mean then?\u201d She nodded toward the exquisitely wrapped bouquet in his hands. He swallowed audibly and pointed each flower out to her.</p> <p>\u201cThese are tulips,\u201d he said, and she rolled her eyes. He had started with one even she recognized, but she nodded and smiled at the friendly red color of the blooms. \u201cThese blue ones are forget-me-nots. These are azaleas; over here we have ambrosia\u2014that was hard to find\u2014and of course, these are daffodils.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very pretty,\u201d she said, and he cleared his throat nervously. \u201cAre you going to tell me what they mean?\u201d</p><p>He tugged a card out of his jacket breast pocket and handed it over to her with a trembling hand. She gave him a searching look, wondering about this extreme display of nervousness and pulled the card from its envelope.</p><p>This time there was writing on only one side. Another poem. She read the words and looked up at him with a confused look on her face before reading them again:</p><p>Roses are red</p><p>Tulips are too</p><p>Every flower in this bouquet</p><p>Means, \u201cI love you\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabe?\u201d She asked uncertainly, her own hand starting to shake.</p><p>\u201cThe red tulips are a declaration of love,\u201d he said, his trembling voice gaining strength with every word. \u201cAmbrosia means that I love only you. The forget-me-nots are absolutely screaming that you\u2019re my true love. The daffodils are saying \u2018I love you too\u2019 in reply to all the times you\u2019ve said those words to me . . . and just in case you have any doubts about what kind of love we\u2019re talking about here, the azaleas are telling you that it\u2019s romantic love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered, her hands coming up to cover her mouth as she tried to hold back her sobs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only idiot in this room, Bobbi,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt took the sight of you bleeding and unconscious to make me realize what I\u2019d be missing if I lost you. All I could think of was that we would never get married and have babies and that my life would be utterly miserable without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried? Babies?\u201d she asked in disbelief, not quite sure if she was awake or not, and he grinned before pointing to a perfect red rose nestled amongst the tulips\u2014she hadn\u2019t even noticed it.</p><p>\u201cYou probably know what a red rose means, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. True love, of course.</p><p>He tugged the rose from the bouquet and she noticed that the long stem was wrapped in cellophane to protect the leaves from breakage. He unwrapped the cellophane and handed the rose to her.</p><p>\u201cWatch out for the thorns,\u201d he warned. She glanced down instinctively and that\u2019s when she saw the ring\u2014dangling prettily from one of the leaves. She looked back at him, her eyes huge in her face, and he smiled lovingly at her before reaching over to tug the ring from the leaf.</p><p>He held the ring, an exquisite square-cut canary diamond surrounded by small white diamonds, up in front of her before unexpectedly going down onto one knee beside her bed. It was such a romantic, if somewhat clich\u00e9d, gesture that Bobbi was absolutely staggered by it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRoberta Rebecca Richmond, I am so utterly in love with you, I worship you, and I cherish you. You\u2019ve always been the finest thing in my life, and I would consider myself the luckiest man in the world if you would consent to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Gabe . . .\u201d She was complete a mess. For someone who never cried, Bobbi had been doing a lot of if over the last few weeks, and she no longer cared who saw her.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d he asked, and she grabbed his hand and tried to tug him up onto the bed with her. He got up and sat down next to her.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you, and I\u2019ll try to be a good wife, even if I don\u2019t conform to some people\u2019s idea of the perfect corporate wife,\u201d she said, and a growl worked its way up from his chest.</p> <p>\u201cWho the hell told you that?\u201d he asked with a glower, and she grinned wetly.</p><p>\u201cGabe, I\u2019m a mechanic, remember? More at home in overalls than ball gowns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d he asked thoughtfully. \u201cI once thought I wanted some perfectly bland blonde on my arm for all eternity. But I would have been bored out of my mind in no time flat. I\u2019m so damned happy you kissed me that night at Sandro\u2019s party\u2014my life has been a crazy roller coaster ride since then, but with you the chaos always makes sense. I don\u2019t want you to be a \u2018good\u2019 wife . . . I want you to be my Bobbi, exciting, fun, and adorable. Just be the woman I fell in love with. That\u2019s who I want to marry.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the circlet of gold and diamonds he still held in his hand before lifting her left hand and lovingly sliding the ring onto her finger. Still choked up from his last words, Bobbi couldn\u2019t speak, but the kiss she gave him said so much more than words ever could.</p><p>Bobbi experimentally tested her weight on her leg and barely felt a twinge. It had been nearly a week since her accident and she was recovering quite nicely. She and Gabe had argued about when she could go back to work, and in the end she had taken a full week off. Her guys had been managing admirably in her absence.</p> <p>Bobbi had been bound and determined to be on her feet for this stupid Valentine\u2019s Day event. She would be unveiling her new look to Gabe tonight, and while she was no longer anxious about whether he would like it or not\u2014he liked her in everything\u2014she was excited about dressing up for him. Which was something she had never expected to feel in a million years.</p><p>She checked her appearance in the mirror for the hundredth time and waited for the doorbell to ring. When it finally did, she had to prevent herself from running down the stairs to let him in.</p><p>Billy, in a repeat of the first time Gabe had come calling on her, came up to get her and he stopped dead in the doorway when he first caught sight of her. She could see the surprise and pride in his eyes, but he merely lifted an eyebrow at her.</p><p>\u201cSkirt\u2019s a bit short, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He was teasing, but Bobbi immediately gasped and checked herself in the mirror again.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, is it?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and came over to give her a one-armed hug. \u201cYou look gorgeous. If Gabe wasn\u2019t already completely smitten with you, he\u2019d be a goner tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh . . . well, that\u2019s okay then,\u201d she said with a blush.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s not keep your fianc\u00e9 waiting.\u201d</p><p>Her fianc\u00e9! She couldn\u2019t get used to the sound of that.</p><p>Gabe was pouring Mike another drink to settle the older man\u2019s nerves when he heard Bobbi\u2019s voice just beyond the door. He couldn\u2019t keep the smile off his face at the thought of seeing her. The changeover at work had kept both Gabe and Mike busy over the past week, and he had barely seen her over the last couple of days. He had called often but calls didn\u2019t cut it.</p><p>He turned expectantly to face the door. He couldn\u2019t wait for this stupid ball to end so that he could take her home with him and drag that ugly navy dress off until he had her splendidly naked and pinned beneath him. Because of her injury and her resulting weakness due to the amount of blood she had lost, they\u2019d had to forego sex completely, but Bobbi had called him that afternoon to tell him she\u2019d gotten the \u201call-clear\u201d from her doctor, and Gabe had been a walking hard-on practically from that moment on.</p><p>The door swung open and Billy stood aside to let Bobbi precede him into the room and . . .</p><p>Wow.</p><p>That was the only word that came to mind when he saw her. There were glorious amounts of golden skin on display everywhere he looked\u2014her shoulders, her arms, and her legs. She was wearing one of those bustier-type dresses; it was pale pink, of all colors. The pretty pink was covered in a dark, gothic print that suited her to a tee. The bell-shaped mini skirt had the silhouette of a chapel printed on it, while the sweetheart bodice had bare black branches crisscrossing dramatically across the front. The short skirt ended at mid-thigh, just below the medical dressing that he knew was still there and revealed a shapely length of leg that made him want to just cover her up before other men saw her.</p> <p>She wore short biker boots, and Gabe could just see the frilly top of her ankle socks above the boot. The only jewelry she wore were the pair of gold hoop earrings that he had given her for Valentine\u2019s Day and her engagement ring. Her eyes were dark and smoky and her lips just tinted with a sexy red shade that made him ache to kiss it off.</p><p>She was an enchanting combination of hard and soft and was absolutely perfect.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked impatiently. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look quite . . . lovely.\u201d Her father sounded a bit taken aback. \u201cQuite the transformation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always looks lovely, Mike,\u201d Gabe corrected. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see a transformation, I see my Bobbi, and she looks\u2014if you\u2019ll excuse the phrase\u2014absolutely smoking hot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her smile was glorious, and after Gabe had her safely buckled into his car and they were headed for the expensive venue that Richcorp had hired for the event, she turned to him.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not super elegant or fancy like the dresses other women will be wearing tonight,\u201d she said, smoothing her hand nervously over the satin twill skirt.</p><p>\u201cBobbi, I told you before, those other women are boring. I don\u2019t need super elegant or fancy. I just need you, and tonight you look like a badass little fairy and I love it!\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that.</p> <p>\u201cA \u2018badass fairy\u2019?\u201d she repeated softly. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he threw her a sideways glance. \u201cYou know, as hot as you look in that dress, all I can think of is getting you out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss,\u201d he said in such a perfect imitation of Sean that it startled a snort of laughter from her. He didn\u2019t know how he was going to get through the evening without dragging her into a closet somewhere and having his wicked way with her.</p><p>After they had reached their destination, he halted at the bottom of the staircase leading up to the hotel\u2019s ballroom.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, while it\u2019s just us,\u201d he whispered, wrapping his arms around her slender waist and dragging her to his chest. \u201cI wanted to give you your Valentine\u2019s Day present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already gave me these.\u201d She shook her head to set the earrings dancing, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cHmm, they make you look like a gypsy, especially with your hair.\u201d She had finally had it styled. Nothing too drastic, just a few layers to give it more body. \u201cNo, my gift is a promise.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head questioningly.</p><p>\u201cA vow to forever love you just the way you are. You don\u2019t need to change for me, Bobbi mine. You\u2019re perfect and I love you so damned much. Never, ever doubt that.\u201d</p><p>As Bobbi looked into his eyes, she saw nothing but love and sincerity shining in them and had no doubt that he meant every word. He was her best friend, her lover, and her heart\u2019s desire.</p> <p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Gabe came jogging over to Bobbi after the game, a triumphant grin on his face as he swooped her into his arms and planted a kiss on her lips.</p><p>\u201cUgh, you\u2019re all sweaty, get off me.\u201d She pushed at his chest and his grin widened.</p><p>\u201cTo the victor goes the spoils,\u201d he proclaimed, wrapping his arms even tighter around her when she tried to wriggle away. \u201cYou\u2019re my spoils.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re insufferable when you win. I don\u2019t know how the other guys can stand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Sandro called from close by. He took a thirsty drink from the water bottle Theresa had handed to him.</p><p>\u201cI personally only come here for the braai,\u201d Rick added, already making his way to the grill.</p><p>\u201cWell since you can\u2019t play, it\u2019s probably time better spent,\u201d Sandro retorted, clearly still annoyed with his teammate for missing a last-minute penalty that would have evened the scores.</p> <p>\u201cOooh,\u201d the other guys jeered, and Rick merely waved the comment aside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d he said with a sanguine grin. \u201cMy man San is clearly jealous of my skills with a ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat skills?\u201d Sandro growled. \u201cYou look like a headless chicken flapping about whenever you take to the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a passable rugby player,\u201d Bryce said in defense of his brother.</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be wonderful if we were actually playing rugby,\u201d Pierre said irritably.</p><p>\u201cSandro, you don\u2019t have to be so rude,\u201d Theresa\u2019s voice piped up. \u201cRick was trying his best, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always take his side,\u201d Sandro complained, looking and sounding like a recalcitrant little boy in that moment. Theresa grinned and stepped up to hug him, before whispering something in his ear. The glower faded from Sandro\u2019s face and his head snapped back as he laughed at whatever it was his wife had whispered in his ear.</p><p>\u201cAah, look at their team falling apart at the seams. A tragic loss like the one they suffered today will do that.\u201d Gabe tut-tutted as he watched the losing team squabble amongst themselves. He turned back to Bobbi, who had given up her struggles to get away from his big, sweaty body. \u201cAnd how are my wife and two kids this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnoyed that we couldn\u2019t play,\u201d she answered, and he grinned before patting her hugely swollen belly. He bent down to talk to the mound, something he did often and sometimes publicly. It would be embarrassing if it weren\u2019t so darned sweet.</p><p>\u201cHear that Seamus and Sian, your mummy\u2019s annoyed with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just no,\u201d she said, pinching the bridge of her nose.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, Bert and Betty, I think she\u2019s annoyed with me too now.\u201d He smiled slyly at her, and she felt a reluctant grin tugging at her lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re naming them Elizabeth and Jonathan,\u201d she proclaimed, and he dropped a kiss onto her tummy.</p><p>\u201cDaddy loves you too much to call you Lizzy and Johnny. I promise you, I will stop mean old Mummy from naming you that.\u201d They had been having different versions of the same argument since they\u2019d discovered that she was carrying a girl and a boy. They just couldn\u2019t come to an agreement on the names, and she was due in just over a month. She couldn\u2019t work anymore, which frustrated her, but the shop was doing well enough for them to hire two more employees, and Bobbi had promoted Craig to manager, so she could take maternity leave without worrying too much about how things were going. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bobbi was blissfully happy with Gabe, and he had kept his promise over the last year of marriage. It didn\u2019t matter where they went, how formal the occasion, or how out of place her \u201cbadass fairy\u201d dresses were, he always looked at her like she was the most beautiful woman in the room. She looked around at her friends, who were all laughing and squabbling happily, and her brothers\u2014Billy and Chase\u2014who were lightheartedly mediating a fight that had broken out amongst the small children on the sidelines, and felt remarkably blessed. This place, these people, and this moment right now\u2014it was home.</p><p>\u201cHow did we get so lucky?\u201d she asked Gabe, who stood behind her and wrapped his arms around her front until his hands rested on her belly. He rested his chin on her shoulder as he watched their happy group of family and friends too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . but I know my luck started improving one night long ago, when a sexy, drunken fairy wiped me out with an unexpected kiss. It was the best damned thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she said, craning her head to look back at him, and she just managed to see the corner of his lip kick up in a smile.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t possibly be as much as I love you,\u201d he teased. She turned within his hold and wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll lose,\u201d he retorted. Before she could say another word he kissed her, and the caress was sweet, hot, loving, and perfect.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d she whispered when he lifted his head, \u201cthat we\u2019re both winners.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and released her briefly before taking hold of her hand and leading her home.</p>  </body></html>"]
