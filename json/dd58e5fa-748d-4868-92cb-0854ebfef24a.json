Disbelief warred with outrage on his hard face. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire me. I\u2019m a client. You don\u2019t fire clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Lillian Harte sat very stiffly behind her sleek, Euro-style desk, her hands clasped firmly atop the polished glass surface. She struggled to hold on to what was left of her temper. \u201cI\u2019ve been downsizing for the past few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDownsizing is for getting rid of employees, not customers. What\u2019s the matter with you? You\u2019re supposed to be running a matchmaking business here.\u201d Gabe swept out a hand to indicate the expensively furnished office and the skyline of the city of Portland, Oregon, beyond. \u201cYou need clients.</p> <p>You want clients. You don\u2019t fire them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome clients are more trouble than they\u2019re worth.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed dangerously green eyes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m one of them, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d She unclasped her hands and leaned back in her chair. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry about this.</p><p>Really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah, I can see that.\u201d His smile was cold.</p><p>\u201cThis was a mistake, Gabe. I told you that when you talked me into letting you sign on with Private Arrangements. I explained that it probably wouldn\u2019t work out well. But you refused to take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>Which was hardly a major shock, she thought. It was a good bet that Gabe had not overcome his wild Madison family legacy to build Madison Commercial, a very successful venture capital firm, by taking no for an answer. Only a Harte, such as herself, could fully appreciate the magnitude of his accomplishment.</p><p>Only a Harte knew just how far Gabe had had to go in order to live down three generations of spectacularly failed potential to rebuild an empire.</p><p>Her father had frequently speculated that Gabe had been successful because he had mastered the art of self-discipline, a rare accomplishment for a Madison. But in the few weeks that he had been a Private Arrangements client she had begun to suspect that Gabe had done more than merely learn how to control the notoriously hot blood that ran in his veins. He had subdued it with such ruthlessness that she suspected he had also crushed a lot of perfectly normal emotions along with it. As far as she could tell, he did not allow himself any strong feelings. She was convinced that he had paid a far higher price for his personal triumphs than anyone had realized.</p><p>Gabe smiled with relative ease, but he didn\u2019t laugh out loud. He didn\u2019t seem to know how to have fun.</p> <p>She had seen him annoyed, as he was now, but she had never seen him lose his temper. Her feminine intuition told her that he was very definitely attracted to women, but she was pretty sure that he did not permit himself to cross the line that separated physical satisfaction from mind-spinning passion. She was willing to bet that Gabe Madison had never allowed himself to take the risk of falling in love.</p><p>And he had expected her to find him a wife? Not a chance.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a mistake on my part,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cI knew exactly what I was doing and what I wanted when I signed on with you. You\u2019re the one who made the mistakes. Five of them, so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that all five of the dates that I arranged for you went bad, should tell both of us something,\u201d she said, trying for a soothing note.</p><p>\u201cIt tells me something, all right. It tells me that you screwed up five times.\u201d</p><p>She had known that this would be a difficult conversation but she had not expected him to be quite so rigid about the matter. After all, it was obvious that the project had not been a success. One would have thought that he would have been content with merely demanding that his money be refunded.</p><p>His icy determination not to be dismissed from her client roster was starting to make her a little uneasy.</p><p>Belatedly it occurred to her that Gabe was accustomed to fighting for what he wanted. She should have known that he would not abandon a goal without a battle.</p> <p>She propped her elbows on the desk and balanced a capped pen between her forefingers, buying herself a little time to compose her arguments. Nothing was ever simple between a Madison and a Harte, she reminded herself. The younger members of the two families liked to pretend that the old feud that had erupted between their grandfathers and destroyed a thriving business empire all those years ago didn\u2019t affect them. But they were wrong. The fallout had echoed down through three generations. Gabe was living proof that the past had the power to haunt.</p><p>\u201cI feel I have lived up to my part of the arrangement,\u201d she said. \u201cI have sent you out on five dates in the past three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig deal. Five dates. I paid for six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have complained about all five dates. In my opinion a sixth date would be a total waste of everyone\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose five bad dates were your fault.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cOr maybe the fault of your computer program. Doesn\u2019t matter. The point is, they weren\u2019t good matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She gave him a small, brightly polished smile. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how they could have been anything but perfect matches. According to my computer analysis the women I paired you with met over eighty-five percent of your requirements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly eighty-five percent? Well, there\u2019s your problem.\u201d He grinned humorlessly. \u201cThe real issue here is that you and your computer aren\u2019t doing a very good job. You haven\u2019t found me any one hundred percent matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet real, Gabe.\u201d She put the pen down very precisely using both fingers. \u201cThere is no such thing as a one hundred percent perfect match. I use a computer program, not a magic wand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, go for ninety-five.\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cI\u2019m flexible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlexible?\u201d She stared at him, completely nonplussed for two or three seconds, and then she swallowed a laugh. \u201cNo offense, but you\u2019re about as flexible as one of those steel beams they use in high-rise construction projects.\u201d</p><p>And just as tough, she thought. His hallmark uniform\u2014expensive steel-gray suits, charcoal-gray shirts, silver-and-onyx cuff links, and striped silver-and-black ties\u2014had taken on near-legendary status in the Northwest business community, which tended toward a more relaxed look. But the classy attire was poor camouflage for an iron will that had been forged in a strong fire.</p><p>The evidence of that will was plain to see. At least, it was obvious to her. It was there in the way he moved with the unconscious grace of a natural hunter. It was clear in the way he held himself and in the cool, remote, watchful expression in his eyes. Always on the alert, even when he appeared to be relaxed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a centered quality to him that was so strong it formed an invisible aura around him. This was a man who did nothing on impulse. A man in control.</p><p>What worried her the most, she admitted silently, was that she found him both compelling and fascinating.</p><p>In one sense she had known Gabe all of her life. He hailed from Eclipse Bay on the coast of Oregon where her family had always maintained a summer and vacation home. Growing up she had encountered him from time to time in the small town\u2014but he was a Madison. Everyone knew that Madison males were trouble. Nice girls might indulge a few fantasies, but they didn\u2019t date Madisons. That, coupled with their complicated family history and the fact that he was five years older than she, had formed a huge barrier. The stone wall had not been breached until the wedding of her sister, Hannah, to his brother, Rafe, a few months ago. The event had shocked and delighted the entire town, leading to much speculation about whether or not the infamous Harte-Madison feud had finally ended. The question was still unanswered in most quarters.</p><p>Meeting Gabe at the reception had left her unsettled and unaccountably restless. She had told herself she would get over it. But when he had walked into her office a few weeks later she had realized that, on some level, she had been waiting for him. She could not explain her anticipation but it had come as a cold shock to learn that he was there on business. His only goal had been to sign up as a client.</p> <p>Still, she had allowed herself a few interesting daydreams.</p><p>Then, of course, he had filled out the lengthy questionnaire she used to feed client data into her program and she had realized just how hopeless it all was. No arty types . It was, she reflected, one of the few places on the form where she was pretty certain he had been completely candid in his responses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you picked five bad matches in a row,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI picked five excellent matches.\u201d She raised one hand, fingers bunched into a loose fist. \u201cThey were all college-educated.\u201d She extended one finger. \u201cThey were all within the age span that you specified.\u201d She extended a second finger. \u201cThey all had successful careers and were financially independent.\u201d Another finger. \u201cThey were all comfortable with the idea of helping you entertain your business clients.\u201d A fourth finger went up. \u201cAnd, as you stipulated, not one of them could even remotely be described as the arty type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll five made less than subtle inquiries about my portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t they have shown an interest in it? You certainly showed great interest in their financial status. You made a huge deal about it, in fact. You wanted someone who was clearly financially well-situated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I don\u2019t want to be married for my money.\u201d He turned and started to prowl the room.</p><p>\u201cAnother thing, all five acted offended when I brought up the subject of a prenuptial contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have known better than to bring up a subject like that on a first date, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cAll five talked about extended vacations in the south of France and second homes on Maui. I don\u2019t take monthlong vacations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you take any vacations?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a company to run, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d No vacations. A real fun guy. But she refrained from voicing that observation aloud.</p><p>\u201cAnd another thing.\u201d He turned back around to face her. \u201cAll five of those women looked very high-maintenance to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not high-maintenance?\u201d</p><p>He appeared genuinely startled that she would even suggest such a possibility. His expression darkened.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I just told you, I\u2019m a very flexible man.\u201d</p><p>She sat forward abruptly. \u201cPay attention here, Gabe. According to the feedback I got from the five women I sent you out with, you showed distinct signs of being bored and impatient within half an hour after each date began.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat was approximately how long it took each time before I realized that you had picked another bad match.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you have to start sneaking glances at your watch before the entr\u00e9es arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sneaking glances. So I checked my watch occasionally. So what? Time is money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was also a general consensus among all five women that you do not have a romantic bone in your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose dates weren\u2019t about romance.\u201d He sliced one hand through the air in a quick, thoroughly disgusted arc. \u201cThey were business meetings as far as I was concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness meetings,\u201d she replied, keeping her tone very neutral. \u201cOddly enough, the women I matched you with did not view the dates in quite the same light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a wife, damn it. Not a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She cleared her throat delicately. \u201cAll five of the women reported that when they did manage to get a conversation going with you, it went nowhere because you are clearly paranoid about being married for your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be paranoid, too, if every person you dated wanted to know how much you had invested in high-tech stocks and how much in bonds and real estate.\u201d He broke off, looking thoughtful. \u201cMaybe I should have adopted an alias for the dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Lying about your identity is a great way to start a long-term relationship. And for your information, I have had more than one date with men who took what I considered an unpleasant interest in my finances. I\u2019m a Harte, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Right. Harte Investments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Anyone who knows me well understands that my brother and sister and I will each inherit a large chunk of my family\u2019s company. In addition, I haven\u2019t done badly with Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>He surveyed the well-appointed office. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that your client list is very high-end. And you sure do charge high-end fees for your services.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a cool smile. \u201cIn short, my balance sheets look very appetizing to a certain type of man.</p><p>But I don\u2019t allow that fact to color my view of the entire male population. I\u2019m not totally paranoid that every guy who asks me out is hoping to marry into money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice for you,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut a little na\u00efve, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She could feel her teeth starting to clench together. \u201cI am not na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and went to stand at the window that looked out across the rain-swept city toward the Willamette River. She followed his gaze and saw that lights were coming on all over town. The late winter day was ending swiftly. Here in the Northwest there was a price to be paid for the long, long days of summer. That fee came in the form of very short days at this time of year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, maybe I am a little paranoid about being married because of Madison Commercial,\u201d Gabe said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of close calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break. Are you telling me that the reason you\u2019ve never married is because you\u2019re afraid that every woman you meet is after your money?\u201d She did not bother to keep the skepticism out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cI find that a little tough to swallow. You haven\u2019t always been wealthy and successful. Far from it. I know exactly where you came from, remember?\u201d</p><p>He contemplated the mist that shrouded the darkening city. \u201cDuring the time when I didn\u2019t have any money I was too busy with Madison Commercial to get seriously involved with anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow that I do believe.\u201d</p><p>There was a short silence.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just caution that kept me from getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in any hurry to follow the Madison tradition.\u201d</p> <p>She watched him narrowly. \u201cWhich tradition, exactly, would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessy relationships and divorce run in my family. We\u2019re not real good at marriage.\u201d</p><p>She straightened in her chair. \u201cSorry, you can\u2019t use that excuse anymore. Your brother put an end to that famous Madison tradition when he married my sister. Rafe and Hannah\u2019s marriage is going to work out brilliantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound very sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure of it.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her over his shoulder, intent curiosity gleaming in his eyes. \u201cWhy? You didn\u2019t run them through your computer program to see if they were a good match. How can you be so certain that their marriage will work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can feel it when you\u2019re with them,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThere\u2019s a bond. I don\u2019t think either of them will ever look at anyone else as long as they have each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can feel it, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it female intuition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntuition is a funny word coming from a woman who uses a computer to match people. Wouldn\u2019t have thought you would be real big on intuition.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cEvery woman likes to think she has good intuition.\u201d This was getting into dangerous territory. \u201cDon\u2019t you believe their marriage will work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said with stunning casualness. \u201cIt\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>The absolute conviction in his words took her back for a second or two. \u201cI beg your pardon? You just accused me of relying on intuition. What makes you so sure their marriage will hold up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell isn\u2019t my intuition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple logic. For starters, it\u2019s obvious that Hannah is Rafe\u2019s passion. You know what they say about us Madisons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing gets between a Madison and his passion,\u201d she recited evenly.</p><p>\u201cRight. In addition, your family has a reputation for being good at marriage. I\u2019ve never heard of a Harte getting a divorce. I figure that makes for a winning combination for Rafe and Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Time to change the topic. \u201cWell, we seem to be in agreement on that point. Why are we arguing about it?\u201d</p><p>Gabe turned away from the window and resumed prowling the room. \u201cWe\u2019re not arguing. I just wondered how you could be so sure of your conclusions when you hadn\u2019t run Rafe and Hannah through your computer, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She glanced uneasily at the laptop on her desk. She was not about to explain that in the past few months she had been forced to admit to herself that her computer program was not the sole secret of her success as a matchmaker. But the truth was too disturbing to discuss with anyone else, let alone a Madison. She was having a hard enough time dealing with it herself.</p><p>The realization that she was relying on her intuition and a hefty dose of common sense combined with the computer\u2019s analysis to get successful matches was fraught with disturbing implications. She was, after all, assuming a huge responsibility with each client. She guided and assisted them in making one of the most important decisions of their lives. The possibility of making a mistake weighed more heavily on her with each passing day. Although nothing awful had happened yet, lately she\u2019d had the uneasy sensation that she was on extremely thin ice.</p><p>The time to get out was now, before disaster struck.</p><p>She was ready to switch careers, anyway. While her rapidly accumulating qualms about the risks of the matchmaking field were not the main reason she had decided to close down her business, they definitely constituted an added incentive to shut her doors. Fast.</p><p>She was not looking forward to announcing her intentions to her family. She knew only too well that the news would not be greeted with wild enthusiasm in the Harte clan. But she had made her plans. The only thing standing between her and her new profession was Gabe Madison. He was the last client left on her active list.</p><p>Unfortunately, getting rid of him was proving more difficult than she had anticipated.</p><p>Gabe came to a halt in front of her desk, shoved aside one edge of his sleekly cut jacket and hooked his thumb in his belt.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the bottom line here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to ditch me because I\u2019m a Madison and you\u2019re a Harte.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyes to the ceiling, seeking patience and forbearance. When she got no help from that direction, she took a deep breath instead.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s got nothing to do with this,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t give a darn about the family feud. Even if I did, I could hardly use it as a reason to drop you from my list now that your brother and my sister are married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because Rafe and Hannah got together doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve changed your opinion about the rest of us Madisons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake, Gabe, it was our grandfathers who started the feud. I couldn\u2019t care less about that old nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He gave her a razor-sharp smile. \u201cYou mean that you really believe that I\u2019m capable of making a long-term commitment?\u201d</p><p>The sarcasm was too much. She had been through a lot since the day Gabe had shown up here in her office, demanding to sign on as a client. The way he had demolished her private fantasies was the least of it.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re perfectly capable of a long-term commitment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it looks to me like you\u2019ve already made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? I\u2019m not in a relationship.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you are. You\u2019ve got a very serious, very committed, one hundred percent exclusive relationship with Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison Commercial is my company,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m committed to it. That\u2019s got nothing to do with getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat company is your passion, Gabe. You\u2019ve devoted your entire life to building that business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Madison,\u201d she said, thoroughly exasperated now. \u201cAs you just pointed out, nothing comes between a Madison and his passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, this is about me being a Madison.\u201d He jerked his thumb out of his belt and planted his hands flat on her desk. \u201cYou are biased against me because our families have a history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our family history that is the problem here.\u201d She could feel her temper rising. She had a nasty suspicion that her face was flushed. Probably an unpleasant shade of red. \u201cYou\u2019re the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me that just because I\u2019m running a successful corporation, I can\u2019t commit to a wife?\u201d</p><p>That gave her pause.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cBut I do think that you\u2019re going to have to refocus if you want to make a relationship work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine refocus.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re going about this all wrong, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to use a logical, rational, scientifically based technique to find a wife. I would have thought you, of all people, would appreciate that approach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m a Harte and you Madisons think all Hartes have ice water in their veins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do own and operate a computerized matchmaking firm, don\u2019t you? Some people would say your line of work requires a pretty cold-blooded approach to marriage.\u201d</p> <p>Damn. She would not allow Gabriel Madison to make her feel awkward right here in her own office.</p><p>She was a Harte, after all. Hartes did not put up with this sort of behavior from Madisons.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between going about the process of finding a mate in an intelligent, logical manner and going about it in a cold-blooded fashion,\u201d she said evenly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m being cold-blooded, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re the one who filled out the questionnaire that I fed into my computer program, not me.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat or two of silence. He watched her with a shuttered look.</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with the way I filled it out?\u201d he asked a little too softly.</p><p>She tapped the printouts in front of her. \u201cAccording to these results, you want a robot for a wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d He straightened and shoved his fingers through his dark hair. \u201cIf that\u2019s the conclusion your idiotic program came up with, you\u2019d damn well better see about getting some new software.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the program is at fault here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA robot, huh?\u201d He nodded once. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what went wrong on those five dates you arranged for me. Maybe you sent me out with five robots. Come to think of it, they were all a little too thin and there was something very computerlike about the way they tried to grill me on the subject of my portfolio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got exactly what you said you wanted, according to the questionnaire,\u201d she said very sweetly.</p><p>\u201cThere was no strong emotion in any of your responses except when it came to the importance of not being matched with what you call arty types and your insistence on a prenuptial agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with the lack of strong emotions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, it makes it extremely difficult to find a match for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have thought taking emotion out of the equation would have made it easier to match me, not harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in approaching marriage logically. I\u2019ve built this business on that premise. But you\u2019ve gone to extremes. You\u2019re hunting for a wife as if you were interviewing a potential employee for an executive slot at Madison Commercial. It won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His eyes were emerald hard. His voice fell to an even softer pitch. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a Madison and Madisons can\u2019t do anything without getting emotional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does it.\u201d She powered down the laptop. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the fact that you\u2019re a Madison.</p><p>You can\u2019t expect me to find you a proper match when you insist on concealing your true feelings on certain matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcealing my true feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She closed the lid of the laptop, reached down, opened a drawer and removed her shoulder bag.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute. Are you accusing me of having deliberately shaded a few of my answers on that questionnaire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She straightened and slung the strap of the bag over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t think you shaded a few of your responses. I think you lied through your teeth about everything except prenuptial agreements and arty types.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would I lie on that stupid questionnaire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? You\u2019d need to discuss that with a trained therapist. I can give you the name of one, if you want to pursue the matter. He\u2019s right here in this building. Three floors down. Dr. J. Anderson Flint.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cHis name certainly popped up in a hurry in the course of this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because he\u2019s on my mind at the moment.\u201d She glanced at the roman numerals etched on the jade green face of her watch. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a therapist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d She went to the small closet behind the desk, opened it and removed the hooded, ankle-length rain cloak inside. \u201cAnderson is doing research for a book. He wants to interview me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he specializes in treating people who have problems in their uh, physical relationships with their partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, he\u2019s a sex therapist?\u201d</p><p>She could feel herself turning red again. \u201cI believe sex therapy constitutes the major portion of his practice, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he wants to interview you. Well, now, that would certainly raise a few eyebrows back in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to get your mind out of the gutter.\u201d She scooped the laptop off her desk and stuffed it into a waterproof case. \u201cI\u2019ve got a very high success rate here at Private Arrangements. Anderson feels my computer program is the key. He is looking for ways to incorporate the principles of that program into a useful guide for couples seeking committed relationships.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sure can\u2019t prove your very high success rate by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She picked up the case containing the laptop and walked around the corner of her desk. \u201cI admit you are a glaring failure. Most of my clients, however, are satisfied with the results they get here at Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>And I intend to quit while they all feel that way, she thought, heading for the door.</p><p>Gabe grabbed his black trench coat off the coatrack. \u201cYour matchmaking program sucks in my opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made your feelings on the subject quite clear.\u201d She opened the door. \u201cAnd that is why I\u2019m releasing you from your contract with Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not releasing me, you\u2019re firing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She flipped the bank of wall switches, plunging the office into stygian gloom.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Hold on, damn it.\u201d Gabe hoisted the monogrammed leather briefcase sitting on the floor near the coatrack. \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk out on me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not walking out, I\u2019m closing my office.\u201d She stepped into the hall and jangled her keys in a pointed fashion. \u201cI just told you, I\u2019m on my way to see Dr. Flint.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged into his trench coat, leaving it unbuttoned. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly in a rush to keep the appointment. A sex therapist. I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an appointment. I\u2019m just going to drop by his office. I need to tell him something important.</p><p>Not that it\u2019s any of your business. Furthermore, I don\u2019t like the sarcastic tone of your voice. I\u2019ll have you know that Anderson is a thorough-going professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? A professional sex therapist.\u201d Gabe moved out into the hall. \u201cGuess I should show some respect. They do say it\u2019s the oldest profession. No, wait, maybe I\u2019ve got that mixed up with another line of work.\u201d</p><p>She would not dignify that with a response, she thought. She locked the office door with a quick twist of her hand and dropped the keys into her shoulder bag. Whirling around, she strode toward the elevators.</p><p>Gabe fell into step beside her. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you owe me another date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only got five dates, remember? The contract guarantees six matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. I\u2019ll refund one-sixth of the fee you paid me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my money back, I want my sixth date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter take the money.\u201d She came to a halt in front of the bank of elevators and stabbed the call button.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all you\u2019re going to get.\u201d</p><p>He flattened one hand on the wall beside her head, leaned in very close and lowered his voice to a low, dangerous pitch that made tiny chills chase down her spine.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Gabe said very deliberately. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a lawsuit over this.\u201d</p> <p>She spun around to face him and found him standing much too close.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to intimidate me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust making an observation.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a frigid smile. \u201cI can see the headlines now. President of Madison Commercial Threatens Lawsuit over Cancelled Date . Talk about looking ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me that date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Gabe. We both know you\u2019re not going to sue me. You\u2019d look like a fool in the press and that\u2019s the last thing you\u2019d want. Just think of what the publicity would do to the image of your company.\u201d</p><p>Gabe said nothing\u2014just looked at her the way Roman gladiators had no doubt studied each other before an event in the arena. Behind her the elevator doors opened with a soft sighing hiss. She turned quickly and got into the cab.</p><p>Gabe got in behind her.</p><p>She punched the floor number she wanted and then, without much hope, she also selected the lobby button. Maybe Gabe would take the hint and remain in the elevator when she got off on Anderson\u2019s floor.</p><p>She stood tensely near the control panel, watching the doors close. She was very aware of Gabe there at her shoulder, dominating the small space, using up all the oxygen so that she could hardly breathe.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d she said when she could no longer stand the silence. \u201cYou lied on that questionnaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe questionnaire has nothing to do with this. You owe me a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t enter the truth when you made your responses. You put down what you thought the truth should be.\u201d</p><p>He quirked one brow. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight and day in most cases.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened. She walked quickly out into the hall.</p><p>Gabe glided out after her. So much for hoping he would stay on board and descend to the lobby.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she said. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m on my way to talk to Dr. Flint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Doesn\u2019t he have a waiting room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you guarantee me a sixth match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it some other time. Give me a call tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to let you push me around like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t touched you,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>She would not lower herself to his level, she thought. She was a mature, sophisticated woman. More to the point, she was a Harte. Hartes did not engage in public scenes. That was more of a Madison thing.</p><p>The only option to yelling at Gabe was to pretend he was not right here, shadowing her down the hall. It was not easy.</p><p>Obviously she had pushed her luck with Private Arrangements, she thought morosely. She had waited a little too long to go out of business. If only she had stopped accepting clients the day before Gabe had walked into her office.</p><p>She reached the door marked Dr. J. Anderson Flint , opened it and walked into the waiting room.</p><p>Gabe flowed in behind her, Dracula in a very expensive black trench coat.</p><p>The first clue that the situation had the potential to deteriorate further came when she noticed that Anderson\u2019s secretary, Mrs. Collins, was not behind her desk. She realized that she had been counting on the woman\u2019s presence to ensure that Gabe behaved himself.</p><p>She glanced quickly around the serene, vaguely beige room, hoping to spot the secretary somewhere in the shadows. There was no one in sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The muffled strains of some loud, hard-core, sixties-era rock music reverberated through the wooden panels of the closed door that separated Anderson\u2019s inner office from the waiting room.</p><p>Her sense of foreboding increased for some unaccountable reason.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like Anderson\u2019s secretary has gone home early today,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably working on his notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like rock music.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnderson enjoys classic rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him pretty well, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met last month in the coffee shop downstairs.\u201d She knocked lightly on the inner door. \u201cWe have a lot in common. Similar professional interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Gabe said. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think he can hear you above the music. He\u2019s really got it cranked up in there.\u201d</p><p>The music was loud and getting louder and more intense by the second.</p> <p>She twisted the knob and opened the door.</p><p>And stopped short at the sight of J. Anderson Flint stretched out on his office sofa. He was naked except for a pair of very small, very red bikini briefs that did nothing to conceal his erection. His hands were bound at the wrists above his head. A blindfold was secured around his eyes.</p><p>A solidly built woman dressed in a skintight leather catsuit, long black leather gloves, and a pair of five-inch stiletto heels stood over him. She had one leg balanced on the back of the sofa, the other braced on the coffee table. Her back was to the door but Lillian could see that she held a small velvet whip in her right hand and a steel-studded dog collar in her left.</p><p>Neither of the room\u2019s occupants heard the door open because the music was building to its crashing finale.</p><p>Lillian tried to move and could not. It was as if she had been frozen in place by some futuristic ray gun.</p><p>\u201cSimilar professional interests, you say?\u201d Gabe murmured into her left ear.</p> <p>His undisguised amusement freed her from the effects of the invisible force field that held her immobile.</p><p>With a gasp, she managed to turn around. He blocked her path, his attention focused on the scene taking place on the sofa. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she croaked. She put both hands on his chest and shoved hard to get him out of the way.</p><p>Gabe obligingly moved, stepping aside and simultaneously reaching around her to pull the door shut on the lurid scene.</p><p>The music thundered to its rousing climax.</p><p>Lillian fled through the tasteful waiting room out into the hallway. She did not look back.</p><p>Gabe caught up with her at the elevator.</p><p>An eerie silence gripped the corridor for the count of five.</p> <p>\u201cDr. Flint obviously believes in a hands-on approach to sex therapy,\u201d Gabe remarked. \u201cI wonder just how he plans to incorporate your computer program into his treatment plans.\u201d</p><p>This could not be happening, she thought. It was some kind of bizarre hallucination, the sort of thing that could turn a person into a full-blown conspiracy theorist. Maybe some secret government agency was conducting experiments with chemicals in the drinking water.</p><p>Or maybe she was losing it. She\u2019d been under a lot of stress lately, what with making the decision to close down Private Arrangements and change careers. Having Gabe as a client hadn\u2019t helped matters, either.</p><p>No doubt about it, stress combined with secret government drinking water experiments could account for what she had just seen in Anderson\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cI think you need a drink,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Outside on the sidewalk the weird afterglow of the rainy twilight combined with the streetlamps to infuse the city with a surreal atmosphere. It was as if he and Lillian were moving through a dream sequence, Gabe thought. It was easy to believe that they were the only real, solid beings in a world composed of eerie lights and shadows.</p><p>In the strange, vaporlike mist, Lillian\u2019s flowing, iridescent rain cloak glittered like a cape woven of otherworldly gemstones. He wanted to reach out and pull her close against his side; feel the heat of her body; inhale her scent.</p><p>It was getting worse, he thought. This gut-deep awareness had hit him hard when he had first experienced it at Rafe\u2019s wedding. He had told himself it would fade quickly. Just a passing sexual attraction. Or maybe a little fevered imagination brought on by the monklike existence he had been living ever since he had turned his attention to the business of finding himself a wife.</p><p>The decision to go celibate after the end of the affair with Jennifer several months ago had seemed like a good idea at the time. He had not wanted something as superficial as lust to screw up his thinking processes while he concentrated on such an important matter. To avoid complications, he had deliberately opted to put his sex life on a temporarily inactive status.</p><p>Within about six seconds of seeing Lillian after all those years of living in separate universes, he had been inspired to revisit that particular executive decision, however.</p><p>Thankfully, he\u2019d had enough common sense still functioning at that point to convince himself that an affair with her was probably not a brilliant idea. She was a Harte, after all. Things between Hartes and Madisons were always complicated. He had come up with a compromise solution. Instead of asking her out on a date, he had signed up as a client of Private Arrangements. He had spent an inordinate amount of time convincing himself that using a professional matchmaking firm was actually a terrific plan. What better, more efficient way to find a wife?</p><p>But things had rapidly gone from dicey to disastrous. He had endured five seemingly endless evenings with five very attractive, very successful women. He had spent each of the five dates tormenting himself with visions of how much more interesting things would have been if Lillian had been the woman seated across the candlelit table.</p><p>The uncanny part was that he had never been aware of her as anything other than a Harte kid while he had been growing up in Eclipse Bay. But then, in all fairness, the only thing that had held his attention in those days was his dream of rebuilding the financial empire that had been shattered by the Harte-Madison feud.</p><p>The fact that the Hartes had resurrected themselves after the bankruptcy and gone on to prosper while his family had floundered and pretty much self-destructed had added fuel to the fire that had consumed him.</p><p>He had left Eclipse Bay the day after he graduated from high school, headed off to college and the big city to pursue his vision. He had not seen Lillian at all during the years of empire-building. He had not even thought about her.</p><p>But ever since the wedding he had been unable to think about anything else.</p><p>If this was lust, it was anything but superficial. If it was something more, he was in trouble because Lillian was not what he had pictured when he set out to look for a wife. For the first time since he had decided to get married he wondered if he should put the search for a wife on hold for a while. Just until he got this murky situation with Lillian cleared up and out of the way. He needed to be able to concentrate and she was making that impossible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He realized they had halted at a crosswalk.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, but I\u2019m walking home.\u201d Her voice was slightly muffled by the hood of her cloak.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we stop somewhere and get you that drink I suggested? I have to tell you that after watching your colleague work with a patient, I could use one, myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with me on that subject, Madison.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and reached out to take her arm. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll buy.\u201d</p><p>He steered her toward the small caf\u00e9 in the middle of the block.</p><p>She peered fixedly through the glass panes into the cozily lit interior.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d she said. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. A glass of wine sounds like an excellent idea.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled free of his hand and went toward the door with quick, crisp steps. She did not look around to see if he was following.</p><p>He made it to the door a half a step ahead of her and got it open. She did not thank him, just swept past him into the caf\u00e9.</p><p>The place was just starting to fill up with the after-work crowd. A cheerful gas fire cast an inviting glow.</p><p>The chalkboard listed several brands of beer from local microbreweries and half a dozen premium wines by the glass. Another hand-lettered menu on the wall featured a variety of oyster appetizers and happy-hour specials.</p><p>He knew this place. It was only a few streets over from the office tower that housed the headquarters of Madison Commercial. He stopped in here occasionally on his way home to his empty apartment.</p><p>\u201cCome here a lot?\u201d he asked as they settled into a wooden booth.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She picked up the miniature wine menu and studied it intently. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortland is a small town in a lot of ways. It\u2019s a wonder our paths haven\u2019t crossed before,\u201d he said, trying for a neutral topic of conversation.</p><p>She frowned at the little menu. \u201cI haven\u2019t lived here much in recent years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been since college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He was suddenly more curious than he wanted to let on.</p><p>She shrugged and put down the menu. Before she could answer his question, however, the waiter arrived to take their orders. She chose a glass of chardonnay. He asked for a beer.</p><p>When the waiter left, there was a short silence. He thought he might have to remind Lillian of the question. Somewhat to his surprise, however, she started to talk.</p> <p>\u201cAfter I graduated from college I worked in Seattle for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I moved to Hawaii.</p><p>Spent a year there. After that I went to California and then back to Seattle. I didn\u2019t return to Oregon until I decided to open Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you running matchmaking businesses in all those different places?\u201d</p><p>She eyed him with a wary expression. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen a while. Just catching up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I don\u2019t have any catching up to do. We hardly even know each other.\u201d</p><p>That was almost funny, he thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Harte and you\u2019re a Madison,\u201d he said. \u201cMy brother is now married to your sister. Trust me, we know each other.\u201d</p><p>The waiter returned with their drinks and disappeared once more. Lillian picked up her chardonnay, took a sip and set the glass down very precisely on the little napkin. He got the feeling she was debating how much to tell him about herself.</p><p>\u201cThe official Harte family version of events is that I\u2019ve spent the last few years trying to find myself,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the unofficial version?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m a little flaky.\u201d</p><p>Definitely not wife material, he thought. Probably not good affair material either. He did not date flakes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t do business with flakes, either. If he had known Private Arrangements was run by a flake, he would never have signed on as a client.</p><p>Then again, who was he kidding?</p><p>Damn. This was not a good idea. If he had any sense he would run, not walk, to the nearest exit. Some lingering vestige of self-preservation made him glance toward the door.</p><p>What the hell, he thought, turning back to Lillian. Plenty of time to escape later.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t realize any of you Hartes had to find yourselves,\u201d he said after a while. \u201cFigured you were all born knowing where you wanted to go in life and how you would get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of everyone else in the family.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI\u2019m the exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? How exceptional are you?\u201d</p><p>She studied the wine in her glass. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I haven\u2019t found my niche yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom all accounts you\u2019ve been extremely successful with Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d She raised one shoulder in dismissal. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking business success.\u201d</p><p>He went blank.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another kind?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Irritation gleamed in her eyes. \u201cOf course there\u2019s another kind.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in the booth. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about finding yourself and inner peace through work, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a problem with the concept of work as a source of happiness and personal fulfillment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a problem with people who think work is supposed to be entertainment. Work is work.\u201d He paused. \u201cProbably why they call it work instead of, say, fun. A lot of folks don\u2019t seem to get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ought to know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been working night and day since you were a boy to build Madison Commercial.\u201d She smiled wryly. \u201cFolks back in Eclipse Bay always said that you were a different kind of Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne who might actually make a success of himself. You certainly proved them right, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>How the hell had the conversation turned back on him like this?</p><p>\u201cAll I proved,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cis that you can get someplace if you want to go there badly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wanted to get where you are now very, very badly, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He did not know what to make of her in this mood, so he took another swallow of beer to give himself time to come up with a strategy.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Gabe, what do you do for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun?\u201d The question put him off stride again. He was still working on strategy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs far as I can tell, all you do is work.

This sure as hell isn\u2019t my office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. This isn\u2019t your office. So, tell me, are you having fun yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to have fun. We\u2019re here because you received a severe shock back there in Dr. J.</p><p>Anderson Flint\u2019s office. I figured you needed a glass of wine for medicinal purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason you\u2019re still hanging around is because you\u2019re trying to figure out how to get your sixth date. Forget it. Never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPay attention, Madison.\u201d She leaned forward and narrowed her eyes. \u201cIt will never happen because Private Arrangements is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? We\u2019ll talk about my sixth date when you reopen on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant closed for good. Today was the last day of business. As of five o\u2019clock this afternoon, my firm ceased operations. Get it?\u201d</p><p>She was serious, he thought. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shut down a moneymaking enterprise like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your clients?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are the last one.\u201d She raised her glass in a mocking little toast. \u201cHere\u2019s to you. Good luck finding yourself a robot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She took a sip of the wine.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you want to go out of business? You\u2019re a huge success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinancially, yes.\u201d She sat back. \u201cThat isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. You really are into this work-has-got-to-be-a-transcendent-experience thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She propped one elbow on the table and rested her chin in her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to you and fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you just got through implying that the two don\u2019t belong in the same sentence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about your relationship with Madison Commercial, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationship? Are you suggesting that the company is my mistress or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly what it looks like to me.\u201d</p><p>He was getting irritated. \u201cIs that your professional opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a matchmaker, remember? I know a good match when I see one. Tell me, what, exactly, do you get out of Madison Commercial?\u201d</p><p>He was wary now. \u201cWhat do I get out of it?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a bright-eyed, innocently inquiring look. \u201cDo you think your relationship with the company is a substitute for sex?\u201d</p><p>She was a Harte, he reminded himself. Damned if he would let her goad him.</p><p>\u201cGot news for you. In case you don\u2019t know, Ms. Matchmaker, there is no substitute for sex. What I get out of Madison Commercial is a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd power,\u201d she added a little too helpfully. \u201cBut, then, the two usually go together, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower?\u201d he repeated neutrally.</p><p>\u201cSure. You have a lot of clout here in Portland. You mingle with the movers and shakers. You\u2019re on the boards of some of the major charitable organizations. You know the players in business and politics.</p><p>People listen to you. That\u2019s called power.\u201d</p><p>He thought about it and then shrugged. \u201cI do get stuck with a lot of board meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to pretend you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. I can\u2019t believe you would have worked so hard to make Madison Commercial such an important and influential company if you weren\u2019t getting something very personal out of it. Something besides money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cthis kind of conversation isn\u2019t my forte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I would never have guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he said. \u201cJust what were you doing in all those different places you were living in for the past few years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want my whole r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hit the high spots.\u201d</p><p>She put the tips of her thumbs and forefingers together, forming a triangle around the base of her glass, and looked down into her wine.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter I graduated from college, I worked in a museum for a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe public never seemed to be compelled by the same art that fascinates me and the whole point of a successful museum is to attract the attention of the public. I wasn\u2019t very creative with the exhibitions and displays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were not real interested in the subjects you were supposed to make attractive to the public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. After that I worked in various art galleries. I had no problem figuring out what would sell, but I wasn\u2019t personally attracted to the art that most of the clients wanted to buy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to stay in business when you don\u2019t want to give your customers what they want to buy.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved ruefully. \u201cOddly enough, that\u2019s what the gallery owners said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat came next?\u201d</p><p>She turned the base of the wineglass slowly between her fingers. \u201cI switched to a career in interior design. It was okay for a while but then I started getting into arguments with my clients. They didn\u2019t always like what I thought they ought to have in their homes and offices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing worse than a client with his own personal opinion, I always say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true. I decided to get out of that field, too, but before I did, I introduced one of my clients, a software designer, to a friend of mine. I thought they made a good match and I was right. After the wedding, my software client got enthusiastic about the whole idea of designing a matchmaking program.</p><p>It sounded interesting, so I agreed to work with her on it. We consulted with some experts. I designed the questionnaire. She did the technical part. When it was finished, I bought her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you got into the matchmaking business? You just sort of fell into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChilling, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cWell, yeah, as a matter of fact, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who has pointed that out recently. I never set out to get into the business, you understand. After my ex-client finished the program, I tested it. More or less as a lark, I tried it on some acquaintances and got lucky a couple of times. People went out on dates, had a good time. An engagement or two was announced. All of a sudden, I was in the matchmaking business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn.\u201d He rubbed his jaw. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s legal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot news for you, Madison, anyone can set up in business as a matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of like the sex therapy business, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She leveled a warning finger at him. \u201cMention that subject again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHard to resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d She gave him an evil smile. \u201cNow that you know the gruesome truth, that you placed your entire future in the hands of an amateur, maybe you\u2019d like to rethink your insistence on that sixth date you say I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He picked up his beer, tilted it to his mouth, and took a long swallow.

After I get my sixth date and you shut down Private Arrangements, that is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGee, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019ll apply for an executive position at Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. Something tells me you wouldn\u2019t last long there, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m what you\u2019d call a self-motivated type. I don\u2019t like working for other people. I prefer to make the decisions and set the agenda. It would be inevitable that sooner or later I would start telling you how to run your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt which point I would have to can you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She waved a dismissive hand. \u201cAnother career path down the tubes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow important is Flint to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you not to mention his name to me again.\u201d But there was no heat in her words this time.</p><p>He decided to take a chance and push a little harder.</p><p>\u201cIf the two of you had something serious going on, I can see where the sight of all the leather might have been a little traumatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnderson and I don\u2019t have anything serious going on,\u201d she said very steadily. \u201cNot in the way you mean. I won\u2019t say I didn\u2019t enjoy his company on a few occasions but I knew from the start that he wasn\u2019t interested in me personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust your program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to help him out with his book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWas it the scene in his office that made you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She went to work on the little paper napkin that had accompanied the glass of wine, folding and creasing it in an abstract pattern. \u201cI changed my mind several days ago. That\u2019s what I was going to tell Anderson this afternoon when I went downstairs to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy back out of the project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my mind on other things right now.\u201d</p><p>He had been through too many negotiations, played too many games of strategy and brinksmanship not to know when an opponent was being evasive. But he had also had enough experience to know when to push and when to let things ride.</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might as well have dinner.\u201d</p><p>She looked up from her origami project. \u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both have to eat. Unless you\u2019ve got other plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t have any other plans.\u201d</p><p>He walked her back to a handsome brick building and saw her to her front door on the top floor. When she turned in the doorway to say good-night, he looked past her through a small foyer into the living room of her apartment. He could see warm yellow walls, white moldings near the ceiling and a lot of vividly patterned velvet pillows heaped on a brilliant purple sofa. The curved arm of a scarlet wingback chair was visible near the window. The edge of a green, yellow, and purple patterned rug peeked out from beneath an abstract glass coffee table.</p><p>The strange combination of colors and designs should have looked garish but for some reason it all went together perfectly. That was a disturbing sign but it was not what really worried him.</p><p>What bothered him the most were the glimpses he caught of the paintings hanging on the yellow walls.</p><p>There were a number of them. Not framed reproductions or posters. Lillian bought originals, apparently.</p><p>A real bad sign. She obviously cared enough about art to have formed her own opinions.</p><p>From where he stood in the doorway, he could not get a good look at any of the pictures but he got an impression of strong light and dark, edgy shadows. He thought back to the conversation in the caf\u00e9, the part where she had detailed her job history working mostly in museums and art galleries.</p><p>A sense of deep gloom settled on him. He could no longer deny the evidence of his own eyes. Lillian was into art big-time.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the drink and for dinner,\u201d she said politely.</p><p>He pulled his attention back from the ominous scene inside her apartment. Realized that she was watching him closely, maybe reading his mind.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She gripped the door with one hand, preparing to close it. A speculative expression crossed her face.</p><p>\u201cYou know, when you think about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cForget what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to get away with calling that dinner we just had my sixth date. I\u2019m not letting Private Arrangements off the hook that easily.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tightened. \u201cYou have been a difficult client from day one, Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople say stuff like that to me all the time. I try not to take it personally.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Lillian watched Octavia Brightwell\u2019s expressive face while she examined the painting. Rapt attention radiated from the gallery owner.</p><p>Octavia stood in the center of the studio, her red hair aglow in the strong light cast by the ceiling fixtures.</p><p>Her slender frame was taut with concentration; she seemed lost somewhere inside the picture propped in front of her.</p><p>Or maybe she hated the painting and didn\u2019t know how to deliver the bad news, Lillian thought.</p><p>She berated herself for the negative thinking. She considered herself to be a positive, glass-half-full kind of person under most circumstances, but when it came to her art she knew she was vulnerable.</p><p>Octavia was the first and, thus far, the only person from the art world who had seen her work. Until recently, she had allowed only the members of her family and a very few close friends to view the paintings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had always drawn and painted. She could not remember a time when she had not kept a sketchbook close at hand. She had been fascinated with watercolors and acrylics and pastels since childhood. She picked up her brushes as easily as other people picked up a knife and fork. Her family considered her painting as nothing more than a hobby but she knew the truth. It was as necessary to her as food and water and fresh air.</p><p>She had been born into a family of financial wizards and entrepreneurs. It was not that art was not respected in the Harte clan. Some of the members of her family actively collected it. But they treated it as they would any other investment. Hartes did not establish careers as artists. She\u2019d dreamed her dreams of becoming an artist but she\u2019d kept them to herself.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>The time had come to turn her dreams into reality. She could feel it. She was ready. Something inside her had changed. She sensed new dimensions in her work, new layers that had not been there in the past.</p> <p>She was sure of her decision to try her hand at painting full time, but she did not know if her work had a market. She had enough Harte business instincts to understand that in the real world, art was a commodity like any other. If there was no consumer demand for her work, there was no possibility of making her living as an artist.</p><p>The route to financial success as an artist required the support and savvy marketing of a respected dealer. The decision to show her paintings to Octavia Brightwell first had been based entirely on intuition.</p><p>Octavia owned and operated an influential gallery, Bright Visions, here in Portland. She had also opened a branch in Eclipse Bay.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Lillian prompted when she could no longer stand the suspense. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I think?\u201d Octavia appeared to have trouble dragging her gaze away from the painting. \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely extraordinary, just like the others in your Between Midnight and Dawn series.\u201d</p> <p>Something inside Lillian relaxed a little. \u201cGood. Great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Octavia turned back to the painting. \u201cI\u2019m pulling out all the stops for your upcoming show. I want maximum impact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you, Octavia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. We\u2019re both in this thing together. I have a feeling that it isn\u2019t just your career that will take off when I hang your work in my gallery. Mine is going to get a real shot in the arm as well.\u201d</p><p>Lillian laughed. \u201cSounds good to me. I\u2019ll leave you to do your job. I\u2019m off to Eclipse Bay on Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to do it? You\u2019re going to close down Private Arrangements?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but keep it to yourself for a while.\u201d Lillian folded her arms and studied the paintings that lined the studio wall. \u201cI\u2019m still working on figuring out how to break it to the family gently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it will come as a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it won\u2019t be quite as much of a blow as it was when Nick announced that he was leaving Harte Investments to write mysteries full time. After all, my grandfather had counted on him taking over the company when my father retires. But no one is going to be real thrilled when I announce that I intend to paint full time. Hartes don\u2019t become artists. They\u2019re businesspeople.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, the laptop under her arm, the hood of her rain cloak pulled low over her face, Lillian walked quickly through the misty rain toward the building that housed the offices of Private Arrangements. Her thoughts were on the conversation with Octavia. She did not see the big man until he stepped right into her path.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lillian Harte, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said fiercely.</p><p>The anger in his voice made her mouth go dry. She came to a halt in the middle of the busy sidewalk, fervently grateful for the fact that she was surrounded by a large number of people.</p><p>The man looming in front of her appeared to be in his mid-forties, big, heavily built with blunt features and thinning, short-cropped hair. She could not see his eyes. They were concealed behind a pair of dark sunglasses. Not real useful on a cloudy, rainy day, she reflected, but they certainly added a note of menacing drama.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d she asked cautiously.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d His heavy jaw jerked. \u201cBut I know you, lady. You\u2019re the matchmaker, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She clutched the laptop very tightly. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you for the past couple of days.\u201d</p><p>A blast of stark fear left her palms damp. \u201cYou followed me? You had no right to do that. I\u2019ll report you to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything illegal.\u201d He looked disgusted. \u201cI just wanted to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you were the woman who runs that matchmaking outfit, Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care who I am?\u201d</p><p>He moved in closer. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who took Heather away from me. You hooked her up with someone else, didn\u2019t you? I called her a couple of days ago. Thought I\u2019d give her another chance, y\u2019know? That\u2019s when she told me that she planned to marry this guy you set her up with. She thinks she\u2019s in love. I think you messed with her mind.\u201d</p><p>Ice touched Lillian\u2019s spine. \u201cAre you talking about Heather Summers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather was with me before you tricked her into thinking I was no good for her. She left me because of you.\u201d</p><p>It took everything Lillian had to stand her ground. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Witley.\u201d He took another step toward her, his face clenching with anger. \u201cCampbell Witley.</p><p>Heather and I were together before you came along. You ruined everything.\u201d</p><p>She glanced quickly around again, reassuring herself that she was not alone here on the sidewalk. Then she looked very steadily at Campbell Witley.</p><p>\u201cPlease, calm down, Mr. Witley. I did match a woman named Heather but when she filled out the forms I gave her she stated that she was not currently seeing anyone. I always insist that my clients be single and unattached when they sign up with my firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Heather said on your damned forms.\u201d He tapped his wide chest with a stubby thumb.</p><p>\u201cShe was with me .\u201d</p><p>Lillian remembered Heather very well. She was a shy, nonconfrontational type who would have found it extremely difficult to deal with an aggressive man like Witley.</p><p>She also recalled that Heather had been a different woman after her first date with Ted Baker. Baker was the quiet, studious sort, very much a gentleman. He and Heather had attended the opera together. It had been love at first sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOut of curiosity,\u201d Lillian said, \u201cdo you enjoy the opera, Mr. Witley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather loves the opera. I just wondered if you shared her interests.\u201d</p><p>Witley\u2019s mouth creased into a thin line. \u201cAre you saying I didn\u2019t have anything in common with her just because I wouldn\u2019t go to the damned opera? That\u2019s bullshit. Heather and I had a lot in common. We went to ball games. I took her camping. We went white-water rafting. We did lots of stuff together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose were all things that you enjoyed. But it doesn\u2019t sound as if you did many things that she liked to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what she liked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was very specific on the questionnaire I had her fill out. She is really quite passionate about the opera, you know. And she likes to attend film festivals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took Heather to the movies. We saw Battle Zone twice.\u201d</p><p>This was hopeless, Lillian thought. Campbell Witley would probably never understand, much less care, that he and Heather had had no common interests.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your personal problems, Mr. Witley, but I assure you, I had nothing to do with the breakup of your relationship,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you didn\u2019t. If it hadn\u2019t been for you, Heather would be with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did she end your relationship?\u201d</p><p>Witley scowled furiously. \u201cThe night we went to see Battle Zone the second time. When I took her home that evening, she said she didn\u2019t want to date me again. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that she broke up with you after you took her to back-to-back screenings of Battle Zone . As I recall, that film came out early last fall. I remember the ads were everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHeather didn\u2019t register with Private Arrangements until December. I matched her in January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares when she registered with your damned agency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to explain that my firm had nothing to do with the end of your relationship with Heather,\u201d</p><p>Lillian said patiently. \u201cShe didn\u2019t come to me until after the two of you had stopped seeing each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to weasel out of this. She\u2019d have come back to me by now if you hadn\u2019t fixed her up with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Lillian said as gently as possible. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like the two of you were a good match. You need an outdoorsy type. Someone who likes to camp and hike. Someone who isn\u2019t afraid to argue with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just shows how much you know. One of the things I really liked about Heather was that she never argued with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess there wouldn\u2019t have been much point.\u201d</p> <p>His face worked. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the feeling you didn\u2019t listen to her very well, Mr. Witley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a damned lie. I listened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you honestly say that Heather never once indicated that she preferred attending the opera to camping?\u201d</p><p>Witley grimaced. \u201cShe may have mentioned the opera crap a couple of times but I told her to forget it.</p><p>That highbrow stuff is boring. No beat to it, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words Heather did everything you wanted to do but you didn\u2019t do any of the things she liked.</p><p>You don\u2019t see that as a problem in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Heather and I had a great relationship.\u201d Witley\u2019s voice got louder. \u201cAnd you wrecked it.</p><p>What gives you the right to play games with other people\u2019s lives, Lillian Harte? You can\u2019t get away with treating folks like lab rats.\u201d</p><p>She held the laptop in front of her as if it were a shield. \u201cI don\u2019t treat them that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing a damned computer to figure out who people should date and marry? You don\u2019t think that isn\u2019t treating them like rats in a maze? Hell, you\u2019re like some mad scientist in a movie or something. Like you know what\u2019s best for everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Witley, I can\u2019t discuss this with you. Not while you\u2019re in this mood.\u201d</p><p>She made to step around him but he blocked her path.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mess up my life like this and then just blow me off,\u201d he said. \u201cYou took Heather away from me. You had no right to do that. You got that? No right, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019ve got to go now,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>She whirled abruptly to the left and plunged through the glass doors of the large department store that occupied most of the block. There would be security staff inside if she needed help, she thought.</p><p>But Campbell Witley did not follow her into the store. She paused in front of a cosmetics counter and glanced over her shoulder to see if he was still on the sidewalk outside.</p><p>There was no sign of him.</p><p>She stared down through the polished glass at a display of elegantly packaged face creams. Her pulse was beating too rapidly. Her stomach was doing weird things.</p><p>What gives you the right to play games with other people\u2019s lives, Lillian Harte? You can\u2019t get away with treating folks like lab rats.</p><p>She could not blame this queasy, slightly panicky feeling entirely on the scene with Campbell Witley, as unpleasant as it had been. She had been getting little foretastes of this nasty sensation for several weeks.</p><p>It was one of the reasons why she knew she had to shut down Private Arrangements.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d a solicitous voice asked from the other side of the counter.</p><p>Lillian looked up and saw immediately that the sales-woman was not offering to summon medical assistance. She was looking to make a sale.</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d Lillian pulled herself together with an effort. \u201cNo thanks. Just browsing.\u201d</p><p>The clerk\u2019s smile slipped a little the way clerks\u2019 smiles always did when you used the magic words.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if I can be of service,\u201d she said and moved off toward another potential customer.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>Lillian turned away. She wove a path through the remaining cosmetic counters, angled across accessories and shoes and exited the store through the doors on the cross street.</p><p>Outside on the sidewalk she glanced uneasily in both directions. Campbell Witley was gone.</p><p>But he had followed her home the other night. He knew where she lived.</p><p>This was scary stuff.</p><p>She took a steadying breath and walked purposefully toward her office building. She had definitely made the right decision when she had made up her mind to close down Private Arrangements. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A short while later she stepped off the elevator. Halfway down the hall she saw a familiar figure waiting for her in front of the door marked Private Arrangements. J. Anderson Flint.</p><p>She was immediately hit with a full-color flashback to the scene in Anderson\u2019s office on Friday afternoon. Every lurid detail was there, including the red bikini briefs. One of the drawbacks to having an artist\u2019s eye, she thought. You sometimes remembered things that you would just as soon forget.</p><p>It was all she could do to resist the urge to leap back into the elevator before the doors closed.</p><p>She made herself continue moving forward. There were things that had to be done before she left town.</p> <p>She could not avoid Anderson. Running away was not going to solve anything. Sooner or later she had to deal with the man.</p><p>Anderson did not notice her immediately. He was too busy checking the time on his very elegant black and gold wristwatch.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Anderson.\u201d</p><p>He turned slightly at the sound of her voice and smiled. It struck her, not for the first time, that he could have played the part of the wise, understanding, all-knowing therapist in a soap opera. He certainly had the cheekbones and the jaw for television. He also had the eyes. They were very, very blue and filled with what looked like insight. He was in his late thirties but he projected an image of wisdom and maturity far beyond his years. His thick, precision-cut, prematurely silver hair and the precision-trimmed goatee added to the impression.</p><p>Anderson was dressed more conventionally this morning than he had been the last time she had seen him. He wore a gray chunky-weave turtleneck sweater, dark tailored trousers, and loafers. He had explained to her once over coffee that a formal business suit and tie made patients tense and uncomfortable. She tried not to think about whether he had on the red bikini briefs.</p> <p>\u201cLillian.\u201d He looked relieved to see her. \u201cI was getting a little worried. It\u2019s nearly eleven o\u2019clock. I called your office several times this morning. When there was no response I thought I\u2019d come up here and see what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Anderson.\u201d She jammed the keys in the lock and opened the door with a single twist of her hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any appointments today so I used the time to take care of some personal business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She flipped on the lights and went toward her desk. \u201cWas there something you wanted?\u201d</p><p>Anderson followed her into the office. \u201cI thought we might have dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t be possible.\u201d She gave him an apologetic smile and put the laptop down on her desk. \u201cI\u2019m going to be busy all day and I have a lot to do tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just said you didn\u2019t have any appointments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting ready to leave town for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said anything about planning a trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going on vacation. I\u2019m changing careers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanging\u2014?\u201d he asked with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? You\u2019re not making any sense, Lillian.</p><p>You seem tense. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, Anderson. I\u2019m going to stay at my family\u2019s place in Eclipse Bay for a while, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. She doubted that he could have looked any more dumbfounded if she had just told him that she intended to join a cloistered order of nuns.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He pulled himself together with a visible effort. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized. Can you take that much time off from Private Arrangements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take all the time I want, Anderson. Private Arrangements went out of business Friday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped a second time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, looking genuinely baffled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I\u2019ve closed my doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he sputtered. \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk away from Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, you\u2019ve got too much invested in it.\u201d He swept out his hand to indicate their surroundings.</p><p>\u201cYour office. Your program. Your client list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lease is up next month. I made back my investment in the program several times over a long time ago. And I\u2019ve whittled my client list down to one.\u201d She waved one hand. \u201cI admit I\u2019m having a small problem getting rid of him, but I\u2019m sure that situation will soon be resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about our book project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing, Anderson. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve decided not to get involved in helping you with your book.\u201d</p><p>He went very still. \u201cSomething is wrong here. This isn\u2019t like you. Your behavior is very abnormal. It\u2019s obvious that you\u2019ve got some issues.\u201d</p><p>She propped herself on the edge of the desk and looked at him. \u201cAnderson, a very unpleasant thing happened to me this morning. A man named Campbell Witley stopped me on the street. He used to date one of my clients. You know what? Mr. Witley was really, really mad at me because I\u2019d helped his girlfriend find someone else to date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this Witley have to do with your decision to shut down your business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe pointed out in no uncertain terms that I had no right to use my computer program to meddle in other people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, I tend to agree with him.\u201d</p><p>Anderson stared at her, clearly appalled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked sharply. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>She eyed the closed laptop and wondered how to explain things to him. He probably wouldn\u2019t believe her if she told him that the program only worked in conjunction with her intuition and a dose of common sense. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe it, herself.</p><p>She needed a more technical-sounding excuse with which to fob him off.</p><p>\u201cThe program is flawed,\u201d she said finally. In a way, that wasn\u2019t really far from the truth, she thought.</p><p>\u201cFlawed. Are you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. You\u2019ve been so successful. You\u2019ve attracted so many high-end clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDumb luck, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cKeep in mind that I don\u2019t have any long-term statistics yet because I haven\u2019t been in business long enough to obtain them. It\u2019s possible that over time my matches won\u2019t prove any more successful than the ones people make on their own in the usual ways.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anderson gave her a long, considering look. \u201cI think I see the problem here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem,\u201d she said very deliberately, \u201cis that Campbell Witley has a point. I don\u2019t have the right to fiddle with other people\u2019s lives. Besides, it\u2019s too stressful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStressful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLately I\u2019ve begun to wonder\u2014what would happen if I screw up badly someday and put the wrong people together? Oh, sure, I do a comprehensive background check on all of my clients to make certain they don\u2019t have a criminal record or any history of serious mental disorders. But what if I miss something? Don\u2019t you see? There\u2019s a very real potential for disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson nodded soberly. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He shoved his hands into his pockets and rocked a little in his tasseled loafers. \u201cTo be perfectly frank, I had been meaning to broach the subject, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I wanted to get to know you a little better before I raised such a delicate question. After all, Private Arrangements is your business.\u201d</p> <p>There was something distinctly patronizing about his smile, she decided.</p><p>\u201cWhat delicate question?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>He looked at the laptop. \u201cAs you know, I have been deeply intrigued by your program for some time now, but I must admit that the fact that you have been using it without professional guidance has worried me more than somewhat.\u201d</p><p>She waited a beat. \u201cProfessional guidance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be honest here, Lillian. You don\u2019t have a background in psychology. You have no training or experience in clinical therapy or counseling techniques. It says a great deal for your program that you\u2019ve been as successful as you have thus far. But I agree that in using it for real-life matchmaking, you assumed an enormous responsibility and a degree of risk. Obviously such a sophisticated program should be used only by a professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. A professional. Like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, yes. If you\u2019re serious about getting out of the business, I would like to make you an offer for the program and the related files that you\u2019ve developed in the course of your work.\u201d</p><p>That stopped her momentarily. She hadn\u2019t bargained on this. The last thing she wanted to do was sell the program to Anderson. If he used it, he would soon discover that it didn\u2019t work very well on its own. No telling how many mistakes he might make before he realized that it was not magic.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI told you, it\u2019s flawed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there are bugs in the program?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot technical bugs,\u201d she said, trying to keep things vague. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work very well.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m sure that I have the professional background necessary to fix any small problems that might come up. I\u2019ll make you a fair offer. We can work out mutually satisfactory terms. Perhaps a licensing agreement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Private Arrangements program is not for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillian, be reasonable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve made my decision.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cObviously that confrontation with Witley was traumatic. Your state of generalized anxiety is extremely high. But I think that when you have a chance to calm down you\u2019ll see that you\u2019re overreacting.\u201d</p><p>She straightened away from the desk, walked to the door and yanked it open. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I have a lot of things to do here today, Anderson. I want to leave town the day after tomorrow. That means I don\u2019t have time for this conversation.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and then apparently decided that further argument would get him nowhere. \u201cVery well.</p><p>We\u2019ll discuss this later.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t hold your breath, she thought. But she managed what she hoped was a civil smile.</p><p>He hesitated and then took the hint and walked out into the hall. He paused.</p><p>\u201cLillian, perhaps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Anderson.\u201d She shut the door very firmly in his face.</p><p>It felt good.</p><p>Probably overreacting, but what the heck. She had a right to overreact. Between Gabe, Witley, and Anderson, she\u2019d had a very difficult week.</p><p>She went back to the desk, picked up the phone and called a familiar number.</p><p>Nella Townsend answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cTownsend Investigations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNella, its me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Lil. What can I do for you? Got a new client you want me to check out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. I want you to get some background on a man named Campbell Witley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ex-boyfriend of one.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, distinct pause on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cA problem?\u201d Nella asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I want you to find out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what have you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. All I know is that until sometime last fall he was seeing Heather Summers, a client, on a regular basis. You did a check on her when she signed up with Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. This shouldn\u2019t take long. He\u2019ll probably pop up in her file. I should have a preliminary report ready for you by the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll pick it up on my way home. Thanks, Nella. I really appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Got any plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be packing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPacking takes energy. You need to eat. Why don\u2019t you have dinner with Charles and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring the wine.\u201d</p><p>At five-thirty that afternoon, Lillian sank into a deeply cushioned chair in the living room of Nella\u2019s apartment and kicked off her shoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted. It took an entire day to pack up that office. I thought I\u2019d be finished by two o\u2019clock.</p><p>How can a person accumulate so much stuff in an office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the great mysteries of life.\u201d</p><p>Nella picked up the blue folder lying on the table and carried it across the room. She wore jeans and a deep yellow blouse with a spread collar. The gold necklace at her throat gleamed against her dark brown skin. She wore her black hair cut close to her head in a style that showed off her excellent bone structure.</p><p>She took the chair that faced Lillian\u2019s, curled one leg under her and opened the folder.</p><p>\u201cI thought you told me all of your files were stored on the hard drive of your computer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe client files are on the computer along with the program, but that still leaves a lot of paper. Receipts, correspondence, notes to the janitorial staff, messages from the company that leased me the space, you name it. I had to go through every single item and make a decision about whether to keep it or toss it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lillian exhaled deeply. \u201cBut it\u2019s done and Private Arrangements is no longer in business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Nella said. \u201cFeel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019ll feel even better after you assure me that Campbell Witley is not a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks squeaky clean to me.\u201d Nella glanced at some of her notes. \u201cWitley was in the military at one time, as you guessed. He received an honorable discharge. After leaving the service he took over his father\u2019s construction business and has been very successful. He was married for six years. Divorced. No children. No record of arrests, no outstanding warrants, no history of violence or abuse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust what I wanted to hear,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>\u201cI also managed to get hold of his ex-wife. She said Witley was the domineering type and inclined to get a little loud at times, but she sounded shocked at the suggestion that he might turn violent. She said he was, and I quote, \u2018harmless.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Nella closed the file and looked seriously at Lillian. \u201cNone of this means that he might not be dangerous under certain circumstances, you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I suppose you could say that about any man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Nella pursed her lips. \u201cThis was a fairly superficial check. I didn\u2019t have time to go deep. Want me to continue looking in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. If his ex-wife vouched for him, I\u2019m satisfied. Thanks, Nella. I really appreciate it. I\u2019ll sleep better tonight.\u201d</p><p>The sound of a key in the lock interrupted her.</p><p>Nella uncoiled from the chair. \u201cThat\u2019ll be Charles. Time to pour the wine.\u201d</p><p>Lillian twisted in the chair to give Nella\u2019s husband a welcoming wave. Charles came through the door, a long paper sack with a loaf of bread peeking out of the top in one arm, a briefcase in his hand.</p><p>He was a slender black man with serious dark eyes framed by gold-rimmed glasses and the air of an academic. He kissed his wife and released the bread to her custody. She disappeared into the kitchen.</p> <p>Charles turned his slow smile on Lillian while he removed his jacket. \u201cI hear we\u2019re celebrating the closure of Private Arrangements tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I finally took the big step. I am now officially a full-time painter. Or officially unemployed, depending on your point of view.\u201d</p><p>He nodded gravely. \u201cThis is going to put a dent in Nella\u2019s business, but I\u2019ve told you all along, that matchmaking business of yours was nothing but a lawsuit waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>Nella walked out of the kitchen with a tray of wine and cheese. She wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou\u2019re a lawyer, Charles. To you, just walking down the street is a lawsuit waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous places, streets.\u201d Charles took one of the wineglasses off the tray and lifted it in a toast.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to art.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cI love what you\u2019ve done with the guest rooms,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cVery spacious and airy.\u201d She opened the French doors of the corner suite and stepped out onto the balcony. \u201cFabulous views, too. \u201c</p> <p>Her sister, Hannah, glanced around the suite with satisfaction and then followed Lillian outside into the chilly evening.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t cheap getting plumbing into all of the rooms,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd installing balcony doors in each one was a major project but I think it will be worth it. Considering what we plan to charge for an overnight stay here at Dreamscape, Rafe and I have to be able to provide our guests with privacy and a sense of luxury.\u201d</p><p>Lillian wrapped one hand around the railing. \u201cYou and Rafe are going to do it, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re going to make this inn and restaurant idea work.\u201d</p><p>Hannah looked amused. \u201cYou had doubts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. You\u2019re both so committed to making a success of this venture that I knew you couldn\u2019t fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe owe it all to Great-Aunt Isabel.\u201d Hannah smiled. \u201cAlthough I must admit that when I first learned that she had left a half-interest in Dreamscape to Rafe in her will, I didn\u2019t feel quite so grateful.\u201d</p><p>Lillian looked out across the bay. Night was closing in rapidly. The wind was picking up, bringing with it the unmistakable scent of rain off the sea. Another storm was approaching. She had always loved this time of year here on the rugged Oregon coast. The stark contrasts of the season appealed to the artist in her. The dark, blustery storms drove away the summer tourists, leaving the town to the locals.</p><p>The shops on the pier and the handful of small, casual eateries geared down for the long, quiet months.</p><p>In summer the establishments were crowded with vacationers from Portland and Seattle. But when you went out to dinner in winter, you usually knew the folks sitting at the next table. If you didn\u2019t recognize them, they were probably students at nearby Chamberlain College or visitors attending a seminar at the Eclipse Bay Policy Studies Institute. The think tank and the school were both located on the hillside overlooking the tiny town.</p><p>When they blew ashore, the wind-driven rains of winter churned the waters of the bay, created boiling cauldrons in the coves and lashed the weather-beaten cottages on the cliffs. The squalls were often separated by periods of bright, chilly sunlight and crisp, intensely clear air. There was an energy in winter that was very different from the moody, atmospheric, fog-bound summers, she thought.</p><p>The evening was still clear. From her perch on the balcony she could see straight across the curving expanse of the semi-circular bay to where a cluster of lights marked the location of the small town and the marina. Another string of lights identified the pier.</p><p>The sweeping arc of Bayview Drive followed the edge of the rocky beach. The road started just outside of town near Hidden Cove, which marked the northern tip of the bay. It linked the tiny community to the beach houses and cottages scattered loosely about on the bluffs. It continued past her parents\u2019 summer place and beyond Dreamscape, to terminate at Sundown Point, the bay\u2019s southern boundary.</p><p>It was a familiar landscape, Lillian reflected, one she had known all of her life. She had not spent a lot of time here in recent years, but that did not affect the strong sense of connection that had swept through her earlier this afternoon when she drove into town.</p><p>For three generations Hartes had been a part of this community. Their roots went deep here; as deep as those of the Madison men.</p><p>She hugged herself against the brisk night air. \u201cAunt Isabel knew all along that you and Rafe were meant for each other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, she was certainly the only one who knew it.\u201d Hannah shook her head. \u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s far more likely that she just hoped to goodness we were meant for each other. It was her dream to resolve the feud. She saw Rafe and me as Romeo and Juliet with the right ending. She left us Dreamscape in an effort to make her fantasy of reconnecting the Hartes and the Madisons come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, it worked out for you and Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she had a touch of your gift for matchmaking,\u201d Hannah said lightly. \u201cCould be it runs in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Lil, what\u2019s going on here? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m delighted to see you. I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019ve decided to take some time off from work. But this is your sister, Hannah, remember? I know you haven\u2019t given me the whole story.\u201d</p><p>There was no point trying to evade the questions, Lillian thought. Hannah knew her too well. They had always been close even though they were different in so many ways. Hannah was nearly two years younger but she had always been the more levelheaded and goal-oriented of the two. Hannah was the one who had always known where she was going; at least that had been the general opinion in the Harte family until she had stunned everyone by announcing that she intended to marry Rafe Madison and turn Dreamscape into an inn.</p><p>True to form, however, even that uncharacteristically wild decision had turned out to be a sound one. It was obvious that Rafe and Hannah were happy together and that they would make a success of the inn.</p><p>\u201cI closed Private Arrangements,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>Hannah looked bemused. \u201cFor a few days? A couple of weeks? A month?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor good.\u201d</p><p>Hannah took a long moment to absorb and process that announcement.</p><p>Then she gave a low, soft, tuneless whistle.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust when Mom and Dad were getting used to the idea of you being a professional matchmaker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure they would ever have come around completely, anyway.\u201d Lillian sighed. \u201cThey still have a hard time telling their friends what I do for a living. In their minds my matchmaking enterprise was always a little suspect. Not nearly as respectable as that wedding consultant agency you owned before you decided to go into the inn business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll agree that Mom and Dad thought the whole thing was a little flaky, but you were successful .</p><p>They couldn\u2019t deny that. You have an impressive list of clients. All those new, wealthy software folks love the idea of computerized matchmaking. You were turning a serious profit and that counts for a lot in this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Mom and Dad think matchmaking is flaky, I can\u2019t wait to hear what they\u2019ll say about my next career move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Hannah tilted her head slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me in suspense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear every word of it.\u201d Hannah paused when a set of headlights turned into the drive that led toward Dreamscape. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid the tale will have to wait. Here comes dinner.\u201d</p><p>The low growl of a powerful, finely tuned engine rumbled in the gathering night. Lillian watched the sleek Porsche prowl down the drive.</p> <p>The vehicle came to a halt near the inn\u2019s main entrance. The engine went silent. The door on the driver\u2019s side opened. Hannah\u2019s husband, Rafe, got out, moving with the easy masculine grace that characterized all the Madison males.</p><p>A dapper salt-and-pepper Schnauzer jumped out of the open car door after him. The dog paused and looked up toward the balcony.</p><p>\u201cHello, Winston,\u201d Lillian called down. \u201cYou\u2019re as handsome as ever.\u201d</p><p>Winston bounced a little in refined appreciation of what he obviously considered no more than his due.</p><p>Then he trotted briskly up the steps and disappeared under the overhanging roof.</p><p>Rafe retrieved two grocery sacks from the interior of the car.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you guys got home,\u201d Hannah said to him. \u201cWe were starting to wonder if the two of you had stopped off at the Total Eclipse for a beer and a fast game of pool.\u201d</p><p>Rafe nudged the door of the Porsche closed and looked up. He gave Hannah and Lillian the patented Madison smile, all rakish charm and a promise of trouble to come.</p><p>\u201cSorry we\u2019re a little late,\u201d he said. \u201cRan into an old pal who just happened to show up in town late this afternoon. I invited him for dinner. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Hannah asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cJust some guy I know.\u201d</p><p>Rafe turned to look back toward the far end of the drive. Lillian followed his gaze and saw a second set of headlights coming toward the inn.</p><p>A dark-green Jaguar glided down the drive and stopped next to the Porsche.</p><p>A sudden premonition sizzled through Lillian. She gripped the railing very tightly and leaned forward to get a better look.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered. \u201cSurely he wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hannah glanced at her in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Before Lillian could answer the Jag\u2019s door opened. Gabe climbed out. His gaze went straight to the balcony.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lillian,\u201d he said much too easily. \u201cI see you got invited to dinner, too. Isn\u2019t this an amazing coincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no coincidences,\u201d Lillian said darkly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that.\u201d</p><p>She was intensely aware of Rafe and Hannah watching the little scene. They both looked amused and intrigued. \u201cWhat are you doing here? And don\u2019t try to tell me that you just decided to take a mini-vacation this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing you should know about me.\u201d Gabe walked around the front of the Jag, making for the front steps. \u201cI never do anything on a whim. You\u2019re probably thinking of Rafe, here. He\u2019s been known to get a little wild and crazy at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me,\u201d Rafe said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m a married man now. I\u2019ve settled down. I only get wild and crazy with Hannah.\u201d He gazed up at the balcony. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, it is,\u201d Hannah said. There was warmth and laughter in the words.</p><p>Gabe stopped at the foot of the steps and looked at Lillian. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really believe that I was going to let you skip out on me, did you?\u201d</p><p>She dug her fingers into the rail. \u201cI offered to repay your money.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a refund. I want what I paid for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>Rafe paused, one booted foot on the bottom step, and gave his brother an inquiring look. \u201cWhat\u2019s this all about? Sounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe owes me a date,\u201d Gabe explained. \u201cI paid for six. I only got five.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is not true,\u201d Lillian said loudly.</p><p>\u201cIt is true,\u201d Gabe assured Rafe and Hannah. \u201cI\u2019ve got a signed contract to prove it.\u201d</p><p>Aware of Rafe\u2019s and Hannah\u2019s thinly veiled amusement, Lillian felt called upon to defend herself. \u201cHe lied on the questionnaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that to cover up the fact that you did such a lousy job of matching me. Bottom line here is that I\u2019ve got another date coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of luck,\u201d she shot back. \u201cNobody gets any more dates from Private Arrangements. The company is out of business. You\u2019ll have to get your last date somewhere else.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe started up the steps. \u201cNobody takes my money and leaves town without delivering the goods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor crying out loud.\u201d Lillian leaned a little farther out over the rail. \u201cThis is ridiculous. You can\u2019t possibly be serious about one lousy date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to business, I\u2019m always serious.\u201d He disappeared into the house.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my brother for you,\u201d Rafe said, mockingly apologetic. \u201cCould have written the book on how not to get screwed in a business deal. He fixates, you know?\u201d</p><p>Before Lillian could tell him what she thought about Gabe\u2019s business style, Rafe, too, vanished beneath the overhang.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Hannah said thoughtfully. \u201cThis is an interesting turn of events.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t interesting, it\u2019s seriously aberrant behavior.\u201d Lillian continued to look uneasily over the railing into the now-empty drive. \u201cYou think maybe Gabe\u2019s gone a little nuts or something in the years since he left Eclipse Bay? Maybe the stress of building his business empire has been too much for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the empire building that\u2019s making him act weird,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s a Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you were going to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething tells me there\u2019s more to this story than your failure to live up to your end of a business contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, things started out fairly normally when Gabe signed up with Private Arrangements. I had stopped taking new clients but he seemed serious and determined. I figured okay, he\u2019s not exactly an old friend of the family, but he certainly qualifies as a longtime acquaintance, and we are sort of connected because of you and Rafe and all. I thought, what the heck? I still had the names of several nice women in my files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Lillian held out both hands, palms up. \u201cGabe became the client from hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got no choice but to move out for at least three weeks,\u201d Hannah said an hour later. She passed a large ceramic bowl across the table to Lillian. \u201cThe Willis brothers have sent us straight into remodel hell. It was bad enough when they were doing the plumbing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey kept shutting off the water without warning and we had to cope with a stack of bathroom fixtures in the front hall for ages,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cI started having nightmares featuring endless mazes of gleaming porcelain commodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe keep assuring each other that we\u2019re lucky to have the full attention of the Willis brothers,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cThere\u2019s a new wing being built up at the institute and we were worried for a while that the folks up there would lure Torrance and Walter away. Fortunately they called in outside contractors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made it through the endless commodes phase,\u201d Rafe concluded, \u201cbut there\u2019s no way we can live here while they refinish the wood floors and paint the rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see the problem.\u201d Lillian gripped the bowl in one hand and served herself a large helping of Rafe\u2019s dill-and-yogurt-laced cucumber salad. \u201cThe dust and fumes would be bad for Winston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t do us much good, either,\u201d Rafe said dryly. \u201cBesides, we need a vacation before we open for business. We\u2019re going down to California to tour some wineries in the Napa Valley. It will be a good opportunity to finalize my selections for the wine list that we\u2019ll be using in the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother astounding coincidence.\u201d Gabe dipped the edge of a wedge of sourdough bread into the fragrant curried potato stew on his plate. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to take some time off, myself.\u201d</p><p>Rafe raised a brow. \u201cGood idea. About time you grabbed a few days off. It\u2019s been a while since you got out of your office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they tell me,\u201d Gabe said noncommittally.</p><p>Lillian stilled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be here in Eclipse Bay for three or four days? That\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>Rafe chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lillian, he won\u2019t loiter long in the vicinity, if that\u2019s what\u2019s worrying you.</p><p>He can stay at Mitchell\u2019s place for a couple of days, at least until Mitchell gets back from Hawaii. But after that he\u2019ll be on borrowed time. I can safely predict that after forty-eight hours the two of them will be at each other\u2019s throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Just two days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Take it from me. Mitchell will start in with his usual lectures, telling Gabe how he\u2019s become too obsessed with M.C. Gabe will tell him where to get off. Next thing you know, Gabe will be packing his bags.\u201d</p><p>Lillian allowed herself to relax. Rafe had a point. Everyone knew that the three Madison men were notoriously stubborn and hardheaded. The trait no doubt made it next to impossible for any two or more of them to share a house for an extended period of time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Gabe raised one shoulder in easy acquiescence to Rafe\u2019s prediction. \u201cA day or two of sharing a house with Mitchell would be about all I could take.\u201d</p><p>Rafe winked at Lillian. \u201cTold you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLately he\u2019s been getting worse with the lectures, if you can believe it,\u201d Gabe continued. He shook his head sadly. \u201cIn hindsight, giving him a computer was a major mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Rafe chuckled. \u201cHe loves that thing. Took to it like a duck to water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got an aptitude for it, all right,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not using it the way I thought he would.\u201d</p><p>Lillian paused, her fork in midair. \u201cHow did you expect him to use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor good, wholesome, educational purposes. I figured he\u2019d wile away many happy hours checking out senior p**n sites. Instead, he\u2019s gotten into the habit of e-mailing me every day.\u201d</p><p>Rafe grinned. \u201cBet I can guess the content of those e-mail notes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey cover a variety of topics but they all come down to his opinion of how I\u2019m running my business and my personal life.\u201d</p><p>Lillian cleared her throat. \u201cI take it he doesn\u2019t approve of how you\u2019re handling either one?\u201d</p><p>The strong emotion in Gabe\u2019s voice startled her. Whatever was going on between Gabe and his grandfather was more than just annoying to Gabe. It was generating some real pain.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you were planning to stay with us,\u201d Hannah said gently. \u201cAs you can see, things are a mess.</p> <p>No one can be in here while the floors are being redone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Gabe added some of Rafe\u2019s homemade tomato chutney to his curry.</p><p>Rafe watched him expectantly. \u201cSo, how long, exactly, do you think you\u2019ll stay with Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be staying with him at all.\u201d Gabe waited a beat. \u201cI rented the old Buckley place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d Lillian asked warily.</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p> <p>There was a moment of acute shock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going to take off an entire month?\u201d Hannah asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to make a couple of trips back to town for some events that I couldn\u2019t scrub from my calendar,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cI\u2019m scheduled to deliver the introduction at a banquet to honor one of my former college professors, for instance. But otherwise I don\u2019t see any reason why I can\u2019t handle anything that might come up at Madison Commercial from here. I brought my computer and my fax machine and there\u2019s always the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Lillian said flatly. \u201cSomething weird is going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cThis is weird. I don\u2019t care how good you are at telecommuting. You\u2019ll have withdrawal symptoms, probably get the shakes or something if you try to stay away from your office for a whole month.\u201d</p><p>Gabe said nothing, just kept eating curry.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Rafe looked intrigued now. \u201cYou\u2019re serious about this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A sardonic look gleamed in Gabe\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve known me all of your life. Ever known me when I wasn\u2019t serious?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, can\u2019t say that I have.\u201d</p><p>An ominous sensation drifted through Lillian. She studied Gabe more closely. Something dangerous moved beneath the cool, controlled surface he presented to the world.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about getting your sixth date out of Private Arrangements, is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou were just teasing me with that nonsense. You\u2019re here because you really do want to get away for a while.\u201d</p><p>Gabe shrugged again but he did not argue the point.</p><p>Hannah turned to Gabe. \u201cIs everything okay at Madison Commercial?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>Lillian was startled by her question. She understood Hannah\u2019s concern. Anyone who knew anything about Gabe, even indirectly, was aware of how much the company meant to him. Impending trouble at Madison Commercial would certainly account for odd behavior on his part.</p><p>But she was very sure that if there were a problem with his business he would be living at his office twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week while he worked to fix it. He would not take a month off and head for the coast in the face of impending disaster.</p><p>\u201cThings are fine at M.C.\u201d Gabe ate more curry.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Rafe prompted.</p><p>Gabe swallowed, put down his fork and leaned back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cBut, nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI need a little time to concentrate on something else, that\u2019s all. I hate to admit it, but Mitchell might have a point. Maybe I have been a little too focused on business for the past few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurnout,\u201d Lillian said quietly.</p><p>They all looked at her. Gabe and Rafe had the baffled, blank expressions that were common to the male of the species when psychological explanations for behavior were offered. But Hannah nodded in immediate agreement.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cMakes sense. Lil\u2019s right. Sounds like burnout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like psychobabble to me,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about burnout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d Lillian said patiently. \u201cYou\u2019ve expended an enormous amount of physical and mental energy on Madison Commercial for years. It\u2019s no secret that you\u2019ve driven yourself very hard to make your company successful. That kind of intense focus over a long period of time takes its toll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d he asked. The words were spoken in deceptively silky tones. \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me about your checkered job history, you haven\u2019t stuck with anything long enough to burn out on it.\u201d</p><p>The blatant rudeness crackled in the solarium like sheet lightning. To Hannah and Rafe, the sharp retort must have appeared to come out of nowhere.</p><p>Afraid that Rafe was going to say something to his brother that was probably better left unsaid, Lillian moved to defuse the situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about my job history,\u201d she said to Gabe. \u201cGuess some of us are just born to be free spirits.</p><p>Funny, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny about it?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cMost people would have assumed that you would have been the one who wound up with the spotty employment record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a Madison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gave him a steely smile. \u201cWhereas I am a stable, steady, long-range planning Harte.\u201d She turned to the others. \u201cI suggested to Gabe that he might want to hire me into an executive position at Madison Commercial, but he declined on the basis of my erratic r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Gabe rested an arm along the back of his chair. He did not take his eyes off Lillian. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the reason I said I wouldn\u2019t hire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the reason?\u201d Hannah asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cShe pointed out that within a very short time she would probably be trying to tell me how to run my company. I said if that happened, I\u2019d have to fire her. We both agreed there was no point even starting down that road, given the foregone conclusion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs you can see,\u201d Lillian said, \u201cthe decision not to hire me at M.C. was mutual. The last thing I need is another short-term position on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>The tension that had cloaked the dining room lightened, as she had hoped. Hannah took her cue and shifted deftly to the new topic.</p><p>\u201cBut you are looking for a new job, I take it, now that you\u2019ve closed Private Arrangements?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d Lillian said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to apply for unemployment? That\u2019d be a first for a Harte,\u201d Gabe mused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going on unemployment.\u201d</p><p>Rafe raised one brow. \u201cAccepting a position with Harte Investments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever in a million years. It\u2019s not just that I can\u2019t work for my father. The main problem is that I\u2019m not the corporate type.\u201d</p><p>Gabe sat forward and folded his arms on the table. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite. What are you going to do next?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always painted,\u201d Hannah replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do it full time now. I\u2019m turning pro.\u201d</p><p>All three of them contemplated her as if she had just announced that she intended to go to work in a carnival sideshow.</p><p>Hannah groaned. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019ve closed Private Arrangements so that you can devote yourself to art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve closed Private Arrangements so that I can devote myself to art.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom and Dad are going to have a fit.\u201d Hannah flopped back in her chair. \u201cTo say nothing of Granddad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>Rafe reached for the coffeepot. \u201cGot any reason to think you can make a living painting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out soon enough whether it will work. Octavia Brightwell is going to put on a show of my work in her Portland gallery in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Rafe smiled wryly. \u201cI\u2019d give you the standard advice about not quitting your day job. But I guess it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch too late,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Gabe stood at the rail of the inn\u2019s broad front porch and watched the taillights of Lillian\u2019s car disappear down the drive. Rafe leaned against a nearby post. Winston was stretched out at the top of the steps, his paws dangling over the edge, ears and nose angled to take in the sounds and scents of the night. Hannah had disappeared back into the warmth of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be here in Eclipse Bay for a whole month, maybe I\u2019d better fill you in on some of the local news,\u201d Rafe said after a while.</p> <p>\u201cSave your breath. I\u2019m not real interested in gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis concerns Marilyn Thornley.\u201d</p><p>Gabe took a moment to rummage around in his memory for some images of the woman he had dated for a time in those first years after college. She had been Marilyn Caldwell in those days, the daughter of one of the wealthiest men in the region. The Caldwells\u2019 home was in Portland but, like the Hartes, they had always kept a second home in Eclipse Bay. They also had a third in Palm Springs.</p><p>Marilyn had excellent instincts when it came to selecting winners. Gabe knew that while she had viewed him as having long-term potential, Trevor Thornley had looked like more of a sure thing. She had taken a long, hard look at the two men and chosen to cast her lot with Thornley.</p><p>There had been no hard feelings on his part, Gabe reflected. He certainly couldn\u2019t fault her decision. It had been a sensible, businesslike move. Trevor had been on the fast track in the political world. It was obvious even back then that he had the charisma, the glibness and the looks required to grab and hold the media\u2019s and the public\u2019s attention. It was clear that, barring some major disaster, he would go far, maybe all the way to Washington, D.C. All he required was money. Lots of it. Marilyn\u2019s family had supplied the missing commodity. Everyone had agreed that it made sense to invest in a son-in-law who was on his way to becoming a major political powerhouse.</p><p>There had been an unexpected bonus for Thornley in the arrangement. Marilyn had proven to be a brilliant campaign strategist. With the help of the politically astute staff of the Eclipse Bay Policy Studies Institute, she had orchestrated every step of Trevor\u2019s career. Under her guidance, he had moved up steadily through the political ranks. Last fall, he had announced that he was making a bid for the U.S.</p><p>Senate.</p><p>To everyone\u2019s surprise, he had pulled out of the race shortly before Thanksgiving. The only explanation Gabe had seen in the papers was the ubiquitous personal reasons .</p><p>\u201cWhat about Marilyn?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? She and Thornley have filed for divorce. She moved into her folks\u2019 summer place here in town last month. She\u2019s got an office at the institute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA staff position?\u201d</p><p>Rafe shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s getting set to launch her own career in politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Doesn\u2019t surprise me. She was born for politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just one problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cWord is she burned through a big pile of her family\u2019s money financing Thornley\u2019s career. Apparently her folks have declined to invest any more cash in politics for a while. Rumor has it they won\u2019t be backing her. At least not until she\u2019s proven that she can win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, she needs money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Lots and lots of it,\u201d Rafe said knowingly. \u201cI mention this because it occurs to me that you have what she wants. Expect you\u2019ll be hearing from her as soon as she learns that you\u2019re back in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the heads-up. But don\u2019t worry about it. One thing I can spot real quick is a woman who\u2019s after my money.\u201d</p><p>Rafe looked out over the dark bay. \u201cThe two of you were once an item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Rafe shoved his hands into his front pockets. \u201cConsider yourself forewarned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>There was another pause. Gabe could feel his brother shifting mental gears.</p><p>\u201cYou really rented the old Buckley place for an entire month?\u201d Rafe asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to admit, it does seem a little uncharacteristic for you to do something like that. You think maybe Lillian is right? You burned out or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadisons don\u2019t do burnout. You ever heard of a Madison burning out?\u201d</p><p>Rafe thought about that. \u201cNo. Heard of one or two exploding. Couple have imploded. Of course you\u2019ve got your occasional cases of spontaneous combustion in the family. But never heard of any burnout.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you and Lillian, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think there\u2019s anything between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the first to admit that I\u2019m not the most sensitive, intuitive, perceptive guy around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCourse not. You\u2019re a Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut even I could see that every time you looked at Lillian tonight you had the same expression you get when you\u2019ve got a major deal going down at Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you said, you\u2019re not real sensitive, intuitive, or perceptive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not real stupid, either,\u201d Rafe reminded him. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that particular look when you were with any other woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillian\u2019s not a business deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold on to that thought, because I\u2019ve got a hunch that if you treat her like you would an M.C.</p><p>investment you\u2019re gonna have some serious problems.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked at Winston. \u201cMy brother, the advice columnist.\u201d</p><p>Winston cocked his head and looked intelligent. It was an expression he did very well.</p><p>Rafe contemplated the empty drive. \u201cAlways figured you\u2019d go off the rails someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a Madison and all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably inevitable. Question of genetic destiny or something. You know, I\u2019m a little sorry Hannah and Winston and I are leaving town tomorrow. Would have been interesting to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe train wreck.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The storm came and went during the night. The morning dawned bright and mild for the time of year.</p><p>The temperature was somewhere in the high fifties.</p><p>Gabe came to a halt at the top of the small bluff and looked down into Dead Hand Cove. The tide was out, exposing the five finger-shaped rocks that had given the cove its name. There were a number of dark holes and voids in the base of the cliffs. They marked a series of small caverns and caves that nature had punched into the rock.</p><p>He saw Lillian perched on one of the carelessly strewn boulders near the water\u2019s edge. The winter sun gleamed on her dark hair. The keen edge of expectation that shafted through him heightened all his senses. He felt the now-familiar tightness in his lower body.</p> <p>She wore a pair of snug black leggings that emphasized the neat curve of her calves and trim ankles. The neckline of an orange-gold sweater was visible above the collar of a scarlet jacket. Her hair was coiled into a knot at the back of her head.</p><p>She was bent intently over an open sketchbook propped on her knees.</p><p>Last night at Rafe and Hannah\u2019s he had learned the terrible truth. She wasn\u2019t just an arty type. She was a for real artist.</p><p>He watched the deft, economical movements of her hand as she worked on the drawing. There was a supple, controlled grace in the way she wielded the pencil that fascinated him. A sorceress at work on a magical spell.</p><p>A gull screeched overhead, breaking the trance that held him still at the top of the short cliff.</p><p>He pulled the collar of his black-and-tan jacket up around his ears and went down the pebbled path, moving quickly, perversely eager to get closer to his own doom. Probably a Madison thing, he thought.</p><p>She became aware of his presence when he reached the rocky patch of ground that formed the tiny sliver of beach. Lillian looked up quickly, turning her head to watch him. She seemed to go very still there on the rock. Sorceress caught in the act. He could sense the cool caution in her.</p><p>Maybe she was right to be wary of him. He sure as hell didn\u2019t understand what was happening here, either. He forced himself to move more slowly as he neared her perch, trying for the laid-back, easygoing, nonthreatening look.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you standing up there spying on me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou sure know how to make a man feel welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was alone. You startled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I usually work out in the mornings. There\u2019s no gym in the vicinity so I thought I\u2019d take a long walk, instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just decided to walk in this direction?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIs it me or do you always wake up in this charming mood?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and then returned his smile. \u201cMy turn to apologize. I shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you. I\u2019ve been feeling a little edgy lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence. So have I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d She looked wise and all-knowing. \u201cProbably the burnout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me all analyzed and diagnosed, don\u2019t you?\u201d He lowered himself onto a nearby rock. \u201cAre you on edge because I\u2019m here in Eclipse Bay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>She shot him an irritated look. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. I\u2019m on edge for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth firmed. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s the fact that I\u2019m not currently employed because I just closed my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour own fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for reminding me. I\u2019m also nervous about how well my show at the gallery will be received.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to that so he let it go.</p><p>\u201cAlso, I had a couple of rather unpleasant scenes before I left Portland. I\u2019ve been worrying about them.</p><p>Wondering if I handled them properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of scenes?\u201d</p><p>She looked out toward the five finger rocks. \u201cAnderson came to see me. He did not take it well when I told him I didn\u2019t want to work on his book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he didn\u2019t. Did you mention that you had seen him in his red underwear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as well. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about that scene, if I were you. What was the other one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man named Campbell Witley stopped me on the street to tell me that I had no business messing around in other people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p><p>Something in the tone of her voice made him look at her more closely. \u201cThis Witley guy scared you?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cMaybe. A little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe disgruntled ex-boyfriend of one of my clients. He didn\u2019t like the fact that I had matched her with someone else, even though it\u2019s obvious that Witley and Heather were not meant for each other.\u201d</p><p>He searched her face. \u201cDid he threaten you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have him checked out.\u201d He reached for the cell phone in the pocket of his jacket. \u201cMadison Commercial keeps an investigation agency on retainer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but that\u2019s not necessary. I had Townsend Investigations run a quick background check. Witley has no history of violence or abuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s okay, really.

Then her voice brightened.</p> <p>\u201cYou do have a way of boiling things down to the bare essence, Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m good at.\u201d He leaned a little to get a look at the drawing on her lap. \u201cCan I see what you\u2019re working on there?\u201d</p><p>She handed the sketchpad to him without comment.</p><p>He examined the drawing for a while and discovered that the longer he studied it, the more he wanted to look at it.</p><p>It was a picture of Dead Hand Cove but it was the cove as he had never really seen it, at least not consciously. There was a riveting intensity about Lillian\u2019s rendering of this small chunk of nature\u2014a dark promise of potent, primordial power. It called to something deep within him\u2014made him aware that he was forever linked on the cellular level to these wild forces of life.</p><p>Damn. All that in a simple sketch. It was worse than he had thought. She was good. Very, very good.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said finally. \u201cYou were wasting your time in the matchmaking business. You\u2019re an artist, all right. This is your calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean my work will sell,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He handed the sketchpad back to her. \u201cIt also doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is what you were born to do. Can I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you stop doing your art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop? You mean, just call it quits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay someone came along and said he\u2019d give you a million bucks if you agreed to never draw or paint again. Could you take the money and keep your promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked down at the sketch. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019d have to go back to it. It\u2019s a compulsion, not a choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured.\u201d He exhaled deeply. \u201cSo you\u2019ll keep doing it, even if you have to get another day job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said again. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>She sounded a little startled. Thoughtful. As if he had surprised her.</p><p>He listened to the seawater tumble in the cove. The tide was returning. Soon only the tips of the fingers would be visible.</p><p>\u201cMadison Commercial must have been like that for you all these years,\u201d Lillian said slowly. \u201cA compulsion. Something you had to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d He picked up a small stone and sent it spinning out into the foaming water. \u201cMaybe I just wanted to prove that a Madison could do what you Hartes seemed to do so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot screw up.\u201d</p><p>She looked toward the point where the stone had disappeared into the water. \u201cAre you telling me that everything you\u2019ve accomplished, all your success, happened just because you felt a sense of competition with my family?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat was part of it. At least at first. I grew up knowing that you Hartes were smart enough not to make the mistakes we Madisons have always been so good at. Your businesses prosper.</p><p>Your families are solid. Hell, your parents were actually married. What a concept.\u201d</p><p>She did not respond to that. There was no need. They both knew each other\u2019s family histories as well as they knew their own. His father, Sinclair, had been a sculptor with a passion for his art and his model, Natalie. Gabe and Rafe had been the result of that union.</p><p>The relationship between his parents had lived up to the expectations of everyone familiar with the Madison clan. The long-running affair had been fiery and tempestuous. Sinclair had never seen any reason to burden himself with the petty strings of marriage. Gabe was pretty sure his parents had loved each other in their own stormy fashion, but family life had not been what anyone could call stable, let alone normal.</p><p>He and Rafe had each learned to cope in their own ways with their erratic, eccentric, larger-than-life father and their beautiful, temperamental mother. Rafe had chosen to pretend to himself and everyone else that he did not give a damn about his own future. \u201cLive for the moment\u201d had been his motto, at least until he\u2019d come within a hair\u2019s breadth of getting himself arrested for murder.</p><p>Gabe knew that he, on the other hand, had probably gone to the other extreme. Control and a sense of order had been his bulwarks against the shifting tides of fortune and emotion that had roiled his childhood. In putting together Madison Commercial he had done everything he could to carve his own future out of granite.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rest?\u201d Lillian asked.</p><p>\u201cThe rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you could have accomplished so much just because you were inspired by a sense of competition with my family.\u201d</p><p>He shook off the brooding sensation that had settled around him like an old, well-worn coat. \u201cI\u2019m not the introspective type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes that\u2019s right. How could I forget? You made that fact very clear on the questionnaire that you filled out for Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall,\u201d she continued, \u201con the portion of the form reserved for \u2018Other Comments,\u2019 you wrote that you considered yourself pragmatic and realistic by nature. You instructed me not to waste your valuable time with any elitist academics or fuzzy-brained New Age thinkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Lillian closed the sketchpad with a snap. \u201cYou also noted that you did not want to be matched with what you called arty types .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, hell.</p><p>\u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong,\u201d Lillian said, \u201cbut I got the impression that the \u2018other comments\u2019 section of the questionnaire was one of the few places on the form where you were actually more or less truthful in your responses. Or did you shade those answers, too?\u201d</p><p>Definitely time to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cYou got anything to eat back in your cottage?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She blinked and refocused. \u201cYou\u2019re hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving. I woke up this morning and realized I didn\u2019t have any coffee in the house. Nothing to eat, either. Forgot to stop at a grocery store last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to feed you breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Be the neighborly thing to do. If I had coffee and toast and maybe some peanut butter, I\u2019d invite you to my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeanut butter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe amazed at what you can do with peanut butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, sorry to disappoint you, but I didn\u2019t pick up anything yesterday, either. I\u2019m planning to drive into town in a few minutes to get something from that bakery Rafe raved about last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncandescent Body?\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cGood idea. My brother knows food.\u201d</p><p>She was not sure why she had allowed herself to get talked into accompanying Gabe into town.</p><p>Something to do with the odd mood she was in, no doubt. But when she walked through the doors of the bakery a short time later, the heavenly fragrance of freshly baked bread quickly resolved any doubts about her decision. She suddenly realized that she was ravenous.</p><p>No one knew much about the group of New Age types who had moved into town a year ago and opened Incandescent Body near the pier. They dressed in long, colorful robes, wore a lot of jewelry that appeared to have been inspired by ancient Egyptian and Roman artifacts, and seemed a little too serene to be real. They called themselves Heralds of Future History.</p> <p>The initial reaction of the town folk had been one of acute disgust and, in some quarters, outright alarm, according to Rafe and Hannah. The town council had expressed deep concerns about the possibility that Eclipse Bay had a genuine wacko cult in its midst. The Eclipse Bay Journal had run an editorial that had advised the authorities to keep a close watch on the new crowd.</p><p>But in a town in which the only bakery had been closed for nearly three years, the Heralds of Future History soon proved to possess one major redeeming feature. They baked like angels.</p><p>It was going on ten o\u2019clock when Lillian and Gabe arrived. A number of people were sprinkled around the handful of tables. The customers were primarily a mix of local residents, a couple of rare winter tourists, and some young people in denim and khaki who looked like students from Chamberlain College.</p><p>The heads of the locals swiveled immediately toward the door when Lillian walked in with Gabe on her heels. Lillian could guess their thoughts. Hannah and Rafe\u2019s marriage a few months ago had thrilled and fascinated the entire town. And now here was another Harte woman with a Madison male. Would wonders never cease?</p><p>\u201cMaybe this wasn\u2019t such a good idea,\u201d she whispered to Gabe.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d He came to a halt at the counter and studied the artfully arranged breakfast pastries behind the glass. \u201cThe only other place open at this hour is the Total Eclipse. You don\u2019t want to eat breakfast there, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Any restaurant that uses the motto \u2018Where the sun don\u2019t shine\u2019 probably isn\u2019t a terrific breakfast spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Besides, those corn bread muffins look incredible. I\u2019m going to have two. What do you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople are staring at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He glanced around curiously, nodded civilly at the people he recognized and then turned back to the croissant display. \u201cSo what? You\u2019re a Harte. I\u2019m a Madison. Put the two together in this town and you\u2019re bound to get a few stares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, a few stares don\u2019t bother you,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re a Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right.\u201d</p><p>He approached the middle-aged woman dressed in a long, pale robe standing behind the counter. She wore a white scarf over her graying hair and a pristine white apron. A crescent-shaped amulet hung from a chain around her neck.</p><p>\u201cMay the light of future history be with you,\u201d she said politely.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cSame to you. I\u2019ll have a couple of those corn bread muffins and a cup of coffee, please.\u201d He looked over his shoulder. \u201cDecided what you want, Lillian?\u201d</p><p>She hurried forward. \u201cA croissant, please. And green tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor here or to go?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cFor here,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cSay, I recognize those voices,\u201d boomed a whiskey-and-cigar voice from the other side of a curtained doorway.</p><p>Lillian suppressed a small groan and summoned up a smile for the husky, robust woman dressed in military fatigues and boots who appeared in the opening. Arizona Snow had long since passed the age that officially placed her in the senior citizen category but she had enough energy for a far younger person. She also had a cause.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, I call this perfect timing,\u201d Arizona Snow said with evident satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cMorning, A.Z.\u201d Gabe said. \u201cHow\u2019s the conspiracy business these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose bastards up at the institute laid low for a while after your brother and Hannah managed to put a spoke in their wheel, but things are heating up again.\u201d Arizona beamed at Lillian. \u201cGood to see you back in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to see you, too,\u201d Lillian said. She waved a hand to indicate the bakery. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegular weekly briefing with the Heralds.\u201d Arizona lowered her voice to what she no doubt thought was a confidential level. \u201cInstituted the routine a couple of months ago after I got to know \u2019em better and discovered that they\u2019re not na\u00efve dupes of the agency like most everyone else around these parts. They understand what\u2019s happenin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad someone does,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Arizona leaned a little farther out the doorway, swept the outer room with a quick glance and then motioned to Lillian and Gabe. \u201cCome on back. I\u2019ll bring you up to date, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s okay, Arizona,\u201d Lillian said hastily. \u201cWe\u2019re a little busy this morning. Aren\u2019t we, Gabe?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know about you.\u201d Gabe put some money down on the counter. \u201cBut I\u2019m in no rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not ?\u201d In her wildest flights of imagination she would never have envisioned him willingly going down the rabbit hole into the alternate universe that was Arizona Snow\u2019s world.</p><p>He glanced at her, brows raised. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked amused.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you, uh, have some telecommuting to do?\u201d she asked weakly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll keep.\u201d</p><p>Arizona gave Lillian a knowing look, squinting slightly. \u201cHannah and Rafe weren\u2019t real interested in what was going on up at the institute, either, until it was damn near too late.\u201d</p><p>Lillian knew when she was beaten. She tried and failed to come up with an excuse but nothing came to mind. The bottom line was that the Hartes and the Madisons owed Arizona Snow. She was more than a little eccentric but a few months ago it had been her meticulously kept logbooks that had provided the clues Rafe and Hannah had needed to identify a murderer.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we can stay for a few minutes,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>\u201cForewarned is forearmed.\u201d Arizona held the curtain aside.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t argue with that,\u201d Gabe said. He picked up his muffins and coffee and went around the counter.</p><p>Lillian reluctantly collected her croissant and tea and trailed after him.</p><p>Arizona let the curtain fall behind them. Lillian stopped at the sight of the three men and two women grouped around a large, floured worktable. All were dressed in Herald-style attire, complete with robes and ancient-looking jewelry. Their ages were varied. The youngest was a man whose long hair was neatly bound up in a white sanitary cap. Lillian thought he was probably in his mid-twenties. The oldest was a woman with silver hair and a matronly figure. A tall man with a shaved head and a stately air appeared to be the authority figure in the group.</p><p>The Heralds regarded Lillian and Gabe with serenely polite expressions.</p><p>Arizona took up a position at the head of the table and fixed everyone in turn with a steely look.</p><p>\u201cGabe, Lillian, meet Photon, Rainbow, Daybreak, Dawn, and Beacon.\u201d She gave the Heralds a pointed look. \u201cGabe and Lillian are friends of mine. Take it from me, you can trust \u2019em. Fact is, in this town, you can trust anyone with the last name of Harte or Madison.\u201d</p> <p>Lillian nodded, determined to be polite. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Gabe inclined his head in an easy greeting. He set his mug down on a nearby table and took a bite of one of the muffins on his plate.</p><p>\u201cGreat corn bread,\u201d he said.</p><p>Photon, the man with the shaved head who seemed to be in charge, said, \u201cThank you. We do our best to introduce the light of future history into all our products. But we\u2019re only human. Sometimes our negative thoughts get into the dough in spite of our best efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLight\u2019s your secret ingredient, huh?\u201d Gabe picked up the remaining portion of the muffin. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d He took another bite.</p><p>Arizona picked up a large rolling pin and rapped it smartly on the table to get everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cEnough with the chitchat,\u201d she said. \u201cGot a briefing to get through here. Not like we have time to waste.</p><p>The future of this town, not to mention the whole country, is hanging in the balance.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone obediently moved a little closer to the table.</p><p>Arizona cleared her throat loudly.</p><p>\u201cNow, then, as I was sayin\u2019 before I heard Lillian and Gabe out front, I\u2019ve put the evidence together and it\u2019s become real clear why they\u2019re building the new wing at the institute. Official word, of course, is that it\u2019s supposed to be additional office and conference space.\u201d She broke off to give everyone at the table a meaningful look. \u201cBut I think everyone here knows that\u2019s just another one of their lies.\u201d</p><p>Lillian studied the map spread out on the table. It showed the hillside above town where the Eclipse Bay Policy Studies Institute was located. A handful of photos that looked as if they had been snapped with a long-range lens were scattered around the edges. They were pictures of what was obviously a construction zone at the institute. She could make out a truck and something that looked like electrical equipment.</p><p>Gabe leaned over the photos. \u201cGood long-range recon shots, A.Z.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d A.Z. allowed herself a proud smile. \u201cTook \u2019em with my new surveillance camera. A genuine VPX 5000. Latest model. Replaces the old 4000 series. Telephoto lens, sniper grip shutter release trigger. Half a dozen filters for day and night photo work. And a real nice leather carrying case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to sound like just another na\u00efve, innocent dupe,\u201d Lillian said, \u201cbut what makes you think they aren\u2019t adding office and conference space?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumber of factors.\u201d Arizona motioned toward the map with the rolling pin. \u201cFirst, increased volume of traffic in this sector during the past six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we talking out-of-town traffic?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cWe are, for sure,\u201d Arizona said.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Gabe took another bite of the muffin. \u201cThat\u2019s suspicious, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d said Lillian. \u201cEveryone knows the institute has been growing rapidly for some time now. They give seminars, receptions, and political theory retreats on a regular basis. In addition, they provided the springboard for Trevor Thornley\u2019s campaign. It\u2019s only natural that there would be a lot of traffic.\u201d</p><p>Arizona squinted. \u201cCover, is what it is. All that political think-tank stuff and those seminars and such make good camouflage for concealing what\u2019s really goin\u2019 on up there. Furthermore, the traffic volume didn\u2019t fall off for long after Thornley pulled out of the campaign. No sir. There was a brief lull, but by the end of November, there were more vehicles than ever going in and out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds serious, all right,\u201d Gabe concurred. \u201cWhat other factors besides increased traffic point to a clandestine operation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, geez,\u201d Lillian muttered. No one paid any attention.</p><p>\u201cMost of the construction work on the new wing is being done by contractors who aren\u2019t from around here,\u201d Arizona said ominously.</p><p>\u201cHeard something about that.\u201d Gabe examined another photo. \u201cMy brother said the Willis brothers didn\u2019t get a chunk of the construction action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t and that tells us a lot, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Arizona said.</p><p>\u201cUh, what, exactly, does it tell us?\u201d Lillian asked cautiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat they didn\u2019t want no one from around here getting a close look at what\u2019s going on up there,\u201d</p><p>Arizona announced. \u201cThat\u2019s what it tells us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably knew the Willis brothers couldn\u2019t be bribed to keep their mouths shut if they saw something suspicious,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cEveryone knows how Walter and Torrance talk.\u201d</p><p>Lillian had an urge to stomp hard on the toe of his large running shoe. She managed, with an effort, to resist.</p> <p>\u201cStands to reason they would bring in outside contractors when you think about it,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>\u201cHannah and Rafe have been keeping the Willis brothers busy for months turning Dreamscape into an inn. They wouldn\u2019t have had time to work on the new wing.\u201d</p><p>They all ignored her. So much for being the voice of reason, she thought.</p><p>\u201cVolume of overnight and regular freight deliveries has picked up recently, too,\u201d Arizona droned on. \u201cI staked out the loading dock for a couple of days. Took a whole series of shots with the VPX 5000.</p><p>Amazing how much equipment and material is being moved into that place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHigh-tech stuff?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Tons of it.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked up from the photos. \u201cWhat about heavy-duty heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning equipment?\u201d</p><p>Lillian glared at him. He paid no attention. He was really getting into this, she realized with a shock.</p><p>Enjoying himself.</p><p>Arizona gave him an approving look. \u201cThey started unloading HVAC crates last week. Got \u2019em on film.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe shook his head. \u201cNot good.\u201d</p><p>The Heralds murmured among themselves, obviously agreeing with that conclusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s not a good sign?\u201d Lillian knew her voice was rising but there was nothing she could do about it. She was getting desperate. \u201cAny large, modern business structure needs a lot of computers and commercial-grade heating and air-conditioning equipment.\u201d</p><p>This time she was totally ignored.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d estimate their security level as Class Three at the moment,\u201d Arizona said. \u201cFences have gone up around the construction perimeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly normal,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cThe last thing the institute would want is a lawsuit filed by someone who happened to trip and fall over a pile of pipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuards on the premises?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. Disguised as low-profile security, though,\u201d Arizona said. \u201cDidn\u2019t see any weapons. Probably knew that would attract too much attention in a small town like this where there\u2019s not much of a crime problem. Expect they\u2019ll wait until after the big move before they go to Class Two status and arm the guards.\u201d</p> <p>Lillian clutched her untouched croissant. \u201cWhat are you talking about? What big move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know what\u2019s happening up there,\u201d Arizona said. \u201cProblem is, we\u2019ve got no hard evidence yet.</p><p>I\u2019m stepping up my surveillance work, though. I\u2019ll try to get us some pictures that we can take to the media.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a true hero, Arizona.\u201d Photon looked at her with unconcealed admiration. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for you, we wouldn\u2019t have had a clue. Who knows how long Project Transfer would have gone undetected?\u201d</p><p>Lillian was amazed to see Arizona turn pink.</p><p>\u201cJust doin\u2019 my duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s people like you who keep this country safe for democracy,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Lillian held up her hand. \u201cAs the sole representative of the na\u00efve, innocent dupes of Eclipse Bay, I would like to ask a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead,\u201d Arizona said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, precisely, do you think is going on up at the institute, A.Z.? What is this Project Transfer you mentioned?\u201d</p><p>Arizona made a tut-tut sound.</p><p>The Heralds shook their heads sadly at Lillian\u2019s failure to grasp the obvious.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye she saw Gabe hide a quick grin behind his coffee mug.</p><p>\u201cThought it was as plain as the white lines out on the highway,\u201d Arizona said. \u201cThe secret gov\u2019mint agency in charge of Roswell and the Area 51 facility has decided it\u2019s attracting too much attention. The Internet was what did \u2019em in, I reckon. After those satellite images of the old test site went online, they knew they had a real problem. That\u2019s probably when they started making plans.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded knowingly. \u201cHad a feeling those mysterious fires in New Mexico a while back weren\u2019t accidental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right,\u201d Arizona said. \u201cNo such thing as an accident where this bunch is concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlans to do what ?\u201d Lillian demanded.</p><p>Arizona rocked back and forth in her boots and looked grim. \u201cPretty clear they\u2019re gonna transfer the bodies of those extraterrestrials they\u2019ve got in deep freeze in Area 51 along with the remains of their spaceship and all that alien technology right here to Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Gabe got into the passenger side of Lillian\u2019s car and closed the door. \u201cMakes sense when you think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes sense?\u201d Lillian turned the key in the ignition and checked the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cTransferring those frozen aliens and their UFO equipment here. Who\u2019d ever think to look for them in Eclipse Bay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it, you were enjoying yourself back there, weren\u2019t you? You were actually encouraging A.Z. in her idiotic conspiracy theories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like anything I said would have discouraged her. Everyone knows she lives in her own parallel universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it worry you that she\u2019s glommed onto the Heralds?\u201d Lillian snapped the car\u2019s gearshift into reverse and backed out of the parking space. \u201cIt was one thing when she was the lone conspiracy theorist in town. But now she\u2019s got a bunch of enthusiastic assistants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Gabe intoned darkly. \u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for pity\u2019s sake.\u201d She turned the wheel and drove out of the parking lot. \u201cYou\u2019re determined to make a joke out of it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it from my point of view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPondering the possibility that some secret gov\u2019mint agency is getting ready to transfer dead space aliens and their technology to Eclipse Bay makes an interesting change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange from what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrom thinking about that sixth date you owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She concentrated on the curving sweep of Bayview Drive. \u201cHadn\u2019t thought of that. Dare I hope that you might sign up with A.Z.\u2019s happy little band of conspiracy buffs and forget about trying to make me fulfill the terms of that contract you signed with Private Arrangements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. Thing is, I never forget about getting what I paid for.\u201d</p><p>She gripped the wheel. \u201cGabe, I told you, I\u2019d refund your money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah. With you, it\u2019s the money. You\u2019ve made that very clear from the start. I\u2019ve never known anyone as paranoid about being married for his money as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heck you aren\u2019t. On this particular subject, you\u2019re as bad as A.Z. is when it comes to secret government conspiracies.\u201d</p><p>He settled deeper into the seat and looked out over the gray waters of the bay.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not that bad,\u201d he said.</p><p>The dry, sardonic amusement that had infused his voice a moment ago was gone now. She shot him a quick glance, trying to read the shift in his mood. But his head was turned away from her. She could discern nothing from the hard angles of his profile.</p><p>She turned off the main road a short time later and went down the narrow, rutted lane that led to the old Buckley place. The weathered cottage was hunkered down on a windswept bluff overlooking a rocky stretch of beach. It looked as if it had not been lived in for a long time. The trees grew right up to the edge of the tiny yard. The blinds in the windows were yellowed with age. The porch listed a little to the right. The whole structure was badly in need of a coat of paint.</p><p>The only sign of life was Gabe\u2019s gleaming Jaguar parked in the drive.</p><p>She brought her compact to a halt in front of the sagging porch.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the lift into town.\u201d Gabe stirred and unfastened his seat belt.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>He opened the car door and paused, gazing straight ahead through the windshield.</p><p>\u201cYou really think I\u2019m a full-blown paranoid?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>This was not good. No doubt about it, Gabe was sinking deeper into a very strange mood.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I think you\u2019re a little overly concerned about the issue of being married for your money,\u201d</p><p>she said gently.</p><p>\u201cOverly concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I would characterize it, yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParanoid. About being married because of your connection to Harte Investments.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI won\u2019t say that I don\u2019t think about the possibility once in a while. As I told you, I have dated a few men who gave me some cause for concern. But I try to employ my common sense in the matter. I don\u2019t obsess on the idea that every man I meet is only interested in me because of my family\u2019s company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help noticing that you still haven\u2019t married, though.\u201d</p><p>She felt her jaw tense. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m still single has nothing to do with being secretly paranoid about being married for my inheritance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why are you still single?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. None of my business.\u201d He pushed the door open and got out. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He paused and leaned slightly to look at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you, you know, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m swell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Haven\u2019t decided. Maybe take another walk on the beach. Check my e-mail. Do some research.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaint. That\u2019s why I came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He made to close the door.</p><p>She hesitated, trying to resist the impulse that had just struck her. She failed.</p><p>\u201cGabe, wait a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>This was stupid, she thought. Just because Hannah was married to Rafe, it did not follow that she herself had to assume any responsibility for members of the Madison family. Gabe was perfectly capable of taking care of himself. If she had any sense she would keep her mouth shut.</p><p>But she could not get past the feeling that something was not as it should be with Gabe. The way he had tried to amuse himself with Arizona\u2019s conspiracy theories and now this swing to another, darker mood did not seem right. He was definitely not in a good place.</p><p>Burnout was a form of depression, she reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat about dinner?\u201d she asked before she could give herself any more time to think.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to drive back into town later this afternoon to do some serious grocery shopping. If you don\u2019t have any plans for tonight, I could pick up something and bring it over here. We can fix it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no gourmet chef like Rafe,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cFew people can cook as well as Rafe, but I can find my way around a kitchen. What about it? You interested? Or do you have other plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing I do not have is other plans,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the way, if you\u2019re going to the grocery store, could you pick up some peanut butter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it chunky style. See you for dinner.\u201d</p><p>He closed the car door with a solid-sounding kerchunk , went up the steps and disappeared into the lonely-looking house before she could figure out how to climb back out of the hole she had just dug for herself.</p><p>He heard the sound of a car\u2019s engine in the driveway just as the early winter twilight descended. A gut-deep sense of pleasurable anticipation rippled through him. He powered down the laptop computer, closed the lid and got to his feet.</p><p>He peered out the window, checking the weather. He could almost feel the weight of the heavy clouds moving in off the ocean. The storm would hit later tonight.</p><p>Perfect timing.</p><p>He crossed the threadbare carpet, opened the front door and went out onto the porch. The little rush of excitement faded at the sight of the vehicle coming toward him. It was a late-model Mercedes. Not Lillian\u2019s Honda.</p><p>The Mercedes halted in front of the steps. The door on the driver\u2019s side opened. An attractive, athletic-looking woman with stylishly cut honey-brown hair got out. She wore a pair of expensively tailored trousers and a pale silk shirt. Silver gleamed discreetly in her ears. A designer scarf in a subdued mauve print framed her long neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marilyn Thornley hadn\u2019t changed much since she had been Marilyn Caldwell, he thought. If anything, she had become more striking and more self-confident with the years. There was an invisible aura of authority and importance about her. When she walked into a room, you knew it.</p><p>She saw him watching her from the porch and gave him a glowing smile.</p><p>He did not take the smile personally. Marilyn always glowed like this whenever they occasionally encountered each other at one of the social events they both were obliged to attend. As Rafe had reminded him, he had a lot of what politicians loved most. Money. Marilyn had been a tireless fund-raiser for Trevor Thornley for years. Now she was firing up her own campaign.</p><p>Under the circumstances, he was not real surprised to see her, he thought.</p> <p>\u201cGabe.\u201d She came around the front of the Mercedes with long, purposeful strides. \u201cI heard you were in town for a while.\u201d</p><p>She was moving more quickly now, coming up the steps, heading toward him.</p><p>Belatedly he realized her intention and took a step back. But he didn\u2019t move fast enough. She had her arms around his neck, her face tilted for a welcoming kiss before he could dodge. Reflexively, he turned his head at the last instant. Her lips grazed his jaw.</p><p>The mouth thing caught him off guard. It was the first time she\u2019d pulled that stunt. But then, this was the first time he\u2019d seen her since she and Thornley had announced their intention to divorce.</p><p>She released him, giving no indication that she had even noticed his small act of avoidance. Politicians had thick skins.</p> <p>\u201cYou look wonderful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking great yourself.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an arch look. \u201cYou mean for a woman whose husband humiliated her by withdrawing from a senatorial campaign and who is in the midst of a nasty divorce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a busy year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again. Talk about stress. Life\u2019s been a little rough lately.\u201d She opened the front door of the house. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside. It\u2019s cold out here. Another storm\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got company scheduled to arrive at any minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLillian Harte?\u201d</p><p>Should have known, he thought.</p><p>Marilyn gave a throaty laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised. It\u2019s all over town that you walked into Incandescent Body bakery with her first thing this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t first thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow serious is it? You two sleeping together?\u201d</p><p>The ease with which she asked such a personal question was a forcible reminder of just how personal their own relationship had once been. He found himself wanting to protect Lillian from some vague menace that he could not quite define. Or maybe it was just the residual effect of Mitchell\u2019s notion of early-childhood education kicking in. Madison men did not kiss and tell. Mitchell had drummed that basic principle of proper masculine behavior into Rafe and Gabe early in life.</p><p>Besides, he had nothing to kiss and tell about, Gabe reminded himself.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just happened to come out here to the coast at the same time. Found ourselves at loose ends today. We both wanted some company for breakfast. No big deal.\u201d</p> <p>Marilyn winked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t cramp your style. I just wanted to say hello to an old friend.\u201d</p><p>She swept through the door of the cottage.</p><p>He glanced once more back along the drive. There was no sign of Lillian\u2019s car. Reluctantly he followed Marilyn into the small house.</p><p>\u201cGood lord, couldn\u2019t you find a better rental?\u201d Marilyn surveyed the dilapidated interior with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly your style, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Rafe and Hannah get Dreamscape open there isn\u2019t a lot of high-end rental housing available around Eclipse Bay. You know that as well as I do. It was either here or my grandfather\u2019s house.\u201d He allowed the door to close slowly behind him. \u201cKnew that wouldn\u2019t work so I picked this place. It\u2019s got everything I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get the point. You\u2019ve got a hot date with Lillian Harte and I\u2019m in the way.\u201d She settled on the arm of the shabby sofa with a regal grace. \u201cI won\u2019t stay long, I promise. I need to talk to you, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>He did not sit down. He didn\u2019t want to encourage her. Instead, he propped one shoulder against the wall and folded his arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s this all about, Marilyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to have a special reason? You and I go back a long way. We have a history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistory was never my best subject. I was a business major in college, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you signed up with Lillian\u2019s matchmaking agency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarole Rhoades. I got to know her when she did a little fund-raising for Trevor at her law firm last year.\u201d</p><p>He identified the name immediately. Carole Rhoades was one of the five women Lillian had matched with him.</p><p>\u201cPortland sure is a small town in some ways, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost as small as Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the size of the town, it\u2019s the size of the universe in which you move.\u201d She swung one long leg.</p><p>\u201cPeople who run companies like Madison Commercial tend to circulate in certain limited spheres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see I need to get out more. Broaden my horizons.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cI hear the date with Carole was a bust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought we\u2019d had a very pleasant evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she was home by ten o\u2019clock and you didn\u2019t even try to invite yourself in for a nightcap. She said it was obvious that you would much rather have been at your desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. Women talk about stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to keep that in mind.\u201d He turned his wrist slightly to check his watch. \u201cYou want to tell me why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Her smile stayed in place but he thought he saw it tighten a notch or two.</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound as though the only thing that might bring me here is business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever we\u2019ve run into each other during the past few years, you\u2019ve usually hit me up for a campaign donation for Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you have always declined to give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadisons aren\u2019t real big on political campaign contributions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that you never supported Trevor but things have changed\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A brisk knock on the back door interrupted her before she could finish the sentence.</p><p>Gabe straightened away from the wall. \u201cLooks like my guest decided to walk instead of drive this evening.\u201d</p><p>He went through the ancient kitchen and opened the back door.</p><p>Lillian stood inside the glass-enclosed rear porch, a large, well-stuffed grocery bag in her arms. She wore the hooded iridescent rain cloak he\u2019d seen in Portland, although it had not yet begun to rain. The cloak was unfastened, revealing the black turtleneck and black trousers she had on underneath. The tunic-length top was slashed with a lightning bolt of intense turquoise.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were going to drive over,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWalking seemed faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? This is Eclipse Bay, not the big bad city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, tough lady, you ought to know better than to run around an unlit, sparsely inhabited stretch of coastline after dark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to help me with this grocery sack or would you rather stand there and lecture me for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the damn sack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, you\u2019re in a swell mood tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUninvited company.\u201d He took the sack from her and stood back. \u201cMarilyn Thornley. She won\u2019t be staying long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, because I didn\u2019t bring enough food for three.\u201d</p><p>The weight of the grocery sack belied that claim, but he did not argue the point. He set it on the counter without comment.</p> <p>Marilyn appeared in the kitchen doorway. She gave Lillian the same glowing grin she\u2019d used on Gabe.</p><p>\u201cLillian. It\u2019s been ages. Good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Marilyn. Been a while,\u201d she responded sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to intrude on your little dinner party,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cI heard Gabe was in town. Thought I\u2019d stop in and say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing a little fund-raising?\u201d Lillian asked smoothly. \u201cRumor has it that you\u2019re going into politics on your own, now that Trevor is no longer in the picture.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, brittle silence during which neither woman\u2019s smile faltered.</p><p>\u201cGabe and I were just talking about how fast word travels in this town,\u201d Marilyn said with a slight edge on her voice.</p><p>\u201cI ran into Pamela McCallister at Fulton\u2019s Supermarket this afternoon,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cHer husband, Brad, is on the faculty at Chamberlain but he has a joint appointment at the institute. He says you\u2019ve already got your campaign staff organized and that you\u2019ve put Claire Jensen in charge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I haven\u2019t seen much of her in recent years but we worked together at a local restaurant one summer when we were both in college. She always said she wanted to go into politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire worked very hard on Trevor\u2019s staff. She\u2019s had a lot of experience. I think she\u2019s ready to head up a campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019ve got your sites on a seat in the U.S. Senate.\u201d</p><p>There was another brittle pause. Gabe helped Lillian with her rain cloak.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Marilyn said.</p><p>\u201cExpensive,\u201d Lillian murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Marilyn said again. \u201cPolitics is an expensive pursuit.\u201d</p><p>Lillian went to the counter, reached into the grocery sack and removed a plastic bag containing a head of dark-green broccoli. \u201cProbably not a lot of money left over after Trevor bowed out of the race last fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Thornley campaign did a lot of media, as well. The television commercials must have cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Marilyn said in a low voice. \u201cThe ads wiped out most of the war chest. We knew going in that they would be expensive, but you can\u2019t win elections without television.\u201d She paused. \u201cThere were also some additional, unplanned expenses toward the end.\u201d</p><p>The sudden anger in her voice made both Gabe and Lillian look at her.</p><p>\u201cWe were so close. So damned close,\u201d Marilyn said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it all fell apart,\u201d Lillian said quietly. \u201cI know it must have been a blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend that you don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you heard the rumors about the videos.\u201d</p><p>Gabe exchanged a glance with Lillian. They were both aware of the story behind the videos that had disappeared when the former editor of the Eclipse Bay Journal had been arrested a few months ago.</p><p>The missing films purported to show Trevor Thornley cavorting in high heels and ladies\u2019 undergarments.</p><p>\u201cI heard that those tapes, assuming they ever actually existed, were destroyed,\u201d Gabe said neutrally.</p><p>\u201cNo one I know has ever seen them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard, Jed Steadman, lied about having destroyed them without looking at them. He made copies.\u201d Marilyn\u2019s voice roughened with tightly controlled rage. \u201cHe blackmailed Trevor from jail. Said he needed the money for his trial.\u201d</p><p>Gabe exhaled slowly. \u201cThat was the unexpected additional campaign expense you mentioned? Blackmail payments to Jed Steadman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteadman was too smart to approach me,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cHe contacted Trevor. And that idiot paid him off. I couldn\u2019t believe it. When I discovered that he was actually making blackmail payments I knew the campaign was finished. But Trevor thought he could keep it all hushed up. He did not even begin to comprehend what we were up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walked out and Trevor was forced to quit the race,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any other viable option. It was obvious that Trevor was going down, but that didn\u2019t mean that I had to go down with him.\u201d Marilyn looked at Gabe. \u201cPolitics is a lot like any other business. You have to know when to cut your losses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Gabe said, keeping his voice very even. \u201cI can see the parallels.\u201d</p><p>Marilyn blinked rapidly once or twice, realizing she\u2019d gone too far. \u201cSo much for catching up on my personal news. It\u2019s getting late. I\u2019ll leave you two to your private little dinner party. Nice to see you both.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from the kitchen and started toward the front door.</p><p>Gabe looked at Lillian. She raised her brows but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out to your car,\u201d he called to Marilyn.</p><p>He caught up with her and together they went out onto the porch. The fast-moving storm clouds had cut off what little was left of the sunset\u2019s afterglow. He switched on the porch light. The wind had grown stronger while they had been inside the cottage. The limbs of the fir trees at the edge of the drive were stirring briskly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marilyn put up a well-manicured hand to keep her hair in place. She looked at her Mercedes, not at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever wonder how things might have worked out for us if we hadn\u2019t broken up?\u201d she asked in a pensive voice.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Never look back\u2019 is about the closest thing we Madisons have to a family motto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeen busy for the past few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. So have I. Sure wish I could adopt your family motto.\u201d Her mouth twisted sadly. \u201cWhen I think of all the time I invested in Trevor\u2019s career, I feel almost physically ill. Looking back, I can\u2019t believe I made such a huge mistake. How could I have been so stupid, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all make the best choices we can with the information we have available at the time we have to make them. None of us ever has enough information to be absolutely sure we\u2019re making the right choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve followed separate paths for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now we seem to be circling back toward each other. Strange how life works, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange, all right.\u201d</p> <p>She unfolded her arms and reached up to touch his cheek very lightly with her fingertips. \u201cEnjoy your dinner with Lillian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if anyone had suggested a few days or months or years ago that you might find her attractive, I would have laughed. But now that I\u2019m going through the breakup of my marriage, I view male-female relationships in a different light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLight is funny. Did you know that if you put it into corn bread dough, it makes terrific muffins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand the appeal that Lillian has for you, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to take it easy on the way back to the main road. The rains must have been heavy last month. They washed out a chunk of the drive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour family and hers have a very tangled history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I hear my cell phone ringing.\u201d He patted his pockets.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, I know you well from the old days. I remember very clearly how you measured your own success against that of Harte Investments. I can only imagine how tempting it would be for you to marry Lillian and graft a third of her family\u2019s company onto Madison Commercial. In a way, it would be the ultimate triumph for you, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have left the damn thing in the house.\u201d</p><p>He took a step back toward the partially opened door.</p><p>\u201cI know you probably aren\u2019t interested in any advice from me,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cBut for the sake of the past we share, I\u2019m going to give you some, anyway. Don\u2019t marry just to prove something to yourself or because you think it would be worth it to add a chunk of Harte Investments to your empire. I married Trevor for reasons that had nothing to do with love. It was the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d</p><p>She went down the steps, got into the Mercedes and drove away.</p><p>He watched the taillights until they disappeared, listening to the wind, aware of the oncoming storm.</p> <p>\u201cGoing to donate to her campaign?\u201d Lillian questioned.</p><p>He turned around slowly, wondering how long she had been standing there on the other side of the screen door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so.\u201d He opened the door and walked into the warmth of the house. \u201cReady to work on dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ve worked up quite an appetite. Spent the day setting up my studio in the spare bedroom at the cottage. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>She turned and disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>Had she overheard Marilyn\u2019s crack about marrying her to get a chunk of Harte Investments?</p><p>He went to stand in the doorway of the kitchen. A variety of vegetables, including the broccoli, stood on the counter. A wedge of parmesan cheese wrapped in plastic and a package of pasta were positioned nearby.</p><p>\u201cLooks like some assembly required,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both smart people. I think we can get this done.\u201d She picked up a small knife and went to work on a yellow bell pepper. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pour us a glass of wine? Probably make things go more smoothly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d He moved out of the doorway, opened a drawer and removed a corkscrew.</p><p>Lillian concentrated on the bell pepper.</p><p>He should probably say something, he thought. But he wasn\u2019t sure what she expected from him. How much had she overheard?</p><p>\u201cMarilyn just showed up a few minutes before you got here,\u201d he said. \u201cOut of the blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be back. You\u2019ve got something she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Money. You\u2019re not the first one to warn me.\u201d</p><p>Lillian dumped the sliced pepper into a bowl. \u201cIt\u2019s not your money she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is. She needs cash to fuel her campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that she wouldn\u2019t find your money useful. But what she really wants is someone she can trust completely, a man who will support her ambitions. She wants someone who will add strength and influence to her power base. Someone whose goals won\u2019t conflict with hers and who will not try to compete with her.\u201d</p><p>The cork came out of the bottle with a small pop. \u201cYou could tell all that in the five minutes you spent talking to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m a former matchmaker, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, right. I keep forgetting about your famous matchmaking intuition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, mock me at your own peril. But I\u2019m here to tell you that you\u2019ve got a lot of what she\u2019s looking for in a husband.\u201d Lillian paused, head tipped slightly to the side. \u201cAnd you know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of what you stated you wanted on the Private Arrangements questionnaire. Say, maybe you were a tad more honest in your responses than I thought.\u201d</p><p>He poured two glasses of the cabernet, grimly pleased that his hand remained steady. \u201cMarilyn and I already tried the couple thing. It didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Lillian put down the knife and picked up one of the wineglasses. \u201cMarilyn meets a lot of the requirements you listed. There\u2019s money in her family. Even if they have cut off her campaign allowance for the moment, she\u2019ll inherit a nice bit of the Caldwell fortune someday. She\u2019s not an elitist academic or a fuzzy-brained New Age thinker.\u201d She paused a beat. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not the arty type.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the refrigerator and swirled the wine in his glass. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Think she and I would be a good match if we gave it another try?\u201d</p><p>She reached for the box of pasta. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecisive. I like that in a matchmaker. Why don\u2019t you think she and I would be a good match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you lied on the questionnaire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn your opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine is the only one that counts here,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cI\u2019m the professional, remember?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The storm crashed ashore shortly after ten o\u2019clock. Time to go, Lillian thought. The edgy intimacy that had been thickening the atmosphere all evening was getting to her. She could no longer ignore the vibes.</p><p>If she hung around any longer she might embarrass herself by making a pass at Gabe.</p> <p>She put down her cards. \u201cGin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. Not again.\u201d Gabe tossed his cards onto the cushion between them. He sprawled against the back of the sofa and regarded her with a malevolent expression. \u201cDidn\u2019t realize you were the competitive type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Harte, remember? We\u2019re all competitive in some ways. Besides, it was your idea to play gin rummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t concentrating. Had my mind on other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. They all say that when they lose to me.\u201d She looked out the window into the heavy darkness. \u201cI\u2019d better be on my way. That rain is going to get worse before it gets better.\u201d</p><p>He uncoiled from the depths of the sagging sofa. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you back to your cottage.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t have to sound quite so eager to get rid of her, she thought. But it was probably for the best. At least his mood seemed lighter now. Her mission of mercy was accomplished.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She rose quickly, a sense of urgency pulsing through her.</p><p>She had left it too long, she thought. It was past time to leave. She was not sure when or how it had happened but she was suddenly, intensely aware of the heavy blanket of sensual awareness that enveloped her. It had settled around her slowly and lightly over the course of the evening, the warm, thick folds practically weightless until now.</p><p>She wondered if Gabe felt anything at all. If he did, he was doing a terrific job of concealing it.</p><p>He was already at the door, her rain cloak in his hand. Obviously she was the only one who could feel the energy of the storm gathering here inside this room.</p><p>The smartest thing she could do tonight was leave right now and go straight home to her own bed.</p><p>She touched the back of a chair briefly to steady herself, took a deep breath and walked deliberately toward him.</p><p>\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you,\u201d he said when she reached the place where he waited with her cloak.</p> <p>She turned her back to him so that he could help her into the garment. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you invite yourself over here tonight just because you thought I needed cheering up or did you have something else in mind?\u201d</p><p>She froze, her hands slightly raised to take the edges of the cloak from him.</p><p>\u201cNot that I don\u2019t appreciate the neighborly gesture,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe were both at loose ends this evening.\u201d She was irritated now. \u201cAnd we are neighbors. Sort of. And you did seem a little moody this morning. Dinner together sounded reasonable. If you\u2019ve got a problem with that, I\u2019ll make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. You\u2019ve got teeth, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I just wanted to let you know that I don\u2019t need any do-gooder nurturing. I\u2019d much rather you had another agenda.\u201d</p><p>He draped the cloak around her shoulders. When he was finished he did not release her and step back.</p><p>Instead he stayed there, so close that she could feel the heat of his body. He rested his hands on her, letting her feel the weight and strength of them.</p><p>\u201cAnother agenda?\u201d She twitched the cloak into place, fussing with it a bit to cover her awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cSuch as exploring various strategies we can use to help A.Z. prove that a secret government agency is planning to move frozen space aliens into the institute?\u201d</p><p>He tightened his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI was thinking more along the lines of you seducing me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth. And closed it immediately when she realized she did not know what to say.</p><p>\u201cYou know, just to help lift my mood.\u201d His voice roughened a little. Getting dangerous. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be too much different from inviting yourself over for dinner so that I wouldn\u2019t be alone. Just another little act of charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already gave at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much for small acts of random kindness.\u201d</p><p>His lifted her hair aside and kissed the nape of her neck. Electricity went down her spine. The room dissolved into a thousand different hues. She was inside the rainbow.</p><p>\u201cGabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you felt sorry for me,\u201d he said against her nape. \u201cI thought you were genuinely concerned about my burnout problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Gabe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot another question for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. It\u2019s been eating at me for weeks. I\u2019ve got to know. Did you ever fill out one of your own questionnaires and run it through your computer program to see if you could find the perfect match for yourself?\u201d</p><p>The question blindsided her. It caught her up with the force of a heavy wave, sweeping her off her feet and roiling her senses. She pulled herself together with an effort.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very chatty all of a sudden, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>She felt the heat rise in her face. Damn . \u201cI don\u2019t owe you any answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So you did try to match yourself. I had a hunch you might have done it. Who could resist? There you were with your program and all those potential dates. What happened? No good candidates on your list of clients? Hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthe program is not foolproof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but it\u2019s got a very high degree of accuracy. You assured me of that when I signed on. What went wrong? Didn\u2019t like the matches it selected for you?\u201d</p><p>She put out her hand and closed her fingers around the doorknob. \u201cTake me home, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr did you lose your nerve? It\u2019s one thing to use intuition and the results of a questionnaire to help other people make a decision that will affect them for a lifetime.\u201d He turned her slowly around to face him. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing altogether to use them to make a choice that will affect your own life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGabe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe your mistake was in looking too far ahead,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHell, maybe I was making the same mistake. Maybe we should both stop obsessing on the long term and focus more on the short term.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cHow short a term are we talking about here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with tonight.\u201d He kissed her throat. \u201cWe\u2019ll reassess matters in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>She stiffened. \u201cI don\u2019t do one-night time frames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go, trying to think too far ahead again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoading me will not work,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not respond to taunts or dares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t. You\u2019re a Harte.\u201d He leaned his forehead against hers. His thumb moved along the line of her jaw. \u201cWhat will work?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, inhaled some of the dancing storm energy that swirled around them and used it to fortify herself.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to admit that you cheated on the Private Arrangements questionnaire,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that damned questionnaire have to do with what\u2019s happening between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran the one you filled out through my program. Compared it with one that I had filled out on myself. If you were completely honest in all your responses on that form, I have to tell you that we are definitely not a good match, Gabe. Not even in the short term.\u201d</p><p>For the space of two or three heartbeats, he went utterly motionless.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I did shade some of the answers?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThen the conclusions were invalid, of course.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled slowly. \u201cI lied through my teeth on most of them.\u201d</p><p>She touched the tip of her tongue to her lower lip. \u201cHonest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear it on my honor as a Madison,\u201d he said against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d Satisfaction unfurled within her. She put both arms around his neck. \u201cI was sure of it. Even the one about\u2014?\u201d</p><p>His mouth closed on hers before she could finish the question. He kissed her, long and hard and deep; so deep that she forgot everything else.</p><p>The colors of the rainbow that surrounded her grew brighter, becoming almost painfully intense. She had to close her eyes against the shattering brilliance.</p><p>She kissed Gabe back, full on his warm, hard, incredibly sexy mouth. She gave it everything she had, moving into the moment the way she did when she was painting all out; flying with the vision, trying to get it down on the canvas before it evaporated.</p><p>Rain pounded on the roof of the cottage. Wind lashed at the windows. Electricity arced in the atmosphere. The night was alive and so was she.</p> <p>She was vaguely aware of the rain cloak sliding off her shoulders. And then she realized that her feet no longer touched the floor. Gabe had picked her up in his arms.</p><p>She turned her face against his chest, savoring the scent of his body and the strength of his arms. She spread the fingers of one hand across the expanse of his chest. Beneath the fabric of his pullover, he was hard and sleek.</p><p>He carried her into the cottage\u2019s tiny bedroom and tumbled her down onto the old-fashioned four-poster. Her shoes thudded softly on the old rug. He straightened, peeled off his pullover in a single, sweeping motion and tossed it carelessly aside. It caught on a bedpost.</p><p>He never took his eyes off her as he stripped off his trousers and briefs. His hands were quick and ruthlessly efficient. The sight of his heavily aroused body elicited an immediate reaction far inside her. She was suddenly aware of a liquid heat pooling in her lower body.</p><p>He paused long enough to open a drawer in the nightstand. She heard foil tear in the darkness.</p><p>And then he was on the quilt with her, looming over her, caging her between his arms. The ancient bed squeaked beneath his weight. If she had tried to sketch him at that moment, she knew the result would have been a picture composed of dark light, strong shadows, and fathomless pools of mystery.</p><p>He tugged the tunic off over her head. Unfastened the satin bra. Excitement sent another flood of brilliant colors through her when he touched her br**sts. She could hardly breathe. All of her senses sharpened and focused.</p><p>Gabe slid one leg between her thighs. He shifted his mouth back to hers in a heavy, drugging kiss.</p><p>She gripped his shoulders, digging her fingers into his bare skin. His hard body cut off what little light came through the doorway from the main room. She could hear the storm swirling outside the cottage, weaving a magic force field that held the rest of the world at bay. At least for now.</p><p>His hands moved on her again. Her trousers disappeared. They were soon followed by her panties.</p><p>He moved his hand across her stomach and down to the place where she was hot and wet and full. He stroked her as if he were now the painter, applying colors with lavish passion and precision. Getting into his art.</p><p>She wanted to tell him to slow down. She needed time to adjust to this unfamiliar level of raw, physical sensation; time to savor the sweep and nuance of the hues of this amazing rainbow.</p><p>But time was out of her control, along with everything else tonight. When he found her again with his fingers, she screamed. It was too much.</p><p>Her body clenched violently. The rainbow pulsed. Neon brights, effervescent blues and glorious, eye-searing reds filled the shadows with light. She could not think; could not sort out impressions or emotions.</p><p>He surged into her at that moment, spilling a whole new palette across the canvas. These were the mysterious, unnamable hues that she had seen only in her dreams.</p><p>She felt the rigid tension in the muscles and bone beneath his skin and knew that he was no longer in control either. His release crashed through both of them.</p><p>The first thing she noticed when she awoke a long time later was that she could not move. Gabe had her pinned to the bed with one heavy arm wrapped around her midsection and a muscular leg thrown across her thigh.</p><p>The second thing she became aware of was that the storm winds had died down. She could still hear gentle rain on the roof, and the darkness on the other side of the window remained immutable. But the world outside was a much quieter, calmer place than it had been earlier.</p><p>She lay still, partly because she knew that if she tried to move she would awaken Gabe and she was not at all certain she wanted to do that. Not yet, at any rate. She had things to think about and she needed to think without distractions.</p><p>Now that the chaos of passion had resolved itself, the first thing she ought to do was take a cold, hard look at what had happened between herself and Gabe. Life had suddenly become extremely complicated.</p><p>But she could not bring herself to focus just yet on her new problems. First she would allow herself the pleasure of absorbing the myriad impressions she had not been able to catalog and enjoy in the heat and turmoil of what had happened earlier.

Sex with Gabe had been as disorienting, thrilling, and ultimately as disturbing as that flash of recognition that sometimes struck while she was in the process of trying to translate a vision onto a canvas. In those rare moments of acute awareness she could see the whole picture in her mind. But the images came so swiftly, so relentlessly, that it was impossible to paint fast enough to keep up with them. She had learned to concentrate on the critical elements, the core of the vision, knowing that she could go back later to fill in the less essential parts.</p><p>Now she tried to do just that, calling up the little details that she had missed during the passionate encounter. The way his fingers had closed around her thigh. The way his teeth had grazed a nipple. The way his tongue\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou awake?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>He shifted a little, settling her more comfortably into the curve of his body. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>She smiled into the pillow and said nothing.</p><p>He nibbled gently on her shoulder. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering why you lied on the Private Arrangements questionnaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t let it go, can you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to throw it in my face again and again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, why do you think I lied?\u201d</p><p>She propped herself up on one elbow and looked down at him, trying to read his expression in the shadows. Impossible. \u201cI think you fiddled with the responses because subconsciously you didn\u2019t want me to find you a perfect match. You set things up so that failure was the only option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Why the hell would I do that after paying you all that money for some good matches?\u201d</p> <p>She put her hand on his bare chest. \u201cProbably because, when crunch time came, your Madison genes just couldn\u2019t tolerate the idea of applying such a sensible, logical, rational approach to an intimate relationship with a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrewed by my genetic predisposition to do things the hard way, you think?\u201d</p><p>She drew her fingertips through the crisp, curling hair. \u201cMadisons are known for doing things the hard way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He stroked the curve of her head. \u201cThere\u2019s just one point I want to make before we get up in a few hours and fix breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight does not qualify as my sixth date.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, she did not understand. Then the meaning of his words shot through her brain, charring the semi\u2013dream state she had been enjoying.</p><p>She sat bolt upright. His arm slid down to her hips. Aware that she was nude, she grabbed the sheets and held them to her br**sts.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got news for you,\u201d she said, \u201cwe had dinner and sex. If that doesn\u2019t qualify as a date in your book, I\u2019d like to know what does. It\u2019s certainly a heck of a lot more than any of my other dates have involved in a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came over here tonight because you felt sorry for me, remember? Being neighborly doesn\u2019t qualify as a date.\u201d</p><p>Anger, pain, and outrage slammed through her without warning. She found herself teetering on an invisible emotional cliff that she had not even noticed a few seconds ago.</p><p>\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t sleep with you just to jolly you out of your brooding mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked, though.\u201d He closed his palm around her hip, squeezing gently. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a lot more cheerful than I did earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gabe, don\u2019t you dare imply that having sex was no different than . . . than playing gin rummy together. One is a game. The other is not.\u201d</p><p>There was a short silence. Was he actually having to think about her comment? She went cold. Maybe he didn\u2019t believe that there was any major difference between sex and gin rummy. Maybe to him they both ranked as nothing more than casual pastimes.</p><p>Maybe she had been a complete fool.</p><p>\u201cOne is a game, the other is not,\u201d Gabe repeated very deliberately. \u201cThis is a test, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said through her teeth. \u201cAnd if you get it wrong, you\u2019re a doomed man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, just give me a minute.\u201d He sounded as serious and intent as a game show contestant who had a hundred thousand dollars riding on the outcome. \u201cOne is a game. The other is not. One is a game.</p><p>The other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe, so help me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>There was an odd ringing in her ears now. Surely she could not have been dumb enough to go to bed with a man who treated sex as entertainment for a rainy night in a small town where there was very little in the way of nightlife. She could not have misjudged Gabe Madison so badly. She was a professional matchmaker, for heaven\u2019s sake.</p><p>He moved his warm palm up over her hip, along the curve of her waist, and pulled her down across his chest. One of her legs lodged between his thighs. She felt a familiar pressure and knew that he was getting hard again.</p><p>He cupped her buttock in one hand. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>The sensual laughter in his voice jolted her back to reality. He was teasing her. She was overreacting.</p><p>Time to get a grip. Act mature and sophisticated.</p><p>With an act of will she forced herself to step back from the invisible emotional precipice. Her ears stopped ringing. She took a deep breath and managed a cool smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for your answer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGin rummy is the game, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations. Right answer.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his fingertips along the rim of the cle**age that divided her derri\u00e8re. Without warning, he rolled her onto her back and came down on top of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCollecting my prize.\u201d</p><p>A long time later she stirred again and leaned over him.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cthere was another reason I decided to stay tonight.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in the darkness. His hand moved in her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was curious to see what you do with the peanut butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is as good a time as any. I seem to have worked up an appetite.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>The sound of a heavy engine lumbering down the drive toward the house woke him. He opened his eyes. The gray light of a rainy morning illuminated the window. Beside him, Lillian did not stir. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What he wanted most in the world at that moment, he thought, was to stay right where he was with Lillian\u2019s beautifully curved bottom nestled against his midsection. But the rumble outside made that a non-option.</p><p>With deep regret, he eased himself cautiously away from her warmth. She wriggled a little, as though in protest. He leaned over and kissed her shoulder. She sighed and snuggled deeper into the pillow.</p><p>He studied her as he rose and reached for his pants. She looked very good lying there in his bed. Like she belonged there.</p><p>Outside the large vehicle had come to a halt. The motor shut down.</p> <p>He made himself go out into the hall, pausing long enough to close the bedroom door firmly. Then he went into the main room.</p><p>He glanced around quickly on his way to the front door, checking to see if there was any evidence of Lillian\u2019s presence. A glimmering pool filled with shifting lights on the floor caught his eye. He scooped up the iridescent rain cloak and crammed it into the hall closet.</p><p>By the time he got the front door open and saw the familiar SUV hulking in the drive, his grandfather was already on the porch.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here,\u201d Mitchell roared. He thumped his cane on the boards for emphasis. \u201cJust what are you up to, Gabe Madison?\u201d</p><p>Damn.</p> <p>Gabe reassessed the situation quickly. Lillian had walked to his place. Her car was not in the drive.</p><p>Mitchell could not possibly know that she had spent the night here.</p><p>Could he?</p><p>Small towns had some serious drawbacks when it came to privacy issues.</p><p>When in doubt, stall.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you, too,\u201d he said easily. \u201cWhen did you get back into town?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLast night. Late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bev?\u201d</p><p>Bev Bolton, the widow of a former editor of the Eclipse Bay Journal , was the woman Mitchell had been seeing for several months She had accompanied him to Hawaii. Bev lived in Portland. Mitchell had been so discreet about the relationship that for several extremely uneasy weeks Gabe and Rafe had both feared that his frequent trips to the city had been for the purpose of seeing a specialist. They had leaped to the conclusion that he was suffering from some dire medical condition that he was trying to keep from them. The truth had come as an enormous, if somewhat startling, relief.</p><p>\u201cBev went on down to California to visit her grandkids,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cNow tell me what\u2019s happening here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d He yawned and absently rubbed his chest. It was cold out here. Should have grabbed a shirt out of the closet. \u201cBeen raining a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to change the topic. This is me, your grandfather, you\u2019re talking to. I had coffee in town at the bakery. Must have been at least half a dozen folks who couldn\u2019t wait to tell me that Marilyn Thornley\u2019s car was seen turning into your driveway last night around suppertime.\u201d</p><p>Gabe drew a slow, deep breath. Relief replaced some of the tension that had tightened every muscle in his belly. Mitchell didn\u2019t know about Lillian. He was here because of Marilyn\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s gone now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Gabe said.</p> <p>He moved farther out onto the porch, pulling the door closed behind him. Rain dripped steadily from the edge of the porch roof. The temperature had to be in the very low fifties. Maybe the high forties. He tried to ignore the chill. How long did it take to contract a case of hypothermia?</p><p>He\u2019d just have to tough it out. He could not risk going back inside to get more clothes. Mitchell would follow him into the hall and the commotion would awaken Lillian. She would probably come out of the bedroom to see what was going on and all hell would break loose. A real doomsday scenario, if ever there was one.</p><p>He needed to think and he needed to do it fast.</p><p>Priorities, priorities.</p><p>The first order of business was to get rid of Mitchell.</p><p>He glanced at the SUV and raised a hand in a casual salute to Mitchell\u2019s faithful factotum, Bryce, who waited stoically behind the wheel. Bryce nodded once, acknowledging the greeting with a military-style inclination of his head.</p><p>Gabe turned back to Mitchell. \u201cSo, how was Hawaii?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawaii was fine.\u201d Mitchell scowled. \u201cHawaii is always fine. I didn\u2019t come here to talk about my vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to be civil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You\u2019re trying to slip and slide around this thing. Don\u2019t waste my time. I didn\u2019t just fall off the turnip truck yesterday. I want to know what\u2019s up with you and Marilyn Thornley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing of any great interest to anyone, including me.\u201d Gabe folded his arms. Nothing like a clear conscience when dealing with the old man.</p><p>The tension that simmered between the two of them lately was a new element in their relationship. Gabe could not pinpoint when it had first begun to emerge. Sometime during the last two years, he thought. It had grown remarkably more acute since Rafe\u2019s marriage, however.</p><p>In the old days, after he and Rafe had gone to live with Mitchell following the death of their parents, there had been relatively few conflicts between Gabe and his grandfather. Rafe had been the rebel, the one who had gone toe-to-toe with Mitchell at every turn.</p><p>But looking back, Gabe knew that he had taken the opposite path, not because he had wanted to please Mitchell but because he was committed to his future goal. All he had cared about was his dream of proving that a Madison could be a success. In high school he had charted a course that he had calculated would enable him to achieve his objective and he had stuck to it. He had been the one who had gotten the good grades, stayed out of trouble and graduated from college because he could see that was how the Hartes did things. They had been his role models. It was clear to him, even as a boy, that the traditional Madison approach to life led to poor outcomes.</p><p>In the end, he had achieved his objective. He had put together a business empire that rivaled Harte Investments. One of these days, it would be even bigger than Harte.</p><p>He knew that now, although he had not built Madison Commercial with the conscious intention of pleasing his grandfather. Mitchell\u2019s approval had been one of the satisfying side effects of success. He had taken it for granted for some time.</p><p>The realization that nothing he had accomplished seemed to matter to Mitchell anymore left him with a peculiar, empty feeling deep inside. This morning, for the first time, he realized that anger was seeping in to fill the void.</p><p>What right did the old man have to give him advice on how to run his life?</p><p>Mitchell squinted, searching Gabe\u2019s face. Whatever he saw there appeared to reassure him somewhat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarilyn didn\u2019t hang around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d Gabe said mildly.</p><p>\u201cShe and Thornley are calling it quits, you know,\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWord is, she\u2019s got her own plans to go into politics.\u201d</p><p>Gabe dropped his arms and wrapped his hands around the wet railing. Damn, it was cold. In another few minutes his teeth would probably start to chatter. \u201cShe told me that much yesterday when she stopped by to see me. Probably do okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what she\u2019s after, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Don\u2019t worry, Mitch, I didn\u2019t just fall off the turnip truck either. It\u2019s obvious that Marilyn is looking for someone to help finance her political career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear her father is a little pissed because she blew so much cash on Thornley\u2019s campaign. They say Caldwell isn\u2019t real eager to pump more money into another political race, even if it is his daughter who is running this time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Caldwells will come around. Eventually. They always do for Marilyn.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell nodded. \u201cThat woman always did have a way of getting what she wanted, even when she was a little girl. Still, no politician ever has enough cash. She could use a rich husband with connections. Looks like you\u2019re back on her radar scope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in being married to a politician. If she doesn\u2019t know that already, I think she\u2019ll figure it out real quick. Marilyn is smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of you had something going there for a while. Maybe she figures she can relight some old flames.\u201d</p><p>Gabe shrugged. \u201cWhatever we had was over a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on her giving up easily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t count on it.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s hawklike face tightened in a shrewd expression. \u201cYou know, things would be a whole lot simpler if you got married.\u201d</p><p>Gabe gripped the railing and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cMarilyn Thornley wouldn\u2019t be hanging around here at suppertime if you had a wife,\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>Gabe looked at him. \u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man your age oughtta be married. Hell, I was married at your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that have been Alicia or Janine? No, wait, Alicia was number three, wasn\u2019t she? So was it Susan? It can\u2019t have been Trish because I\u2019m sure you told me once that Trish was number one. Must have been Janine.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell hammered the cane against the boards. \u201cThe point is, I was married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd divorced. A couple of times, at least at that point. Two down and two more to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I screwed up once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour times in all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot and damn.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s voice went up a few decibels. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to learn from my mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadisons never learn from their mistakes. Family tradition.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell raised the cane and leveled it at him as if it were a rapier. \u201cYou know what your problem is?</p><p>You\u2019re going about this marriage business all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly an authority on the subject.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell snorted. \u201cShould have known you couldn\u2019t go after a woman the way you go after investment prospects for Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did manage to figure that out. That\u2019s why I signed up with Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell kind of results do you expect from a computer?\u201d Mitchell shot back. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Lillian Harte isn\u2019t a smart lady. No such thing as a stupid Harte. And I\u2019m not saying she doesn\u2019t know how to run her business. But the fact is, you aren\u2019t going to have any luck finding a wife with a computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a Madison, that\u2019s why not. When it comes to women, a Madison relies on his gut, not his brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look where it\u2019s gotten us,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cThree generations of screwed-up relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe broke that jinx.\u201d Mitchell lowered the cane with grim dignity. \u201cI expect you to do the same, by God. But you\u2019re gonna have to stop fooling around with Madison Commercial for a while and pay attention to what\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>That did it.</p><p>Gabe felt his Madison temper flash through him with all the stunning heat of summer lightning. It crackled and flared, surging forth from the windowless vault where he kept it locked and chained in the name of establishing total control.</p><p>He released the railing and turned on Mitchell.</p><p>\u201cFooling around with Madison Commercial? Is that what you call what I\u2019ve been doing all these years?</p><p>Fooling around with Madison Commercial? \u201d</p><p>Mitchell blinked. Then the lines at the corners of his eyes creased in wary concern. \u201cSimmer down, son.</p><p>Just trying to have us a reasonable discussion here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFooling around with Madison Commercial? Is that what you call building a major venture capital company that did a few hundred million dollars\u2019 worth of business last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, see here, Gabe, this isn\u2019t what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it has slipped your mind that your stock in Madison Commercial is the primary source of your retirement income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot and damn, this isn\u2019t about money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot about money? All I ever heard from you when I was growing up was how Harte-Madison had been destroyed because you and Sullivan Harte went to war over a woman. How many times did you tell me how you\u2019d been financially ruined because Claudia Banner made fools out of you and Harte? A couple of thousand, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Harte-Madison all those years ago has got nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Hartes recovered financially because they had the brains and the determination to concentrate on business. You could have done the same thing, but you didn\u2019t, did you, Mitch? You preferred to get married. Over and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your grandfather you\u2019re dealing with here. Show some respect.\u201d</p><p>Gabe flexed his hands at his sides. \u201cI proved to you and the whole damn world that a Madison could be as successful as a Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you haven\u2019t been successful with Madison Commercial. But the fact that the company\u2019s making a profit isn\u2019t what\u2019s important here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me that the next time you cash your quarterly dividend check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking about money.\u201d Mitchell whacked the cane against a post. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about getting your priorities straight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMadison Commercial is a success because I\u2019ve had my priorities straight all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d had \u2019em straight, you\u2019d have been married by now.

He was vaguely aware that Mitchell did the same.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, gentlemen,\u201d Lillian said from the other side of the screen. \u201cLovely day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Gabe shoved his hand through his hair. Just what he needed.</p> <p>There was nothing but acute silence from his grandfather. He wondered how he was going to take this turn of events.</p><p>Mitchell stood transfixed. He gazed at Lillian as if she were a mermaid who had just appeared at the edge of the bay.</p><p>Gabe switched his attention back to Lillian and did a quick assessment. She was dressed in the black trousers and the turquoise-slashed sweater she had worn last night. A little dressy for day wear but it just might pass, especially with Mitchell, who didn\u2019t pay attention to the nuances of fashion. Her hair was caught up in a neat twist. She wasn\u2019t wearing any makeup, but there was nothing unusual in that. In his experience she never wore much.</p><p>With luck Mitchell would assume that Lillian had just walked over from her place to join him for breakfast.</p><p>She looked out at the two silent men with an expression of amused interest.</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting anything?\u201d she asked politely.</p> <p>Neither said a word.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little chilly out there,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you both come inside? I\u2019m making coffee.\u201d She turned away from the screen. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to bring Bryce with you,\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>Bryce collected his cup of coffee with a short, brusque \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am\u201d and went back out to the SUV.</p><p>\u201cBryce isn\u2019t real keen on socializing,\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>Lillian sank down onto the sofa. \u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>Nonchalantly she watched Gabe where he stood at the window, his mug gripped in both hands. He had disappeared into the bedroom while she had poured coffee. When he reappeared a few minutes later he wore a dark flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up on his strong forearms. The neckline of a black crew-neck tee was visible at his throat. Must have been a little chilly out there on the porch, she thought.</p><p>The tension in the tiny front room was charged with remnants of the quarrel she had interrupted.</p><p>When she had awakened to the sound of the heated argument, her first instinct had been to get dressed and slip out the back door. She was fairly certain that was the course of action Gabe would have preferred.</p> <p>She might have done just that, sparing everyone, including herself, this awkward scene. But halfway down the hall she had overheard Gabe. Fooling around with Madison Commercial? Is that what you call what I\u2019ve been doing all these years?</p><p>The frustration and stark pain in his words had stopped her in her tracks, canceling all thought of disappearing out the back door.</p><p>Mitchell studied Lillian. \u201cHeard you were in town. Going to be here for a while?\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of coffee. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family\u2019s place isn\u2019t far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A short walk along the bluffs.\u201d</p><p>A speculative gleam appeared in Mitchell\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo, you walked on over here for coffee, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked over here, yes,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>At the window, Gabe tensed a little, as though preparing himself for battle.</p><p>Lillian pretended to ignore him. What she had told Mitchell was the truth as far as it went. Admittedly, it was the truth unencumbered by pesky little details such as those pertaining to the exact time and day she had made the trek, but that was not her problem. Mitchell had obviously decided to play inquisitor, but he was a Madison and she was a Harte. She was under no obligation to tell him everything he wanted to know.</p><p>Mitchell angled his chin toward the gray mist outside the window and looked concerned. \u201cPretty wet out there to be taking a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is quite damp this morning,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut what else can you expect this time of year?\u201d</p><p>Gabe took a swallow of coffee. He did not speak, but she knew that Mitchell\u2019s blunt questioning was stoking the flames of his anger. She could only hope that he would have enough sense not to lose his temper again.</p><p>\u201cA real coincidence, you and Gabe both deciding to take a little vacation here in Eclipse Bay at the same time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>\u201cJust one of those things,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>\u201cHow long you going to be here?\u201d Mitchell asked.</p><p>Gabe turned around at that. \u201cWhat business is it of yours how long she intends to stay here?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell glowered. \u201cJust trying to make polite conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cThat\u2019s you, all right. Polite.\u201d</p><p>Lillian cleared her throat. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m going to be here for quite a while, I\u2019ve closed my business in Portland.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell\u2019s attention snapped back to her. \u201cYou shut down your matchmaking operation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell looked thoughtful. \u201cSo you\u2019re the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell shrugged. \u201cThe one your dad\u2019s going to groom to take over Harte Investments. Never figured it would be you. No offense, but you always seemed to be a little on the flaky side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here we thought my flakiness was a closely held family secret.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell ignored that, busy with his own logic. \u201cWell, makes sense, when you think about it. I reckon you\u2019re the only choice left now that Hannah\u2019s fixin\u2019 to open the inn with Rafe, and your brother quit the company to write those mystery novels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m not going to go to work for my father. I closed Private Arrangements so that I could paint full time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaint what?\u201d Mitchell looked nonplussed. \u201cHouses? Cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPictures.\u201d If he had looked nonplussed a moment ago, he was clearly floored now. \u201cYou mean real paintings? The kind they put in museums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be so lucky.\u201d Lillian drummed her fingers on her mug, aware that Gabe was watching her with an odd expression. \u201cOctavia Brightwell is going to give me my first show in Portland in a few weeks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mitchell shook his head. \u201cWell, shoot and damn. If that don\u2019t beat all. Bet your folks and your grandfather are climbing the walls about now. Bad enough having a writer in the family. Now they\u2019ve got themselves a real live artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told them yet that I plan to paint full time,\u201d Lillian said carefully. \u201cIn fact, they don\u2019t even know that I\u2019ve closed Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t hear it from me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I sure would pay big bucks to be a fly on the wall when you tell \u2019em that you\u2019re going to quit working to paint pictures.\u201d</p><p>Lillian stiffened. \u201cThey\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey may understand, but they sure as hell aren\u2019t going to be real thrilled about it.\u201d Mitchell was almost chortling. \u201cSullivan sweated blood putting Harte Investments together after our company went under.</p><p>And your father has worked in the business his whole life. Everyone figured one of you three kids would take over and manage it for another generation. Now, one by one, you\u2019re all peeling off to do your own thing.\u201d</p><p>He was right, she thought. But she didn\u2019t need the guilt trip this morning.</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s son, Carson, may develop an interest in the business when he gets older,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mitchell snorted. \u201cYour brother\u2019s boy is only, what? Four? Five?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be twenty years at least before he\u2019s even ready to think about taking on a job like running Harte Investments, assuming he wants to do it in the first place.\u201d Mitchell squinted. \u201cYour dad\u2019s in his early sixties. He can\u2019t wait that long to turn the company over to the next generation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Dad plans to retire sometime in the next couple of years,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe and Mom want to establish a charitable foundation aimed at teaching disadvantaged young people how to run a business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wants out, he\u2019ll have to sell or merge the company.\u201d Mitchell pursed his lips. \u201cProbably make a truckload of money, but for all intents and purposes, Harte Investments will come to an end with this generation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a business,\u201d Lillian blurted.</p><p>\u201cJust a business, my left, uh, foot.\u201d Mitchell took another sip of coffee and lowered his mug very slowly.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Harte Investments we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Lillian became aware of the fact that Gabe had turned away from the window. He was watching her intently. She looked at him and then back at Mitchell. Both pairs of green eyes were identical. It sent a chill down her spine.</p><p>It occurred to her that the success of Harte Investments over the years had been more of a thorn in the sides of the Madison men than anyone in her family had ever fully understood.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Gabe stood with Lillian on the front porch and watched Mitchell climb into the SUV.</p><p>Bryce put the behemoth into gear and drove off toward the main road.</p><p>They watched the rain fall for a while.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about giving you a break,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Lillian folded her arms. \u201cWhat kind of a break?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know that sixth date you owe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sixth date is a figment of your obsessive imagination. It will never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>He watched the SUV disappear into the trees. \u201cI need a date for that banquet in Portland I mentioned the other night at dinner. The one scheduled to honor a former professor of mine. Are you free?\u201d</p><p>She turned halfway around, searching his face with an unreadable expression. \u201cThis is your idea of a real date? A rubbery-chicken business dinner complete with long, boring speeches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be giving one of those long, boring speeches. Do you want to come with me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink fast. I\u2019m going to drive into Portland Monday morning so that I can get some time in at the office before the dinner. I plan to stay overight and drive back here Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cGoing into Portland for the night would give me a chance to stop by my studio and pick up some odds and ends that I left behind. Yes, I can see where the trip might be marginally worthwhile for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get the point. It wasn\u2019t a real romantic invitation, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can live with the unromantic part. Just so we\u2019re clear that this is not to be considered as your sixth, contractually arranged, bought-and-paid-for Private Arrangements date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d she said curtly and opened the screen door. \u201cAnd another thing you should know before we drive into Portland for this big evening on the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel that we both need to give ourselves a chance to evaluate the future direction of this relationship.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn simple terms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do best with simple terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means no more sex, at least not for a while. I want some time to think about what\u2019s going on here. I believe that you should do some thinking about it, too.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing. Just looked at her.</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem for you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. I can think. Do it all the time. Sometimes I have two or three whole thoughts in the course of a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you could probably handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking now is that this decision not to have any more sex for a while has something to do with that scene that just took place with Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cMaybe his sudden appearance on the doorstep first thing this morning did help to put some things into perspective. But don\u2019t blame him. They were things that I should have thought about last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to get obsessive about this, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want some answers.\u201d</p><p>She put one hand flat on the screen. \u201cI want us both to be sure that we know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing? Or that you don\u2019t think I know what I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came here to Eclipse Bay to paint. You came here to recover from a bad case of burnout. Neither of us planned to get involved in a relationship.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Understanding hit him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between us last night scared the hell out of you, didn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Her nails made little indentations in the screen.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should both be a little scared, Gabe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s Mitchell you\u2019re worrying about, forget it. I\u2019m pretty sure he bought that story you gave him about walking over here for coffee this morning.

He picked up the phone and handed it to Mitchell without comment.</p> <p>Mitchell found his reading glasses, fished a notebook out of his pocket, flipped it open and located the number he wanted. He carefully punched the digits on the phone, peering carefully at the display to make sure he\u2019d struck the right ones. It wasn\u2019t easy. The arthritis made some things harder than they had been in the old days.</p><p>\u201cWhy do they make these buttons so damn tiny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPeople like small phones,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cSmall phones require small buttons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was what they call one of them rhetorical questions.\u201d Mitchell listened to the phone ring. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to actually answer it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask me a question, you get an answer,\u201d Bryce said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d know that by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir, you would think that.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang a third time.</p><p>\u201cShoot and damn,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cHe\u2019d better be there. I don\u2019t have time\u2014\u201d</p><p>The fourth ring was cut short.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Sullivan Harte said.</p><p>Mitchell grunted with satisfaction at the sound of the cool, graveled voice. He and Sullivan hadn\u2019t had much to do with each other in the years since the destruction of Harte-Madison and the infamous brawl in front of Fulton\u2019s Supermarket. They hadn\u2019t even had a civil conversation until Hannah and Rafe\u2019s wedding a few months ago. But some things you didn\u2019t forget, he reflected. The voice of the man who had fought alongside you in the green hell of jungle warfare was one of those things.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sullivan asked immediately.</p> <p>\u201cYour granddaughter is shacking up with my grandson.\u201d</p><p>There was a short silence.</p><p>\u201cGot news for you, Mitch.\u201d Sullivan chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay now that they\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about Hannah and Rafe.\u201d</p><p>There was another brief pause.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Sullivan no longer sounded amused.</p><p>\u201cLillian and Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch,\u201d Sullivan said very softly.</p><p>\u201cYou referring to me or my grandson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made your opinion real clear,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cPoint is, what are you gonna do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe is your grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lillian is your granddaughter. I fixed things last time. It\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fixed things? What the hell do you mean, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mitchell punched the button to end the call, cutting Sullivan off in midsentence.</p><p>He looked at Bryce and grinned.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cis gonna be downright entertaining.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Claire Jensen dropped an overstuffed leather briefcase onto the vinyl seat and slid into the booth across from Lillian. She was flushed and a little breathless.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she said. \u201cMarilyn wanted to go over some talking points for an interview she\u2019s doing tomorrow and we had to make some last-minute changes in the schedule for the Leaders of Tomorrow open-house event. Hey, you\u2019re looking great, Lil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. So are you. It\u2019s good to see you again. Been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed and Lillian felt the years fall away. Claire had always been fun. She was a bright, high-energy woman who bubbled with personality and plans.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cMuch too long. Where did the time go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife happens. Not like we both haven\u2019t been busy for the past few years.\u201d</p><p>They had met when Claire had been a student at Chamberlain College. Lillian had been attending a college in Portland but she had always spent her vacation breaks with her family in Eclipse Bay. She and Claire had both gotten jobs as waitresses at a pier restaurant one summer. Claire had needed the money.</p><p>Strictly speaking, Lillian had not needed the income but she had needed the job. The Harte family believed very strongly in the work ethic. All Harte offspring were expected to work during summer vacations.</p><p>Initially she and Claire had had little in common, but the long hours spent dealing with stingy tippers and rude tourists had forged a bond between them. They had hung out together after work and talked a lot about the important things: guys and the futures they were planning for themselves.</p><p>Claire was the first person and, for a long time, the only person to whom she had confided her dream of becoming an artist. In what some would call typical Harte fashion, she had been very focused on her goal but, acutely aware of her family\u2019s opinion on the subject of art as a career, she hadn\u2019t discussed it much.</p><p>It had been exciting to share her secret with someone who understood an impractical dream.</p><p>Claire had had some very impractical dreams of her own in those days. She had wanted to go into politics.</p><p>\u201cThis place certainly hasn\u2019t changed much, has it?\u201d Claire commented. \u201cSnow\u2019s Caf\u00e9 looks just like it did when we used to come here back when we were in college.\u201d</p><p>The d\u00e9cor of Snow\u2019s Caf\u00e9 had always reflected Arizona Snow\u2019s unique view of the world, Lillian thought. The walls were hung with a mix of faded rock band posters and enlarged satellite photos of the terrain around Area 51 and Roswell, New Mexico. The clientele consisted mostly of students from nearby Chamberlain College.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the menu?\u201d Claire asked. \u201cIs it still the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d Lillian plucked the plastic laminated menu out from its position between the napkin holder and the little carousel that held the condiments. She surveyed the offerings. \u201cStill heavy on veggie burgers, french fries, and coffee drinks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe three basic food groups for college students. Arizona knows her clientele,\u201d Claire mused. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you called. How did you know where to find me? I didn\u2019t even know that you were in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Pamela McCallister in Fulton\u2019s Supermarket. She mentioned that you were up at the institute, plotting Marilyn Thornley\u2019s campaign. How\u2019s it going? Think she can step into Trevor\u2019s shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Claire assured her. \u201cOne thing\u2019s for certain, she\u2019ll look a whole lot better in them than he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the rumors that went around after Trevor pulled out of the running?\u201d Claire leaned forward and lowered her voice. \u201cWord has it that Trevor liked to have sex in high heels and women\u2019s lingerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, those rumors.\u201d</p><p>Claire sat up and settled back against the seat. \u201cGossip among the campaign staff has it that he was forced to quit the race because he was being blackmailed with some old videos that showed him prancing around in frilly underwear. It was a shock, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe campaign staff never had a clue?\u201d</p><p>Claire sighed. \u201cOf course not. The staff is always the last to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat made Marilyn decide to become a candidate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always been extremely ambitious. But I think that until recently she saw herself in the role of the candidate\u2019s wife. The power behind the throne, as it were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard she put a lot of her family\u2019s money into Trevor\u2019s campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Claire made a face. \u201cBetween you and me, when Trevor imploded, she was absolutely furious.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen anyone in such a rage. I overheard a massive fight between the two of them one afternoon. She told Trevor that she could do a better job of running for office herself and that she was going to prove it. Said a lot of things about how much time she had wasted on him. She dropped the divorce announcement on the staff the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up as her campaign manager?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was in the right place at the right time. She and I had worked together a lot in the course of Trevor\u2019s campaign. She knew me. Knew what I could do. Most of all she wanted someone she could trust to head up her campaign. When she offered me the job, I jumped at the chance. That woman is going places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to go with her, is that it?\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed. \u201cYou got it.\u201d Her grin faded to a thoughtful expression. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s funny. Back at the beginning, when I used to dream about getting into politics, I pictured myself as the dynamic female senator from the great state of Oregon. Then I found out how much cash it takes just to run for dog catcher, let alone to get a shot at a state or national office. Short of marrying money, the way Trevor did, there aren\u2019t a lot of options. So I decided to carve out a career behind the scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill dream of becoming a candidate?\u201d</p><p>Claire shook her head decisively. \u201cNot anymore. I love what I do. There\u2019s real power and a real rush in running a good campaign. And there\u2019s very little downside if it fails. The candidate may disappear from the face of the earth after a big loss but a good strategist just moves on to another campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad things worked out for you, Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both. What\u2019s up with you? How long will you be in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for a month.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA whole month?\u201d Claire asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made the big move. I closed down Private Arrangements. I\u2019m going to devote full time to my painting and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s lips parted on a silent wow . \u201cGood for you. No risk, no glory, I always say. Staying at your folks\u2019 cottage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny how you Hartes and Madisons keep coming back to Eclipse Bay, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Claire commented.</p><p>\u201cHannah and Rafe are full-time residents now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey love it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing, those of us up at the institute can\u2019t wait until they get Dreamscape open. As it is now, when people come for seminars and receptions like the Leaders of Tomorrow event, we\u2019re forced to put them up in one of those low-budget motels out on the highway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re planning to open in the spring. Assuming the Willis brothers cooperate, of course.\u201d</p><p>Claire grinned. \u201cWhat a pair. I practically had to get down on my knees and plead with them to come out to my place a couple of weeks ago just to unclog a toilet. They charged me a small fortune. I didn\u2019t have any choice but to pay it, of course, and they knew it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Gabe dropped Lillian off at the entrance to her apartment building shortly before ten o\u2019clock on Monday morning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at seven,\u201d he said when she made to slide out of the Jag.</p><p>She stood and looked at him through the open door. Tension coiled in the pit of her stomach. He was dressed for business once again in the legendary Gabe Madison war armor: steel-gray jacket and trousers, charcoal-gray shirt secured with silver-and-onyx cuff links, silver-and-black striped tie. When he moved his hand on the wheel, the dark-gray edge of his shirt cuff shifted, revealing the gleaming stainless-steel watch on his left wrist.</p><p>He looked good, she thought. Exciting. Powerful and predatory and wholly in control. You\u2019d never guess that he was suffering a bad case of burnout. But, then, what did burnout look like?</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>She hurried toward the building\u2019s secured entrance and punched in the code. Gabe waited until she was safely inside the lobby before he drove off in the direction of his downtown office.</p><p>He was wrong to accuse her of being nervous about their relationship, she thought a few minutes later when she twisted the key in the lock of her apartment door. She had spoken the truth the other morning when she had tried to explain herself to him. They both needed to think things through. Neither one of them could trust their own judgment at the moment.</p><p>A man dealing with burnout was certainly not in the best position to make sound decisions regarding his personal relationships. As for herself, she had arrived at a major turning point in her life. Getting involved in an affair with a man who was going through his own emotional crisis was the last thing she needed.</p><p>Probably be best to write off that night at his cottage as an ill-advised one-night stand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It all sounded so logical. Why did she feel depressed by her own clear reasoning?</p><p>She opened the door and walked into the apartment. They had made good time on the long drive from Eclipse Bay this morning. She had most of the day ahead of her to tidy up some of the loose ends that she had left dangling when she had rushed out of town a few days ago. She had a number of things on her agenda, not the least of which was deciding what to wear to the dinner tonight.</p><p>The atmosphere of the apartment had the closed-up feeling that accumulates quickly when a residence has been uninhabited for a few days. She walked through the rooms, cracking open windows to allow fresh air to circulate.</p><p>She did the living room first and then went down the hall to her bedroom. At the entrance, she paused.</p> <p>A tingle of eerie awareness drifted through her.</p><p>There was something different about the room. Something wrong.</p><p>She looked around with her artist\u2019s eye, noting the small details. The bedding was undisturbed. The closet doors were firmly closed. The dresser drawers were shut.</p><p>The closet doors were closed. Completely closed.</p><p>Her attention snapped back to the mirrored closet. She stared at it for a long time.</p> <p>She was certain that she had left it partially ajar because of the way the slider got hung up when it was pushed fully closed.</p><p>Almost certain.</p><p>She had been in a hurry the other morning when she had left for Eclipse Bay, she reminded herself.</p><p>Perhaps she had forced the door closed without thinking about it.</p><p>She crossed the room, gripped the handle and tried to open the slider. It stuck. Just as it had been sticking for the past two months. She took a firmer grasp, braced herself and forced it open.</p><p>The slider resisted for a few seconds and then reluctantly moved in its track. She stood back and surveyed the interior of her closet. The clothes on the hangers seemed to be in the same order they had been in when she had packed. The stack of plastic sweater boxes on the shelf looked untouched.</p> <p>This was ridiculous. She was allowing her imagination to get carried away.</p><p>She reached for the handle of the slider again, intending to close the door. She went cold when she saw the smear on the mirrored glass at the far end next to the metal frame.</p><p>She allowed her hand to hover over the smear. It was right where the heel of a palm would rest if one were to take hold of the frame at the far end in an attempt to force the slider closed. But the mark was a little higher than one she would have left if she had grasped the frame.</p><p>Right about where a man or a woman a couple of inches taller than herself might put his or her palm.</p><p>She stepped back quickly.</p><p>Someone had been in this room.</p><p>Take deep breaths. Think about logical possibilities.</p><p>Burglary.</p> <p>She whirled around, examining the scene once more. Nothing appeared to be missing.</p><p>She rushed back out into the living room and threw open the doors of the cabinet that housed her entertainment electronics. The expensive equipment was still safely stowed in place on the shelves.</p><p>She went cautiously down the hall to the small second bedroom that she used as a study. Halting in the doorway, she studied the interior. The most valuable item in this room was the art glass vase her parents had given her for her birthday last year. It glowed orange and red on the shelf near her desk.</p><p>She was definitely overreacting here. Maybe she was on edge because of the tension of dealing with Gabe.</p><p>More deep breaths. Other logical possibilities.</p><p>The cleaning people.</p><p>She had canceled the weekly appointments until further notice. But there could have been a mix-up about the dates. The cleaners had a key. Perhaps they had come in last Friday on the usual day.</p><p>It made sense. One of them might have tried to close the closet door. But surely a professional housecleaner would have wiped off the smear on the mirror?</p><p>Then again, perhaps the cleaner had been in a hurry and hadn\u2019t noticed the smudge.</p><p>The light winked on the phone, snapping her out of her reverie. Belatedly it occurred to her that she hadn\u2019t checked her messages during the time she had been away in Eclipse Bay. She pulled herself out of the doorway, crossed to the desk and punched in the code.</p><p>There had been two calls. Both had been received the night before last between ten and eleven o\u2019clock.</p><p>In each instance the caller had stayed on the line long enough for the beep to sound. But no one had left a message.</p><p>A shiver went through her. She listened to the long silence before the hangup and fancied she could hear the unknown caller breathing.</p><p>Logical possibilities.</p><p>Two wrong numbers in a row. People rarely left messages when they dialed a wrong number.</p><p>This was crazy. She needed to get a grip and fast.</p><p>She grabbed the phone and dialed the number of the agency that cleaned regularly. The answer to her question came immediately.</p><p>\u201cYes, we sent the crew in last Friday,\u201d the secretary said apologetically. \u201cSorry about the mix-up. We\u2019ll give you a free cleaning when you restart the service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all right. I just wanted to know if you had been into the apartment, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She put the phone down and waited for her heart to stop pounding. It took a while.</p><p>She did the little black dress bit for the dinner. The darkened hotel banquet room was filled to capacity with members of both the business and academic worlds. She sat at the head table, next to the wife of the guest of honor, and listened, fascinated, to Gabe\u2019s introductory remarks. She had known this event was important to him but she had not been prepared for the deep and very genuine warmth of his words.</p><p>\u201c. . . Like so many of you here tonight, I, too, was profoundly influenced by Dr. Montoya . . .\u201d</p><p>He stood easily in front of the crowd, hands braced on either side of the podium frame, speaking without notes.</p><p>\u201c. . . I will never forget that memorable day in my senior year when Dr. Montoya called me into his office to discuss my first five-year plan, a plan which, in all modesty, I can only describe as visionary . . .\u201d</p><p>Laughter interrupted him for a moment.</p><p>\u201c. . . \u2018Gabe,\u2019 Dr. Montoya said, \u2018with this plan, I sincerely doubt that you could attract enough venture capital to put up a lemonade stand . . .\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The audience roared. Beneath the cover of applause, Dolores Montoya, a lively woman with silver-and-black hair, leaned over to whisper in Lillian\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness the committee chose Gabe to make the introduction. At this kind of event half the crowd is usually dozing by the time the guest of honor gets to the podium. At least he\u2019s keeping them awake.\u201d</p><p>Lillian did not avert her attention off Gabe. \u201cTrust me, he won\u2019t let anyone fall asleep. This is important to him. I hadn\u2019t realized just how important until now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy husband has told me more than once that Gabe was the most determined student he ever had in the classroom,\u201d Delores told her.</p><p>At the podium, Gabe continued his remarks.</p><p>\u201c. . . I\u2019m happy to say that I finally got my lemonade stand up and running . . .\u201d</p><p>This understatement was greeted by more chuckles from the crowd. Likening Madison Commercial to a lemonade stand was somewhat on a par with comparing a rowboat to a nuclear submarine, Lillian thought.</p> <p>\u201c. . . in large part because of what I learned from Dr. Montoya. But looking back, I can see that it wasn\u2019t just his nuts-and-bolts advice on how to survive market downturns and nervous investors that I took with me when I left his classroom.\u201d Gabe paused for a beat. \u201cHe gave me something much deeper and more important. He gave me a sense of perspective . . .\u201d</p><p>The crowd listened intently.</p><p>\u201c. . . Dr. Montoya gave me an understanding not only of how business works in a free country but of what we who make our living in business owe to our communities and our nation. He showed me the connections that bind us. He gave me a deep and lasting appreciation of what it takes to maintain the freedoms and the spirit that allows us to succeed. He taught me that none of us can make it in a vacuum.</p><p>And for those teachings, I will always be grateful. I give you now, Dr. Roberto Montoya.\u201d</p><p>The gathering erupted once again as Dr. Montoya walked to the podium. This time the applause was led by Gabe. It metamorphosed into a standing ovation. Lillian got to her feet and clapped along with everyone else.</p> <p>No wonder Dr. Montoya was important to Gabe, she thought. This was how a kid from a family that could not provide any successful male role models became one of the most successful men in the Northwest. He found himself someone who could teach him how to get ahead and he had paid attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to be crying.\u201d Dolores handed her a tissue.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Lillian hastily blotted her tears, grateful that the lights were all focused on the podium.</p><p>The applause died away and the members of the audience took their seats again. The spotlight focused on Roberto Montoya. Gabe made his way back through the shadows to the chair beside Lillian. She felt his attention rest briefly on her profile and sensed his curiosity. She hoped he hadn\u2019t seen her dabbing at her eyes with the tissue.</p><p>He started to lean toward her, as if about to ask her what was wrong. Fortunately his attention was distracted a moment by Dr. Montoya, who had just launched into his own remarks.</p><p>\u201cBefore I get to the boring parts,\u201d Dr. Montoya said, \u201cthere is something I would like to clarify. I taught Gabriel Madison many things, but there is one thing I did not teach him.\u201d He paused to look toward the head table. \u201cI did not teach him how to dress. That, he learned all on his own.\u201d</p> <p>There was a startled silence and then the crowd howled with delight.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d Gabe muttered, sounding both resigned and amused.</p><p>Dr. Montoya turned back to the audience. \u201cFive years ago when I approached Gabe to try to talk him into participating in a program that would place college seniors in local businesses during their final semesters, he said\u2014and I recall his exact words very clearly\u2014he said, what the hell do you expect me to teach a bunch of kids about business that you can\u2019t teach them?\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause. Montoya leaned into the microphone.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Teach \u2019em how to dress for success,\u2019 I said.\u201d</p><p>When the fresh wave of laughter had faded Montoya continued. \u201cHe took me seriously. Every semester when I send him the current crop of business students, he takes them to meet his tailor. What\u2019s more, he quietly picks up the tab for those who can\u2019t afford that first all-important business suit. Tonight, some of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s have prepared a small surprise to thank him for what he taught them.\u201d</p><p>The spotlight shifted abruptly to the far end of the stage. Two young men and a woman stood there. All three were dressed in identical steel-gray business suits, charcoal-gray shirts, and black-and-silver striped ties. All three had their hair combed straight back from their foreheads. Three sets of silver-and-onyx cuff links glinted in the light. Three stainless-steel watches glinted on three wrists.</p><p>The Gabe Madison clone on the right carried a box wrapped and tied in silver foil and black ribbon.</p> <p>They walked forward in lockstep.</p><p>The audience broke out in another wave of laughter and applause.</p><p>Gabe dropped his face into his hands. \u201cI will never live this down.\u201d</p><p>The young woman in the Gabe suit assumed control of the microphone. \u201cWe all owe Mr. Madison a debt of gratitude for the opportunities he provided to us during our semester at Madison Commercial.</p><p>Most of us came from backgrounds where the unwritten rules of the business world were unknown. He taught us the secret codes. Gave us self-confidence. Opened doors. And, yes, he introduced us to his tailor and offered us some advice on how to dress.\u201d</p><p>One of the young men took charge of the microphone. \u201cTonight we would like to show our gratitude to Mr. Madison by giving him a helping hand with a concept that he has never fully grasped . . .\u201d</p><p>The clone holding the silver foil box removed the lid with a flourish. The young woman reached inside and removed a scruffy-looking tee shirt, faded blue jeans, and a pair of well-worn running shoes.</p><p>\u201c. . . The concept of casual Fridays,\u201d the clone at the microphone concluded.</p><p>The banquet room exploded once again in laughter and applause. Gabe rose and walked back to the podium to accept his gift. He flashed a full laughing smile at the three clones.</p><p>It struck Lillian in that moment that Gabe looked like a man at the top of his game\u2014a man who enjoyed the respect of his friends and rivals alike, a man who was comfortable with his own power in the business world, cool and utterly in control.</p><p>He sure didn\u2019t look like a man who was going through a bad case of burnout.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>An hour later Gabe bundled her into the Jag and made to close the passenger door. Impulse struck. She gave into it without examining the decision.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if we stopped at my studio on the way back to the apartment?\u201d she said. \u201cI forgot a few things this afternoon when I went there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. No problem.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door, circled the car and paused long enough to remove his jacket. He put it down in the darkness of the backseat and got in behind the wheel. She gave him directions but she had the feeling that he already knew where he was going. He drove smoothly out of the parking garage and turned the corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A short time later he stopped at the curb in front of the brick building in which she rented studio space.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t take long,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>He got out of the car and opened her door for her. She walked beside him to the secured entrance. He waited while she punched in the code.</p> <p>They went up the stairs to the second-floor loft in silence. When she inserted her key into the lock she realized that her pulse was beating a little too quickly. A sense of anticipation mingled with unease quickened her breathing.</p><p>Why had she brought him here? she wondered. Where had the urge come from? What was the point of showing him the studio tonight? He was a businessman with no use for arty types.</p><p>She opened the door and groped for the switches on the wall to the right. She flipped two of the six, turning on some of the lights but not all, leaving large sections of the loft in shadow.</p><p>Gabe surveyed the interior.</p><p>\u201cSo this is where you work.\u201d His voice was completely uninflected.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She watched him prowl slowly forward, examining the canvases propped against the walls. \u201cThis is where I paint.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in front of a picture of her great-aunt Isabel. It showed her seated in a wicker chair in the solarium at Dreamscape, looking out to sea.</p><p>Gabe looked at the painting for a long time.</p><p>\u201cI remember seeing that expression on Isabel\u2019s face sometimes,\u201d he said finally. Absently he loosened the knot in his tie and opened the collar of his shirt. He did not take his gaze off the picture. \u201cAs if she were looking at something only she could see.\u201d</p><p>Lillian crossed to the large worktable at the far end of the room, propped one hip on the edge and picked up a sketchpad and a pencil. \u201cEveryone has that look from time to time. Probably because we all see something a little different when we look out at the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>He removed the silver-and-onyx cuff links and slid them into the pocket of his trousers. Again, his movements were casual and unself-conscious; the easy actions of a man relaxing after a formal evening.</p><p>He moved on to the next picture, rolling up the sleeves of the charcoal-gray shirt as he crossed the space, exposing the dark hair on the back of his arms.</p><p>She watched him for a moment. He looked rakish and extremely sexy with his tie undone and his shirt open at the throat. But what compelled her was the way he looked at her paintings. There was an intensity in him that told her that he made a visceral connection with the images she had created. He might not like the arty type but he responded to art. Unwillingly.</p><p>She began to draw, compelled by the shadows in her subject.</p><p>\u201cYou meant everything you said about Dr. Montoya tonight, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, not looking up from her work.</p><p>\u201cHe was the closest thing I had to a mentor.\u201d Gabe studied a picture of an old man sitting on a bench in the park. \u201cI was a kid from a small town. I didn\u2019t know how to handle myself. Didn\u2019t know what was appropriate. I had no polish. No sophistication. No connections. I knew where I wanted to go but I didn\u2019t know how to get there. He gave me a lot of the tools I needed to build Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you repay him by allowing him to send some of his students into Madison Commercial every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe company gets something out of it, too. The students bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm with them.</p> <p>And we get first crack at some bright new talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019ve heard my father talk about what a nuisance student interns are for a busy company. They can be a real pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone is cut out to work in a corporation.\u201d</p><p>Her pencil stilled for an instant. \u201cMe, for instance.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou, for instance. And apparently your sister and brother, too. You\u2019ve all got strong, independent, entrepreneurial streaks. You\u2019re all ambitious and you\u2019re all talented but you don\u2019t play well with others. At least not in a business setting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think you\u2019re so very different? Give me a break. Tell me something, Gabe, if you were only a vice-president instead of the owner, president, and CEO of Madison Commercial, would you still be on the company payroll?\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. Flat and final.</p><p>\u201cYou said that not everyone is cut out to work in a large corporation.\u201d She moved the pencil swiftly, adding shadows. \u201cBut not everyone is cut out to run one, either. You were born for it, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his attention away from a canvas and looked at her down the length of the studio. \u201cBorn for it?</p><p>That\u2019s a new one. Most people would say I was born to self-destruct before the age of thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the natural talent for leadership and command that it takes to organize people and resources to achieve an objective.\u201d She hunched one shoulder a little, concentrating on the angle of his jaw. Going for the darkness behind his eyes. \u201cIn your own way, you\u2019re an artist. You can make folks see your objective, make them want to get there with you. No wonder you were able to get that initial funding you needed for Madison Commercial. You probably walked into some venture capitalist\u2019s office and painted him a glowing picture of how much money he would make if he backed you.\u201d</p><p>Gabe did not move. \u201cTalking her out of the venture capital funds I needed wasn\u2019t the hard part.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up sharply, her curiosity pricked by his words.</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d she repeated carefully.</p><p>\u201cYour great-aunt Isabel is the one who advanced me the cash I needed to get Madison Commercial up and running.\u201d</p><p>She almost fell from her perch on the worktable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d She held the point of the pencil in the air, poised above the paper. \u201cIsabel backed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never said a word about it to any of us.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat was the way she wanted it.\u201d</p><p>She contemplated that news.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d she said at last. \u201cEveryone knew that it was her dream to end the Harte-Madison feud.</p><p>Hannah figures that\u2019s the reason she left Dreamscape equally to her and your brother in the will. But why would she back you financially? What would that have to do with ending the old quarrel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she felt that the Madisons got the short end of the stick when Harte-Madison went into bankruptcy. She wanted to level the playing field a little for Rafe and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when Harte-Madison was destroyed all those years ago, everyone lost everything. Both the Hartes and the Madisons went bankrupt.

There was no denying that the tough, stable Harte family bonds, not to mention the Harte work ethic and emphasis on education, had provided a much stronger foundation from which to recover than the shaky, shifting grounds that had sustained the Madisons.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken,\u201d she agreed. \u201cSo Isabel, in her own quiet way, tried to even things up a bit with money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was the hard part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hard part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that getting the backing from her for Madison Commercial wasn\u2019t the hard part. What was?\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved reminiscently. \u201cStructuring the contract so that Isabel got her money back plus interest and profit. She didn\u2019t want to do things that way. She wanted me to take the cash as a straight gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Madison pride, she thought, but she did not say it out loud. She went back to work on her drawing.</p><p>Gabe moved on to another picture.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong about you, wasn\u2019t l?\u201d She used the tip of her thumb to smudge in a shadow.</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching you at the banquet tonight, it finally hit me that I had leaped to a totally false conclusion about you. And you let me do it. You never bothered to correct my assumption.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her his enigmatic smile. \u201cHard to imagine a Harte being wrong about a Madison. You know us so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. Which is why I shouldn\u2019t have been fooled for even a minute. But I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the wrong conclusion you leaped to about me?\u201d</p><p>She looked up from the sketch and met his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t suffering from burnout.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, just watched her steadily.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you set me straight?\u201d She returned to her sketch, adding more depths and darkness.</p><p>\u201cBecause it suited your purpose to let me think you were a victim of stress and burnout? Did you want me to feel sorry for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He started toward her down a dim aisle formed by unframed canvases. \u201cNo, I sure as hell did not want you to feel sorry for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you want?\u201d Her pencil flashed across the paper, moving as though by its own volition as she worked frantically to capture the impressions and get them down in all the shades of light and dark.</p><p>He came to a halt in front of her. \u201cI wanted you to see me as something other than a cold-blooded machine. I figured that if you thought I was a walking case of burnout, you might realize that I was human.\u201d</p><p>She studied the sketch for a moment and then slowly put down the pencil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always known that you were human,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that? I had a somewhat different impression. Must have been all those comments you made about how I wanted to date robots.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the sketchpad. She let him take it from her fingers, watching his expression as he looked at the drawing she had made of him.</p><p>It showed him as he had appeared a few minutes ago, standing in front of one of her canvases, his hands thrust easily into the pockets of his trousers, collar and cuffs undone, tie loose around his neck. He stood in the shadows, his face slightly averted from the viewer. He was intent on the painting in front of him, a picture that showed an image that only he could see. Whatever he saw there deepened the shadows around him.</p><p>She watched his face as he studied the drawing. She knew from the way his jaw tightened and the fine lines that appeared at the corners of his mouth that he understood the shadows in the picture.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, he handed the sketch back to her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you do see me as human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you saw what I put into this drawing, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHard to miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people could look at this sketch and not see anything other than a figure standing in front of a canvas. But you see everything.\u201d She waved a hand at the canvases that filled the studio. \u201cYou can see what I put into all of my pictures. You pretend to disdain art but the truth is you respond to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent a lot of the first decade of my life in an artist\u2019s studio. Guess you pick up a few things when you\u2019re surrounded by the stuff during your impressionable years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Your father was a sculptor. Your mother was his model.\u201d She put the sketch down on the worktable. Guilt and dismay shot through her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gabe. I know you lost your parents when you were very young. I didn\u2019t mean to bring up such a painful subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. It\u2019s a fact, after all, not something you conjured up out of your imagination. Besides, I thought I made it clear that I don\u2019t want you to feel sorry for me. Sort of spoils the Harte-Madison feud dynamic, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cGabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you stated on the Private Arrangements questionnaire that you didn\u2019t want any arty types, you were telling the truth, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d decided that I pretty much lied through my teeth on that questionnaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you lied on that issue. Did you make a point of not wanting to be matched with so-called arty types because of your parents? Everyone knows that they didn\u2019t give you and Rafe what anyone could call a stable home life.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment.</p><p>\u201cFor years I blamed most of what wasn\u2019t good in my childhood, including my parents\u2019 deaths, on the fact that they were both involved in the world of art,\u201d he said finally. \u201cMaybe, in my kid brain, the mystique of the wild, uncontrolled, temperamental, artistic personality was convenient. Better than the alternative, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the alternative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we Madisons were seriously flawed; that we couldn\u2019t manage the self-control thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve proved that theory wrong, haven\u2019t you? I\u2019ve never met anyone with more self-control.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t exactly fit the image of the temperamental, self-centered artist who has no room in her life for anything except her art, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I think we\u2019ve successfully established that neither of us fits whatever preconceptions we might have had.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here tonight, Lillian? I know it wasn\u2019t because you needed to pick up some supplies.\u201d</p><p>She looked around at her paint-spattered studio. \u201cMaybe I wanted to find out how you really felt about arty types.\u201d</p><p>He raised one hand and traced the cowl neckline of her black dress. His finger grazed her throat. \u201cLet\u2019s see where we stand here. We\u2019ve established that you don\u2019t think I\u2019m a machine.\u201d</p><p>She caught her breath at his touch. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t think I\u2019m typical of what you call the arty type.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere does that leave us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He lowered his head until his mouth hovered just above hers. \u201cI think we ought to find out, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex is probably not the best way to explore that issue.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her slowly, lingeringly. When he raised his head she saw the hunger in him. She felt her blood heat.</p> <p>\u201cCan you think of a better way to explore it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cNot right at the moment.\u201d</p><p>He put one hand on her knee just beneath the hem of the little black dress. His smiled slowly and eased the skirt higher. She caught the ends of his silk tie in her hands and drew him closer.</p><p>He took the invitation the way a shark takes prey; smoothly and swiftly, leaving her no time to consider the wisdom of moving back into shallower waters.</p><p>Between one heartbeat and the next, he was between her knees, using his thighs to part her legs and open her to him. The black dress was up to her hips now, leaving only a scrap of midnight-colored lace as a barrier to his hand. It proved woefully inadequate to the task. She felt the silk grow damp at his touch.</p><p>She gripped the ends of the necktie and hung on for the ride.</p> <p>He roused himself a long time later, sated and content. For the moment, at any rate. He sat up on the edge of the worktable. Beside him Lillian was curled amid scattered sheets of drawing paper, brushes, and tubes of paint. Her hair had come free from the sleek knot in which it had been arranged earlier in the evening. The little black dress that had looked so elegant and tasteful at the head table was now crumpled in an extremely interesting, very sexy and no doubt less-than-tasteful manner. But it looked terrific on her that way, he thought.</p><p>His tie was now looped around her throat instead of his own. He grinned, remembering how it had gotten switched in the middle of the lovemaking.</p><p>She stirred. \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA work of art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She nodded once in appreciation. \u201cA work of art. That was pretty quick, Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty quick, you mean for a man who is still recovering from a truly mind-blowing experience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh. Was that your mind?\u201d Her smile was very smug. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI handed you that line on a platter. Admit it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI admit it. You\u2019re good, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m a lot better than good.\u201d He leaned down to kiss her bare hip. \u201cI\u2019m terrific. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll survive.\u201d She hauled herself up on her elbows and surveyed herself. \u201cBut the dress is dead meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are plenty more where it came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Department stores are full of little black dresses.\u201d She noticed the tie around her neck and frowned. \u201cHow did that get there?\u201d</p><p>He eased himself off the table, stood and stretched. \u201cSome questions are better left unanswered.\u201d</p><p>He studied a canvas propped against the wall directly across from him as he zipped his trousers and buckled his belt. It was another one of her unique, riveting creations, all hot, intense light and dark, disturbing shadows. He felt it reaching out to pull him into that world, just as her other works did. He had to force himself to look away from it.</p><p>He turned his head and saw that the sensual, teasing laughter that had gleamed in her eyes a moment ago had evaporated. She was watching him in the same way that he had looked at the painting, as if she were wary of being sucked into his universe.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re having an affair?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Curious. Polite. Very cool. Just asking.</p><p>Her deliberately casual air wiped out a lot of the satisfaction that he had been enjoying. Whatever was going on here was a long way from settled.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. I think we\u2019d better call this an affair. I don\u2019t see that we have any real choice.\u201d</p><p>She sat up slowly and dangled her legs off the edge of the worktable. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>She had small, delicate ankles and beautifully arched feet, he noticed. Her toenails were painted scarlet.</p><p>And here he\u2019d never considered himself a foot man.</p><p>He walked back to the table, fitted his hands to her waist, lifted her and set her on her feet. He did not release her. \u201cBe sort of awkward to have to admit that we\u2019re into one- and two-night stands, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight make us both look extremely shallow and superficial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have that,\u201d he said easily. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go back to your apartment. We need some sleep. Got a long drive back to Eclipse Bay tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>A deceptively bright sun supplied light but very little heat to Eclipse Bay. Small whitecaps snapped and sparkled on the water. The brisk breeze promised another storm soon. They drove through the community\u2019s small business district on the way back to the cottage. Lillian noticed that the handful of men standing around a truck at the town\u2019s only gas station were huddled into goose-down vests and heavy windbreakers.</p><p>Sandy Hickson, the owner of the station, spotted Gabe\u2019s car and waved a casual greeting. His companions turned to glance at the vehicle. Even from where she sat, Lillian thought she could see the open speculation in their eyes.</p><p>A Harte and a Madison could not even drive through Eclipse Bay together without drawing interested gazes.</p><p>\u201cSmall town,\u201d Gabe said. He sounded completely unruffled by the attention.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like there\u2019s a heck of a lot to do around here in the middle of winter. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019ve got a social obligation to bring a little excitement to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did Madisons worry about their social obligations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we started hanging out more with you Hartes. You\u2019re a bad influence on us.\u201d</p><p>She noticed the illuminated message indicator on the answering machine when she walked into the Harte family cottage a short time later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabe saw it too. \u201cGot a hunch Mitchell ratted us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks that way. Probably my mother. Great.\u201d She put down the carton of painting supplies she had carried in from the car. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you said your folks were on a business trip in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. But you know as well as I do that gossip travels fast among the Hartes and the Madisons, especially since the wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, we both knew we wouldn\u2019t be able to keep this a secret. And it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re not all adults here.\u201d</p><p>He sounded a little too philosophical, she thought. Downright upbeat, in fact. As if the prospect of explaining away a red-hot affair between a Harte and a Madison was no big deal. Just a walk in the park.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all adults here.\u201d</p><p>He set her suitcase in the hall and looked at her, brows raised in polite inquiry. \u201cNeed backup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom a Madison? That would be like pouring oil on a burning fire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe Madisons are good at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that the next time I\u2019m trying to start a blaze instead of putting one out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be a tough fire to put out,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She did not know if she ought to take that as a warning or just another teasing remark. Upon brief reflection, she decided it would be best to assume the latter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult,\u201d she said. \u201cI make my own decisions. My parents know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He looked unconvinced but he turned to walk toward the door. \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t need my assistance in pacifying your mother, I\u2019ll be on my way. See you for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>He said it with such breathtaking casualness, she thought. Taking the concept of dinner together for granted. The unspoken expectation of spending the night was very clear. He was moving right into her daily routine, making himself comfortable.</p><p>Well? They had both agreed that they were starting an affair, hadn\u2019t they? Why the sudden qualms?</p><p>But the answer was there in the next heartbeat. For all her fine talk of being a grown-up, the bottom line here was that getting involved with Gabe was a dangerous business.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go out tonight?\u201d she said on sudden impulse.</p><p>Dining out in public would be more like a date. She could handle a date with him. Dates were more structured, more ritualized. They were not infused with quite the same degree of casual intimacy as cooking dinner together and eating it at the kitchen table. A date allowed her to keep a little distance. So what if they went back to his place later and made wild, passionate love. Some people did that after a date. Or so she had heard.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Something told her that he had guessed what was going through her mind. But he did not argue. Instead, he walked out onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up. Six-thirty okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can meet you at your place.\u201d She went to stand in the doorway. \u201cIt\u2019s a short walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019ll be dark. I don\u2019t want you walking alone after dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. We\u2019re not exactly crime central around here. Especially in the dead of winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEclipse Bay isn\u2019t the same town it was when you and I were kids. It\u2019s not just the summer tourists who cause trouble around here now. Chamberlain College is expanding and so is the institute. I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t stroll around on your own after the sun goes down.\u201d</p><p>She propped one shoulder against the door frame, amused, and crossed her arms. \u201cAre you always this bossy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cautious, not bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe a tad inclined to be overcontrolling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but hey, isn\u2019t everyone?\u201d He brushed his mouth across hers. \u201cHumor me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. This time.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, satisfied and went down the steps. \u201cSee you later. Good luck with your painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>He paused and looked back over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to go online to do some deep background research on a potential Madison Commercial client. Why?\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I explained to you that what I do at M.C. is called work, not fun.\u201d He gave her his slow, sexy Madison smile. \u201cFun comes later, after work. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the Jag, opened the door and got behind the wheel.</p><p>Back at the beginning she had made the mistake of assuming that he was a victim of burnout because he claimed that running Madison Commercial was not fun for him. In one sense, she thought, he was right.</p><p>But work wasn\u2019t the correct label, either, although it was the one he preferred. The truth was, Madison Commercial was his passion.</p><p>Passion wasn\u2019t fun. Passion was serious stuff.</p><p>She had always understood that distinction intuitively when it came to her painting. Now she was starting to understand it about her relationship with Gabe, as well. Serious stuff.</p><p>She went back into the house, closed the door and crossed to the phone to listen to her messages.</p><p>There were two, she noticed. The first was, as she had expected, from her mother.</p><p>Might as well get this over with fast. She braced herself and dialed the number of the hotel room in San Diego.</p><p>We\u2019re all adults here.</p><p>Elaine Harte answered on the second ring. In typical maternal fashion, she did not take long to come to the point.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world is going on up there in Eclipse Bay?\u201d she asked without preamble.</p><p>\u201cLong story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather phoned yesterday. He and your father talked for a very long time. It was not what anyone would call a cheerful, lighthearted conversation. I haven\u2019t heard those two go at it like that in years. Sullivan says that you\u2019ve closed Private Arrangements for good. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, darling, why?\u201d Elaine\u2019s voice rose in that practiced wail of dismay that is unique to mothers around the world. \u201cYou were doing so well.\u201d</p><p>Elaine did not actually add at last but it was there, silently tacked on to the end of the sentence.</p><p>\u201cYou know why, Mom.\u201d</p><p>There was a short silence, then Elaine sighed.</p><p>\u201cYour painting,\u201d she said.</p><p>The whining tone had vanished from her voice as if by magic, Lillian noticed. Smart moms also knew when to abandon a tactic that no longer worked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this for a long time, Mom. I need to see if I can make it happen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you keep Private Arrangements going while you find out if you can make a living with art?</p><p>You\u2019ve always painted in the evenings and on weekends.\u201d</p><p>Lillian flopped down on the sofa and stacked her heels on the coffee table. \u201cI feel that the time has come to put my art at the top of my agenda. I need to concentrate on it. The fact is, after a full day at Private Arrangements, I\u2019m tired, Mom. I don\u2019t have a lot of energy left for my work.\u201d</p><p>My work . She was using the word, herself, she realized, mildly astonished. The same way Gabe used it, to describe the important thing that she did. Painting wasn\u2019t a hobby. It wasn\u2019t fun. It wasn\u2019t entertainment. It was her passion.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if the painting doesn\u2019t go well?\u201d Elaine said. \u201cWill you reopen Private Arrangements? You still have your program and your client list, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think about that now, Mom. I have to stay focused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like your father and your grandfather when you say things like that.\u201d Elaine hesitated and then probed further. \u201cSullivan told your father something else. He said that you and Gabe Madison are seeing each other . . . socially.\u201d</p><p>Lillian laughed in spite of tension. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he said a lot more than that.\u201d</p><p>Elaine cleared her throat. \u201cI believe he used the phrase \u2018shacking up together.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d Lillian took her heels off the table and sat up on the edge of the sofa. \u201cMitchell Madison did squeal to Granddad. Interesting that he went straight to Sullivan with the news, isn\u2019t it? I wonder why he did that.\u201d</p><p>There was another brief pause.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d Elaine asked, her voice grim.</p><p>\u201cAfraid so.\u201d Lillian hunched around the phone in her hand. \u201cBut I prefer the phrase \u2018seeing each other socially\u2019 to \u2018shacking up together.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cMen of Mitchell\u2019s and Sullivan\u2019s age have a different view of these matters. And a different vocabulary to describe them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, how does Gabe describe your, uh, relationship?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re all adults here.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t actually asked him that question. Not in so many words. Look, Mom, I know you mean well, but this conversation is getting a bit personal. I\u2019m perfectly capable of handling my own private life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Hartes and Madisons get together in Eclipse Bay, there is no such thing as a private life,\u201d Elaine said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you that. But I\u2019m still capable of dealing with things here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m sure. Mom, I\u2019m not in high school anymore. Or even college, for that matter. I\u2019ve been getting by out there in the big bad world all on my own for quite a while now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had to deal with the complications of having a Madison in your life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabe is a different kind of Madison, remember? He\u2019s the one who made it through college and built a very successful business. When I was a kid, I recall Dad saying that Gabe was the one Madison who proved the exception to the rule that all Madisons were bound to come to a bad end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, I know.\u201d Another short silence hummed on the line. \u201cBut between you and me, Gabe was the one I worried about the most.\u201d</p><p>That stopped Lillian cold. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>Elaine was quiet for a moment. Lillian could almost hear her thinking about the past.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one who was concerned about him,\u201d Elaine said eventually. \u201cIsabel and I discussed him often. Even as a little boy, Gabe always seemed too self-contained, too controlled. He never lost his temper, never got in trouble at school. Always got good grades. It just wasn\u2019t natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean for a Madison?\u201d .</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean for a little boy. Any little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was as if he always had his own private agenda. Looking back, I can see that he must have been driven, even then, by his vision of building a business empire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cHe needed to prove something to himself. But he accomplished his goal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople who are compelled by a lifelong ambition do not change, even after it appears to everyone else around them that they have achieved that ambition. In my experience they remain driven. It\u2019s a deeply imbedded characteristic.\u201d</p><p>A Madison and his passion.</p><p>\u201cMom, listen, I really don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude on your personal life, but I am your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lillian sighed. \u201cYou gotta do what a mom\u2019s gotta do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should assume that nothing has changed with Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison Commercial was always the most important thing in his life. It still is. If anything, all that single-minded determination and willpower he used to get to where he is today has only become more honed through the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning,\u201d Elaine said bluntly, \u201cthat if he has decided to see you socially, as you call it, he very likely has a reason.\u201d</p><p>She felt her stomach tighten. \u201cIs this where you tell me that the only thing Gabe wants from me is sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Elaine paused. \u201cTo be frank, I expect that, given his money and position, Gabe can get as much of that as he wants.\u201d</p><p>Lillian winced. She had a feeling her mother was right. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me that you think he\u2019s getting some sort of perverse satisfaction out of having an intimate relationship with a Harte. I refuse to believe that he\u2019s so warped or so immature that he sees seducing me as a form of one-upsmanship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She felt her stomach unknot. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t stoop to such a thing just to score points off a Harte. Heck, his brother is married to one now. Even Granddad couldn\u2019t possibly believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Elaine said again, soothing now but firm. \u201cI don\u2019t think Gabe would seduce you just to score points in that ridiculous old feud. He\u2019s a long-term strategist, not a short-term opportunist.\u201d</p><p>She let herself relax a little more. \u201cSo, what are you trying to say, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to be careful, dear. Your father and I have been talking a lot lately. It is clear that Harte Investments will have to be sold or merged when Hampton retires in a couple of years. None of you three kids wants to take over the company, nor does your father want you to feel that you must.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. He\u2019s been great about not pressuring us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord knows he experienced enough pressure when he was your age. He refuses to put any of you through it, regardless of what Sullivan wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lillian froze. \u201cAre you telling me that the only reason Dad took over Harte Investments was because Granddad pressured him to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the years following the breakup of Harte-Madison, your grandfather put everything he had into building Harte Investments. It was always understood that Hampton would be his heir apparent. Your father went along with Sullivan\u2019s dreams but they were never really his dreams.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Lillian got to her feet and stood in front of the window, the phone clutched very tightly in her hand. She looked out at the white ripples on the bay and knew a strange sense of sudden understanding. It was as if a veil had been pulled back. She had just gotten a fleeting glimpse of a piece of family history that she had never even suspected existed.</p><p>\u201cHampton did not want any of you three to feel you had to live someone else\u2019s dreams,\u201d Elaine said.</p><p>\u201cHe made that clear to your grandfather years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad took the heat for us? I always wondered why Granddad didn\u2019t make a bigger issue out of the fact that none of us showed much interest in Harte Investments. We all thought that Sullivan had just mellowed with the years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFat chance.\u201d Elaine gave a soft, ladylike snort. \u201cYour father went toe-to-toe with Sullivan more than once over that issue. He warned your grandfather that he would not permit any of you three to be coerced into turning the company into a family dynasty. Hampton wanted each of you to feel free to choose your own paths in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Dad never felt that he, himself, had that option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the early days,\u201d Elaine said. \u201cBut things have changed. Hampton and I agree now that life is simply too short to spend it maintaining someone else\u2019s vision. Your father has plans for his future and he\u2019s going after it with both hands. Sullivan has called the shots in this family long enough. He can do whatever he wants with Harte Investments. Hampton and I are cutting loose.\u201d</p><p>There was no mistaking the steely satisfaction and determination in her mother\u2019s voice. This was, Lillian thought, a whole new side of Elaine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the charitable foundation you two plan to set up, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Lillian asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Your father can\u2019t wait to get started on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d Lillian blinked away the moisture that was blurring her view of the bay. \u201cGuess Hannah and Nick and I all owe Dad big-time for keeping Sullivan off our backs, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Elaine said pointedly. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the issue here. What I want you to understand is that Gabe Madison is one very smart, very savvy CEO. Rumors travel like wildfire in his world. He has to be aware of the situation at Harte Investments. He must know very well that the company probably won\u2019t continue as a privately held family business much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect he\u2019s working on the assumption that H.I. will either be merged or sold soon. But if he marries you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Lillian could hardly breathe. \u201cStop right there. Don\u2019t say it, Mom. Please don\u2019t tell me that he\u2019s sleeping with me just because he thinks he can get his hands on a third of Harte Investments that way.\u201d</p><p>There was a heavily freighted pause on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d have to do more than sleep with you to get his hands on a large piece of the company,\u201d Elaine said finally. \u201cHe\u2019d have to marry you to accomplish that goal, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Through the window Lillian could see that another new storm was moving in quickly. The winds were snapping and snarling beneath the eaves of the cottage. An ominous haze was forming out on the bay.</p> <p>The water was turning steel gray.</p><p>\u201cLook on the bright side, Mom. Gabe hasn\u2019t said a word about marriage. I have it on good authority that, when you get right down to it, I\u2019m not his type.\u201d</p><p>She went through the motions of making a pot of tea while she dealt with the floodtide of restless thoughts that cluttered her brain after she hung up the phone. By the time the water boiled, she had managed to regain some perspective.</p><p>Get a grip, she told herself as she poured the brewed green tea into a cup. What she had said to her mother was true. Gabe had not even hinted at marriage. He seemed quite satisfied with the prospect of having an affair with her, but that appeared to be his only goal.</p><p>On the other hand, she did not have a great track record when it came to applying her intuitive abilities to Gabe Madison. For some reason, her normally reliable sensors always seemed to get scrambled when it came to analyzing his vibes. Until last night, for example, she had been laboring under the assumption that the man was suffering a severe case of burnout.</p><p>She wandered into her studio, mug in hand, and looked at the blank canvas propped on the easel. She had come here to Eclipse Bay to paint, but thus far she had done little more than unpack her paints and brushes. She had made some sketches but she had not done any serious work. The relationship with Gabe was proving to be a huge distraction.</p><p>She fiddled with a pencil for a while, doing a little drawing, trying to get into the zone where the vision of the picture took shape around her, forming an alternate universe.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t concentrate, so she headed back toward the kitchen to refill her tea mug.</p><p>She saw the light on the telephone answering machine when she was halfway across the living room.</p><p>Belatedly she remembered that there had been two messages. She had only listened to the one from her mother.</p><p>She changed course to play the second message.</p><p>\u201c. . . This is Mitchell Madison. We gotta talk.\u201d</p><p>Just what she needed to round out her day and ensure that she got absolutely no painting done whatsoever.</p><p>That afternoon, she walked into Mitchell Madison\u2019s garden and looked around with interest. She had heard about this fantasyland of lush ferns, exotic herbs, and exuberant roses for as long as she could recall. For years it had been generally accepted in Eclipse Bay that Mitchell\u2019s garden was far and away the most spectacular in town. Even now, in the heart of winter when all of the blooms had disappeared, it was an earthly paradise. But, then, they said gardening was Mitchell\u2019s passion and everyone knew how it was with a Madison and his passion.</p><p>She followed the graveled path that led past banks of thriving ferns and through a maze of exquisitely maintained plant beds. The recent rains had released rich scents from the ground. At the far end of the walk a large greenhouse loomed. She could see a shadowy figure moving behind the opaque walls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She opened the door and stepped into the fragrant, humid warmth. Mitchell was working intently over some clay pots arrayed on a waist-high bench. He had a pair of small shears in one hand and a tiny trowel in the other. The pockets of his heavy-duty, dirt-stained apron were filled with gardening implements. He appeared to be totally engrossed in his plants.</p><p>\u201cI got your message, Mr. Madison,\u201d she said from the doorway.</p><p>Mitchell looked up quickly, gray brows bristling above his fierce, aquiline nose. \u201cThere you are. Come in and close the door. It\u2019s cold out there today.\u201d</p><p>She stepped farther into the greenhouse, allowing the door to swing shut. \u201cYou made it sound urgent. Is something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShoot and damn, course there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d He put down the shears and the trowel and stripped off his gloves. \u201cI turned this thing over to Sullivan but as far as I can see, he hasn\u2019t done a blame thing to straighten up this mess. Looks like I\u2019ll have to take a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSituation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst things first. You serious about Gabe or are you just havin\u2019 yourself some fun?\u201d</p><p>She came to an abrupt halt. This was going to be worse than she imagined. For an instant she was afraid the thick air would suffocate her. With an effort of will, she managed to resist the temptation to flee back outside.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games with me, young woman. You know what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about here. If you\u2019re fixin\u2019 to break Gabe\u2019s heart, I want to find out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Break Gabe\u2019s heart?\u201d From out of nowhere, anger surged through her. \u201cWhat makes you think that\u2019s even a remote possibility?\u201d</p><p>Madison gave a muffled snort. \u201cYou\u2019ve got him in the palm of your hand and you know it. Question is, what are you gonna do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. Just because we\u2019re seeing a lot of each other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing each other? Huh. Appears to me that the two of you are doin\u2019 a heck of a lot more than just lookin\u2019 at each other. You think no one would notice if you just up and ran off to Portland together for a night? Shoot and damn, you aren\u2019t even trying to keep things a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know as well as I do that you can\u2019t control gossip here in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was your age most folks had the common decency to do their foolin\u2019 around out of sight.\u201d</p><p>He was genuinely irate, she realized, as if this mess were somehow all her fault. His bad temper only served to inflame her own.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I hear, Mr. Madison. The way my folks tell it, you were more than a little obvious about your fooling around back in the good old days. In fact, Madisons in general are notorious for keeping the gossip mills humming here in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimes change. Things are different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that things are different now doesn\u2019t change the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Gabe.\u201d Mitchell planted his hands on his hips. \u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople keep saying that, but how do I know if it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to take my word for it.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled coldly. \u201cNow why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I can see where you might not be able to figure him out. Gabe\u2019s a little complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little complicated. That\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe important thing here is that I don\u2019t want him hurt. If you\u2019re not serious about him, I want you to break it off now before he gets in any deeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because we\u2019re seeing each other,\u201d she said through her teeth, \u201cit does not necessarily follow that your grandson is in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the two of you were just bouncing around together in a bed in Portland, that would be one thing. I wouldn\u2019t pay any attention. But Gabe left Madison Commercial to follow you here to Eclipse Bay. That means he\u2019s serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief, you make it sound like the company\u2019s his wife and I\u2019m the other woman.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s not too far off, when you think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, for the record, Gabe did not leave Madison Commercial for me.\u201d She spread her hands. \u201cHe\u2019s just taking a little vacation, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. \u2019Scuse my language. Gabe doesn\u2019t take vacations. Leastways, not monthlong ones. He walked out on M.C. because he lost his head over you. That\u2019s the only explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very romantic notion but that\u2019s not what happened. Furthermore, there are any number of people around these parts and several in my own family who will be only too happy to tell you what they believe is the real reason he took a month off from Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what the heck do they figure that real reason is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the talk. The gossip in certain quarters is that Gabe wants to marry me in order to get his hands on a large piece of Harte Investments.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell stared at her in astonishment. He looked genuinely thunderstruck. \u201cAre you crazy, woman?</p><p>Madisons don\u2019t marry for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe most Madisons don\u2019t marry for money. But everyone has always claimed that Gabe is a different kind of Madison.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell snorted. \u201cNot that different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we all know that Madison Commercial is the most important thing in Gabe\u2019s life. It\u2019s his creation. Over the years, he has sacrificed for it, fought for it, nurtured it. Why wouldn\u2019t he be attracted to someone who could add significantly to his empire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019d been the type to marry for money, he\u2019d have married Marilyn Thornley all those years ago. Her family has plenty of cash.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI was under the impression that they broke up because Marilyn ditched him for Thornley, not because Gabe didn\u2019t want to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot and damn. Can\u2019t you figure it out for yerself? They split on accounta Gabe made it clear that Madison Commercial was more important to him than she was. That woman likes to be number one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I, Mr. Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Harte. You understand about business coming first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, as a matter of fact, I do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do. Look, you know damn well you\u2019ve got Gabe\u2019s full, undivided attention and that means things are dead serious. At least they are for him. What I want to know is, how do you feel about Gabe? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You willing to get married?\u201d</p><p>She took a step back and groped for the doorknob with one hand. \u201cMr. Madison, this discussion is purely hypothetical. For your information, the subject of marriage has never come up between Gabe and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like it will. And pretty damn quick, too, if I know Gabe. He didn\u2019t get where he is by letting grass grow under his feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think so, Mr. Madison.\u201d She found the doorknob and wrapped her fingers around it very tightly, using it to steady herself. \u201cFor the record, Gabe has made it very clear that he does not want to marry what he refers to as an arty type. If you will recall, I\u2019m an artist. That sort of takes me out of the running, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah. Not with a Madison. Madisons aren\u2019t that logical when it comes to love.\u201d</p><p>She had to get out of here. She was ready to explode. \u201cLet me make something clear. If, and I repeat, if, Gabe ever brought up the subject of marriage, I would want to know that I was more important to him than just another addition to his empire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how the hell is he supposed to prove that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me. That\u2019s not my problem. It\u2019s Gabe\u2019s. Assuming you\u2019re right, of course, which is highly doubtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot and damn, if that isn\u2019t just like a Harte. Askin\u2019 for hard evidence when it comes to something that\u2019s downright impossible to prove.\u201d Mitchell leveled a finger at her. \u201cKnow what I think? I think you\u2019ve just decided to play with him a little. You\u2019re havin\u2019 yourself some fun, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re not serious about him.\u201d</p> <p>She had the door open now but something in his voice made her pause on the threshold. \u201cYou\u2019re really worried about him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a right to worry about him. He\u2019s my grandson, damn it. I may not have done the best job of raising him and Rafe after their parents died, but I did what I could to make things right. I got a responsibility to Gabe. I got to look out for him.\u201d</p><p>She searched his face. \u201cHe has the impression that you don\u2019t care that he\u2019s made a success of Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse I care,\u201d Mitchell roared. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what he\u2019s done with that company. He proved to you Hartes and the whole damn world that a Madison can make somethin\u2019 of himself. He proved that a Madison who sets his mind to it can get his act together, that being a member of this family doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doomed to screw up everything you touch the way I did and the way his father did.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, hard silence.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever tell him that?\u201d Lillian asked softly. \u201cBecause I think he needs to hear it.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell\u2019s mouth opened again but this time no words emerged.</p><p>She turned and walked out into the garden.</p><p>Gabe dunked a clam strip into the spicy red sauce. \u201cHeard you went out to the house to see Mitchell this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Lillian started a little. The fork in her hand trembled slightly. She clenched her fingers around it and stabbed at the mound of coleslaw on her plate.</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Stalling, he thought. Why? What the hell was going on here?</p><p>This morning when they had left Portland together he had been feeling good. More settled. Like he finally had a handle on this relationship. He had assured himself that various issues had been clarified.</p><p>He and Lillian were having an affair. They both agreed on that. Couldn\u2019t get much simpler or more straightforward than that.</p> <p>But now that they were back in Eclipse Bay, everything was starting to get complicated again.</p><p>He pondered that while he listened to the background hum of conversations and the clatter of dishes and silverware. The Crab Trap was a noisy, cheerful place. Until Rafe and Hannah got Dreamscape open, it was the closest thing to fine dining that Eclipse Bay could offer. It boasted a view of the bay, actual tablecloths and little candles in old Chianti bottles. On prom night and Mother\u2019s Day it was always fully booked.</p><p>It had seemed the obvious choice for dinner tonight.</p><p>A little too obvious, he had realized a few minutes ago when Marilyn Thornley had walked in with a small entourage and occupied the large booth at the rear.</p><p>\u201cRan into Bryce at the gas station.\u201d Gabe put the clam strip into his mouth, chewed and swallowed. \u201cHe mentioned you\u2019d been out to the house. Not like Bryce to say anything about a casual visit. He doesn\u2019t talk much. Must have figured it was important.\u201d</p><p>Lillian hesitated and then gave a tiny shrug. \u201cYour grandfather left a message on my answering machine while we were in Portland. Said he wanted to see me. I drove over to his place. It seemed the polite thing to do under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemed to think that I was exerting my feminine wiles on you. Weaving a net of seduction in which to trap you, et cetera, et cetera. Evidently he\u2019s afraid that I might break your heart.\u201d</p><p>He managed to swallow the clam strip without sputtering and choking but it was not easy.</p><p>\u201cHe said that? That he\u2019s worried you might break my heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said \u2018shoot and damn\u2019 a lot, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a little embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to know if my intentions were honorable,\u201d Lillian said without inflection.</p><p>Gabe made himself pick up another clam strip. \u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him the same thing that I told my mother today when she asked me about our relationship.\u201d</p><p>Definitely getting more complicated by the minute.</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She picked up her water glass. \u201cThat the subject of honorable intentions had not arisen and that it was highly unlikely to arise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told both of them that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about \u2019em now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She flushed and glanced hurriedly around, apparently making certain that no one had overheard him.</p><p>\u201cThat is not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t trying to make a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Gabe, keep your voice down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is down. Yours is starting to get a little loud, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t need this. I\u2019ve had a difficult day. I came here to work. Thus far I have accomplished nothing. Absolutely zilch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPainting not going well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat painting? I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019ll have to go back to Portland to get anything done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy. You seem a little tense tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tense,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, if you say so, but I gotta tell you that you look tense.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her fork very deliberately. \u201cIf this is your idea of a relaxing evening, I\u2014\u201d She broke off, stiffening in her chair. \u201cOh, damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it Marilyn? I saw her come in earlier. Don\u2019t worry about her, she\u2019s busy with her staff in the booth at the back. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll pester us tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Marilyn.\u201d Lillian stared past him toward the door. \u201cAnderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlint? Here? What the hell?\u201d He turned to follow her gaze. Sure enough, J. Anderson Flint stood in close conversation with the hostess. \u201cWell, what do you know? Almost didn\u2019t recognize him in his clothes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat on earth could he possibly be doing in Eclipse Bay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that was obvious.\u201d Gabe turned back to his food. \u201cHe followed you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is absolutely no reason for him do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can think of one.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to buy your matchmaking program, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. I forgot about that. But I told him I didn\u2019t want to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably thinks he can talk you into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. I did not need this.\u201d</p><p>Gabe turned his head to take another look at Flint. At that moment Anderson caught sight of Lillian. His smile was the sort a man bestows on a long-lost pal. He made a never-mind gesture to the hostess and started across the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cHe followed you, all right,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Lillian crushed a napkin in one hand. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he wants my program that badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a lot of money with that program. Why wouldn\u2019t he want to do the same?\u201d</p><p>Her brows came together in a sharp frown. \u201cYou really are paranoid when it comes to money, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not paranoid, I\u2019m cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCautious, my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillian.\u201d Anderson came to a halt beside the table before Lillian could finish her sentence. He leaned down with the clear intent of kissing her lightly in greeting. \u201cWhat a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>Lillian turned her head slightly, just enough to avoid the kiss. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m attending a conference at Chamberlain College. Arrived this afternoon. I\u2019m staying at a motel just outside of town. I remember your saying something about taking some time off here in Eclipse Bay. We\u2019ll have to get together while I\u2019m here.\u201d He extended his hand to Gabe. \u201cJ. Anderson Flint. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe Madison.\u201d He rose slowly and kept the handshake perfunctory. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been formally introduced but I did see you once. Don\u2019t think you would remember the occasion, though. You were a little busy at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe Madison of Madison Commercial? This is, indeed, a pleasure. Are you one of Lillian\u2019s clients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d Lillian interrupted crisply. \u201cWe both have roots here in Eclipse Bay. My sister is married to his brother. Our families go back a long way together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Anderson kept his attention on Gabe. \u201cHow long are you going to be in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it takes,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>There was a stir at the front of the restaurant. He was conscious of a change in the atmosphere of the room. At the door an attractive woman was in heated conversation with the hostess.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Claire Jensen.\u201d Lillian sounded concerned. \u201cMarilyn\u2019s new campaign manager, remember?</p><p>Looks like something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>She was right, he thought. Even from here he could see that Claire\u2019s face was tight with fury.</p><p>He also noticed that Marilyn had left her booth and was making her way swiftly toward the front of the restaurant. Her mouth was compressed into a tight, determined line.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the looks of this.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s voice rose above the hubbub. \u201cGet out of my way, I said.\u201d She tried to push the hostess aside.</p><p>\u201cI have something to say to that bitch and I\u2019m not leaving until I\u2019ve said it.\u201d</p><p>Marilyn reached the hostess\u2019s podium. She gripped Claire\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this,\u201d she said to the hostess.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me, you bitch,\u201d Claire raged. \u201cTake your hands off me. I\u2019ll have you arrested. You can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>But Marilyn already had her halfway through the door. Within seconds both women disappeared outside into the rainy night.</p><p>A hush fell over the restaurant. It lasted for all of five seconds. Then the room erupted in a buzz of excited conversation.</p><p>\u201cWas that Marilyn Thornley?\u201d Anderson sounded awed. \u201cThe wife of the politician who quit the senate race?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon to be ex-wife.\u201d Lillian watched the closed doors at the front of the room. \u201cAnd something tells me that Claire Jensen is now an ex\u2013campaign manager. Poor Claire. I wonder what happened? I thought everything was going so well for her in her new job.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened again a short time later. Marilyn strode back into the room, looking cool and unruffled by the skirmish. She paused to speak quietly to the hostess. Then she walked straight toward the table where Gabe sat with Lillian.</p><p>\u201cYou know her? You know Marilyn Thornley?\u201d Anderson asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cHer family has had a summer place here in town for years,\u201d Lillian explained. \u201cGabe is much better acquainted with her than I am, however.\u201d</p><p>Gabe gave her what he hoped was a silencing glare. He got one of her bright just-try-to-shut-me-up looks in return.</p><p>Marilyn arrived at the table.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that little scene,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to let Claire go today. She didn\u2019t take it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerminations are always so stressful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice throbbed with compassion. \u201cMay I say that you handled that unfortunate scene very effectively. You took complete control before things got out of hand. That\u2019s the key. Complete control.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomeone had to do something before she interrupted everyone\u2019s dinner.\u201d Marilyn smiled and extended a graceful hand. \u201cMarilyn Thornley.\u201d</p><p>Anderson looked dazzled. \u201cJ. Anderson Flint. In town for a conference at Chamberlain. I\u2019m delighted to meet you, Mrs. Thornley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Marilyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p> <p>This was getting downright sticky, Gabe mused.</p><p>\u201cGot a new campaign manager lined up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting together a short list,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cI intend to announce my selection as soon as possible.</p><p>This problem couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time. I can\u2019t afford to lose any momentum.\u201d</p><p>Anderson glanced toward the door, a concerned expression knitting his brows. \u201cI trust your former manager won\u2019t cause you any trouble. Disgruntled employees can sometimes be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClaire will behave herself if she knows what\u2019s good for her,\u201d Marilyn declared. \u201cIt was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Flint. Any friend of Gabe\u2019s and Lillian\u2019s is welcome at the institute. Please feel free to drop by while you\u2019re in town and pick up some of my campaign material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Anderson said immediately.</p><p>Marilyn inclined her head. \u201cWonderful. Now I\u2019ll let you two get back to your meal. Have a nice evening.\u201d</p><p>She walked away toward the booth at the rear. Anderson did not take his eyes off her.</p><p>\u201cA very impressive woman,\u201d he breathed. \u201cVery impressive. So forceful. Dynamic. Authoritative. We need more people like her in public office.\u201d</p><p>Lillian caught Gabe\u2019s eye. She looked amused.</p> <p>\u201cA perfect match,\u201d she murmured beneath the hum of background chatter.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAre you speaking as a professional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He knew before she started making excuses that she wasn\u2019t going to spend the night with him.</p><p>\u201cI really need to get some sleep,\u201d Lillian said when they walked out of the restaurant some time later. \u201cI want to get up early tomorrow morning and try to do some work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go again. It\u2019s those conversations you had with your mother and Mitchell, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He opened the door of the Jag with a little more force than was necessary. \u201cThey messed with your mind.\u201d</p><p>She slid into the dark cave that was the front seat. \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with them. I just need some quiet time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Quiet time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you earlier that I haven\u2019t gotten any real painting done since I got here. If I go home with you tonight, I probably won\u2019t get to work until noon or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want to interfere with your best painting time.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door. With a little more force than was necessary.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a business,\u201d Hampton said on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is.\u201d He\u2019d had enough of the familiar argument, Sullivan decided. He ended the call abruptly with a sudden punch of a button.</p><p>He ought to be used to this feeling after so many years of butting heads with his stubborn son. It was always like this whenever the subject of the future of Harte Investments arose. Hampton had done a brilliant job with the company, but he flatly refused to be concerned about what happened to it in the next generation. As if it didn\u2019t matter a damn.</p><p>It had taken him a long time to realize that, to Hampton, Harte Investments was just a business. Running the company was nothing more than a job to him. He had done it extraordinarily well but he could walk away tomorrow and never look back.</p><p>In fact, walking away from H.I. was precisely what Hampton planned to do. Sometime in the next two years. Sullivan swore under his breath and reached for his cane. He still could not believe that after having worked so hard to take the company to another level, his son was looking forward to retiring so that he could start a charitable foundation.</p><p>As far as he was concerned, Sullivan thought, charity began at home.</p><p>Just a business.</p><p>What the hell was the matter with everyone else in the family? Didn\u2019t they understand that a company like Harte Investments was a work of art? It had required vision and sweat to bring it to life. It was the result of a lot of carefully calculated risks and farsighted strategy. It had heart. It had struggled and fought and survived in a jungle where other businesses, large and small, got eaten alive.</p><p>And now, because none of his grandchildren had any interest in the company, it would be sold or swallowed up by some other, larger, predator.</p><p>He rapped the tip of the cane sharply against the cool terra-cotta tiles of the living room floor. The small gesture did nothing to release his pent-up frustration.</p><p>Just a business.</p><p>He stopped at the bank of floor-to-ceiling French doors that overlooked the pool.</p><p>Rachel was on her last lap. He watched her glide through the turquoise water and felt some of his anger fade. He became aware of the quiet sense of connection that he always experienced when he saw her. It calmed him and gave him a centered feeling that he could not explain. The older he got, the more he realized that Rachel helped define him. A great deal of what he knew about himself he had learned from living with her all these years.</p><p>He opened one of the glass-paned doors and went out onto the patio. It was late afternoon. The long rays of the desert sun were blocked by the walls of the house. The pool lay in comfortable shadow. In the distance the mountains were very sharp against the incredibly blue Arizona sky.</p><p>He selected two bottles of chilled springwater from the small refrigerator he had installed near the outdoor grill and lowered himself onto a lounger. He unscrewed the cap of one of the bottles, took a long swallow, and waited for Rachel to emerge from the jeweled pool. Talking to her always helped him put things into perspective.</p><p>She reached the steps and walked up out of the sparkling water. He watched her peel her swim cap off her short, silver-blond hair and admired her figure in the black-and-white bathing suit. After all this time he still felt the quiet heat of sexual attraction. She was only five years younger than he but somewhere along the line she had stopped aging, at least to him. He would want her until the day he died. And probably after that, too.</p><p>Her mouth curved as she walked toward him across the patio. \u201cI can see that the discussion with Hampton did not go well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where he gets that stubborn streak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not from you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She picked up her white terrycloth robe, wrapped it around herself and sat down beside him. He handed her one of the bottles of cold water. She removed the cap and took a sip. They sat and watched the sunlight on the mountains. Sullivan relaxed into the lounger.</p><p>\u201cHampton and Elaine think that Gabe will try to marry her in order to get his hands on a chunk of Harte,\u201d he said after a while.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Madison I ever knew had enough common sense to marry for money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood point. But everyone says that Gabe is a different kind of Madison. His company is his passion.</p><p>He built it to prove something to himself and everyone else. It\u2019s as important to him as Harte Investments is to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sullivan grimaced. \u201cJust wish one or two of my grandkids felt the same way about H.I. It\u2019s Hampton\u2019s fault that none of them ever showed much interest in the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want them to feel the same kind of pressure he got from you when he was growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPressure, hell. I just guided him a little, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou groomed him for Harte from the day he was born. Made him think he owed it to you and that he had to prove he wouldn\u2019t turn out to be the same kind of wastrel Mitchell\u2019s son was. Hampton took over the firm to please you and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? He\u2019s done a damn fine job of growing the company. He couldn\u2019t have run it that well if he hadn\u2019t had a talent for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHampton has a talent, all right. But he wants to use it to set up that foundation of his. He\u2019s had enough of H.I. and he doesn\u2019t want any of our grandchildren to be forced into running it when he steps down.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan groaned. \u201cI knew Hannah and Lillian probably wouldn\u2019t take on H.I. But I had hopes that Nick would take the helm eventually. Why he had to go off on his own to write mysteries is beyond me. Don\u2019t know why anyone as smart as he is would want to waste time writing novels when he could be running a company the size of Harte Investments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll three of them have followed their own stars and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d Rachel patted his shoulder. \u201cBesides, you enjoy Nick\u2019s mysteries and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan brooded on that for a moment. \u201cLittle Carson may show some interest in business in a few years,\u201d he said hopefully. \u201cHe\u2019s a bright kid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, he\u2019s only five years old. It will be ages before Carson can even think of assuming such a responsibility. You certainly can\u2019t expect Hampton to hold the reins for another two decades on the off-chance that your great-grandson might someday want to take over the business.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan leaned his head against the back of the lounger and considered the problem.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always telling me what people will do and why,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cDo you think Gabe Madison would marry Lillian just to get his hands on Harte?\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, Rachel hesitated briefly. A troubled frown creased her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate concern, under the circumstances,\u201d she said finally. \u201cOf the two boys, I think Gabe was more affected by all the baggage Mitchell carried because of the blowup of Harte-Madison. Proving to himself and everyone else that he could compete with a Harte has been a fierce source of motivation for Gabe for years. In addition, H.I. is one of his competitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly occasionally. H.I. and M.C. have carved out different territories for the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is that if he saw a chance to control a portion of Harte Investments he might not be able to resist for both emotional and business reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ultimate revenge for a Madison, hmm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that it would be a deliberate act of revenge on his part. More of a subconscious motivation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubconscious, my sweet patoot.\u201d Sullivan took a swig of his springwater and lowered the bottle.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to business, Gabe Madison knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Rachel stretched her legs out on the lounger. \u201cThat stupid feud. I can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s still affecting both our family and the Madisons, too.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan said nothing.</p><p>Rachel studied the pool for a while. \u201cDo you ever think about her?\u201d</p><p>When Rachel spoke in that quiet, thoughtful tone he paid attention. It meant that she was very serious.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked, groping to refocus on whatever this new issue was.</p><p>\u201cClaudia Banner. The woman who destroyed Harte-Madison and ruined your friendship with Mitchell.</p><p>I\u2019ve always assumed that she was very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He summoned up an image of the Claudia he had known all those years ago, contemplated it for a few minutes and then shrugged.</p><p>\u201cShe was a pretty little redhead. Sharp as a tack, too. Mitch and I were fresh out of the service and eager to make our fortunes. She showed us how to do it. That combination of qualities can make a woman seem pretty damn attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you in love with her?\u201d</p><p>He sensed a minefield.</p><p>\u201cThought I was for a time,\u201d he said. \u201cChanged my mind real fast when she disappeared with the total assets of Harte-Madison and dumped the company into bankruptcy. But poor Mitch had fallen for her hook, line, and sinker. He refused to believe she\u2019d conned us. He was convinced that I had somehow used her to grab his share of the firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence the infamous knock-down-drag-out fistfight in front of Fulton\u2019s Supermarket and the start of the legendary Harte-Madison feud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago, Rachel. Mitch and I were young men. Young men do dumb things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you thought you were in love with Claudia Banner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know for certain whether or not you loved her?\u201d</p><p>He gazed out at the mountains. \u201cI now know for sure that whatever the hell I felt for Claudia Banner was not love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so certain of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what love was until I met you.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head very quickly, obviously startled.</p><p>Then she laughed softly, leaned across the small space that separated the two loungers and kissed him lightly.</p><p>\u201cGood answer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I thought it was pretty good, myself.\u201d</p><p>It was also the truth, he thought. But after all these years he was certain she knew that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 14</p><p>He dressed carefully before he went to see her, wanting to strike precisely the right note. So much hung in the balance. He contemplated the limited range of clothing in the closet. Unfortunately he had left many of his best shirts and ties behind in Portland. He hadn\u2019t expected to need them here on the coast. But he was not entirely unprepared. He was never entirely unprepared. He wanted her to know that.</p><p>After due consideration he went with a pale-blue shirt that matched his eyes and an Italian knit sweater that made his shoulders appear a little broader. The trousers and loafers worked well with the sweater.</p><p>He stood in front of the mirror studying the effect. Not quite right. He took off the sweater and went back to the closet for a tie and the corduroy jacket. The tie showed respect. The cord jacket said he was a deep thinker.</p> <p>Satisfied, he left the room and went outside to the parking lot. He got into the car and drove the short distance to the Eclipse Bay Policy Studies Institute.</p><p>Ten minutes later he was standing in front of her secretary\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Mrs. Thornley,\u201d he said.</p><p>The secretary looked skeptical and apologetic at the same time. It was probably a natural-born talent.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but please give her this card. I think she\u2019ll see me.\u201d</p><p>The secretary examined the card and the note he had jotted on it. She got to her feet, went to the closed door behind her desk and opened it.</p><p>He waited until she disappeared inside before checking his reflection in the highly polished chrome base of her name plaque.</p><p>He straightened quickly when the door opened again.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Thornley will see you, Dr. Flint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He took a deep breath, preparing himself for acute disappointment in case he had gotten the wrong impression about her last night. The scene in the restaurant had happened so quickly.</p><p>He went through the door, closed it firmly and stood looking at his fate.</p><p>She studied him from where she sat behind her desk, a vision in a fitted red knit jacket that was accented with gold buttons and well-defined, padded shoulders. She toyed with the small card he had sent in a moment earlier.</p><p>He gave the office a quick once-over, checking the quality of the furnishings. First class all the way. The lady had style and taste. The room was spacious with a view of the town and the bay spread out below in the distance.</p><p>There was another door on the far side of the office. It stood open a crack. Someone was moving around in the adjoining room. Probably an assistant or a speech-writer. He heard a desk drawer slam.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down, Dr. Flint,\u201d Marilyn said. Cool self-possessed authority rang in the words.</p><p>He felt his blood heat. He had not been wrong. She was magnificent. A goddess.</p><p>He lowered himself into one of the sleek black leather chairs.</p> <p>Marilyn rose, crossed the room to the door that separated her office from the smaller one on the far side of the room and closed it very firmly. She smiled at him.</p><p>Absolutely magnificent.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Anderson said.</p><p>\u201cI found out that she had an affair with Trevor,\u201d Marilyn said. She went to stand at the window of the cottage and looked out over the bay. \u201cI could hardly keep her on as my campaign manager after I learned the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess it would be a little awkward,\u201d Lillian admitted. She glanced at her watch. Another morning\u2019s work shot. The last thing she had needed today was to open the front door and find Marilyn Thornley on her front porch. Why me? she wondered. She did not relish being a politician\u2019s confidant.</p><p>\u201cI knew that he was probably screwing someone but I just assumed it was one of his perky little campaign workers. Someone unimportant. Lord knows, it wouldn\u2019t have been the first time. Trevor and I had an understanding, you see. As long as he was reasonably discreet about it, I could ignore it.\u201d</p><p>Marilyn looked different this morning, Lillian thought. No longer the battlefield general with antifreeze running in her veins. More like a woman who has learned the name of her ex-husband\u2019s lover. Hurt.</p><p>Angry. Resentful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about understandings like that,\u201d Lillian said neutrally.</p><p>Marilyn\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cYou sound very disapproving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I wouldn\u2019t want a marriage based on that kind of unwritten contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather be married for your family\u2019s company, is that it?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy but Lillian managed to hold on to her temper. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you came here this morning to tell me this, Marilyn. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I had to talk to someone. I don\u2019t know anyone else I can trust here in town.</p><p>Not with something this personal. I certainly can\u2019t talk to anyone on my staff. I would look weak and emotional.\u201d Marilyn took a deep breath and exhaled, making a visible effort to compose herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have made that crack about being married for Harte Investments. That was uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>Lillian lounged back against the counter. \u201cForget it. Not like you\u2019re the first person to leap to the conclusion that Gabe is only interested in me because of Harte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, it wasn\u2019t right. I apologize. I\u2019m not at my best this morning. The thing is, even though I knew Trevor was sleeping with someone, I never dreamed it was Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it was Claire who had the affair with Trevor?\u201d Lillian asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure accident. I was going through some old expense account statements the other day, gathering data for my divorce attorney. I came across records of some reimbursements Trevor had made to Claire. At first I thought they were legitimate expenses associated with the campaign. Something made me dig a little deeper. Turned out the expenses were incurred at a series of cheap hotels over a period of several months. In each case Trevor and Claire had registered as Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTacky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. Once I started looking, I turned up a few other unusual receipts. When it comes to sex, Trevor has his little, uh, eccentricities. Apparently Claire catered to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. What did Claire say when you confronted her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe denied it, of course. Claimed Trevor must have been with some other woman, not her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t believe her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Marilyn rubbed her temples in a gesture of weariness that seemed uncharacteristic. \u201cNaturally I had to let her go. Wouldn\u2019t you have done the same?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I was absolutely sure of my facts.\u201d</p><p>Definitely should not have answered the door, Lillian thought. At the very least, she ought not to have invited Marilyn inside. But it had been impossible to ignore the bleak pain in the other woman\u2019s eyes. The sisterhood thing.</p><p>\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t have come here,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cI had no right to dump this on you. But I woke up this morning needing to talk to someone and I couldn\u2019t think of anyone else. You and I have a common bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe? That\u2019s stretching the definition of a common bond a bit far, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Marilyn rested a hand on the windowsill. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not even going to try to take him away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, thanks. I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a pragmatic woman,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cI don\u2019t waste time beating my head against stone walls. You don\u2019t have to think of me as your competition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, as a matter of fact I hadn\u2019t thought of you in quite those terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw you two together that night at the old Buckley place I knew that I had no chance of ever resuming my relationship with him. You can offer him something I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lillian felt her insides tighten. \u201cI suppose you mean Harte Investments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not just the company,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cHe probably finds you attractive, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh. You really think so?\u201d</p><p>Marilyn sighed. \u201cYou want to know a little secret? I used to blame your family and Harte Investments for the breakup of my relationship with Gabe.\u201d</p> <p>Lillian stilled. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA part of me will always wonder what would have happened if he hadn\u2019t been so obsessed with competing with you Hartes. Who knows? Maybe he and I could have had something lasting together.\u201d</p><p>Enough with the sisterhood thing, Lillian thought. She had done her politically correct duty. She straightened away from the counter.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I have a lot of things to do this morning, Marilyn.\u201d</p><p>Marilyn regarded her with an apologetic expression. \u201cYes, of course. Forgive me. I didn\u2019t mean to get into old history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just wanted to talk to someone.\u201d Marilyn blinked rapidly and wiped moisture away from the corner of her eye with a fingertip. \u201cThings have been a little rough lately, what with the divorce and getting my campaign organized and now finding out that my campaign manager had an affair with Trevor.\u201d</p><p>Lillian hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019ve been under a lot of stress. Maybe you need to take some time off. Go somewhere quiet and relax before you start your big push for office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford to take that kind of time. Not at this juncture.\u201d Marilyn squared her shoulders. \u201cI intend to go to Washington, D.C., one of these days, so I\u2019d better get used to dealing with stress, hadn\u2019t I? But I shouldn\u2019t have come here. It wasn\u2019t fair to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. That\u2019s certainly what I intend to do.\u201d Lillian went past her and opened the front door. \u201cGood luck in the campaign, Marilyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Marilyn walked out onto the porch and went down the steps to the Mercedes. She paused just before getting behind the wheel. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll vote for me.\u201d</p><p>Lillian watched her drive away and then slowly closed the door. She walked to the table, picked up her mug and carried it into the second bedroom. She looked at the blank canvas propped on the easel.</p><p>For a long time she sipped tea and contemplated the empty white space, trying to get back into that alternate reality where she stood within the vision. But it was hopeless. Too many real-world thoughts barred the way.</p><p>\u201c. . . You want to know a secret? I used to blame your family and Harte Investments for the breakup of my relationship with Gabe.\u201d</p><p>After a while she gave up trying to get into the zone. She went into the kitchen and took a bottle of wine and some cheese out of the refrigerator. She put both into a paper sack.</p><p>She went upstairs to her bedroom, opened a drawer, selected a nightgown and a change of underwear, and put them into a leather tote. In the bathroom she quickly packed the basics into a small, zippered case and dropped the case into the tote.</p><p>Carrying the tote in one hand, she went back downstairs, collected the sack with the wine and cheese inside and a jacket. She left the cottage through the mudroom door.</p><p>Outside she was met with a brisk, bracing wind and the roar of the surf down in Dead Hand Cove. The day was already darkening into night.</p><p>She walked across the top of the bluffs to the old Buckley place.</p><p>Gabe opened the back door just as she raised her hand to knock. He looked at the bulging tote bag.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you plan to stay awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d spend the night if it\u2019s okay with you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly, emerald eyes warm and sensual.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said.</p><p>She walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to push my good luck but curiosity compels me to ask.\u201d He took the tote and the sack from her. \u201cWhy the change of heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarilyn came to see me today. You know, it\u2019s one thing for my mom and your grandfather to mess with my mind. They\u2019re family. They got a right, I guess. But having your ex-girlfriend try the same trick is going too far. Got to draw the line somewhere.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door and looked at her. \u201cMarilyn paid you a visit today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things, she said she needed to talk to someone about the real reason she\u2019d fired Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that reason is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks Claire had an affair with Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks that or she knows it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say she\u2019s convinced of it.\u201d She unfastened her cloak. \u201cAt any rate she doesn\u2019t trust Claire anymore. So she canned her.\u201d</p><p>Gabe took the cloak. It spilled from his hand in an iridescent waterfall.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d he said. \u201cMarilyn is divorcing Thornley. Their relationship was obviously based on Trevor\u2019s electability, not true love. Why worry about an affair with Claire that may or may not have happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Gabe. Would you want to employ someone as your close, personal assistant who had slept with your wife?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t miss a beat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d destroy any man who slept with my wife.\u201d</p><p>The absolute finality of that statement made her catch her breath. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not a politician,\u201d Gabe continued. \u201cPoliticians are different.\u201d</p> <p>She thought about Marilyn\u2019s disturbed behavior. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that they\u2019re so very different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarilyn mention me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat everyone else seems to be saying.

You do realize that you probably won\u2019t get home until noon tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like I\u2019m getting much work done here in Eclipse Bay, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>She did not return to the cottage until after lunch the following day, just as Gabe had warned. He walked her back across the bluffs and left her at the front door with a long, lingering kiss.</p> <p>\u201cI know you need to paint this afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I come over here for dinner tonight? I\u2019ll bring the wine this time.\u201d</p><p>She went into the house and smiled at him through the screen. \u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>He raised a hand in casual farewell and went down the steps. She watched him walk away across the bluffs, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket, his dark hair ruffled by the wind. A dark squall line hung across the bay, moving swiftly toward shore.</p><p>Memories of last night\u2019s lovemaking ignited hot little sparklers of pleasure deep inside her. But there was something else burning down there, too, a long fuse that promised a painful explosion sometime in the future when this very adult relationship blew up in her face.</p><p>Don\u2019t look too far ahead. Just take it one day at a time. That\u2019s all you can do for now. That\u2019s all you dare to do now.</p><p>Gabe was right. She needed to paint.</p><p>She hung her jacket in the closet and started toward the hall that led to her makeshift studio. Halfway across the living room she noticed the light on the answering machine and changed course. She went to the table where the phone sat, and punched up the message.</p><p>She was startled to hear Arizona Snow\u2019s harsh whisper.</p> <p>\u201c. . . Being tailed by an institute spy. Bastard\u2019s too smart to get close enough for me to get a look at him but I know he\u2019s out there somewhere, watchin\u2019 me. I can feel him. Must\u2019ve seen me doin\u2019</p><p>recon and knows I\u2019m on to the plans for the new wing.</p><p>\u201cI called you on accounta I don\u2019t know Gabe\u2019s number. I\u2019m at a pay phone at the pier. Can\u2019t risk leaving all the details on that machine of yours. When I leave here, I\u2019ll head for my place and hole up there.</p><p>\u201cI got to talk to you and Gabe. Heard you two are shackin\u2019 up together so if this message gets to you, I figure it\u2019ll get to him, too. My place is the only safe house in the sector. Appreciate it if you two would come on out as soon as you can. Things are getting hot around here.</p><p>\u201cGotta go. Bye.\u201d</p><p>There was a muffled crash on the other end of the line. Arizona had hung up in a hurry.</p><p>Lillian glared at the answering machine. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said to the universe at large, \u201cI came out here to find a nice, serene place to do some painting.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the phone and dialed Gabe\u2019s cell phone. He answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cMadison here.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the muffled sound of the wind and the surf. He was probably halfway back to the old Buckley place.</p><p>\u201cDoing anything important?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends how you define important. I\u2019m thinking about a proposal from a small startup company that needs five million in cash. That strike you as a weighty matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive mil? Sounds like penny-ante stuff to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciate your consulting opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bill is in the mail.\u201d She watched the dark shadow of the squall line moving across the bay. \u201cWould you like to do something more exciting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp defend Eclipse Bay against the spies up at the institute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this involve frozen extraterrestrials?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got anything else to do now that you\u2019ve taken all the fun out of my puny little five-mil deal. I\u2019m almost back to the house. I\u2019ll get my car and come pick you up.\u201d</p><p>The squall struck just as he geared down to take the steep, rutted path that led through the woods to Arizona\u2019s cabin. He did not want to think about what the rough road was doing to the Jag\u2019s expensive alignment.</p><p>\u201cShe said she was being followed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she give you a description?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lillian watched the narrow road. \u201cJust said she thought it was an institute spy. But she sounded nervous, Gabe. That\u2019s what worried me. In all the years I\u2019ve known A.Z. she\u2019s always seemed very cool and somehow in full command of her crazy conspiracy theories. I\u2019ve never heard her sound genuinely scared or even uneasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s slipped another cog. Sunk a little deeper into her fantasy world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone from being seriously eccentric to seriously crazy, you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility.\u201d</p><p>Lillian folded her arms tightly beneath her br**sts. Her body was tense. She was concerned and she appeared to be getting more so as they got closer to Arizona\u2019s cabin.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, we both know there\u2019s nothing really wrong here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s A.Z\u2019s state of mind I\u2019m worried about. I wonder if getting involved with that crowd at the bakery is responsible for pushing her over some psychological edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she has cracked up big-time,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re right. We\u2019ve got a big problem on our hands. I doubt if we\u2019ll be able to talk her into checking into some nice quiet psych ward for observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d never trust a psychiatrist or a sanitarium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d He negotiated another sharp bend in the road. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do for someone who won\u2019t go for help unless she is a clear danger to herself or others.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s try to keep some perspective here. We\u2019re talking as if A.Z. has gone off the deep end. We have no evidence of that yet. Keep in mind that she hasn\u2019t ever hurt anyone in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we know of.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a swift, searching glance. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that no one around here knows anything about her past before she showed up in Eclipse Bay. I remember asking Mitchell about her once when I was in high school. He just shrugged and said that she was entitled to her privacy so long as she didn\u2019t do anyone else any harm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cTo the best of our knowledge or anyone else\u2019s she\u2019s never done any damage to people or property.\u201d</p><p>He navigated the last tight curve in the road and saw the cabin. Rain and wind slashed the heavy limbs of the trees that loomed over the weather-beaten structure. Arizona\u2019s ancient truck was parked in the small clearing.</p><p>He eased the Jag to a halt behind the truck and switched off the engine.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least she\u2019s here and not out prowling around the new wing of the institute with her VPX 5000,\u201d</p><p>he said.</p> <p>He unfastened his seat belt and reached into the back seat for Lillian\u2019s rain cloak and his jacket.</p><p>\u201cShe said something about holing up for a while.\u201d Lillian put her arms into the sleeves of her cloak and pulled the hood up over her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not like her, either, when you stop and think about it. She\u2019s always out doing recon and surveillance. Says she likes the bad guys to know she\u2019s keeping an eye on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged into the jacket, tugged the hood up over his head and opened the door. Rain driven by rough winds dampened his hair when he got out.</p><p>Lillian did not wait for him to come around to her side of the car. She already had her own door open. A few seconds later she joined him at the front of the Jag.</p><p>They both went quickly toward the shelter of the porch. Gabe took the steps two at a time and came to a halt at the front door. Dripping rain from her sparkling cloak, Lillian stopped beside him.</p> <p>There was no doorbell. Gabe banged the brass eagle knocker a few times.</p><p>There was no response. No surprise, he thought. No right-thinking paranoid would open a door without verifying the identity of the person on the other side.</p><p>\u201cA.Z.? Gabe and Lillian out here,\u201d he called.</p><p>The door did not open. He glanced at the nearest window. It was covered with what looked like blinds fashioned from metal slats.</p><p>\u201cI got your message.\u201d Lillian rapped her knuckles on the blank window. \u201cAre you okay in there?\u201d</p><p>The wind-driven rain whipped around the cabin. He knew Lillian was getting more agitated. He had to admit that the utter silence from inside the cabin was starting to bother him, too.</p><p>He tried the heavy, steel-braced screen door. It was locked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a young woman,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cI hope something hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA heart attack or stroke. Or maybe she fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine. Probably locked in her war room and can\u2019t hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try the back door.\u201d Lillian turned and disappeared around the corner of the porch.</p><p>\u201cHang on, not so fast, damn it.\u201d He went after her, moving quickly. \u201cThe woman\u2019s a full-blown conspiracy theorist, remember? Paranoid as hell. No telling how she\u2019s got this place booby-trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to see if I can find a window that isn\u2019t covered with those steel blinds. I don\u2019t understand why she isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off on a strangled gasp. He saw the crumpled body lying on the porch at the same time.</p><p>\u201cA.Z.\u201d Lillian rushed forward. \u201cOh, my God, Gabe, I was afraid of this. She\u2019s had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>She went to her knees beside Arizona, feeling for a pulse at the throat.</p><p>He looked at the blood on the wooden boards beneath Arizona\u2019s head and went cold.</p><p>\u201cNot a heart attack.\u201d The cell phone was in his hand. He didn\u2019t remember taking it out of his pocket. He punched in the emergency number.</p><p>Lillian followed his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It wasn\u2019t her heart. She fell and hit her head.\u201d Her fingers moved gently on Arizona\u2019s throat. \u201cShe\u2019s breathing but she\u2019s unconscious. The bleeding doesn\u2019t seem to be too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter not move her.\u201d</p><p>Lillian nodded. She stripped off her cloak and arranged it snugly around Arizona\u2019s chunky frame while he gave a terse account of the situation to the 911 operator.</p><p>He saw the overturned plant stand lying nearby just as he ended the call. The stand was made of wrought iron.</p><p>Lillian bent intently over A.Z. \u201cArizona? It\u2019s me, Lillian. Help is on the way. You\u2019re going to be okay.</p><p>Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Arizona groaned. Her lashes fluttered. She squinted up at Lillian.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you slipped and fell. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you do,\u201d Lillian said gently. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to be okay.</p><p>Arizona closed her eyes again. She mumbled something.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Lillian asked.</p><p>\u201cSaid I didn\u2019t fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember much,\u201d Lillian said soothingly. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty normal when you\u2019ve had a blow to the head. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Arizona\u2019s hand moved a little in a small, agitated gesture, but she did not speak again.</p><p>Lillian looked up and saw Gabe watching her. She frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she fell, either,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the world do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no cop, but it looks to me like someone used that plant stand to hit her on the back of the head.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>They were standing in the busy hallway outside Arizona\u2019s hospital room. Monitors beeped and pinged.</p><p>Lights winked on computer screens. High-tech equipment gleamed. Eclipse Bay Community Hospital had moved with the times, Gabe thought.</p><p>He noticed that everyone around him who wore a name tag and a stethoscope appeared purposeful and competent and a little high on adrenaline. Those who were not decked out with a name tag and a stethoscope looked worried. Civilians, Gabe thought. He and Lillian fit into that category. Definitely worried.</p><p>Sean Valentine, Eclipse Bay\u2019s chief of police, on the other hand, fell into some middle zone. He had the same purposeful, competent air that marked the members of the hospital staff, but he didn\u2019t look as if he were enjoying an adrenaline rush. There were deep lines around his eyes and mouth. The marks weren\u2019t caused by Arizona\u2019s problems. Sean always looked as if he anticipated the worst. Gabe figured the permanently etched expression was a legacy of his days as a big-city cop in Seattle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably came home and interrupted some SOB who was trying to break into her cabin,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard must have grabbed the first available heavy object and used it on the back of her skull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever he was, he can\u2019t be from around here,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cEveryone in town knows that it would take an armored tank and a battering ram to break into A.Z.\u2019s cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have looked like a challenge to some dumb-ass kids from Chamberlain who\u2019d had a few beers,\u201d</p> <p>Sean speculated. \u201cOr maybe a transient found the place and didn\u2019t realize it was actually a small fortress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have killed her.\u201d Lillian\u2019s anger vibrated in every word and in every line of her body. She was very tightly wound at the moment.</p><p>\u201cThe blow was a little off,\u201d Sean said. \u201cFortunately for A.Z. She\u2019s concussed but they say she should be okay. They\u2019re going to keep her here at the hospital for a couple of days for observation.\u201d</p><p>Lillian looked at him. \u201cAre you sure we shouldn\u2019t take that message she left on my machine seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take everything seriously,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWay I\u2019m made, I guess. But I gotta tell you that a call from A.Z. claiming that she was being tailed by an institute spy does not give me a whole heck of a lot to work with. In her world, institute spies are everywhere and they\u2019re all trying to follow her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d Lillian agreed reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cAnother thing,\u201d Sean added. \u201cThere\u2019s a small flaw in A.Z.\u2019s logic here. Assuming the institute actually employed spies, none of them would need to tail her in order to find out where she lives. Everyone in town knows where her cabin is located. All anyone looking for her would have to do is ask a few questions down at Fulton\u2019s Supermarket or the video rental shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody ever said A.Z.\u2019s logic holds up well under scrutiny,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Sean\u2019s face twisted briefly in a wry smile. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Lillian gave them both a quelling glance. \u201cA.Z. operates in a parallel universe but within that universe, her reasoning is consistent and logical.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked wary. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeaning that something scared her enough to make her use a telephone and leave a message on an answering machine. She would never willingly do that if she could avoid it. She\u2019s convinced that all phones are tapped. She doesn\u2019t even have one in her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTapped by institute spies?\u201d Sean asked politely.</p><p>Lillian exhaled unhappily. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go with my theory of an interrupted burglary in progress for now, if you don\u2019t mind. But if you get any more useful information from her when you talk to her, let me know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to Gabe, then turned and walked off down the hospital corridor. Lillian watched him until he turned a corner and disappeared. Then she looked at Gabe.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably right, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Gabe hesitated. \u201cYou have to admit, it\u2019s a simpler explanation than one involving vast government conspiracies. When it comes to this kind of stuff, cops prefer simple because most of the time that\u2019s the right answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And we are dealing with A.Z. here. Whatever the answer is, it can\u2019t possibly be as mysterious as she thinks it is. Come on, let\u2019s go see how she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He walked beside her to the doorway of the hospital room. Arizona was stretched out on a bed. She looked so different in a hospital gown, he thought. In all the years he had known her he had never seen her in anything except military camouflage and boots. She had always seemed curiously ageless, sturdy and vigorous. But now, bandaged and helpless, her gray hair partially covered with a white bandage, she looked her age. A wave of anger swept through him. What kind of bastard would hit an elderly woman on the head with a wrought-iron planter?</p><p>A nurse wearing a tag inscribed with the name Jason leaned over A.Z., taking her pulse. When he was finished he lowered her wrist very gently to the sheet and moved toward the door. Behind him, Arizona stirred restlessly but she did not open her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you family?\u201d Jason asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lillian looked toward the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has any family. We\u2019re friends. How is she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a nasty headache and she\u2019s confused and disoriented. Pretty much what you\u2019d expect after a severe blow to the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA.Z. always seems confused and disoriented to people who don\u2019t know her well,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cHas she said anything?\u201d</p><p>Jason shook his head. \u201cJust keeps talking about something called a VPX 5000.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer new camera,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cShe was very excited about it.\u201d</p><p>On the bed, Arizona moved slightly. She turned her head on the pillow. Her face was drawn with pain.</p><p>Her cheeks were slightly sunken. \u201cLillian? Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here, A.Z.\u201d Lillian went to the bed and patted Arizona\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything.</p><p>You\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy VPX 5000.\u201d Arizona\u2019s voice had lost its usual hearty timbre. She sounded a thousand years old. \u201cI can\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Lillian assured her. \u201cYou\u2019ll find it when they let you go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Arizona gripped Lillian\u2019s hand with gnarled fingers. \u201cThey said someone hit me. Probably the institute spy. I\u2019ll bet he took my VPX 5000. Gotta get it back. Can\u2019t risk having it fall into the wrong hands. Pictures. Of the new wing. They\u2019ll destroy \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Gabe went to stand at the bed. He leaned on the rails. \u201cTell you what, A.Z., Lillian and I will go back to your cabin and see if we can find the camera. Maybe you left it in your truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta find it.\u201d Arizona\u2019s eyes fluttered closed. \u201cCan\u2019t let the bastards get it.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, after a fruitless search of the interior of Arizona\u2019s aging pickup, he closed the door on the driver\u2019s side and pocketed the keys. He watched Lillian come down the cabin\u2019s porch steps and start toward him.</p><p>\u201cAny luck?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went over every square inch of the porch and checked the flower beds around it. It\u2019s gone, unfortunately. I hate to have to give her the bad news. She was so thrilled with that camera.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe may be right. Whoever hit her probably stole it. Maybe he figured he could get a few bucks for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s got any sense, he won\u2019t try to unload it anywhere near Eclipse Bay,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cSean Valentine will be watching for it and so will everyone else in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do some research online,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cMaybe I can find another one to replace it for her.\u201d</p><p>Lillian flashed him a grateful smile. \u201cThat would be wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>He liked it when she smiled at him like that, he thought. He liked it a lot. That smile had a very motivating effect on him. He took a long, slow breath and then he took her arm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late,\u201d he said. \u201cBe dark soon. Let\u2019s go back to your place and get some dinner.\u201d</p><p>Another squall struck just as Gabe halted the car in front of the cottage. Lillian pulled up the hood of her cloak, opened the door, leaped out and made a dash for the front porch. Gabe was right behind her. She stopped in front of the door, shook rainwater off her cloak and rummaged in her purse for her keys.</p><p>When she got the door open, she headed straight for the mudroom, intending to hang up her cloak so that it could drip dry.</p><p>Gabe followed, stripping off his jacket. When they reached the mudroom she did not bother to switch on the overhead light. There was enough illumination from the hall to see the row of metal clothes hooks beneath the window.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open the wine. You can do the salad tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d A damp draft sent a chill through her. \u201cIt\u2019s cold in here. Why don\u2019t you start a fire before you\u2014\u201d She broke off abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder it\u2019s cold in here. The back door is open. I can\u2019t believe I forgot to lock up. But I\u2019ve been distracted a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>She crossed the small space to push the door closed.</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d Gabe said quietly, pointing to the door.</p><p>He reached out to switch on the mudroom light and then moved past her. She watched him lean forward slightly to examine the door frame.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She moved closer. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Something\u2019s wrong, all right. Looks like A.Z. wasn\u2019t the only one who got hit by a burglar today.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him, just stared, disbelieving, at the deep gouges in the wooden door frame and the broken lock.</p><p>\u201cYou sure there\u2019s nothing missing?\u201d Sean Valentine asked for the second time.</p><p>\u201cNo, not as far as I can tell,\u201d Lillian said.</p> <p>Gabe leaned against the kitchen counter and watched her answer Sean\u2019s questions. She sat hunched on the kitchen stool, knees drawn up, feet propped on the top rung.</p><p>\u201cI went through the whole house,\u201d she added. \u201cNothing looks as if it\u2019s been touched. Of course, we don\u2019t keep anything really valuable here because the cottage is empty for weeks, sometimes months, at a time. Still, there\u2019s the old television and the new answering machine. And all the stuff I brought with me from Portland. My painting supplies. Some clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that would bring a burglar a lot of fast cash, though.\u201d Sean looked down at what he had written. \u201cYou know, these guys aren\u2019t known for neatness. They usually leave the place in a mess.</p><p>Maybe he got scared off before he could get inside. A car coming down the drive would have done it.</p><p>Or someone taking a walk along the bluff with a dog.\u201d</p><p>Gabe considered that. \u201cThink that after he got nervous here, he went looking for another, more isolated house to break into? A.Z.\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd got surprised again. Hit Arizona and took off with her fancy camera.\u201d Sean nodded. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d He flipped the notebook closed. \u201cI\u2019ve been interviewing people all day. So far no one has noticed any strangers acting suspiciously. But that still leaves a bunch of college kids and unknown transients. The camera is my best hope. If someone turns up with it, I\u2019ll have a lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtherwise, zip, right?\u201d Lillian asked morosely. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that these kinds of burglaries often go unsolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true in big cities but not so true in a small town where you\u2019ve got a more limited group of suspects.\u201d Sean stuffed the notebook into the pocket of his jacket and started toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I come up with anything useful. Meanwhile, get that back door fixed.\u201d</p><p>Lillian nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll ask the Willis brothers to come over here tomorrow and take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Sean paused at the door. \u201cFolks are usually a little nervous after a break-in.\u201d He angled a brief, meaningful glance at Gabe. \u201cNice for you that you won\u2019t be here alone tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lillian gave him a basilisk stare from her perch on the stool. She did not say a word.</p><p>Sean did not move. But, then, that was only to be expected, Gabe thought. A basilisk could turn a man to stone with the power of her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI mean, you\u2019ll be a lot more comfortable with Madison here,\u201d Sean muttered. \u201cNot nervous or anything.\u201d</p><p>Lillian continued to glare.</p><p>\u201cRight, she won\u2019t be alone.\u201d Gabe pushed himself away from the counter. \u201cI\u2019ll walk outside with you.\u201d</p><p>He did not know why he felt obliged to rescue Sean. A guy thing, maybe. Or maybe he just didn\u2019t like the way Lillian had reacted to Sean\u2019s assumption that she was sleeping with him. She looked ticked. For some reason that irritated him.</p><p>Sean cleared his throat. \u201cSure. Got to get going. Things to do.\u201d</p><p>Gabe crossed the kitchen in a few long strides. He had the front door open for Sean by the time the police chief reached it.</p><p>He moved out onto the porch after Sean and closed the door behind them. They stood in the yellow light and looked at the cars parked in the drive.</p><p>\u201cGuess I stepped in it back there,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Gabe braced a hand on the porch railing. \u201cNot like it\u2019s a big secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecrets like that are a little hard to keep here in Eclipse Bay. Especially when a Harte and a Madison are involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Sean looked thoughtful. \u201cFolks in town are sort of assuming that you\u2019re planning to marry her in order to get your hands on a piece of Harte Investments.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDangerous things, assumptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.

He knew at once that Lillian was not asleep.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of this.\u201d He levered himself up on one elbow and reached for her. \u201cAre you upset because Sean Valentine guessed that we\u2019re sleeping together? Honey, this is a small town and we haven\u2019t exactly tried to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d She locked her hands behind her head and stared up into the shadows. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not real thrilled with the fact that Sean and everyone else in town thinks you\u2019re trying to sucker me into marriage so that you can get your hands on a third of Harte Investments\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cValentine didn\u2019t say that. He just sort of observed that you and I are having an affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what he was thinking. But, to tell you the truth, I\u2019m getting used to people thinking that.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if that was a good thing. Did he want her thinking that their affair was fine just as it stood?</p><p>\u201cSo, the gossip isn\u2019t what\u2019s keeping you awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, why can\u2019t you sleep? The break-in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He flattened his hand on her soft, warm belly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. I wired the mudroom door shut, remember? Besides, if the guy didn\u2019t find anything worth stealing the first time, he\u2019s not likely to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He did not like the disquiet that threaded her words. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like this happened to me in Portland.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. \u201cA break-in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discovered it when we went into town for the Montoya dinner. I got the feeling that someone had been inside my apartment.\u201d</p><p>He sat up very fast. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you tell me? Did you call the cops?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. There was no evidence. My door hadn\u2019t been forced open the way it was here. Nothing was missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I figured it was the cleaning people. I called them and I was right. A schedule mix-up. But there was a smear on the bedroom closet mirror and well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that after what happened tonight, I can\u2019t help wondering, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember what I said about the simple answer usually being the right one. Sounds like whoever cleaned your apartment left a smear. It happens. As long as there was no sign of forced entry or theft, I think we can assume that the break-in here had nothing to do with the cleaning day mix-up in Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. Guess I\u2019m just a little nervous after what happened, that\u2019s all. You know, what with one thing and another, I\u2019m not getting a lot of painting done lately.\u201d</p><p>He lay back against the pillows and gathered her against him. She snuggled close. He stroked her slowly, his hand gliding down her spine to the curve of her hip, letting himself enjoy the warmth and the sensual curves of her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat you need is some artistic inspiration,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou may be right.\u201d She put an arm around him. \u201cUnfortunately, it isn\u2019t always easy to find.\u201d</p><p>He moved his hand on her again, savoring the shiver that went through her. Then he eased her onto her back and came down on top of her. \u201cLuckily for you, I am prepared to give my all to art.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Shortly before noon the next day, Lillian stood in the opening that separated the mudroom from the back hall and watched Gabe and the Willis brothers. The three men huddled around the broken lock with a solemn air. Their expressions were grave, their voices hushed and serious. A guy thing, she thought. You saw it whenever the male of the species was in the presence of a nonfunctioning piece of hardware or machinery.</p><p>\u201cLooks like the work of an amateur.\u201d Torrance Willis bent low to make a closer examination of the gouges in the door frame. \u201cA real pro would have slipped right through this old lock without leaving a scratch. What d\u2019ya say, Walt?\u201d</p><p>Walter stooped to get a better look. \u201cYep. An amateur, all right.\u201d</p><p>Lillian hid a grin. The Willis brothers were identical twins but in style and appearance they were opposites. With his completely shaved head, precisely pressed work clothes, and neat, mechanical movements, Walter always made her think of an efficient little robot. In contrast, Torrance was a genial slob. His long, straggly hair was cinched in a ponytail at the nape of his neck. His clothes were stained with what looked like several years\u2019 worth of oil, paint, grease, and some orange-red stuff that might have been pizza sauce.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, Sean Valentine agrees with you.\u201d Gabe studied the gouges. \u201cNot that it tells us much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf whoever broke in here is the same rat who hit Arizona on the head, I reckon he\u2019s long gone,\u201d Walter said. \u201cBe a damn fool to hang around Eclipse Bay now that the heat is on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cBut the important thing is to get something solid on this door. I don\u2019t want Lillian spending another night here with a busted lock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Torrance absently scratched the snake tattoo that slithered out from beneath the sleeve of his grimy work shirt. \u201cAfter you called us this morning, we stopped off at the hardware store. Picked up just what we need. We\u2019ll have this fixed in no time.\u201d</p><p>Walter selected some tools from a polished metal box. \u201cWon\u2019t take long. We can fill in those gouge marks and paint \u2019em out for you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cI really appreciate this. I know how busy you are with Dreamscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe and Hannah would be the first to tell us to take care of this for you,\u201d Walter said. \u201cBut I got to admit, they\u2019re keeping us real busy over there at the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right,\u201d Torrance agreed. There was a groan of metal and wood as he leaned into the task of removing the broken lock. \u201cWalt and me didn\u2019t even bother to bid on any of the work on the new wing of the institute. Knew we wouldn\u2019t have time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot that we was invited to bid, mind you.\u201d Walter removed the new lock from its packaging. \u201cPerry Decatur is runnin\u2019 things up there now. Doesn\u2019t like dealin\u2019 with local business if he can avoid it. Made it real clear he wanted to bring in out-of-town contractors. Said they were more competitive .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike money\u2019s the most important aspect of a good job,\u201d Torrance scoffed. \u201cNo respect for fine craftsmanship these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you two didn\u2019t even get a slice of the project?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Walter positioned the new lock. \u201cNot to say we don\u2019t get some work on the side from time to time. Lot of the folks employed up there are local. They know us. They call us when they got a plumbing problem or need a hot-water tank replaced. Those fancy out-of-town contractors aren\u2019t interested in the small jobs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClaire Jensen mentioned that she had you take care of a clogged toilet for her,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>\u201cYep, she did, as a matter of fact.\u201d Walter exchanged a meaningful look with Torrance. Both men smirked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the joke?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing much.\u201d Torrance readied a drill. \u201cJust that while Walt and me was in Claire\u2019s bathroom we couldn\u2019t help noticing that she had some birth control pills and a box of condoms under the bathroom sink.\u201d</p><p>Lillian frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little tacky to snoop in people\u2019s bathroom cupboards when they hire you to fix their plumbing?\u201d</p> <p>Walter had the grace to blush. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We shouldn\u2019t have said nothin\u2019 about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Torrance said. \u201cNot like it\u2019s news. That woman always did have what you\u2019d call an active social life, even back in the old days. Remember how she used to sneak around with Larry Fulton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure do,\u201d Walter said. \u201cThe two of \u2019em used to crawl into the back of his dad\u2019s delivery van and go at it like a couple of bunnies.\u201d</p><p>Lillian straightened in the doorway. \u201cShe ran around with Larry Fulton? But he\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was back before he married Sheila Groves and took over his dad\u2019s grocery store,\u201d Walter assured her. \u201cWay back when he was still in college. That sound right to you, Torrance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, sounds about right. Way I hear it, Claire hasn\u2019t changed much over the years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s enough gossip about Claire,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>He spoke quietly, but Walter and Torrance immediately changed the subject. Lillian smiled to herself.</p><p>Everyone knew that whatever else you could say about the Madison men, they didn\u2019t kiss and tell.</p><p>Apparently, they didn\u2019t listen to other masculine gossip about women either. That kind of old-fashioned chivalry was an extremely endearing trait in a man.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>The following morning Arizona held her security briefing from her dimly lit hospital room. She certainly looked the part of the heroically wounded warrior, Lillian thought. The bandages around A.Z.\u2019s head gave her a dashing air. It was clear from the glittering determination in her eyes that she was recovering rapidly.</p><p>Lillian was quite relieved to see Arizona looking so much better this morning. She and Gabe had received the phone call summoning them to A.Z.\u2019s bedside half an hour ago, just as they were finishing breakfast.</p><p>The only other attendee present today was Photon from the Incandescent Body bakery. He stood in the corner, serene and silent in his strange robes and jewelry. His shaved head gleamed green in the light of a nearby monitor. Could have passed for a space alien, Lillian thought.</p> <p>\u201cWay I figure it,\u201d Arizona said, \u201cthe institute spy followed me home because he spotted me taking my routine sector surveillance photos. I cover the whole town right out to the boundaries three mornings a week, you know. Check up on the institute daily, of course. I must have caught something on film that they didn\u2019t want anyone to see. When he saw his chance he knocked me out and stole my VPX 5000.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, A.Z.,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cYou can replace the camera and get back to your daily recon work in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the camera,\u201d Arizona said. \u201cNow that we know for sure that we\u2019re on to something, we\u2019ve got to get inside.\u201d</p><p>That sounded ominous, Lillian thought.</p><p>\u201cInside?\u201d she repeated cautiously. \u201cInside what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new wing, of course. Listen up here.\u201d Arizona\u2019s voice lowered. \u201cGot no choice now. We need to get a firsthand look at whatever is going on in there. My guess is they\u2019ve made the big move.\u201d</p><p>Dread settled on Lillian. \u201cOh, I really don\u2019t think they\u2019ve had time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably brought \u2019em in with the HVAC equipment,\u201d Arizona said.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case,\u201d Photon murmured, \u201cwhoever goes inside will have to search for a large freezer compartment somewhere in the new wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Arizona adjusted her position on the pillows, checked the door and then lowered her voice again, this time to a raspy whisper. She motioned with one hand. \u201cMove in as close as you can. The institute probably has spies out there in the hall. Be easy enough to disguise them as orderlies or janitors.\u201d</p><p>Lillian suppressed a sigh and obediently leaned over the bed. Gabe and Photon followed suit.</p><p>\u201cWe all know that they\u2019ll never let me or one of the Heralds step foot inside the institute.\u201d Arizona gave Lillian and Gabe a meaningful look. \u201cThat leaves you two.\u201d</p><p>Lillian gripped the bed rails. \u201cWait a second here, A.Z. We\u2019re not, uh, trained in this kind of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give you a few pointers before you go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to get us inside?\u201d Gabe asked, looking interested.</p><p>Lillian frantically tried to get his attention but he pretended not to see her.</p><p>\u201cI figure the Leaders of Tomorrow open-house event will give you both the perfect opportunity,\u201d</p><p>Arizona said. \u201cEasy for you to get invites because one of you is a Harte and the other is a Madison.</p><p>Perry Decatur and the folks who run the institute will fall all over themselves to get you there. You\u2019re both potential donors.\u201d</p><p>Phonton nodded somberly. \u201cAn excellent plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust might work, A.Z.,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cBut the new wing won\u2019t be open yet.\u201d Lillian struggled to bring some common sense to the situation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to get in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t be too hard,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cEveryone will be busy with the reception. Don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t slip out at some point and take a look at the area under construction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled then.\u201d Arizona gave them a thumbs-up. \u201cYou two will go in the night of the open house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a camera?\u201d Lillian said quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t have one and I doubt if Gabe has one either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould always get one of those little throwaway cameras they sell at the pier,\u201d Gabe said helpfully.</p><p>\u201cOne of those gadgets won\u2019t do it,\u201d Arizona said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you my old VPX 4000. Fine piece of equipment. Lacks a few of the features of the 5000 but it\u2019ll get the job done. Remember, we need hard proof that they\u2019ve stashed those frozen extraterrestrials in that new wing.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Gabe gave up trying to work, closed the laptop, grabbed a jacket and went down to the beach. He walked for a long time, trying to make sense of the screwy dream that had awakened him in the middle of the night. It had featured broken locks and the grinning faces of the Willis brothers. Not quite a nightmare but close enough.</p><p>He stopped at the edge of the water and watched a gull angle into the offshore breeze. Normally he didn\u2019t pay much attention to dreams. He didn\u2019t believe in intuition, premonitions, or the like.</p> <p>But he had a healthy respect for his own hunches. They had served him well in business.</p><p>Something J. Anderson Flint had said the other night at the restaurant was running through his brain again and again this morning.</p><p>\u201cDisgruntled employees can be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>When he added it to the dream he got a very uneasy feeling.</p><p>What if Lillian\u2019s first intuitive suspicion had been correct? What if the break-in at her cottage had nothing to do with what had happened to Arizona but was, instead, linked to her fear that someone had intruded into her Portland apartment?</p><p>The knock on her front door interrupted her just as she was about to mix some paint. She put down the palette knife with a sense of deep resignation. What had ever made her think she would get some work done today?</p> <p>She opened the door warily.</p><p>Gabe stood there, one hand braced on the door frame. There was no sign of his car. He was dressed in a black-and-tan windbreaker, jeans, and running shoes. His dark hair was tousled from the wind and a little damp from the mist-heavy air.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d He walked into the hall and shrugged out of his jacket.</p><p>His cold, grim expression silenced whatever comment she had been about to make on the subject of interruptions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about something Flint said about Claire.\u201d</p><p>She took the jacket from him. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned that disgruntled employees could be dangerous. It occurred to me that maybe disgruntled boyfriends of former clients might fall into the same category.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him, the jacket clutched in her hand. \u201cAre you talking about Campbell Witley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He disappeared into the kitchen. \u201cGot any coffee?\u201d</p><p>She draped the jacket over the hanger, jammed it into the closet and hurried to the doorway of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d She watched him fill the coffeemaker with fresh water. \u201cThat Witley might be responsible for the break-in here?\u201d</p><p>He removed the lid of the coffee canister. \u201cIt would explain the incident at your apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming there was an incident.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAssuming that.\u201d</p><p>A shiver went through her. \u201cBut that would make Witley a stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He finished spooning ground coffee into the filter and switched on the machine. \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you. Sean Valentine probably got it right when he concluded that whoever conked A.Z. on the head was a transient who had tried to break in here, first. But there is a remote possibility that the two incidents are related. Which, in turn, means that the break-in here could be connected to what happened in Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would explain why nothing was taken. A stalker probably wouldn\u2019t be interested in stealing stuff.\u201d</p><p>He crossed the kitchen and cradled her face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cLook, this should be easy enough to check out,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we have to do is find out where Witley was when someone here in Eclipse Bay was breaking into your mudroom. Shouldn\u2019t be too hard to see if he\u2019s got an alibi. If he can account for his whereabouts during that time period, we can go back to Valentine\u2019s theory of a transient burglar.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI never considered the possibility of a stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I until I got to thinking about Flint\u2019s comments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call Nella Townsend, the investigator I used to check out my clients. She might be able to verify Witley\u2019s alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Call her. I\u2019ll speak to Valentine, too. Let him know what\u2019s going on. But from what I\u2019ve read, stalkers can be very slick. Very devious. It\u2019s hard to prove that they\u2019re doing anything illegal.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see this guy myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to meet Witley face-to-face. Ask him some questions,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Alarm washed through her. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, honey. I\u2019ve done a lot of deals with a lot of people who have things to hide. I\u2019m good at knowing when I\u2019m being lied to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nuts?\u201d she yelped. \u201cYou can\u2019t confront Witley on your own. What if he really is a stalker? He could be very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked first surprised and then pleased. \u201cWorried about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m worried. No offense, Gabe, but this is not one of your more brilliant ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to drive into Portland and meet the guy. Don\u2019t worry, if he is a stalker, I doubt that he\u2019s a danger to me. Stalkers are obsessed with their victims, not other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I don\u2019t want you handling this on your own. If you insist on going to Portland to see him, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d There was no give in the single word. \u201cI don\u2019t want you anywhere near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitley is a big man. He\u2019s had military training. He works in construction.

I mean it. You can\u2019t do this by yourself and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI guess I could take along some backup.\u201d</p><p>That stopped her for a heartbeat or two.</p> <p>\u201cBackup?\u201d she repeated cautiously.</p><p>\u201cA guy I know. He\u2019s big. Had some military training. Worked construction for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me again why we\u2019re going to drive all the way into Portland to see this guy, Witley,\u201d Mitchell said, buckling his seat belt.</p> <p>\u201cLong story.\u201d Gabe put on his dark glasses and turned the key in the ignition. \u201cIt\u2019s just barely possible that Witley is stalking Lillian. She\u2019s going to have an investigator check out his movements in the past few days, but I want to talk to him myself. Lillian made it clear that she didn\u2019t want me meeting him alone. I refused to take her along. You\u2019re the compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn,\u201d Mitchell said cheerfully. \u201cThis sounds like fun. Any chance of a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. But there\u2019s always hope.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>She stared at the blank canvas, knowing that she was even less likely to get into the zone now than she had been earlier in the day when Gabe had interrupted her.</p><p>All she could think about was that he and Mitchell were on their way to Portland together to confront Witley.</p> <p>The phone rang in the living room. She turned away from the canvas and went to answer it.</p><p>\u201cLillian? This is Nella. I got your message. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for calling me back.\u201d She sank down onto the arm of the sofa. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little problem here.</p><p>Remember that guy Witley I asked you to check out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Nella paused. \u201cSomething happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. Can you find out if he left town sometime during the past few days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t be too difficult. What\u2019s going on, Lil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d She gave Nella a quick rundown of events.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on it,\u201d Nella said. \u201cMeanwhile, watch yourself, okay? These guys tend to escalate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe incidents get more serious. It\u2019s a progressive thing. Do me a huge favor. Lock all your doors and windows and keep them locked until your friend Madison gets there or until I give you the all-clear. I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I have something solid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Lillian ended the call, put down the phone and went back into the studio.</p><p>The blank canvas might as well have been sitting in another universe, a place where she could not go today.</p><p>A red compact pulled into the drive just as she was about to pour herself another cup of tea. Her fourth that afternoon. She went to the window and saw Claire Jensen, dressed in a navy blue shirt and a pair of jeans, get out from behind the wheel and walk up the front steps.</p><p>Just what she needed. Another interruption. She put down the cup and went to open the front door.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Claire looked and sounded as if she had not slept much in recent days. \u201cI need to talk to someone.</p><p>Mind if I come in for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>More sisterhood stuff. How much of this kind of thing was a woman supposed to do to retain her politically correct status?</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Lillian held the door open. \u201cI made tea. Want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Claire walked into the front hall, took off her coat and gave it to Lillian to hang in the closet.</p><p>\u201cCome on into the kitchen,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>\u201cI assume you know that Marilyn fired me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the end of the world.\u201d Claire folded her hands on the table and looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cCampaign managers get canned a lot. Goes with the territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find another position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Something will turn up. That\u2019s not what\u2019s bothering me. It was the scene in the Crab Trap. It\u2019s all over town. I have never been so embarrassed in my life. The worst part is that I have no one to blame but myself.\u201d</p><p>Lillian took another cup down out of the cupboard. \u201cIt\u2019ll all blow over in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t know what made me track her down at the restaurant and confront her like that. I guess I was just so angry that I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. She actually accused me of sleeping with Trevor, can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>Lillian poured tea. \u201cI take it you didn\u2019t have an affair with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I admired Trevor\u2019s political agenda, but that was as far as it went. I\u2019m a pro. I don\u2019t sleep with my clients.\u201d</p><p>Lillian set the cup down in front of her. \u201cProbably a good policy in your line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d Claire blew on her tea. \u201cBesides, according to the rumors, Thornley likes to dress up in women\u2019s lingerie and prance around in high heels. Don\u2019t know about you, but personally I don\u2019t find that type of thing a real turn-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see where the lingerie and heels might be a little off-putting. What happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving town in a couple of days. I plan to go to Seattle and regroup. I\u2019ve got contacts there. But I didn\u2019t come here to whine today. Well, maybe just a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d</p><p>Claire put down her cup. \u201cMarilyn has always been a little overcontrolling and a bit paranoid. I never worried about it too much. You expect that in a strong candidate. But I have to tell you that after those crazy accusations about Trevor and me, I\u2019m starting to wonder if maybe she\u2019s gone off the deep end. If that\u2019s the case, I think you should be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Why should I worry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve noticed that she\u2019s become a little fixated on your relationship with Gabe Madison. Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s divorced now. But I think there\u2019s more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang. On the off chance that it might be Nella reporting back with the all-clear, Lillian lunged for it.</p><p>She heard the muffled noise of a car in motion.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWitley is gone.\u201d Gabe\u2019s voice was very even. Too even. \u201cHe told some friends that he was taking a vacation. He\u2019s not at his house. No one has seen him for a few days. Heard from your investigator yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lillian clutched the phone very tightly. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our way back to Eclipse Bay. It\u2019s almost four o\u2019clock. We should get there around seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold dinner for you both.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow that we know for sure that Witley has disappeared, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to be there alone. We don\u2019t know where he is or what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine until seven tonight, for heaven\u2019s sake. Claire Jensen is here with me now, as a matter of fact, so I\u2019m not alone.\u201d</p><p>There was a murmur of conversation in the background. Lillian realized that Mitchell was speaking to Gabe.</p><p>Gabe spoke into the phone again. \u201cMitchell wants to send Bryce over to baby-sit until we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d Lillian checked her watch. \u201cLook, I\u2019m going stir-crazy here. I need to run into town and pick up some groceries for dinner. I\u2019ll leave the house right after Claire. I\u2019ll do the shopping and then I\u2019ll stop and see A.Z. at the hospital. That will keep me busy and I won\u2019t be alone. Call me at the hospital when you get into town and I\u2019ll meet you back here at the cottage. That way I won\u2019t be alone for any extended period of time.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe hesitated. \u201cAll right. But don\u2019t take any long walks on the beach by yourself, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I figure if you\u2019re scared, you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t wander off by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>Lillian ended the call and put down the phone.</p> <p>Claire gave her a quizzical look. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t really know. There have been a couple of small incidents lately. Someone broke in here the other day while I was at the old Buckley place with Gabe.\u201d</p><p>Claire frowned and slowly lowered her cup. \u201cAnything taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sean Valentine thinks it\u2019s the same guy who tried to burglarize A.Z.\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about that. It\u2019s all over town. They\u2019re saying it was a transient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But the thing that\u2019s worrisome is that there was another possible break-in at my apartment in Portland. Nothing taken there, either. Gabe leaped to the conclusion that the culprit might be a guy named Witley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA former boyfriend of one of my clients.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut why on earth would he break into your apartment and this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe theory is that he blames me for ruining his relationship with his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because you matched her with someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. Are we talking stalker here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a possibility. A remote one, I hope. You know, a friend told me I was courting a lawsuit in the matchmaking business. But I never considered this kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe worry about stalkers when we plan security for candidates. There are always a few nutcases running around. But I must admit, I never thought about it in your line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy former line.\u201d</p><p>Claire blew out a deep breath. \u201cAnd I thought I had problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA matchmaker\u2019s life is never dull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d Claire got to her feet. \u201cWell, at least you\u2019ve got Gabe Madison looking out for you.</p><p>Things could be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better be on my way. I can see you\u2019ve got other things to worry about than my little scene in the Crab Trap. Promise me you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will.\u201d Lillian rose and followed her out into the hall. She got Claire\u2019s coat out of the closet and handed it to her. \u201cYou said you had something you wanted to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yeah.\u201d Claire shrugged into her coat. \u201cBut it seems a little petty compared to this stalker business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Marilyn. I\u2019m no shrink, but like I started to tell you before Gabe phoned, I really do think she may be a bit paranoid. When you add that to the fact that she\u2019s a very determined woman who always gets what she wants, well, I just think you might want to watch your step around her, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve got something she wants,\u201d Claire said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn.\u201d Mitchell watched Gabe disconnect the phone. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ourselves a problem here, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I sure don\u2019t like the fact that Witley has disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell watched him for a moment. He\u2019d seen that same look of focused determination back when Gabe had been a twelve-year-old kid doing his homework at the kitchen table. Nothing had changed, Mitchell thought. Gabe was a different kind of Madison. But not that different.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t talking about Witley,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get that sorted out. Meant this situation between you and Lillian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSituation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay it looks to me, you\u2019re in up to your neck and sinking deeper by the minute.\u201d</p><p>Gabe navigated a turn, accelerating smoothly on the far side. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell absently massaged his arthritic knee. He tried to remember if he had taken his anti-inflammatory medication. Things had been a little busy today.</p><p>\u201cHad what you might call a chat with Lillian,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI heard about that. Stay out of this, Mitch. My relationship with Lillian is none of your business. You don\u2019t have the right to interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your grandfather. Course I\u2019ve got the right.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell watched the road. There was very little traffic now that they had left the city behind. The last of the daylight was evaporating. The white lines on the pavement marked the path into the darkness.</p><p>He braced himself for the old memories. No matter where he was or what he was doing, they always came back to haunt him for a while at this time of day; the point when the oncoming night could no longer be ignored. He knew from long experience that once the transition to full dark was made, the specters would fade. They would not return for another twenty-four hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he was home it was his custom to handle the ghosts with a shot of whiskey. But tonight he had nothing to take the edge off. He would just have to deal with it. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time.</p><p>From out of the depths the phantoms arose, right on schedule. The scene was a twilight-shrouded jungle drenched with the smell of death and gut-wrenching fear. The worst part had been knowing that the night was inevitable and that there was no hope of rescue until dawn.</p><p>He and Sullivan had made it through that hellish night together because they had both understood that their survival depended on staying in control of the panic. They had both understood the need for absolute silence and absolute stillness. Side by side in the unrelenting darkness, they had somehow managed to reinforce that grim knowledge in each other without words or movement of any kind. And without words or movement they had managed to keep each other from slipping over the edge into that place where the fear took over and got you killed.</p><p>At dawn, he and Sullivan had still been alive. A lot of the others had not been so lucky.</p> <p>He wondered if Sullivan went through the same ritual every evening. Waiting. Knowing the night was inevitable.</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly, did you say to Lillian?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>Mitchell watched the light disappear, unable to look away. \u201cJust told her flat-out that it looked to me like you were fallin\u2019 for her in a big way and that I didn\u2019t want her to stomp all over your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose were your exact words?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell thought back to the conversation in the greenhouse. \u201cPretty close.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid Lillian imply that she intended to, uh, stomp all over my heart?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>What the hell was it about this time of day? The shift from day to night always seemed to take forever.</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gabe gazed steadily at the road unwinding in front of the car. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like something Lillian would say. What were her precise words, Mitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she got irritated when I told her that I didn\u2019t want you gettin\u2019 hurt. Said something about how she was the one who stood to get stomped on account of everyone was so sure you were after her because you wanted a chunk of Harte Investments.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded. \u201cI can see where she\u2019d get that impression. Lot of people have been saying that lately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNatural assumption, under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her that was garbage. Said you were a Madison and Madisons never marry for money. Not that practical, when you get right down to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d Gabe waited a beat. \u201cSo, how did she respond to that observation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe reminded me how everyone said that you were a different kind of Madison. I told her you were different, but not that different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. I believe I may have pointed out that Madison Commercial is your passion and that when it comes to a Madison and his passion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing gets in the way. Yeah, right, I\u2019ve heard that. She say anything else?\u201d</p> <p>The transition to night was complete at last. The phantom images receded into the darkness.</p><p>Mitchell exhaled slowly. \u201cSeemed to think I\u2019d maybe given you the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what you\u2019ve done with Madison Commercial.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s hands tightened a little on the wheel. \u201cFor the past year and a half you\u2019ve been telling me that I\u2019ve spent too much time fooling around with the company. Maybe you were right.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell had to swallow twice to keep from sputtering. \u201cShoot and damn, son, you built that company from the ground up. You sweated blood to prove something to the whole damn world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I prove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what you proved. Hell, after you created Madison Commercial no one could say that every Madison who came along was doomed to screw up everything he touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou consider that a major accomplishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I do.\u201d He stared at the road. \u201cMore important than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause after Madison Commercial, folks had to quit sayin\u2019 that I had screwed up both my grandsons\u2019</p><p>lives the same way I had messed up your father\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>A crystalline silence enveloped the front seat of the car.</p><p>\u201cDid people really say that?\u201d Gabe asked after a while. \u201cTo your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome said it to my face. Most folks said it behind my back. They were all pretty much agreed that I wasn\u2019t fit to raise you and Rafe after Sinclair killed himself and your mother on that damn motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said I set a piss-poor example for a couple of young boys.\u201d He rubbed his jaw. \u201cTo tell you the truth, they were right. But what the hell was I gonna do? Not like there was anyone else around to take over the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have walked out. Disappeared. Let the social workers deal with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You don\u2019t turn your grandkids over to the state to raise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadisons don\u2019t do stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>Gabe smiled slightly. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell suddenly realized that he wanted to explain things, but he didn\u2019t know how to go about it. He wasn\u2019t good at this kind of situation. He groped for the right words.</p><p>\u201cThe point I\u2019m trying to make,\u201d he said, \u201cis that you were smart enough not to follow my bad example.</p><p>You made something of yourself, Gabe. When you built M.C. you broke the Madison curse or jinx or whatever that made us all failures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean? That\u2019s exactly what you did and don\u2019t you ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me who broke the jinx,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cIt was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? You\u2019re the one who changed after Dad\u2019s death. And when you changed, you altered the future for Rafe and me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Lillian stopped the car in the drive, opened the door and checked her watch in the weak overhead light.</p><p>Just after seven. There was no sign of Gabe and Mitchell yet but they would be here any minute. Gabe had called her from the outskirts of town a short while ago.</p><p>She had left the porch light on as well as several lamps inside the house. The cottage was illuminated with a warm, welcoming glow. Keys in hand, she collected the two sacks of groceries she had picked up at Fulton\u2019s Supermarket and went up the porch steps. With a little jockeying, she managed to get the front door open without having to put down one of the grocery bags. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walked into the front hall, kicked the door shut and wrestled her burdens into the kitchen. The house felt unaccountably cold.</p><p>She was certain she had left the thermostat set at a comfortable temperature.</p><p>An uneasy feeling drifted through her. There had been a cold draft in the mudroom the night someone had broken in.</p><p>She went to the door and studied the living room. Nothing appeared to be disturbed. Maybe she had left an upstairs window open a crack.</p> <p>But the draft was not coming from the staircase. It emanated from the downstairs hall.</p><p>Her studio.</p><p>Galvanized, she rushed toward the guest bedroom.

But through the narrow opening she could see that something was very wrong inside her studio.</p><p>A chill that had nothing to do with the draft of cold air went through her. With a sense of deep dread, she pushed the door open wide.</p><p>The studio was in chaos. The blank canvas on the easel had been ripped to shreds. Rags, brushes, and knives were scattered across the floor. There was paint everywhere. The contents of several tubes of paint had been smeared across one wall and the floor. Her palette lay upside down on the bed. Pages of drawings had been ripped from her sketchbook and crumpled into balls.</p> <p>She finally identified the source of the cold draft. It came through the broken window.</p><p>Gabe felt everything inside him turn to stone when he saw Sean Valentine\u2019s SUV parked in the drive.</p><p>Then he saw Lillian standing on the front porch talking to Valentine, and allowed himself to start breathing again.</p><p>He hit the breaks and switched off the engine. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured that.\u201d Mitchell surveyed the scene on the porch. \u201cNot like Sean to be running around at this time of night unless there\u2019s trouble.\u201d</p><p>Gabe got the Jag\u2019s door open. He loped toward the steps. Sean and Lillian looked at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Lillian had another visit from whoever broke in the other night,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cHe vandalized my studio this time,\u201d Lillian said shakily.</p><p>Mitchell came up the steps with his cane. He frowned at Lillian. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She smiled wanly. \u201cBut he made a mess. The floor, the bedspread, the wall. Everything\u2019s covered in paint.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked serious. \u201cDidn\u2019t think too much of your idea that this guy Witley might be stalking her, Madison. But after seeing what he did to that bedroom, I\u2019m inclined to agree with you. Let\u2019s go inside and see what we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got jack squat, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mitchell announced an hour later when they finally got around to dinner. He squinted at Lillian. \u201cHow the heck did you get into so much trouble running a matchmaking business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarned if I know.\u201d She picked up her wineglass. \u201cFriend of mine told me that the business was a lawsuit waiting to happen. But no one warned me about stalkers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t you worry about it too much.\u201d Mitchell tackled his stir-fry vegetables with gusto. \u201cOne thing to be a stalker in Portland where no one notices a guy hanging around places he shouldn\u2019t be hanging around. Another thing to do your stalking here in Eclipse Bay where a stranger gets noticed, especially at this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cIf Witley\u2019s in town, Sean Valentine will find him quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeanwhile, you\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Mitchell added. \u201cGabe here will watch over you.\u201d</p><p>Lillian looked at Gabe.</p><p>He gave her his sexy grin. \u201cWon\u2019t let you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>She contemplated the wine in her glass. \u201cThe thing is, even if Sean does find Witley, what can he do?</p><p>I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s tough to prove a charge of stalking.\u201d</p><p>Gabe and Mitchell exchanged silent looks.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Gabe shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Witley. If Sean can\u2019t do anything, Mitch and I will think of something.\u201d</p><p>Her hand tensed around the glass. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs Madisons are pretty creative,\u201d Mitchell assured her cheerfully.</p><p>She looked at each of them in turn. Another small chill wafted through her. They were both smiling, easy, laid-back Madison smiles. Probably trying to reassure her. But there was something very different going on in their eyes. Something very dangerous.</p><p>She did not argue when Gabe suggested that they go back to his place after dinner. The idea of leaving the cottage undefended made her uneasy but the notion of actually spending the night there gave her the jitters. She knew that she would not sleep.</p><p>When she emerged from the bathroom she found him standing at the bedroom window, gazing out into the night. He wore a pair of jeans but nothing else. The sleek, muscled contours of his bare back and shoulders made her fingers itch for a pencil and some drawing paper. Other parts of her were tingling, too, she noticed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI had an interesting conversation with Mitch on the way back to Eclipse Bay this evening.\u201d He did not turn around. \u201cApparently Madison Commercial is more important to him than he likes to admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She tightened the sash of her bathrobe and sank down on the end of the bed. \u201cI could have told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it was proof to the world that he hadn\u2019t screwed up completely with Rafe and me.\u201d</p><p>She thought about it. \u201cI can see where he might view your success as a sign that he hadn\u2019t botched the job of raising you. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>Gabe let the curtain fall and turned around to face her. \u201cThat he was the reason Rafe and I made it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth. I\u2019ve known it for years but I don\u2019t think I ever told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison Commercial is important to your grandfather, but you and Rafe mean a lot more to him than the company does.\u201d</p><p>Gabe sat down beside her, leaned forward and clasped his hands loosely between his knees. He contemplated their images in the mirror above the chest of drawers.</p><p>\u201cHe really is afraid you\u2019ll break my heart,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>She managed a soft little laugh. \u201cDid you assure him that\u2019s not very likely?\u201d</p><p>Gabe said nothing.</p><p>She stilled. \u201cGabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t allow him to think that I could really break your heart, did you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, sure.\u201d He said it carelessly, easily, casually. As if it were an incontrovertible fact. \u201cI\u2019m a Madison.\u201d</p><p>She stopped breathing altogether for the space of a couple of heartbeats. With concentration she managed to drag some oxygen into her lungs.</p><p>\u201cIs this your subtle, roundabout way of telling me that you see our relationship as something more than just a short-term affair?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been something more than just an affair for me right from the start.\u201d</p> <p>She could hardly speak. \u201cBut I thought we had agreed that we aren\u2019t a good match.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou Hartes probably worry about things like that more than we Madisons do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be a different kind of Madison.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and reached for her, pushed her gently down onto the bed. He leaned forward and kissed her throat.</p><p>\u201cNot that different,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The following morning they went back to the cottage together to clean up the studio. There was a message from Nella on the answering machine. It was short and to the point.</p><p>\u201cCall me.\u201d</p><p>Lillian grabbed the phone and punched in the number.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got?\u201d she asked without preamble.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been? I\u2019ve been trying to reach you since six o\u2019clock this morning.\u201d</p><p>Lillian glanced at Gabe. \u201cOut. I was out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Nella sounded amused. \u201cWouldn\u2019t have thought there was enough going on in Eclipse Bay to keep a jaded city girl out all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNella\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found Witley,\u201d Nella said, brisk and businesslike now. \u201cHe has a rock-solid alibi for the entire time that you\u2019ve been in Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and a pal are down in the Caribbean doing some diving. They\u2019re registered at a hotel on Saint Thomas. I checked with some of the local dive shops and I called his room. He was there, Lil. No way he could have flown back to Oregon, driven to Eclipse Bay yesterday and then returned to the island this morning in time to take my call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Lillian looked at Gabe, who was listening intently to her side of the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s good news or bad news because it means we have to start from scratch. But thanks for checking him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. By the way, apparently whatever you said to him on the street that day made an impact. I had a long conversation with him. He said he realized that maybe you\u2019d been right about how he needed an outdoor type, not one of those highbrow arty types.\u201d</p><p>Lillian groaned. \u201cHe used the term arty ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. He now agrees with you that he and Heather Summers were not made for each other after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just yet, but stay tuned.\u201d</p><p>Nella hesitated. \u201cCan you think of anyone else besides Witley who might want to harass you? Any old boyfriends hanging around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know better than anyone else what my social life has been like for the past year, Nella. Boring doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.\u201d</p><p>Gabe raised a brow. She ignored him.</p><p>\u201cWe in the investigation business have a saying,\u201d Nella continued. \u201cWhen the picture doesn\u2019t make sense, draw a new one. Maybe you should look at these incidents from another perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem is, I can\u2019t see any other angle here.\u201d</p><p>Nella hesitated. \u201cYou know, if it weren\u2019t for the trashing of your studio yesterday, I\u2019d say that someone had broken into your apartment and your cottage to look for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it could be. I told you, nothing was taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pieces of this puzzle aren\u2019t fitting well together, Lil. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>The darkened hallway was lined with office doors fitted with opaque glass. Gabe could hear the din of muffled voices in the distance. The noise came from the large reception room in the intersecting corridor.</p><p>The Leaders of Tomorrow open-house event was in full swing.</p><p>Lillian stood beside him in the shadows. Her hair was pinned into a sleek, graceful knot at the back of her head. She wore a close-fitting, midnight-blue dress made out of a stretchy, slinky fabric that moved when she did and a pair of sexy, strappy heels.</p><p>He could think of a couple of other things he would rather do with her tonight than hunt for frozen space aliens. But duty called.</p><p>He checked the bulky camera Arizona had given him. \u201cWe\u2019re all set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still say this is a really bad idea,\u201d Lillian muttered. \u201cWhat if we get caught prowling through the new wing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone stops us, which is highly unlikely given that they\u2019re all very busy with the reception, we\u2019ll say we were curious about the new construction. Big deal. You really think anyone would arrest a Harte and a Madison who just happened to wander into the wrong hallway here at the institute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more likely they\u2019d ask us for a contribution. Stop worrying. You\u2019re a little tense tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a very difficult week and now I\u2019m getting ready to look for frozen aliens. I\u2019ve got a right to be tense. I\u2019m supposed to be devoting myself to art, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of this as performance art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Performance art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get in, take a few shots of empty offices and get out. Tomorrow we\u2019ll turn the pictures over to A.Z. and she can weave whatever conspiracy theories she wants. That will be the end of it for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we explain the camera if we\u2019re stopped by a guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cWe\u2019ll say we wanted some souvenir photos of the reception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a high-tech spy camera, for heaven\u2019s sake. No one\u2019s going to buy that story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I can fake it if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said with annoyance. \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with and get back to the open house.\u201d</p><p>She started off down the hall toward the new wing with long, determined strides. He fell into step beside her, marveling at how well she could move in the sexy shoes. Together they prowled deeper into the bowels of the institute. The sounds of the open house faded into the distance behind them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the far end of the dark passage a temporary door fashioned out of plywood had been installed to separate the uncompleted wing from the main building. A band of loosely draped construction zone tape barred the way. Gabe ducked under the tape and found the partition unlocked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in luck.\u201d He eased the plywood door open and stood aside to allow Lillian to enter. \u201cReady to boldly go where no Harte or Madison has gone before?\u201d</p><p>She moved into the unpainted hall and stopped.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you start taking pictures?\u201d she said in a low voice.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the nearest door and opened it. There was enough light filtering through the window from the parking lot lamps to reveal the bones of an empty room that was clearly intended to serve as an office.</p><p>\u201cNo frozen aliens in here,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cBig surprise.\u201d She leaned around the edge of the door. \u201cHurry up and take a picture. We\u2019ve got a whole bunch of rooms to cover.\u201d</p><p>He raised the heavy VPX 4000 and snapped off a shot. The flash flared, brilliantly illuminating the small space for an instant. Darkness closed in again almost immediately.</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cNow I can\u2019t see a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis thing really puts out some wattage, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He blinked a few times to get rid of the dark spots.</p><p>\u201cNext time close your eyes when I take the picture.\u201d</p><p>He went to the door across the hall, opened it, and took another picture of an empty, partially painted interior. When he finished, he moved to the next door and repeated the procedure.</p><p>After a while, it became routine. Open a door, take a photo of a bare office, close the door. Go to the next room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think A.Z. is going to be real thrilled with these pictures,\u201d Lillian said halfway down the hall.</p> <p>\u201cShe has her heart set on finding proof that the government has secretly moved frozen extraterrestrials here to Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about A.Z. She\u2019s a professional conspiracy buff, remember? A pro can always find a way to spin the facts into a new theory.\u201d</p><p>He opened the next door in line, raised the VPX 4000 and fired off a shot.</p><p>A woman yelled at the same instant the flash exploded. Not Lillian, he realized. Someone else. This room was inhabited. Not frozen aliens. Warm bodies.</p><p>Two figures were illuminated in the intense light. A man with a serious erection dressed in a pair of red bikini briefs and a woman in a black leather bustier and high-heeled black boots.</p><p>J. Anderson Flint and Marilyn Thornley.</p><p>\u201cHoly cow,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cA.Z. was right. But it\u2019s worse than she thought. Wait\u2019ll she hears that they\u2019ve thawed out two of the frozen alien life-forms.\u201d</p><p>For two or three seconds everyone stared at everyone else. Marilyn, demonstrating the well-honed instincts of a natural-born politician, recovered first.</p> <p>\u201cGive me that camera,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s not mine to give away.\u201d Gabe took a quick step back toward the door. \u201cPrivate property, you know. A bulwark of our constitutional republic. Wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said give me that damned camera.\u201d Marilyn lunged toward him.</p><p>\u201cGive her the stupid camera, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>She grabbed the heavy VPX 4000 out of his hand and hurled it toward Marilyn the way you\u2019d hurl garlic and a silver cross at a vampire.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d She seized his arm and hauled him out of the doorway. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>She broke into a run. Gabe had to stretch a little to keep up with her. He admired her form as they went down the corridor.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know a woman could move that fast in high heels,\u201d he said.</p><p>By the time they reached the main building he was laughing so hard he accidentally went through the construction zone tape, severing it. The ends fluttered to the floor.</p><p>\u201cA.Z. was right,\u201d he managed to get out between howls. \u201cStrange things going on in the new wing.\u201d</p><p>Lillian stopped and turned to look at him. She was breathing hard from her recent exertion. She watched him for a long moment, a strange expression on her face. You\u2019d think she\u2019d never seen a man doubled up with laughter, he thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything for a picture of you right now.\u201d She stepped forward and brushed her mouth lightly against his. \u201cAnd to think that I once thought you were a walking case of burnout.\u201d</p><p>The following morning Lillian was still trying to figure out how to deliver the bad news to Arizona. She stood at the kitchen counter in Gabe\u2019s house watching him slather peanut butter onto two slices of toasted Incandescent Body sourdough bread, and went through the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cWe could say we lost her VPX 4000,\u201d she said. \u201cOr maybe imply that it was stolen out of the car.\u201d</p><p>Gabe did not look up from his task. \u201cCould tell her the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. No one, not even A.Z., would believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point.\u201d Gabe put the peanut butter toast on a plate. \u201cSome things defy description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things are also actionable. The last thing we need is a lawsuit from Marilyn\u2019s campaign.\u201d Lillian poured coffee. \u201cWe have to come up with a reasonable story or A.Z. will invent another new conspiracy theory to explain a second missing camera.\u201d</p><p>Gabe picked up a slice of peanut butter toast and took a bite. \u201cYou have to admit that it\u2019s pushing coincidence a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it. Two missing spy cameras. One stolen by force. One confiscated by a politician in a black leather bustier. Both cameras belong to a woman dedicated to uncovering the truth about a clandestine government project housed at the Eclipse Bay Policy Studies Institute. I mean, what are the odds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find this all very entertaining, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and took a swallow of coffee. \u201cMost fun I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Wonderful. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re amused. But what the heck are we going to tell A.Z.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it to me. I\u2019ll handle it. I think I\u2019ll go with the truth. By the time A.Z. gets through twisting it, no one will recognize it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Lillian took a bite of toast. She chewed on it for a while and then swallowed.</p><p>\u201cSomething I\u2019ve been meaning to ask,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Marilyn wear black leather bustiers a lot when the two of you were an item?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cMy memory isn\u2019t so good when it comes to some things. But I\u2019m pretty sure the black leather gear is new. Probably a political fashion statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She looked at the unfinished portion of her toast. \u201cYou\u2019re good with peanut butter, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarilyn Thornley confiscated the camera?\u201d Arizona slapped a big hand, palm down, fingers spread, on the laminated map that decorated the table of her war room. \u201cDamn. I was afraid of this. She\u2019s either working with them or she\u2019s one of their dupes.\u201d</p> <p>Lillian suppressed a groan. This was not going well. The good news was that Arizona appeared to be back to her old self. She still wore a small bandage but there was no sign of any other physical problems resulting from the blow to her head.</p><p>\u201cPersonally,\u201d Gabe said, \u201cI\u2019d vote for the dupe possibility. I can\u2019t see Marilyn getting involved in a conspiracy to cover up dead space aliens and high-tech UFO secrets. She\u2019s too busy working on the launch of her campaign.\u201d</p><p>Arizona squinted a little while she considered that angle. \u201cGuess you know her better than anyone else around here does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d Lillian agreed brightly.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that she has changed much,\u201d Gabe said deliberately. \u201cShe\u2019s devoted to one cause and that cause is Marilyn Thornley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been involved in politics for the last few years, though,\u201d A.Z. mused. \u201cMakes for strange bedfellows.\u201d</p><p>A vision of Anderson in his red bikini briefs flared briefly in Lillian\u2019s mind. \u201cYou can say that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll replace the camera, A.Z.,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cIn the meantime, you have our full report. The bottom line is that there was no sign of heavy-duty lab equipment in the new wing and we found no evidence of frozen extraterrestrials. If those alien bodies were moved into the institute, they\u2019ve got them well hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures.\u201d Arizona nodded sagely. \u201cShould have known it wouldn\u2019t be this easy. We\u2019ll just have to keep digging. Maybe literally, if they\u2019ve hidden the lab underground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA scary thought,\u201d Lillian murmured.</p><p>\u201cMy work will continue,\u201d Arizona assured them. \u201cMeanwhile, thanks for the undercover job. Couldn\u2019t have done it without you. Unfortunately, you\u2019ll never get the public recognition you deserve because we have to maintain secrecy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe understand,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Arizona nodded. \u201cBut I want you to know that your names will be legend among the ranks of those of us who seek the truth about this vast conspiracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly good enough for me,\u201d Lillian said quickly. \u201cHow about you, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways wanted to be a legend in my own time,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want any public recognition,\u201d Lillian added, eager to emphasize the point. \u201cJust knowing that we did our patriotic duty is all the reward we need. Isn\u2019t that right, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Gabe got to his feet. \u201cPublicity would be a disaster. If our identities as secret agents were exposed, it would ruin any chance of us helping you out with future undercover work.\u201d</p><p>Lillian was almost to the door. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Arizona said. \u201cNever know when we might have to call on you two again.\u201d</p> <p>She knew that something was bothering Gabe. The amusement that had carried him through last night\u2019s investigation and this morning\u2019s debriefing with Arizona had vanished. When she had called him to suggest a walk on the beach a short while ago, he had agreed, but she could tell that his thoughts were elsewhere.</p><p>He had met her at the top of the beach path. She had noticed immediately that the cool, remote quality was back. At least she had finally figured out that the withdrawn air did not automatically indicate major depression or burnout. It meant that he was doing some heavy-duty thinking.</p><p>At last. Progress in the quest to understand the deeper elements of Gabriel Madison\u2019s enigmatic nature.</p><p>He moved easily beside her, his jacket collar pulled up around his neck, his hands shoved deep into his pockets. She recognized this brooding mood, she suddenly realized. She had experienced it often enough herself. It came upon her at times when she was struggling to find the key to the inner vision of a picture.</p><p>She wondered why she had never understood the similarity before.</p><p>She did not try to draw him out of whatever distant space he was exploring. Instead she contented herself with setting an energetic pace for both of them. The tide was out, exposing small, rocky pools.</p><p>She picked a route through the driftwood and assorted debris that had been deposited by the last storm.</p><p>Gabe did not speak until they had almost reached Eclipse Arch, the rock monolith that dominated the beach.</p><p>\u201cHow well do you know Flint?\u201d he asked without any preamble.</p><p>The question took her by surprise.</p><p>\u201cAnderson?\u201d She came to a halt. \u201cNot well at all. He moved into the same office building in Portland about six months ago. Like I said, we had some conversations of a professional nature. That\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me that he wanted to buy your matchmaking program.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAnd I explained to him that it wasn\u2019t for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he figured he could get it another way,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cWhat other way is there?\u201d Then it hit her. \u201cGood grief. You don\u2019t really think Anderson would try to . . . to steal it, do you? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked with the college public affairs office this morning. There is no conference of any kind scheduled at Chamberlain this week or next. Flint lied when he said that he was in town to attend a professional seminar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She started walking again, mulling over the possibilities. \u201cOkay, maybe he made up the story about being here for a conference. I can see where he might have followed me to try to talk me into selling him the program. But it\u2019s hard to envision him actually breaking into my apartment and the cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019ve got something he wants. You refused to sell it to him. In his mind that might not leave a lot of options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d She trailed off, trying to sort out the logic. \u201cAnderson is a sex therapist, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been one for long.\u201d</p><p>That stopped her in her tracks. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I called Chamberlain, I talked to some people I know in Portland and went online for some research. The institution that issued Flint\u2019s professional credentials is a mail-order outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a paper mill. You pay them money, they give you a fancy piece of paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, his credentials are bogus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say that his alma mater is not real rigorous when it comes to academic standards.\u201d</p><p>She thought about the women she had seen in Anderson\u2019s waiting room. A shudder went through her.</p><p>\u201cTalk about a lawsuit waiting to happen. And I thought I was on dangerous ground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny you should mention the word lawsuit .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurns out that Flint reinvented himself as a sex therapist after he got into legal troubles in his former profession.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask but I can\u2019t help myself. What did he do before he went into the field of sex therapy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe headed up a consortium that invested heavily in some Internet ventures that disappeared into thin air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me Anderson is a complete fraud?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. From what I could learn this morning, it appears that no one has as yet managed to prove that.</p><p>Flint appears to have a talent for staying inside the gray area between legal and illegal activities. But a guy like that might not have any qualms about trying to steal a computer program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She took her hands out of her pockets and spread them wide. \u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Gabe said, \u201cthat we should have a conversation with J. Anderson Flint.\u201d</p><p>The motel was typical of many that dotted the winding coast road that led to and from Eclipse Bay, a little down at the heels and mostly empty at this time of year. The rooms all opened directly onto the outside sidewalk. There were three cars parked in front of three doors. Two of the vehicles were mud-splattered SUVs. The third was a sparkling-clean late-model Lincoln.</p><p>Gabe brought the Jag to a halt at the far end of the parking lot and studied the blue Lincoln.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to bet that\u2019s his car?\u201d</p><p>Lillian followed his gaze. Tension angled her shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re wrong, this could be a little hard to explain,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI told you to let me handle this on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that and you know it. Anderson is my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrection.\u201d He cracked open the door and got out. \u201cHe\u2019s our problem.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door before she could argue.</p><p>She emerged from the Jag without another word. Together they walked to Number Seven.</p><p>Gabe knocked twice. Anderson opened the door immediately. He wore gray trousers and a blue sweater that matched his car and his eyes. He did not look at all surprised to see them standing outside his room.</p><p>\u201cI wondered when you two would get here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lillian looked at him unhappily. \u201cWe came to talk to you, Anderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Flint held the door open. \u201cYou might as well come inside. I trust this won\u2019t take long. I\u2019ve got a meeting with Marilyn in an hour.\u201d</p><p>Lillian entered the room warily. \u201cA meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be taking over as her campaign manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Lillian hesitated for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re taking Claire\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarilyn made her decision last night,\u201d Anderson said.</p><p>\u201cIs that what she was doing?\u201d Gabe moved into the small room. \u201cSelecting a new campaign manager? I wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave your pathetic little jokes for someone else.\u201d Raw anger sharpened the lines of Anderson\u2019s face.</p><p>He closed the door with sudden force. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for your crude humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Anderson,\u201d Lillian said quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were interested in politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t until I met Marilyn.\u201d An odd light appeared in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that she needs me.\u201d</p><p>He means it, Gabe thought. What the hell was going on here?</p><p>Lillian watched Anderson closely. \u201cWhy do you say Marilyn needs you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a brilliant candidate but it\u2019s clear from the way she fired Claire Jensen on impulse that she lacks maturity and experience. I can bring those strengths to her campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Lillian said.</p><p>Gabe leaned against the closed door and folded his arms. He took stock of the room. From the thin bedspread to the faded flower-print curtains, it fit in with the rest of the establishment. A bit on the seedy side. He had a hunch it was not a J. Anderson Flint kind of place. But, then, Flint hadn\u2019t had a lot of choice when it came to accommodations here on the coast. Too bad Dreamscape wasn\u2019t up and running.</p><p>Hannah and Rafe could have made some money off him.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to join Marilyn\u2019s campaign, can we assume that you\u2019ll be giving up your practice in Portland?\u201d Lillian asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Anderson sounded impatient.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your clients?\u201d Lillian said. \u201cAre you just going to abandon them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other sex therapists. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably no worse off, at any rate,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Anderson scowled. \u201cThere are priorities here. The transition to a new campaign manger has to be made without delay. Any loss of momentum at this juncture could be disastrous for Marilyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cGotta have a seamless transition. I understand that. Hell of a sacrifice on your part, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarilyn\u2019s candidacy is far more important than my personal business affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a great deal to give to this country.\u201d Anderson\u2019s rich voice was laced with what sounded like genuine fervor. \u201cI can help her achieve her full potential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour patriotic duty to get her elected, is that it?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>Anderson\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. There\u2019s no point expecting you to comprehend what\u2019s at stake here. Let\u2019s get down to business.\u201d</p><p>Lillian cleared her throat. \u201cWe didn\u2019t actually come here to talk about business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anderson made a disgusted sound at the back of his throat. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born yesterday. I know why you\u2019re here. You came to bargain for access.\u201d</p><p>Lillian looked baffled. \u201cAccess to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Marilyn, of course.\u201d Anderson did not look at her. He kept his attention on Gabe. \u201cWe all know that when she\u2019s elected, she\u2019ll have a great deal of power. You want me to guarantee that you\u2019ll have access to her, isn\u2019t that right, Madison? A man in your position likes to have friends in high places.\u201d</p><p>Lillian stared. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Anderson flicked a quick glance at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, didn\u2019t Madison tell you how he intended to use those pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t have any photos,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cMarilyn took the camera, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap. I know you had two cameras last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were too quick to turn the first one over to Marilyn when she demanded it.\u201d Flint moved his hand in a small arc. \u201cThere\u2019s only one reason why you would do that. You knew you had backup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Lillian was indignant.</p><p>\u201cThe double-camera routine is as old as the hills.\u201d Anderson cut off her protest with a patently bored look. \u201cIt buys the photographer some time to escape an unpleasant confrontation. The victim thinks she\u2019s confiscated the incriminating film and doesn\u2019t realize until too late that there is another set of photos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound familiar with the technique,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell Marilyn because I knew it would upset her. Now that I\u2019m her manager, it\u2019s my job to handle this type of incident. I certainly don\u2019t intend to allow her to be destroyed by the same type of cheap blackmail that ruined her husband\u2019s campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you imply that we would do something like that?\u201d Lillian was furious now. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here to blackmail Marilyn.\u201d</p><p>Anderson paid no attention to her. \u201cJust tell me what you want, Madison, and I\u2019ll see to it that you get it, provided that you destroy those photos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat we want,\u201d Gabe said evenly, \u201care some answers.\u201d</p><p>Anderson\u2019s brows came together in a puzzled scowl. \u201cAnswers to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you break into Lillian\u2019s apartment in Portland?\u201d</p><p>For an instant Anderson appeared frozen in place. Then he came up out of the chair. He was practically vibrating with outrage.</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d he hissed. \u201cWhy would I do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo look for her computer program,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cYou can save the act. It\u2019s good but it\u2019s not that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not break into her apartment.\u201d Each word was pronounced with unnatural precision.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about her cottage here in Eclipse Bay?\u201d Gabe said. \u201cI assume that was you, too, but I\u2019ll admit that incident is a little confusing because of the assault on Arizona Snow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know anyone named Arizona Snow,\u201d Anderson gritted.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that was an unrelated event, after all,\u201d Lillian said to Gabe.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t get past the coincidence thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoincidences happen,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>Anderson swung around to face her. \u201cStop it. Both of you. You can\u2019t make false accusations like this.</p><p>You can\u2019t prove a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about not being able to prove anything,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Anderson settled himself, relieved. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we came here instead of going to the cops. Of course, if you\u2019d rather we went to Marilyn, we can do that. She might be interested to hear about your legal problems back in the days when you were selling online investments.\u201d</p><p>Shock flashed on Anderson\u2019s face. \u201cMarilyn would never listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bank on it,\u201d Lillian responded. \u201cShe and Gabe have a history. They go back a long way, I think Marilyn would listen to him if he told her that he didn\u2019t believe that you were a good choice for campaign manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d Anderson stammered. \u201cYou have no right. Nothing was ever proven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we want is confirmation that you went through Lillian\u2019s things looking for her matchmaking program,\u201d Gabe demanded.</p><p>Anderson abruptly turned away toward the window. He gazed bleakly out at the motel parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI did not break into Lillian\u2019s apartment or the cottage,\u201d he said eventually, again enunciating each word with care.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not quibble over the details.\u201d Gabe watched him closely. \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t break into her apartment. Maybe you let yourself inside with keys that you either duplicated from her key ring or conned out of the housekeeping staff or the manager.\u201d</p><p>Lillian flashed him a startled look. Her mouth opened but she closed it quickly without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cThe cottage was a problem,\u201d Gabe went on, \u201cbecause you didn\u2019t have a key so you had to pry open the door. The second time you smashed a window. By then you had heard about our theory that Lillian was being stalked. Word of that kind of thing gets around fast in a small town. You trashed her studio hoping to keep us looking in that direction. You didn\u2019t want us thinking there might be another motive for the break-ins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s pretty clear that Marilyn can\u2019t afford to be connected to a campaign manager who goes around imitating stalkers. Or one who breaks into apartments and cottages, for that matter. Bad for the image, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lie. I didn\u2019t trash Lillian\u2019s studio. You can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we want is the truth,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I won\u2019t let you ruin this for me.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Anderson spun away from the window and flung himself at Gabe.</p><p>\u201cAnderson, no,\u201d Lillian called. \u201cStop. This won\u2019t solve anything.\u201d</p><p>But Anderson was beyond reason. Gabe managed to sidestep the initial charge but Anderson wheeled with startling speed and came at him again. This time Gabe found himself trapped in the corner, the television set on one side, a lamp on the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took the only way out, going low to duck Anderson\u2019s swinging fist. Anderson\u2019s hand struck the wall where Gabe had been standing a second earlier. A shuddering jolt went through him. Gabe heard him suck in an anguished breath.</p><p>He caught Anderson by the legs and shoved hard. The momentum toppled both of them to the rug. They went down with a stunning thud, Anderson on the bottom. He struggled wildly, fighting back with a reckless fury, completely out of control. He hammered the floor with his heels and managed to slam a fist into Gabe\u2019s ribs. He twisted violently, trying to lurch free.</p><p>Gabe finally pinned him to the rug, using his weight to force him to lie still.</p><p>Trapped, Anderson stared up at him. Gabe felt him go limp as the hurricane of violence dissipated as suddenly as it had appeared.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her hurt, do you understand?\u201d Anderson\u2019s voice was ragged. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want\u2014just don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Anderson, no one wants to hurt Marilyn. We just want the truth.\u201d Gabe tightened his hands on Anderson\u2019s shoulders. \u201cTell me about the break-ins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Okay. I did go into Lillian\u2019s apartment. But I didn\u2019t break in, damn it. I went in with the cleaning people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was that easy?\u201d</p><p>Anderson nodded. \u201cIt was that easy. Just told them I was there to check out some electrical problems.</p> <p>People trust you when you wear a uniform with your name on it.\u201d</p><p>Lillian moved closer. Gabe sensed the shock that gripped her. He caught a glimpse of her hands. They were clenched so tightly that her knuckles were white. But her voice was surprisingly steady.</p><p>\u201cDid you want the matchmaking program that badly, Anderson?\u201d she asked. \u201cI told you, it wasn\u2019t magic. Just a standard personality inventory analysis program that I used together with a dose of common sense.\u201d</p><p>Anderson looked up at her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the damned matchmaking program I wanted, you little fool. It was the data on your clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy clients .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it?\u201d He made a disgusted sound. \u201cHell, you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got, do you?</p> <p>Don\u2019t you have any concept of what that client database is worth? You\u2019ve got detailed background information on some of the wealthiest, most successful, most powerful people in the city. Hell, in the whole damn state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what would you do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your boyfriend, here. I\u2019m sure he understands what that kind of information is worth these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fortune.\u201d Gabe released Anderson and got to his feet. \u201cGood client data is one of the most valuable commodities on the market today. Businesses, investors, politicians, charitable organizations, you name it, they all want it. They\u2019ll all pay big bucks for solid background on people who have a lot of money to spend.\u201d</p><p>Lillian looked at Anderson. \u201cYou never were interested in collaborating on a book, were you? You were after my client roster all along. Who did you plan to sell my files to?\u201d</p><p>He sat up slowly, wincing. \u201cI hadn\u2019t finalized my list of prospects. I was still working on it when you announced that you intended to close down Private Arrangements. When I realized you were serious, my first thought was to salvage the data. I offered to buy your program, thinking I\u2019d get the client list with it.</p><p>But you refused to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you tried to steal it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to steal the damned files.\u201d Anderson actually looked offended. \u201cI just wanted to take a copy for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t call that theft?\u201d Lillian asked.</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like you had any use for that data.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you didn\u2019t find her files in Portland, you followed her here to Eclipse Bay,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cThat night in the restaurant you encountered the perfect prospect for the client info. Marilyn Thornley. A politician badly in need of a rich donor list.\u201d</p><p>Some of the fierceness returned briefly to Anderson\u2019s expression. \u201cShe needs those names and the background on those people.\u201d</p><p>Lillian opened her mouth. Gabe didn\u2019t know what she planned to say but quite suddenly he had had enough. He shook his head once. She got the message and remained silent.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced once more at Anderson and then walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d Anderson gripped the edge of the television set to steady himself. \u201cWhat are you going to do? You can\u2019t involve Marilyn in this. She had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Flint.\u201d Gabe opened the door. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do a damn thing. I told you, all we wanted was the truth. It stops here, provided you leave Lillian alone. But if you make another move to get her computer, I\u2019ll take the story straight to the cops and to the press.\u201d</p><p>Anderson looked horrified. \u201cMarilyn\u2019s campaign couldn\u2019t survive that kind of scandal at this stage.</p><p>Things are too delicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cYou have my word that if you leave Lillian alone, this won\u2019t go any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I won\u2019t bother her again.\u201d Anderson sounded frantic. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>He ushered Lillian through the door and out onto the sidewalk. A chill, damp wind was blowing bits of litter around the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cLillian, wait.\u201d Anderson came to stand in the doorway. \u201cIf you change your mind, my offer to buy those client files is still good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it, Anderson. The files are gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you destroyed them. They\u2019re too valuable. Think about my offer. You\u2019ve got in-depth information on guys like Tom Lydd of Lydd-Zone Software and Madison, here. That data is worth a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about the Lydd information,\u201d Lillian said quietly. \u201cBut the data on Gabe certainly wouldn\u2019t do anyone any good.\u201d</p><p>Anderson scowled. \u201cWhat the hell do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it is false,\u201d Lillian explained. \u201cHe lied through his teeth on the questionnaire that he filled out for Private Arrangements.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Gabe needed a place to think. And a cup of coffee. So he drove to the nearest restaurant, Snow\u2019s Caf\u00e9.</p><p>They found a booth at the back. Lillian ordered tea. He went for the hard stuff, a double espresso. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a sprinkling of Arizona\u2019s customary clientele around them, primarily students and faculty from Chamberlain College, but no one bothered them. Arizona was not behind the counter today. Gabe figured she was probably at home in her war room, devising strategy to uncover the secret, underground labs at the institute.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think he\u2019ll leave me alone now?\u201d Lillian asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t believe me when I told him that I had destroyed the client files.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe sipped the supercharged espresso and lowered the small cup. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst day I got here. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to be absolutely certain that my clients\u2019 privacy would be protected as long as the data concerning them was stored in my computer. So I removed the hard drive and tossed it into Dead Hand Cove at high tide. I left the rest of the computer in the trunk of my car. It\u2019s still there as far as I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only copy of those files was on that hard drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess that took care of the privacy issue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was the whole point.\u201d She sighed. \u201cLooking back, I suppose I should have realized sooner that Anderson was after those files. But he kept talking about the program so I assumed he wanted to go into matchmaking. It seemed like a logical extension of his sex therapy business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could hardly admit that he wanted the background info on your clients. He knew how strongly you felt about guarding their privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing bothers me,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cHe acknowledged that he went into my apartment in Portland.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t he admit that he broke into the cottage here in Eclipse Bay, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s smart enough to know that he left no proof of illegal entry in your apartment. Like he said, he just walked in disguised as a repairman and looked around. Nothing was taken. No damage done. Hell, he\u2019s got witnesses that he didn\u2019t steal anything. Your cleaning people will vouch for him. And you never even filed a report with the cops. He had nothing to lose by telling us about that incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut here in Eclipse Bay, he left obvious signs of forcible entry and I did file a report with Sean Valentine.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cIn addition, everyone knows that Valentine is investigating the assault on A.Z. and that he\u2019s working on the assumption there may be a link to at least one of the break-ins at your place. Flint didn\u2019t want to take the risk of admitting that he was ever inside your cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have been him, though. He was the only one who knew about the files on my computer.\u201d</p><p>Gabe contemplated the espresso cup. \u201cAnd after meeting Marilyn, he wanted those files very, very badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably made the deal with her right after he met her and then had to deliver the goods quickly. So he took some chances and used force to get into the cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Absently he touched his side, feeling the sore place around his ribs.</p><p>Her gaze followed the movement of his hand. Sudden alarm tightened her expression. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, did Anderson hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m fine, Lillian.\u201d He put his hand back down on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you should have a doctor check out your ribs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, no need to snap at me. I was just worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He took another swallow of coffee.</p><p>\u201cIt was a little scary there for a while.\u201d She shivered. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I was completely taken off guard when Anderson turned violent. I never expected him to attack you that way. He seemed the type who would try to talk himself out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople change when they fall in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn love .\u201d She set her cup down hard on the table and fixed him with a dumbfounded expression. \u201c</p><p>Anderson? Are you crazy? Who in the world could he possibly\u2014? Good grief, not Marilyn Thornley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he just met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappens that way sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She flopped back against the vinyl cushions. \u201cIt boggles the mind. J. Anderson Flint in love with Marilyn Thornley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said they were a perfect match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I was joking. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no joke.\u201d</p><p>She looked thoughtful. \u201cYou may be right. He was very protective of her, wasn\u2019t he? I wonder if she cares about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But if she\u2019s smart, she\u2019ll keep him on as her campaign manager. He\u2019s committed. She\u2019ll have his complete loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice qualities in a campaign manager. And in a husband. Be interesting to see what happens there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him across the table. \u201cWeird, when you think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the fact that you picked up on it first. I\u2019m supposed to be the expert in that department. What tipped you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale intuition.\u201d He drained the last of the espresso and put down the cup. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to tell her the truth. Not yet at any rate. He had problems enough dealing with it, himself.</p><p>\u201cIt bothers you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you found his weak spot and you used it to apply pressure to get him to confess.\u201d</p><p>He looked up, surprised. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get something clear here.\u201d He pushed aside the empty espresso cup and folded his arms on the table. \u201cProtecting you is my only priority. I don\u2019t give a damn about Flint\u2019s finer feelings.\u201d</p><p>She searched his face. \u201cI see. But if that\u2019s true, then why are you acting so weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not acting weird.\u201d He started to extricate himself from the booth. \u201cAre you finished? Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She reached across the table and covered one of his hands with her own. He went very still, intensely aware of the warmth of her fingers.</p><p>\u201cGabe, I\u2019m sorry. I know you\u2019ve been through a lot because of me. I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d</p><p>Anger heated his blood, just as the violence had earlier. He clamped down on the fierce surge of emotion, seeking refuge in that inner space to which he always retreated when things threatened to get out of control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe last thing I want is your gratitude,\u201d he said.</p><p>She recoiled, her hand coming off his so swiftly an onlooker would have thought she had gotten her fingers burned.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>He made himself breathe. \u201cI know.\u201d He got to his feet and reached for his wallet. \u201cI\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d She slipped quickly out of the booth and hurried toward the front door without looking back.</p><p>He watched her rush away. Nice going, Madison, you really screwed that up, didn\u2019t you?</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Gabe was thinking of shutting down the computer and walking to Lillian\u2019s cottage to join her for lunch when he heard the sound of a car in the drive.</p><p>He opened the front door and saw a large black Lincoln come to a halt in front of the steps. The man behind the wheel wore a dark, inexpensive suit and a single gold earring. A hired driver.</p> <p>The rear door of the vehicle opened. Sullivan Harte got out of the car.</p><p>This did not look promising.</p><p>Sullivan said something to the driver and then started toward the front porch.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were in town,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>The tip of Sullivan\u2019s cane hit the first step. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you were going to say that.\u201d He held the door open. \u201cIs this where you tell me that if I manage to sucker Lillian into marrying me you will make certain that she never inherits a dime\u2019s worth of Harte Investments?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan went past him into the house.</p><p>Gabe glanced at the limo. The driver had pulled out a paperback novel and appeared to be content to remain where he was.</p><p>Gabe followed his uninvited guest inside and let the door close behind him.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use a cup.\u201d Sullivan surveyed the desk where Gabe had left the laptop and a stack of papers.</p><p>\u201cYou really trying to run Madison Commercial from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to run it. I am running it from here. Technology is amazing.\u201d Gabe went into the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cHow long can you afford to stay away from the office?\u201d Sullivan demanded.</p><p>\u201cLong as I want.\u201d Gabe poured a cup of coffee and carried it into the living room. \u201cDid you come here to talk about the wonders of modern techniques for long-distance management?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Mitchell slammed the newspaper down with such force that the little table vibrated on its spindly legs. He scowled at Bryce, who had just walked into Incandescent Body with the news.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, Sullivan Harte is in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw him sitting in the back of a limo a few minutes ago,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cPassed me while I was at the gas station. Must have flown into Portland and hired a car and driver there. Thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned right I want to know.\u201d Mitchell grabbed his cane and levered himself to his feet. \u201cWhere was he headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook Bayview Drive. Could be on his way out to the Harte cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he could be headed toward the old Buckley place where Gabe is staying.\u201d Mitchell tossed some money on the table. \u201cWhat do you want to bet that he came here to try to scare off my grandson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. I never take bets on Hartes and Madisons. Too unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>Lillian studied the fresh canvas propped on the easel while she finished cleaning the last of her brushes. It was the start of a portrait of Gabe based on the sketch she had made of him in her Portland studio. All brooding shadows and hard, bright light, it was the first real work she had done since she had arrived in town. She was pleased with it. She had been in the zone this afternoon. About time.</p><p>She set the brushes in a holder to dry and looked at her watch. She was startled to see that it was nearly two o\u2019clock. Gabe had said he would come over around noon for lunch. As usual, she had lost all track of time while she was in that other place where the vision reigned supreme.</p><p>Maybe he had been delayed by business or a phone call.</p><p>She looked out the window. There were whitecaps on the bay and no rain in sight. She could use some fresh air after such a long stretch of work. The overstimulated sensation that always followed a particularly good session in the studio was making her restless. She needed to get out and work it off. A walk along the bluffs would do the trick. She would probably run into Gabe on his way here.</p><p>She indulged herself in a brief, romantic picture of herself flying into his arms on the top of a windswept bluff. Gulls would be wheeling overhead. His dark hair would be ruffled by the crisp breeze. She would be sexy and free-spirited in a gossamer dress and bare feet.</p><p>That image made her wonder if she ought to take time to change out of her paint-stained jeans and long-tailed denim shirt. Then she remembered that it was only about fifty-three degrees outside and that there was a lot of rough gravel on the bluff path. Forget the gossamer dress and bare feet.</p><p>She put on a pair of scuffed running shoes, took a black denim jacket out of the hall closet and left the house through the mudroom door.</p><p>Outside, the scene on the bluffs was very much as she had envisioned it, blustery and invigorating. The bay was a dramatic sweep of quietly churning seawater. The town was picturesque in the distance. The air was clear and bright. The only thing missing was Gabe. There was no sign of him on the path.</p><p>An uneasy feeling coiled around her, pushing aside the zesty anticipation. By the time she emerged from the trees and found herself near the back porch of the old Buckley place a dark foreboding had settled on her.</p><p>She walked around the side of the house to see if Gabe\u2019s car was in the drive. It was. So was another vehicle, a dark limo complete with a driver behind the wheel. The chauffeur did not notice her. He was deep into a paperback.</p><p>She told herself to relax. Obviously business from out of town had caught up with Gabe. But for some obscure reason the anxiety didn\u2019t dissipate. Things felt wrong.</p><p>She returned to the back door, opened it quietly and moved stealthily into the kitchen. If Gabe was wheeling and dealing with an important client she did not want to interrupt.</p><p>The low rumble of voices from the other room made her stop short. She knew those voices. Both of them.</p><p>Suddenly everything made sense. Outrage flared. She rushed to the doorway.</p><p>Sullivan and Gabe were seated on the sofa. A leather-bound binder and a stack of computer printouts were arrayed on the low table in front of them.</p><p>\u201cGranddad, how dare you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sullivan looked up swiftly, peering at her through a pair of reading glasses. She could have sworn that he turned red.</p><p>\u201cLillian.\u201d</p><p>Gabe said nothing. He took one look at her and lounged back into the corner of the sofa, one arm stretched out along the top of the cushions.</p><p>She ignored him. Her entire attention was focused on Sullivan.</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the world are you doing?\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cNo, don\u2019t bother explaining. I know exactly what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan blinked owlishly behind the spectacles. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as obvious as those papers on the table.\u201d She walked a few steps closer. \u201cYou\u2019re here to try to buy off Gabe. Or maybe you want to scare him off. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, honey,\u201d Sullivan said in placating tones.</p><p>She was vaguely aware of the sound of a large vehicle arriving in the drive. She ignored it.</p> <p>\u201cYou think he wants to marry me so that he can get his hands on a chunk of Harte, don\u2019t you? What are you offering him to get out of my life? Or are you threatening him?\u201d</p><p>The front door crashed open. Mitchell stormed into the house.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s threatening my grandson?\u201d he roared. He came to a halt, brows bristling, jaw clenched, and glowered at Sullivan. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, Harte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings aren\u2019t quite the way they look,\u201d Sullivan said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that for one minute,\u201d Lillian declared. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking to Mom and Dad, haven\u2019t you? They told you I was seeing Gabe and you just leaped to the conclusion that he was after me because of H.I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of leaping to conclusions,\u201d Gabe said mildly.</p> <p>She glared at him. \u201cStay out of this. It has nothing to do with you. This is between me and Granddad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me.\u201d Mitchell jabbed a thumb at his own chest. \u201cDon\u2019t forget about me. I\u2019m involved in this thing, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Gabe said dryly. \u201cDon\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>Lillian whipped her attention back to Sullivan. \u201cI realize you feel you\u2019re acting in my best interests. I know everyone believes that Gabe is after a piece of Harte. But that is absolute nonsense.\u201d</p><p>All three men stared at her.</p><p>\u201cNonsense?\u201d Sullivan repeated carefully.</p><p>\u201cYes. Nonsense.\u201d She swept out a hand. \u201cHe would never marry for business reasons. He\u2019s a Madison.</p><p>They don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d</p> <p>Sullivan cleared his throat. \u201cAlways heard that Gabe, here, was a different kind of Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that different,\u201d she shot back. \u201cAnd what\u2019s more, you can\u2019t buy him off or scare him off. Madisons don\u2019t work that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIf Gabe wants to marry her, you won\u2019t be able to get rid of him with money or threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich brings up a very crucial issue,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cAs I told Mom on the phone, Gabe has never asked me to marry him. Isn\u2019t that correct, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Sullivan grabbed the handle of his cane and used it to haul himself up off the sagging sofa.</p><p>He turned on Gabe with a thunderous expression. \u201cI was under the impression that you were serious about my granddaughter. If you think I\u2019m going to stand by while you shack up indefinitely with her, you can think again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t planning to shack up indefinitely,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Mitchell beetled his brows. \u201cJust what are you doing here, Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we were so rudely interrupted,\u201d Sullivan said, \u201cI was presenting a business proposition to Gabe.</p><p>Of course, that was when I was still under the impression that he intended to marry Lillian.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell eyed him with deep suspicion. \u201cWhat kind of business proposition?\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked at Lillian. \u201cYour grandfather was outlining the financial advantages of marriage to you. You come with one-third of H.I., you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe advantages ?\u201d Lillian stared at Sullivan. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re trying to bribe him to marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted him to understand that we\u2019d be happy to have him as a member of the family,\u201d Sullivan said mildly.</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn.\u201d Mitchell whistled softly. \u201cGot to hand it to you, Sullivan. Didn\u2019t think you had that much common sense.\u201d</p><p>Lillian was aghast. \u201cYou weren\u2019t trying to buy him off. You\u2019re here to try to buy him for me. This is the most mortifying thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan stiffened. \u201cWhat\u2019s mortifying about it? I thought you wanted Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Granddad. It\u2019s like you\u2019re offering him a dowry to take me off your hands. If he marries me and gets a chunk of H.I., everyone will say he did it for the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I turned down the deal,\u201d Gabe replied softly.</p><p>She swung around to face him. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot and damn.\u201d Mitchell waved a hand. \u201cWhy did you go and do something dumb like that? You coulda had the lady and one-third of H.I. That\u2019s what we call a win-win situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat choice did I have?\u201d Gabe gestured toward the papers on the coffee table. \u201cIf I sign those Lillian would always wonder if I married her for her inheritance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Lillian said quickly.</p><p>Gabe looked at her. \u201cI appreciate your faith in me but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t accept you and one-third of H.I., too. I just finished explaining that to Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I just give up my shares in H.I.?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sullivan glared at her. \u201cI\u2019m not about to let you walk away from your inheritance, young woman.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t be right. I worked my tail off to build that company. I did it for you and Hannah and Nick.\u201d</p><p>Her refusing a third of H.I. would be a terrible blow to him, she realized.</p><p>\u201cEvidently I\u2019m fated to be doomed by my inheritance,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>She looked at him, hope rising. \u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a way around this. If you agree to marry me and if your family insists on endowing you, so to speak, you can put your share of your Harte inheritance into a trust for any children we might have. Okay with you, Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan looked thoughtful. \u201cOne way to handle it, I guess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joy flowed through Lillian, bringing a rainbow of colors.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Gabe got to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll do it? You\u2019ll marry me?\u201d</p><p>Neither Mitchell nor Sullivan so much as twitched. It was, Lillian thought, as if the whole world was holding its collective breath in anticipation of her answer.</p> <p>\u201cWell, sure,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI mean, what else can I do after you turned down the chance to get your hands on a chunk of my family\u2019s company? It\u2019s such a truly Madison-style gesture. But I really don\u2019t want you to feel that you have to do this. It\u2019s not necessary, honest. I know you\u2019re not a fortune-hunter.\u201d</p><p>He gave her his slow smile, showing just a hint of teeth. \u201cHoney, if I want Harte Investments, I\u2019ll buy the whole damn company when your dad puts it on the market in a year or two.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stared at him in dumbfounded silence.</p><p>Lillian met Sullivan\u2019s eyes. He grinned. She felt the laughter bubble up inside.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she gasped between giggles. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that. It\u2019s no secret that H.I. will be up for sale soon. You can buy it outright when Dad retires. No fuss, no bother, no need to get married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cit would be a whole lot simpler that way.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell grunted. \u201cNever thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because business is not your forte, Mitch,\u201d Sullivan growled. \u201cIt was obvious right from the start that Gabe didn\u2019t need to marry Lillian to get his hands on Harte. All he has to do is wait a few years and do a buy-out.\u201d</p><p>Gabe wrapped his fingers around Lillian\u2019s wrist. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go someplace where we can discuss our private affairs in private.\u201d</p><p>He opened the porch door and led her outside into the bright afternoon light. Together they went down the path toward the rocky beach.</p><p>Neither of them spoke until they reached the bottom.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious about this?\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cNever been more serious in my life.\u201d He tightened his hand around hers. \u201cDid you mean it when you said you\u2019d marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But you don\u2019t have to give up a share of Harte Investments for me. I mean, I appreciate the grand gesture but it\u2019s not necessary. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He stopped and pulled her around to face him. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a Madison. A Madison does things like turn down the offer of a third of a multimillion-dollar company for the woman he loves. It\u2019s in the genes.\u201d</p><p>The woman he loves.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gabe.\u201d The brilliant colors of happiness splashed through her, effervescent and glorious. She went into his arms. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her.</p><p>Except for a few details such as the fact that they were on the beach, not on the bluffs, and she wasn\u2019t barefoot and there was no gossamer gown, the scene was just the way it had been in the romantic fantasy she had conjured up when she had set out to meet him on the path.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Sullivan surveyed the seating options in Mitchell\u2019s living room and chose the recliner that provided a view of the bay. He lowered himself into it with a long sigh and looked out at the water. The light was starting to go. He never liked this time of day.</p><p>\u201cWe came mighty close to screwing that up pretty bad, didn\u2019t we?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with this we business?\u201d Mitchell settled into the other well-worn recliner. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who damn near screwed things up. What the hell did you think you were doing trying to buy Gabe with a chunk of H.I.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me I was supposed to fix things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fix things between a Madison and a Harte with a business contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemed like the logical thing to do. Pretty clear that Lillian wanted him and I just wanted to encourage him to see the benefits of marriage to her.\u201d Sullivan stretched out his legs, wincing when his joints protested. \u201cHow do you stand this damp, cold weather all year long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to it. You\u2019ve gotten soft living down there in Arizona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot soft, smart. If you had any sense you\u2019d move to the desert, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it just fine here in Eclipse Bay.\u201d Mitchell rested his head against the back of the chair. \u201cYou figure to drive back to Portland tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad enough driving for one day. Knees stiffen up when I sit in a car for a long period of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know what you mean.\u201d Mitchell absently rubbed one of his own knees. \u201cOccurs to me that if you\u2019re gonna hang around town for a while, you might as well stay here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you stay at the cottage you\u2019ll get in the way of Gabe\u2019s courting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take you up on that offer. Don\u2019t want to interfere with the lovebirds.\u201d Sullivan chuckled.</p><p>Mitchell eyed him suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about what the folks in town will say when they find out that I\u2019m your houseguest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Sullivan grinned. \u201cProbably figure we\u2019ll try to knock each other\u2019s teeth out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s settled, maybe I should fill you in on some of the stuff that\u2019s been happening around here.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later Sullivan was ready to explode. \u201cWhy the hell wasn\u2019t I told about the break-ins? I didn\u2019t have a clue that Lillian was in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy. Like I just said, everything is under control. Gabe took care of Flint for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have been informed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe put the fire out before anyone realized just how big it was.\u201d Mitchell heaved himself up out of his chair. \u201cBryce will have dinner ready in a while. I generally have a glass or two of something beforehand.</p><p>As I recall, you used to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t changed.\u201d Sullivan watched the darkness close in over the bay. \u201cA little something at this time of day helps a man relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it does.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell went to a cabinet, hauled a bottle out of a cupboard and splashed whiskey into two glasses. He brought the two drinks back across the room and handed one to Sullivan without comment.</p><p>They drank their whiskeys and watched the darkness thicken outside the window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After all these years, Sullivan thought, it was good to sit here and share the twilight with the one other person in the world who understood why this was such a bad time of day.</p><p>\u201cThey say the memories fade as you get older,\u201d Mitchell said after a while.</p><p>\u201cThey lie.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p> <p>Lillian parked her car in the driveway behind Claire\u2019s red compact, got out and walked across the graveled drive toward the porch steps. All four doors and the lid of the compact\u2019s trunk were open wide.</p><p>Two suitcases and a file box occupied the trunk.</p><p>The front door of the house banged open just as she reached out to knock. Claire lurched forward, head down, onto the porch, struggling with an oversized suitcase. She was dressed in sweats and running shoes. Her hair was anchored in a ponytail.</p><p>The loud, strident voice of a radio talk-show host holding forth on politics poured out of the doorway behind her.</p><p>\u201cNeed a hand?\u201d Lillian asked above the hammering of the radio pundit.</p> <p>Claire jolted to a stop, breathing hard. She looked up quickly, startled.</p><p>\u201cLil.\u201d She let go of the suitcase. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t hear you drive up. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you were leaving town today. I came by to see if I could help with the packing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Claire looked at the compact\u2019s trunk and then down at the suitcase that she had angled through the doorway. \u201cI underestimated the job. Guess I hadn\u2019t realized how much stuff I had accumulated here in Eclipse Bay. I\u2019m taking the essentials with me in the car. The moving-van people will be here at two o\u2019clock for the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint me in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finished my office. I was just getting started on the bedroom and bath. If you want to take the kitchen, I would be forever grateful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Lillian moved through the doorway.</p><p>Claire followed her. She went to the table where the radio blared and turned off the political hot talk.</p><p>The sudden silence left an uncomfortable vacuum.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good friend,\u201d Claire declared. \u201cUnlike some others I could mention. You will notice how none of the other members of the team bothered to show. Turns out they all had something unexpected come up at the last minute. Why am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting fired from a political campaign staff endows you with instant invisibility. Did you know that?</p><p>Like being in the wrong crowd in high school.\u201d</p><p>Lillian cleared her throat. \u201cWhere are the packing cartons?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the laundry room off the kitchen. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>Lillian went toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s coffee on the counter,\u201d Claire called after her. \u201cAnd some croissants from Incandescent Body.</p><p>You know, that bakery is one of the few things I\u2019m going to miss about this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable. It\u2019s very good.\u201d</p><p>Lillian went into the kitchen and opened the cupboard doors. She did a quick survey of the contents of the cabinets, getting a feel for the size of the job, and then went into the laundry room to look for boxes.</p><p>The small space was crowded with the usual jumble of odds and ends that tend to wind up in laundry rooms. A long shelf above the aging washer and dryer held a collection of soap, bleach, and dryer-sheet packages, together with squeeze bottles of glass cleaner and stain remover. A mop and a broom were propped in a bucket in the corner. The basket on the floor next to it was filled with rags.</p><p>A selection of empty cardboard cartons was stacked on top of the washer and dryer. She chose two and went back into the kitchen. Methodically she began emptying Claire\u2019s cupboards.</p><p>Impulse had brought her here today. She did not know what she was looking for. She only hoped that she would know it when she saw it.</p><p>Half an hour later, the two cartons filled, she went out into the living room and down the hall to the room Claire had used as a second office. The desk and file cabinet were still there but they had been cleaned out.</p><p>Claire appeared in the hall, a box filled with bathroom items in her arms.</p><p>\u201cFinished with the kitchen already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need some strapping tape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the table in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done without you today.\u201d Claire went past her toward the front door. \u201cNext time you\u2019re in Seattle, give me a call. I\u2019ll take you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>She waited until Claire disappeared outside and then ducked into the bedroom. The closet doors and the drawers in the chest beneath the window stood open, making a quick search easy. She examined an array of shoes first. Ignoring the high heels and pumps, she looked for a familiar pair of loafers.</p><p>They were nowhere in sight. Maybe they had already been packed. She opened one of the unsealed cartons.</p><p>Claire\u2019s footsteps sounded on the porch. Adrenaline surged through Lillian, making her hand tremble.</p><p>This was pointless. She was wasting her time. She dropped the lid of the carton and hurried out of the bedroom. She started back along the hall.</p><p>Too late. Claire was already in the living room, looking at the strapping-tape device that rested on the coffee table. She turned and saw Lillian. A frown crossed her face.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you find the tape?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI stopped to use the bathroom.\u201d Lillian kept moving. She went to the coffee table and picked up the tape. Her pulse was pounding. \u201cI\u2019m almost finished with the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and made herself walk briskly but not too briskly back into the kitchen. She knelt beside the cartons and went to work sealing them.</p><p>Claire\u2019s footsteps receded back down the hall toward the bedroom.</p><p>Lillian wondered if her heart would ever stop pounding. Clearly she was not cut out for this kind of thing.</p><p>But there would never be a better opportunity to satisfy her curiosity.</p><p>She finished taping the boxes, got to her feet and went back into the laundry room for more cartons. Her pulse had finally slowed. She moved two large boxes aside to get at the medium-sized one that looked right for the contents of the silverware drawer.</p><p>She noticed the crumpled piece of navy blue cloth on top of the rag basket when she put the boxes down beside it. The blue fabric was not faded or torn. It looked new.</p><p>It looked familiar. She had an artist\u2019s eye for colors. She remembered them.</p><p>Her pulse picked up speed again. Her heart was pounding now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t get too excited. Probably nothing. Just a rag.</p><p>Cautiously she reached into the basket, picked up the wad of navy blue cloth and shook it out. It was the shirt Claire had worn the day she had stopped by the cottage to warn her that Marilyn still wanted Gabe.</p><p>There did not appear to be anything wrong with the garment. No rips or holes that would have explained how it had come to be relegated to the rag pile. Could have fallen out of the laundry hamper by accident, she thought.</p><p>She flipped the shirt around to examine the back.</p> <p>The smear of dried red paint on the right cuff made her go cold.</p><p>\u201cOh, damn,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She had come here this morning on the off chance that she might get some answers. Be careful what you wish for.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing in here?\u201d Claire came to stand in the doorway of the laundry room. \u201cNeed more boxes? I\u2019ve got some\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off at the sight of the navy blue shirt dangling from Lillian\u2019s fingers. Her eyes went to the paint-stained cuff.</p> <p>\u201cIt was you who trashed my studio.\u201d Lillian put the shirt down on the washer. \u201cI knew there had to be some evidence somewhere. It\u2019s almost impossible to work with a lot of paint and not get some on your clothes.\u201d</p><p>The blood drained from Claire\u2019s face. She swallowed twice before she managed to speak.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t prove anything,\u201d she stammered. \u201cYou can\u2019t prove a damn thing, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. Unless, of course, you kept the VPX 5000. But I\u2019m sure you had enough sense to ditch it. Did you throw it into the bay? That\u2019s what I did with my client files.\u201d</p><p>Claire eyes filled with tears. She seemed to collapse in on herself.</p><p>\u201cThere was no need to injure Arizona,\u201d Lillian said. \u201cShe had nothing to do with this. Do you realize what might have happened if you had hit her even a little bit harder? She\u2019s an elderly woman, Claire. You could have killed her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it but I had no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo choice? What are you talking about. No one made you hit her and steal her camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to get the camera.\u201d Claire\u2019s hands knotted into fists at her sides. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? She had pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPictures of you breaking into my cottage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see her until I left. I had parked my car in the woods nearby. But when I started to drive away, I saw her truck parked on the opposite side of the road. She wasn\u2019t in it so I knew she was probably nearby conducting her idiotic surveillance rounds. I was afraid she might have spotted me coming out of your cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Claire, you know as well as I do that it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if she had noticed you in the vicinity of the cottage. No one ever pays any attention to A.Z.\u2019s claims and theories. Everyone knows she\u2019s a little weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she came out of the woods a short time later she was carrying that damn camera. I panicked. Of course, no one would have listened if she had claimed to see me near your cottage on the day a break-in was reported. Everyone knows she\u2019s paranoid about people who work at the institute. But they sure as hell would have paid attention if she had produced some time-and-date-stamped photos of me coming out the back door of your place with a tire iron in my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou followed her home, waiting for an opportunity to take the VPX 5000 from her, didn\u2019t you? She knew that she was being tailed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI watched her for a while but I realized that sooner or later she would go back to that fortress. I got there ahead of her, hid the car in the trees and waited on her back porch behind the woodshed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planned to attack her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Claire wiped away her tears with the back of her hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t know exactly what I was going to do. I couldn\u2019t think straight. I guess I had some vague idea of catching her off guard when she went into the house. I just wanted to get that camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut something made her walk around the porch to check the rear door. You saw your chance, grabbed the plant stand and hit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to put her into the hospital.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice rose on an anguished wail. \u201cYou have to believe me. I just wanted to knock her down. Make her drop the camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave her a concussion, Claire. You could have killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I never meant to hurt her.\u201d Claire sniffed. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, you can\u2019t prove that I took the camera. Just your word against mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Lillian leaned back against the dryer and gripped the white metal edge on either side. \u201cAnd since its just us girls talking here, I\u2019ve got some questions. What gave you the idea of going after my client files in the first place? Did you come up with it all on your own or was it something Anderson said?\u201d</p><p>Rage infused Claire\u2019s face. She turned a shade of red that rivaled the paint on the shirt.</p><p>\u201cFlint. I heard that bastard tell Marilyn about your files the day he came to see her at the institute. He actually bragged about them to her. He used them to talk his way into my job . Promised her he could get them for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to give credit where it\u2019s due. Marilyn is no fool. She understood the value of those files immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Anderson tell her he planned to steal them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. He just said he was working an angle to get them. Told her not to worry. He\u2019d handle all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you when they had that conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was packing up my desk in the adjoining office. Marilyn closed the door but I simply switched on the recording system.\u201d Claire smiled bitterly. \u201cThat was one of my jobs, you know. Recording Marilyn\u2019s meetings and conversations with important people. She plans to publish her memoirs someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater you decided to see if you could find my client files before Flint got to them, right?\u201d</p><p>Claire shrugged. \u201cHe said they were on your computer. Sounded easy enough. I could have used them the same way Flint planned to use them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo buy your way into another job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The data on your high-end clients would be worth a fortune to any candidate in the Northwest.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in Claire\u2019s eyes again. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t find your computer when I broke into the cottage.</p><p>And there was Arizona with her damned camera when I came out. Everything went wrong. All that risk for nothing. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat day you stopped by the cottage to warn me to watch out for Marilyn, you overheard my conversation with Gabe when he was on his way back from Portland. You learned that we had concluded I might be the target of a stalker. That made you very nervous, didn\u2019t it? You realized that we were no longer dismissing the break-in as the action of a transient. So you came back to trash my studio to add some credibility to our theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got scared. Really scared. This is Eclipse Bay. I knew that if a Harte and a Madison were putting pressure on Sean Valentine, he might actually conduct a serious investigation. I didn\u2019t know where that would lead. I thought that I would be safe if everyone continued to blame the break-in on a stalker who could conveniently just disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Claire.\u201d Lillian shook her head. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>The bitterness tinged Claire\u2019s voice. \u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you could say it was a process of elimination. Gabe and a private investigator cleared the only real potential stalker we had on our list. When we talked to Anderson, he denied the break-ins here in Eclipse Bay. Adamantly.\u201d</p><p>Claire widened in scorn. \u201cAnd you actually believed that bag of sleaze?\u201d</p><p>Lillian shrugged. \u201cThe forced entry didn\u2019t fit with what I knew about him. Anderson is the sort who tries to talk his way in and out of situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Marilyn? She should have been on your list. She was the one who had the most to gain from those files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing about Marilyn is that she is very up-front about what she wants. She doesn\u2019t sneak around.</p> <p>You, on the other hand, have a history of sneaking around.\u201d</p><p>Claire flinched. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was right when she said that you had an affair with Trevor Thornley, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I never slept with Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Claire watched her warily. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I found out that you were sneaking around with Larry Fulton in the back of his father\u2019s van the summer that he and I were dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarry Fulton.\u201d Claire\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cBut that was years ago. We were in college .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was pretty sure that he was fooling around with someone else that summer. I just hadn\u2019t realized that the other woman was you. The Willis brothers set me straight a few days ago. They gave me a whole new perspective on you, Claire. Once I started asking the right questions, things fell into place.\u201d</p><p>Claire backed out of the laundry room, never taking her eyes off Lillian. \u201cYou can\u2019t prove anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying that.\u201d Lillian came away from the washer. \u201cI\u2019m not arguing the point. I came here today for some answers, not to get you arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d Lillian crossed the living room, paused at the front door and looked back over her shoulder. \u201cJust one more question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, get out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told me that Trevor was into high heels and ladies\u2019 lingerie and that his tastes would be a real turnoff. Can I assume you lied about that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated the dressing up part,\u201d Claire explained. \u201cBut the man was on track to be a U.S. senator. I figured I could overlook a few eccentricities if it meant I would be a senator\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he really tell you that he would divorce Marilyn and marry you after he was elected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe promised.\u201d Claire looked down at the blue shirt crumpled in her hands. \u201cJust like Larry Fulton promised we would get engaged after he broke up with you. Nothing ever works out the way it\u2019s supposed to. It not fair, you know? It\u2019s just not fair.\u201d</p><p>Gabe prowled back and forth across the cottage kitchen. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have confronted her on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned that several times already.\u201d Lillian propped her elbows on the kitchen table and rested her chin in her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve explained that I went there on impulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she had turned violent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe, she knows I can\u2019t prove anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess this is one of those situations where you have to let karma happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKarma never happens to people like her. Karma is bullshit. The Claires of this world always skate.\u201d</p><p>Lillian looked out the window. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that Claire has done a lot of skating in her life. She said that things have never worked out for her. None of her big plans ever jelled. Larry Fulton and I broke up but he didn\u2019t marry her. He married Sheila. Trevor Thornley crashed and burned, so she didn\u2019t get to marry him and become a senator\u2019s wife. She lost her job with Marilyn\u2019s campaign. All and all, Claire hasn\u2019t been what anyone would call a winner.\u201d</p><p>They drove into town for warm croissants and coffee the next morning. Gabe parked in the lot in front of Incandescent Body. He studied the warmly lit interior of the bakery through the windows. A handful of people were clustered inside. The array of vehicles standing in the rain outside included Mitchell\u2019s big SUV, Arizona\u2019s aging truck and Sean Valentine\u2019s cruiser.</p><p>\u201cLooks a little cozy in there,\u201d he said. \u201cWant to go somewhere else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThere is nowhere else where we can get croissants like the ones they make here.\u201d Lillian pulled up the hood of her rain cloak and reached for the door handle. \u201cCome on, we can deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Reluctantly he opened the driver\u2019s side door. \u201cIt\u2019s a little early for a Harte-Madison scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Never too early for one of those.\u201d</p><p>He hunched deeper into his jacket and walked quickly beside her through the drizzle to the entrance.</p><p>He opened the glass door and immediately registered the serious tone of the atmosphere inside. The buzz of conversation was more intense than usual. His first thought was that the sight of Mitchell and Sullivan sharing coffee together had electrified the gossip circuit. But then he realized that no one was paying much attention to the pair, who were seated at a small table with Bryce and Sean.</p><p>Predictably, everyone looked toward the door when it opened. Lillian pushed back the hood of her cloak and bestowed a bright smile on the crowd. Gabe nodded brusquely and headed for the counter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He needed some coffee before he dealt with Mitchell and Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked the Herald who took their orders for croissants and corn bread.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d</p><p>Before she could explain, the curtain opened behind her. Arizona leaned out and beckoned urgently.</p> <p>\u201cCome on back here, you two,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI\u2019ll brief you along with the others.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked at Mitchell and Sullivan. They had resumed their conversation with Sean. He was in no great rush to join them, he thought. One of Arizona\u2019s briefings promised to be a lot more entertaining. He glanced at Lillian. She shrugged and turned to go behind the counter.</p><p>He picked up his corn bread and followed her.</p><p>A familiar group of Heralds, including Photon, was gathered at the large worktable. They nodded somberly when Lillian and Gabe joined them.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Morning,\u201d Gabe said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Lillian asked.</p><p>Arizona rapped a rolling pin on the floured table. \u201cA very interesting development has just occurred.</p><p>Course, the mainstream media and the local authorities, including Sean Valentine, have bought into the cover story being handed out by the gang up at the institute. But that\u2019s only to be expected.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cPoor dupes.\u201d</p><p>Gabe propped one shoulder against the wall and savored a bite of warm corn bread. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficial version is that Claire Jensen was injured in a single-car accident on her way out of town yesterday. She\u2019s in the Eclipse Bay hospital as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens.\u201d Lillian stared at Arizona. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSean says she\u2019s pretty banged up but she\u2019ll be okay. He investigated the crash. Said she was driving like a bat outta hell in the rain. Took a curve way too fast. But we all know the truth.\u201d</p><p>Heads nodded around the table.</p><p>Lillian cleared her throat. \u201cUh, what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious. She must have seen somethin\u2019 she wasn\u2019t supposed to see up there at the institute.</p><p>Probably stumbled into the underground lab. They faked an accident to try to get rid of her. Lucky for her they botched the job.\u201d</p><p>Lillian looked at Gabe. \u201cAnd you say you don\u2019t believe in karma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stand corrected,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cLearn something new everyday.\u201d</p><p>He took her arm and steered her back through the curtain into the main room. Several pairs of eyes followed them as they made their way to the small table where Mitchell and Sullivan sat with Bryce and Sean.</p> <p>Lillian leaned down to give Sullivan a kiss on his cheek. \u201c \u2019Morning, Granddad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, honey.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded at Mitchell and Sullivan. \u201cGlad to see that the two of you didn\u2019t knock each other\u2019s teeth out last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you get to be this age,\u201d Sullivan said, \u201cyou have to think twice about risking your teeth. Not that many good ones left.\u201d</p><p>She greeted the others and sat down beside Sullivan.</p><p>\u201cArizona give you her version of the accident?\u201d Mitchell asked Gabe.</p><p>Gabe set his coffee and partially eaten corn bread down on the table and took one of the chairs. \u201cAll part of the big conspiracy up at the institute, according to A.Z.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan chuckled.</p><p>\u201cGot to admit that her take on local news is always a lot more interesting than mine,\u201d Sean allowed.</p><p>\u201cSo it was an accident?\u201d Lillian asked.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Sean took a bite out of a large, jelly-filled pastry. \u201cShe must have been in a real hurry to get out of town. Had to be doing seventy when she took that curve out by the Erickson place.\u201d</p><p>Bryce shook his head in solemn disapproval. \u201cEveryone knows that\u2019s a real bad curve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe medics who pulled her out of the car said she was spittin\u2019 mad when they got to her.\u201d Sean swallowed the bite of pastry and reached for his coffee. \u201cKept saying something about how unfair it all was.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>On the night of the reception at the Eclipse Bay branch of the Bright Visions Gallery, Sullivan stood with Mitchell, a glass of champagne in his hand, and watched the large crowd ebb and flow around Lillian and her paintings. Warm pride flowed through him.</p><p>\u201cNot like it was in Portland last week,\u201d Mitchell observed. \u201cOnly press here is from the Journal. But, what the heck, Eclipse Bay isn\u2019t exactly the art capital of the western world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortland was all about publicity and media coverage,\u201d Sullivan reminded him. \u201cIt worked just like Octavia Brightwell said it would. It introduced Lillian to important collectors and the museum and gallery crowd. But this event is special for Eclipse Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re lovin\u2019 it.\u201d Mitchell grinned. \u201cLook at \u2019em, all dressed up and swilling champagne. I doubt if a lot of these folks know much about art, but they\u2019re sure having a good time.\u201d</p><p>The throng that filled the gallery was composed largely of local townsfolk. Everyone from the Willis brothers to the strangely dressed group from Incandescent Body had turned out. Sullivan had a hunch that it wasn\u2019t a keen interest in art that had brought so many of the residents of Eclipse Bay out on a wet night. The driving motivation for this crowd was its lively curiosity about Hartes and Madisons. Everyone knew that both families would be in town for the event and they were all well aware that Gabe and Lillian were engaged.</p><p>The free drinks and hors d\u2019oeuvres were just icing on the cake as far as most folks were concerned tonight.</p><p>\u201cWho would have thought that a Harte would turn out to be an artist?\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>\u201cWho would have believed that anyone in your family could create a profitable business like Madison Commercial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta say that Octavia sure knows how to give a party.\u201d Mitchell helped himself to a cheese canap\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cFirst class all the way, too. Lot of people here tonight wouldn\u2019t have noticed or cared if she had served cheap champagne and second-rate food. But she pulled out all the stops, same as she did for the Portland crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing respect for the locals.\u201d Sullivan nodded. \u201cVery smart. Good public relations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a smart young woman. But she\u2019s real, too, if you know what I mean. She didn\u2019t put on this bash just for publicity purposes. She did it because she really wanted to show folks that she appreciates them as much as she does the Portland crowd.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sullivan took a sip of his champagne. \u201cI\u2019ll buy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help noticing that she and your grandson, Nick, are having themselves a mighty serious conversation over there.\u201d</p> <p>Sullivan followed his gaze, searching for the pair over the heads of the crowd. He spotted Nick, dressed in formal black and white, standing with Octavia on the far side of the gallery.</p><p>The conversation looked more than serious, he thought. It had a close, intimate quality. Nick had one hand casually flattened on the wall behind Octavia\u2019s head. He leaned slightly in toward her, his broad shoulders angled in a way that subtly but effectively cut her off from the crowd around them. Sullivan recognized the body language and knew that every other man in the room understood it too, if only on a subconscious level. It was a clear statement of possession, a this-woman-is-mine-tonight message.</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHere we go again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it, if I were you,\u201d Mitchell said cheerfully. \u201cLike I said, Octavia\u2019s a nice young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed hair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what? You got a problem with red hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something familiar about her, Mitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen her before. She attended Hannah and Rafe\u2019s wedding. And you met her at the Portland reception last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean something really familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe red hair, the profile. The way she holds herself. Take a good look, man. She remind you of anyone?\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell studied Octavia for a long time.</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn,\u201d he said at last. \u201cShe\u2019s a dead ringer, isn\u2019t she? Funny, I never noticed before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight explain why you took to her right off, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shoot and damn,\u201d Mitchell said again, this time sounding dazed. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cBut I figure this isn\u2019t a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d An expression of bemused wonder gleamed in Mitchell\u2019s eyes. \u201cNo coincidence. Tell you one thing, Nick better behave himself with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat business is it of yours, how he behaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOctavia\u2019s alone in the world. No family to protect her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to take on the job, is that it?\u201d Sullivan asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta do it. That grandson of yours has a reputation for playing it fast and loose with the ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just hasn\u2019t found the right woman to take Amelia\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay I hear it, he\u2019s not lookin\u2019 real hard for a wife,\u201d Mitchell observed. \u201cSeems like he prefers a more casual arrangement with his lady friends, one that doesn\u2019t involve rings and a ceremony and a commitment. I hear tell they call him Hardhearted Harte in some circles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, my grandson\u2019s love life isn\u2019t any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him take advantage of Octavia, got that?\u201d Mitchell set his jaw. \u201cShe\u2019s not gonna be just another one of his short-term flings. You better set him real straight on that score or there\u2019ll be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>Glumly, Sullivan studied the pair on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cThis could get complicated,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSure could.\u201d</p><p>Sullivan didn\u2019t know precisely what Mitchell was thinking, but he was willing to bet his companion was recalling the same scene he himself remembered so well. It was a scene out of their shared past: an eerie, unsettling memory of the day a flame-haired woman in a short skirt and high heels opened the door of their little office on Bay Street and told them she would make them both very rich.</p><p>They both stared, fascinated at Octavia. No doubt about it, Sullivan thought, she bore an uncanny resemblance to Claudia Banner, the mysterious creature who had blazed through their lives all those years ago, singed them both badly and turned their world upside down before she disappeared with the assets of Harte-Madison.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Octavia Brightwell and what is she up to here in Eclipse Bay?\u201d he asked very quietly.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>She listened to him climb the stairs and walk down the hall toward her studio. She continued to clean her brushes. His strides were easy, smooth, full of purpose and determination. A lot of the essence of Gabe Madison was distilled in the way he moved.</p><p>She put down the brushes and went to open the door. He came to a halt in front of her. He had left his jacket in the car and removed his cuff links. The collar of his charcoal-gray shirt was open, the silver-and-black striped tie loose around his neck. He was not smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d She stood on tiptoe to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cUmmm.\u201d He wrapped an arm around her when she made to pull back, holding her close for a long, slow, blood-warming kiss.</p><p>When he finally released her she was flushed and breathless. She saw the lazy, sexy gleam in his eyes and knew that she wasn\u2019t the only one who had been affected by the embrace.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I needed that,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a hell of an afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitchell, Sullivan, and your father all arrived unannounced in my office two hours ago, just as I was thinking of leaving early for the day. It was nothing short of an ambush.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>He did not answer immediately. Instead he went to stand in front of her newest creation, an unfinished portrait of her mother and her grandmother and herself. The three figures were arranged around Eclipse Arch. They looked out at the viewer with steady gazes, each woman bringing the perspective of her particular phase of life to the scene, each silently acknowledging her links to the other two.</p><p>Gabe studied the picture.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re good,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou really are good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but you\u2019re avoiding the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a CEO. I\u2019ve got a natural aptitude for avoiding unpleasant subjects.\u201d</p><p>She did not like the sound of this. \u201cWhat did they want, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey presented a new business proposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was sort of my response, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to do a merger.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. It took her a few seconds to get her tongue untied. \u201cA merger? You mean of Madison Commercial and Harte Investments?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn equal exchange of stock between the companies.

I would be the CEO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways, there is a lot to be said for the deal,\u201d Gabe continued, sounding as if he was reading from an investor\u2019s prospectus. \u201cIt would double the assets of the company overnight. It would allow us to extend the range and scope of our activities. It would give us the opportunity to provide extended management and consulting services to our clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d She felt the laughter bubble up inside and hastily clapped a hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt is also of course, my worst nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that.\u201d She gave up the attempt to swallow her laughter. \u201cThe very thought of having to ride herd on a board of directors and a group of stockholders composed entirely of Hartes and Madisons would be enough to strike terror into the heart of any prudent, cautious, sensible CEO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a Madison.
