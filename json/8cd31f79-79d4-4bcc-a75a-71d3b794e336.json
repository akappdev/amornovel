I was in the process of straightening a row of colorful vials. I dusted in between all the potions and was now making sure they were astutely lined up like well-behaved soldiers.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to look up to know that, Aiden Blake, the most infuriating vampire I\u2019d ever met, had just stepped into my shop. I could feel his presence, as if a big flashing arrow was pointing straight to him. I watched him through the glass shelves and shifted my eyes when his gaze met mine. A smile grew on his perfectly kissable lips.</p><p>I couldn't deny that he was gorgeous. He was around six foot two with jet-black hair framing his face, that he often worn a little long. His bright blue eyes seemed to watch me with too much interest and his presence oozed with sex appeal. He\u2019d been overly interested in me since I met him, two years ago. He wasn\u2019t easy to ignore.</p> <p>I straightened the last of the potions and looked in his direction again; he was sniffing the lavender oil and closing his eyes in pleasure. It just so happened I wore lavender oil, so the gesture didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Deciding I would put an end to his games, I stood up and walked around the display shelf.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Aiden?\u201d I asked, nonchalantly. He put the stopper back in the lavender bottle and walked, with all the confidence in the world, to where I stood with my arms crossed. It wasn\u2019t easy pretending that seeing him again was no big deal.</p><p>He had the body of a swimmer, thin but muscular. He was dressed in his usual business attire, although it didn\u2019t slip my notice that the top two buttons on his shirt were undone, as if to showcase his perfectly chiseled chest.</p><p>\u201cI was in the neighborhood so I thought I\u2019d stop by,\u201d he said, his sly smile giving him away. My shop catered to many folks, but Aiden wasn\u2019t my target customer. He hadn\u2019t come here to check out my potions or enchanted knick-knacks; he\u2019d come for me.</p><p>\u201cI call bullshit. I\u2019m about to close shop; what do you want?\u201d I asked again as I walked over to flip the closed sign on the front door. I could feel his eyes watching my backside but I decided not to tense up. I didn\u2019t want him the satisfaction of knowing he got to me.</p> <p>\u201cAs clever as ever, Gwen,\u201d he said, with humor in his voice. \u201cIt would make me immensely happy if you would accompany me to the Founders Gala this weekend.\u201d Although I rarely saw it, nervousness showed in his eyes. He had been pursuing me for the past couple of years and I always came up with an excuse as to why I couldn\u2019t date him, but his perseverance was astounding. Now it was my turn to grin, I knew he was uncomfortable at the thought of being turned down yet again, but I assumed that was why he kept coming around; he never met a female he couldn\u2019t seduce. If I were smart, I would say yes and we\u2019d enjoy the evening, flirting and dancing, and then he\u2019d leave me alone. But I couldn\u2019t bring myself to get involved with anyone at the moment, even if that someone was as mouth-watering as Aiden Blake.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your offer, really, but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I told him as politely as I could. The man had his pride, after all, and I wasn\u2019t going to be responsible for trampling all over it.</p><p>\u201cAm I too late? Has someone else already asked you?\u201d He inquired, revealing the tightness in his jaw. He was trying really hard not to be offended.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re the first,\u201d I told him as I deposited the till from the register into a moneybag. I risked looking up at him and felt a warm blush color my cheeks. Boy was he beautiful. My relationship with Micah had left me with trust issues. I didn\u2019t want to get my heart broken again. He walked over to where I stood behind the counter and leaned on his forearms. His aura sizzled all around me, like tendrils of pure male energy poking and prodding my flesh.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I protested. A soft chuckle escaped his lips but I refused to return it; the man got off by messing with me.</p><p>\u201cA woman as beautiful as you should have an equally beautiful man to accompany her to the Gala,\u201d he said. I had been totaling the store\u2019s intake and was on my third try of trying not to lose my count. I could feel his eyes on me so I temporarily abandoned the money and gave him all of my attention, hoping he\u2019d leave sooner.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019ll be sure to find one,\u201d I said with a smile. He grabbed his chest as if a stake had gone straight through his heart and despite my annoyance, I laughed. I rolled my eyes at his pathetic charades and walked around the counter to grab his arm and escort him to the front door. I held the door open and waited for him to get the hint, but he hesitated to leave. My eyes roamed the store, as if I suddenly had the urge to inventory everything to my memory. I was trying desperately to conceal that being this close to him set every one of my nerve endings on fire.</p><p>He leaned down slowly; his lips just hovering above my forehead, and softly pressed his lips against my skin. I momentarily closed my eyes at his touch but quickly regained my composure and pushed him out the door. \u201cNight, Aiden,\u201d I called over my shoulder as the door slammed shut. I could hear his amused laughter as I walked back to the office.</p><p>I lived only five miles from my shop, Broomsticks, with my best friend and roommate, Fiona. Our apartment wasn\u2019t the nicest but very affordable and that\u2019s all we cared about. I pushed through the front door, which had a tendency to jam, and almost fell over Aura, my cat and familiar.</p><p>\u201cSorry, girl,\u201d I said as I leaned down to pet her. Aura wasn\u2019t actually a cat. She was a spirit that assumed the body of a beautiful black Persian in order to serve as my assistant, also known as a witch\u2019s familiar.</p><p>She meowed and whipped her tail as if to tell me she didn\u2019t appreciate me almost toppling over her. Did I mention she\u2019s a grumpy spirit?</p><p>Our apartment looked like every other crappy unit. I tried sprucing it up when I moved in several years earlier, but the new items didn\u2019t fool anyone. The kitchen was painted a grayish-blue and our kitchen table sat against a small window overlooking the street. White appliances gleamed in contrast against the blue walls and a small, globe light hung from the ceiling. Linoleum that was supposed to look like tile covered the floors. I could have used magic to make the apartment immaculate but I felt that was wrong. I wanted to earn my nice things, not create them out of thin air.</p><p>I set my purse and a bag on the kitchen table and made my way into the living room. Fiona was reading a magazine while the vacuum and duster circled around her, cleaning the room.</p><p>\u201cWorking hard I see,\u201d I remarked with a smile. Fiona definitely loved being a witch; she used magic for everything, even something as simple as vacuuming and dusting.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not messing up my manicure to chase dust bunnies,\u201d she replied. Fiona was the epitome of a diva. Her nails were always done; her closet stocked with high-priced fashions, and she would bite your head off if you touched her granola bars. I had learned that one the hard way. We\u2019d been friends since we were teens though, so I was used to her high maintenance attitude. She came from a wealthy family, although they were not close, aside from providing her with money.</p><p>Our living room was painted in a sage green and our sofas were a dark tan and purchased from a neighbor woman who moved out. They weren\u2019t very old, but they weren\u2019t new either. A large coffee table dominated the middle of the floor, and on the far end of the room, a flat screen television hung on the wall. The carpet was an off-white Berber that had a few stains, probably unnoticed by most, but my eyes always seemed to find them. The two windows in this room bathed the small space with a decent amount of sunlight.</p><p>Fiona smelled one of those perfume samples you find in magazines, when she looked over the top of it and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cYou got a package today. Something you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019d I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>I turned to walk down the small hallway that led to my bedroom on one side and Fiona\u2019s on the other and gasped when I opened my door. My room was filled with flowers and a white garment box sat on my bed, as if silently waiting for me to open it.</p><p>My bedroom barely contained my queen-sized bed but I had refused to downsize to a twin when I moved in. My bed took up one wall, while my closet with mirrored doors occupied the other wall. I painted the walls a warm tan and laid an area rug to cover a large stain on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the...?\u201d</p><p>Tall black vases with long stem white and red roses decorated almost every square inch of my floor while small bowls of pink and red roses sat on my dresser and desk. I looked back at Fiona as if she were responsible for my room being turned into a rose garden.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a card,\u201d she happily remarked, pointing to the box. In a state of extreme confusion, I walked over to retrieve the card. I wasn\u2019t currently dating anyone and hadn\u2019t been for at least eight months. There was only one guy, one sexy vampire, who\u2019d been making advances on me. My suspicions were confirmed when I flipped open the card.</p><p>Gwen,</p><p>Thought you should know I was thinking about you and that I\u2019m very much looking forward to having the most beautiful woman on my arm at the Founders Gala this weekend. See you Saturday at 8 p.m.</p><p>Love Aiden</p><p>A blush rushed to my cheeks as I thought about Aiden\u2019s maddening methods. I was almost afraid to see what was in the box, although I had a pretty good idea. I untied the red satin bow and lifted the lid to reveal a royal blue, strapless dress. The bodice was intricately detailed with Swarovski crystals, and it looked like it would outline every inch of my curves.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start dating Aiden?\u201d Fiona asked, after swiping the card out of my hand. She sounded hurt that I hadn\u2019t gushed about my new beau to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dating Aiden, this is just a ploy to get me to go to the Founders Gala with him,\u201d I explained. Damn him, he knew how to tempt a girl. I was dangerously close to falling for his white knight tactics.</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you? I mean he\u2019s gorgeous and he\u2019s loaded, what\u2019s not to love?\u201d Fiona said flippantly, while reading the label on the dress. I shook my head at how shallow she could sometimes be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After deciding not to answer her question, because honestly, she wouldn\u2019t get why I wanted to avoid someone as charming and sexy as Aiden, I changed the subject. \u201cWhen did all this arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes before you got home. Grace Parker stopped by to set it up.\u201d Grace Parker owned Vines, a floral shop on Main Street. She\u2019s an elf, so must have used her nature magic to arrange all the roses so quickly. That meant that Aiden set this up even after I had told him no. Like I said, he\u2019s infuriating.</p><p>\u201cWho are you going to the Founder\u2019s Gala with?\u201d I asked. Flora was a small town, with a population of only a thousand, all strictly otherworldly residents. The humans had accepted us, but still demanded segregation. Flora sat in the countryside of Missouri where magic permitted anyone human from entering, except during the Founder\u2019s Gala, once a year. The humans thought of it as a tourist attraction.</p> <p>Most humans had come to terms with us, but some were still threatened by our differences. We opened our boundaries to humans who filled out applications prior to visiting. This year, we had a whopping two hundred human tourists planning to visit this special weekend.</p><p>\u201cLiam,\u201d Fiona said with a satisfied smile. I should have known, Liam Fawns, a bigwig warlock that works with the board of Flora trustees. He and four other people were the creators of our little sanctuary, and he\u2019d be one of the guests of honor this weekend.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were on that good of speaking terms with Liam,\u201d I told her. She grabbed a hanger out of my closet and hung the dress Aiden had gotten me, as if she couldn\u2019t stand for it to sit for one more minute in that cramped box.</p><p>\u201cDaddy set it up,\u201d she said nonchalantly, but I knew the relationship with her parents bothered her. Hearing her mention her father was more surprising than hearing that she was taking one of the founders to the Gala.</p><p>\u201cOh, you talked to your dad?\u201d I tried to sound indifferent but my eyes betrayed me.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he called yesterday. Gave me some crap about how I\u2019m too old to still be living with a roommate and that I should have a husband. You know how he is,\u201d she said with a shake of her head.</p><p>Boy did I ever! Old money and old-fashioned, that was Fiona\u2019s father. Fiona and I were both twenty-six, not exactly spinsters, but in his eyes, she should have been married and settled down already? What did that say about me? He had blown a gasket when he found out his daughter was living in my apartment, being that it was only nine hundred square feet and needed some repairs. But Fiona insisted and decided to move in with me anyway. Sure she was shallow sometimes, okay most of the time, but she was also a great friend and wouldn\u2019t take crap from anyone, including her overbearing parents.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t like...an arranged marriage is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Fiona turned to look at me as if I\u2019d lost the last of my marbles and instantly began laughing hysterically.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, but it\u2019s not that far of a stretch, I mean we are talking about your father,\u201d I said, defending my comment. Fiona was still laughing as she left my bedroom and returned to the living room.</p><p>Now what was I going to do with a room buried in flowers?</p> <p>I decided that I\u2019d surprise Aiden, like he\u2019d done to me. I sent my magic to each one of the flowers and imagined Aiden\u2019s home. I imagined his posh two-story house that sat atop a hill ten minutes from mine and willed the roses to return to sender. One by one, the flowers popped out of my bedroom and hopefully showed up at Aiden\u2019s. I wasn\u2019t the best at transporting objects, but I assumed most would make the trip.</p><p>I kept just one of the small bowls of roses and the dress, sending the rest back. Then I sent a text message that read, \u201cThanx 4 respecting my decision to NOT go W/U 2 the Gala. It was generous of u 2 get me such a beautiful dress, I\u2019m sure my date will appreciate it.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to know that I was going to the Gala solo; I\u2019d let him stew over my imaginary date.</p><p>2</p><p>WITCH FOUND DRAINED, the newspaper headline announced. I read the article three times, hoping my eyes were playing tricks on me. Unfortunately, they weren\u2019t. Amy Harper\u2019s body was found yesterday night in a ditch, all of her blood drained. The FPD (Flora Police Department) was currently investigating and hadn\u2019t found any clues as to who was behind the grisly murder. They made a point to say that the citizens of Flora should not jump to conclusions, they hadn\u2019t determined if this was a single case or if they had a serial killer on their hands.</p><p>I threw the paper on my desk, disgusted. Of course, the FPD\u2019s collective mind wouldn\u2019t be made up until another death occurred. Why was it that no one ever took precautions until the body count started piling up?</p><p>I had been living in Flora since I was nineteen and had only known of eight murders. You would think with all of the otherworldly creatures living together, there would be more violence, but surprisingly, there wasn\u2019t. The murder of Amy Harper though, left my blood frozen in my veins. The other murders in the past seven years had been normal, if there was such a thing. They\u2019d occurred between scorned lovers or rivaling thugs. The death of Amy Harper seemed different. I didn\u2019t think this was a lover\u2019s quarrel or had anything to do with the crowd she hung around.</p><p>I really hated what I was about to do, but knew I had to. I picked up the phone and hesitated, my fingers positioned over the numbers. Overcoming my unease, I dialed the FPD\u2019s phone number.</p><p>\u201cFPD,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice answered. I had a quick impulse to hang up but I knew that would be pointless; they would have logged my phone number as soon as the call went through.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d the woman asked again, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cUm, hi. My name is Gwen Sparks. I\u2019m calling for Micah Reynolds please,\u201d I told the woman.</p><p>\u201cHold please.\u201d She transferred the call and, I swore, my heart sped up with each ring that went unanswered. Micah and I had dated a year earlier, but he broke up with me because I wasn\u2019t the right species. His father, the alpha of the Flora weres, had been pressuring him to find a were woman, and advised him not to waste his time on someone who couldn\u2019t give him purebred were children. The last I heard, he was dating a beautiful were woman and there was talk of them getting married. I really hated having to talk to him again.</p><p>\u201cMicah Reynolds,\u201d his masculine voice answered.</p><p>I took a deep breath to calm my nerves, \u201cHi Micah, it\u2019s Gwen.\u201d There was a moment of silence, finally breaking when he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Gwen?\u201d he asked, clearly uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI saw the paper and I want to help,\u201d I confessed. Back when Micah and I were dating, I worked on a couple cases as a consultant. I could use my magic to see glimpses of a victim\u2019s last thoughts, with the help of Aura, she\u2019s my link to the spirit world. I had</p><p>helped Micah close two cases.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, Gwen,\u201d Micah said tentatively.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019m the only one who might be able to find out who and why Amy Harper was killed. Don\u2019t let our personal history get in the way of finding this asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to get it approved by Wyatt,\u201d he said, seemingly giving in to my demands. A smile slowly formed on my lips, Wyatt was Micah\u2019s brother and always liked me.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019ll agree to it; he loves me. What time should I meet you at the morgue?\u201d I said smugly.</p><p>Micah took a deep breath, \u201cAn hour. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d He hung up the phone and I did the same. I loved when things went my way.</p><p>I was fifteen minutes early, but I didn\u2019t want to give Micah a reason to deny my help on the case. I had Aura in her pet carrier, a pink and black bag that was meant for a spoiled, ankle-biting dog, but it worked perfectly for my finicky cat.</p><p>I hate morgues, talk about depressing. I walked down the long, sterile hallway that led to where they kept the bodies. My heels clicked against the white tile and echoed in the otherwise quiet hall.</p><p>I was more nervous about seeing Micah than a dead body. We hadn\u2019t dated long, only eight months, but I loved him. When he told me that he had to prepare for the future of his pack and that nothing serious could ever exist between us, it created an unfixable crack through my otherwise protected heart. I almost wished he had cheated on me; that would have eradicated him from my mind, like he was just a cheating slime ball. But having Micah tell me that I couldn\u2019t give him what he needed was a huge blow to my self-esteem. Deep down, I knew it wasn\u2019t my fault. I hadn\u2019t chosen to be born a witch, but it didn\u2019t hurt any less.</p><p>I paused outside the door to the morgue and pulled out a small mirror to check my reflection. My dark hair was down, coming to the middle of my back. I had full makeup on and magically switched my clothes to skinny jeans, black pumps, and a red eyelet lace blouse that fit like the proverbial glove. Call me crazy, but I wanted to rub how hot I looked into Micah\u2019s prejudiced face.</p><p>When I pushed through the double doors, however, Micah wasn\u2019t there. Instead Wyatt was waiting for me. I rolled my eyes at the thought of Micah\u2019s cowardly absence and made my way to where Wyatt stood next to the sheet-covered body.</p><p>\u201cHi Wyatt. Thank you for allowing me to help the FPD,\u201d I smiled. Wyatt was thirty-two, two years older than Micah, but they looked as if they were twins. They both had chocolate brown hair with hints of highlights from spending so much time in the sun. Their eyes were the same deep amber that I had come to love. The only real differences between the two brothers were that Wyatt wasn\u2019t as uptight as Micah and somewhat taller.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Gwen, I was happy to hear you volunteered to help. I\u2019m sorry Micah couldn\u2019t meet with you; he\u2019s busy on another case,\u201d Wyatt explained. A thin-lipped smile crept on my face since I knew Wyatt was lying. This was their biggest case, and they\u2019d have all their best detectives working it, including Micah.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, I\u2019m more interested in seeing Amy Harper than Micah,\u201d I said, only half lying. My initial interest was to search Amy Harper\u2019s last memories. If Micah just happened to notice how hot I looked and what he\u2019d given up as well, no harm, no foul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the estimated time of death?\u201d I asked. I could only read the thoughts of the newly dead, so if Amy had been dead for longer than a day, I might have trouble seeing into her mind. From past experiences I learned that spirits usually linger awhile after the body dies. I don\u2019t know why, maybe they were deciding whether to walk into the light or stay earthbound. All I knew was, once the spirit departs, I\u2019m unable to read their memories.</p><p>My gift for being able to connect to the dead always made me feel unique. I haven\u2019t ever met another witch who can do what I can. The Goddess had bestowed me with a power I had yet to understand.</p><p>\u201cA citizen found her around nine last night. Our forensics team has clocked her death at being on the same day, sometime within four hours from when her body was found,\u201d Wyatt said in a solemn tone.</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have any problems reading her last thoughts.\u201d I set Aura\u2019s pet carrier down and walked over to where Amy\u2019s body lay under the white sheet. My hand hesitated to make contact, since that was my least favorite part of the process. I pulled the sheet back to reveal her face and gasped at how young she looked, maybe eighteen. Her complexion was paler than any vampire\u2019s and her red hair looked like it hadn\u2019t been washed in a while.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Gwen?\u201d Wyatt asked from the corner of the room. I glanced up and gave him a sad smile, \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t expect her to be so young. I really hope you catch the bastard who did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Wyatt said. I walked over to where Aura sat and bent down on one knee to peer into her carrier, \u201cYou ready, girl?\u201d She meowed her affirmation and I reached in to pet her head, \u201cGood girl.\u201d I could feel Aura\u2019s power vibrating through her fur as she prepared to feed me her magic. We were invisibly connected as witch and familiar, my magic could mesh with hers without touching.</p><p>Returning my attention to Amy, I stood at the head of the table and placed my hands on either side of her face, with my palms on her temples. I overcame the shiver that ran through my body at the feel of her cold, clammy skin. I stared straight ahead and drew energy from Aura which I absorbed.</p><p>Wisps of fog twisted and curled before my eyes, slowly making the room disappear into a cloudy abyss. I concentrated on Amy\u2019s soul that lay just under the skin. I could see the outline of trees and what looked like buildings silhouetted against the night sky, but they weren\u2019t coming into focus yet. I pressed my palms tighter to Amy\u2019s temples and drew in the energy that Aura supplied. A scene appeared within my vision and I could make out that the part of town Amy was in was rundown and desolate. Storefronts with \u201cOut of Business\u201d signs lined a deserted road and off in the distance, a dilapidated warehouse stood.</p> <p>The vision flickered and threatened to vanish, but I pushed forward with my magic until it was as if I were looking through Amy\u2019s eyes. I saw and felt what she saw and felt in her last moments. My heart rate became sporadic as though I were running. The surrounding scenery bobbed up and down with my heavy footfalls. I turned and looked over my shoulder but there wasn\u2019t anyone chasing me. I worriedly looked all over but still didn\u2019t see anyone. Something heavy weighted my hand and I looked down to see that Amy had produced a stake, but before she could fling it into her attacker\u2019s chest, he was on her.</p><p>The rundown town disappeared and I was strapped to a musty cot. It looked like I was in a warehouse of some sort, but I couldn\u2019t be sure. Amy\u2019s memories came through diluted and weak. I flung my body from side to side, trying to break the straps that held me down. A stinging pinch made me stop my attempts to escape. Looking down, I gasped at the needle that hung from my arm. I followed the plastic tube that carried my blood into one of those plastic bags that hospitals use to store blood. The sound of footsteps diverted my attention from the horror before me and to a man who was fast approaching. I couldn\u2019t make out his face. It flickered, like the connection was bad, or maybe Amy\u2019s soul didn\u2019t want to remember such a horrific person. He had light hair and was dressed in jeans and a zip-up hoodie. He looked to be around five-foot-nine and his body appeared lean and muscular under his clothes. Other than that, I couldn\u2019t make out his features. He knelt down and fixed the needle that was on its way out of Amy\u2019s arm. We cried out as the pain radiated up our forearm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, luv, it\u2019ll all be over soon,\u201d the man said in a thick English accent.</p><p>The vision disappeared bit by bit until my eyesight refocused on the cold storage wall in front of me. I blinked a few times to shake the residual energy from my eyes and shifted my gaze to Wyatt. He was still standing in the corner with his arms folded across his expansive chest, inspecting me.</p><p>\u201cThat never ceases to creep me out,\u201d he said with a small laugh. \u201cAny luck?\u201d I thought back to what I had witnessed, muddled memories really, but I discovered a location, a warehouse of some sort.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, does the FPD have any leads or ideas as to who did this?\u201d I asked, curious to see if my findings would coincide with theirs. Wyatt flipped open a manila folder that lay on the stainless steel table and scanned the files inside.</p><p>\u201cWe assume blood draining means a vampire did this, but there isn\u2019t any concrete evidence as of yet,\u201d he answered. I nodded my head and went to uncover the arm where I had seen the needle inserted. Sure enough, a small red pinprick was evident on Amy Harper\u2019s forearm.</p> <p>\u201cThis,\u201d I began, pointing to Amy\u2019s arm, \u201cwas made with a needle. Whoever kidnapped her didn\u2019t drain her with his fangs.\u201d Wyatt came around the table to get a better look at the small hole.</p><p>\u201cHuh? We assumed that was nothing.\u201d</p><p>In human crime labs, they didn\u2019t disregard a pinprick as nothing; but otherworldly beings were different, we didn\u2019t inject drugs like humans did.</p><p>I went on to tell Wyatt everything I had seen as he held his tape recorder out in front of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the area, which means she wasn\u2019t killed in Flora. What it did mean was that the person who killed her was an otherworldly, and most likely a vampire. A human can\u2019t cross our protective borders.\u201d My initial conclusion that the perp was a vamp was founded not on the fact that her blood was drained, but that she had conjured a stake.</p><p>\u201cThis must have something to do with brew,\u201d Wyatt said angrily.</p><p>\u201cBrew?\u201d I pursed my lips in confusion.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t leave this room, understand?\u201d Wyatt threatened.</p><p>I nodded my head. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>Satisfied that I was trustworthy, Wyatt leaned against the wall and said, \u201cThere was a case two years ago in Hemlock. Witches\u2019 bodies showing up drained just like Amy\u2019s. Word on the street is that young vampires can get high off witches\u2019 blood; they called it brew. It\u2019s sold in bags of blood that are slipped into regular blood shipments, making it almost impossible to trace back to its origin. It\u2019s also highly addictive.\u201d Wyatt took a ragged breath, as if the world had just plopped onto his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re dealing with brew dealers, then this case just got a whole hell of a lot more complicated.\u201d</p><p>I was completely speechless. Witches\u2019 blood helped young vampires high? How I never heard of this was beyond me. I didn\u2019t keep in contact with the NAWC (North American Witches Council) so maybe that was why I was out of the loop, but still. I would have assumed if vampires could become addicted to our blood, they\u2019d at least send a newsletter warning us. Had there been a memo I didn\u2019t receive?</p><p>Wyatt took a phone call before I could question him further. He covered the end of his phone with his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to run. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d I nodded my head because my mouth wasn\u2019t working at the moment, too overwhelmed with this new information.</p><p>I drove back to my shop but I couldn\u2019t stop the flow of thoughts that infiltrated my mind, like, what was a girl like Amy Harper doing in a rundown part of town? And, was it true that a witches\u2019 blood could cause a vampire to get high? I didn\u2019t have any of the answers but I knew who might. As much as it chapped my ass, I was going to have to talk to Aiden.</p><p>3</p><p>I called Aiden once the sun was on its way down, and to say he was amused that I needed his help, was an understatement. In the two years since I\u2019d known him, I evaded contact with him as much as I possibly could. It wasn\u2019t that I held a weak disposition towards vampires, just a weak sense of self-control around a certain dark haired vamp.</p><p>He lived in the Cula subdivision, named after the infamous vampire, Dracula. The architect responsible for building and naming the subdivision was also a vampire.</p><p>I parked my red car against the sidewalk and with anxious hands, opened the door. Aiden\u2019s home was ostentatious, but then again, so were most vampires\u2019 homes. He lived in a six thousand square foot villa with burnt orange stucco and Spanish tile roofing. Wrought iron railings decorated the balconies, of which there were three.</p><p>I took a calming deep breath to relax my nerves and finally, after debating whether it was a good idea to be visiting Aiden, I knocked. The door opened slowly, as if an apparition was welcoming me.</p><p>\u201cAiden?\u201d I called into the expansive entryway.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I stepped just over the threshold and the flickering of light caught my peripheral vision. Aiden\u2019s entire living room twinkled with a hundred white candles, and standing by the front window, was a shirtless Aiden. My eyes shot wide and my jaw dropped to the floor. I thought he was delicious in clothes, but out of them, he was mouth-watering.</p><p>Realizing I was staring, I averted my gaze. \u201cDid I interrupt something?\u201d I asked nonchalantly, but a twinge of jealousy stuck in my stomach like food poisoning.</p><p>\u201cActually, the guest of honor just arrived,\u201d he said, moving at warp speed to sit on the couch. \u201cCare to join me?\u201d he asked, patting the cushion. A small smile tugged at my lips but I quickly straightened it and crossed my arms.</p><p>\u201cI think you got the wrong idea, again.\u201d</p><p>Before I could blink, Aiden was standing in front of me, bare chest and all. I jumped slightly, which made him laugh, damn it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid I?\u201d he asked, his voice thick with seduction. He was a good five inches taller than my five-foot-seven height, so I was eye level with his sculpted body but I refused to let the drool leave my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I murmured. He reached for my hand and brought it up to his chest. Then he slowly trailed my palm against the ridges and valleys that made up his spectacular physique. His flirtatious actions should have pissed me off, but I was enjoying myself too much to be mad. If my body had a switch, than Aiden had just turned it on. His lust set his blue eyes on fire, and if I wasn\u2019t careful, I could get lost in those aqua pools.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I protested, as I snatched my hand away, \u201cI need to talk to you about something serious.</p> <p>\u201cHow serious?\u201d he asked, uninterested.</p><p>\u201cLife and death serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d he said with a heavy sigh and slumped his shoulders.</p><p>Aiden suddenly disappeared along with the glow of candlelight. I squinted my eyes against the sudden glare of the overhead light, to see that he had used his vampire speed to extinguish all of the candles. He was in the middle of pulling a white t-shirt over his head and caught my admiring gaze. I quickly gained my wits and stared at a large painting that hung on the far wall, rather than give him the satisfaction of knowing that I found him attractive.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even get to see my use of the flowers you rudely returned,\u201d he said with a pointed look. I smiled, happy that my \u201creturn to sender\u201d spell had worked.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, but I simply couldn\u2019t accept so many beautiful flowers from a man I turned down,\u201d I said, sending him my own pointed look. A smirk bent the side of his mouth up.</p><p>\u201cBut you kept the dress.\u201d I feigned interest in the eclectic doodads that adorned his bookshelf, all the while trying to figure out a good excuse for keeping the dress.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid it\u2019d get ruined in the transport spell,\u201d I said, deciding that sounded truthful.</p><p>Aiden laughed and walked into the kitchen, with me on his heels. Like the rest of his house, the kitchen was top-notch, black and stainless steel appliances, dark brown marble countertops accented by cherry cabinets. Wrought iron light fixtures and burnt orange tile, reiterated the Spanish theme of the house.</p><p>\u201cSo, what have you gotten yourself into now, my Gwen?\u201d he asked, as he set a teakettle on the stove and retrieved two coffee cups. Aiden had been saying \u201cmy\u201d Gwen ever since I had met him, and telling him not to call me that only made him enjoy it more. It had especially pissed off Micah when Aiden had claimed I was \u201chis\u201d Gwen. A smiled played on my lips at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really supposed to discuss this with anyone, Wyatt swore me to secrecy, so do I have your word that this stays between us? Or am I gonna have to use a memory wipe spell?\u201d</p> <p>Aiden scoffed at my warning, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you think so little of me.\u201d Deep down I knew he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone what we discussed tonight but I had to throw the warning out there. If he had any desire to mention even the tiniest bit of information, he knew I\u2018d take action. The kettle\u2019s scream echoed through our uncomfortable silence, shaking me back on track.</p><p>\u201cThis is serious and the FPD will rip me a new one if word gets out about what I\u2019m about to tell you. It\u2019s not personal but I need to make sure I can trust you,\u201d I told him. Aiden filled both of our cups with the boiling water and plopped a teabag into each one.</p><p>\u201cGot it, serious,\u201d Aiden said, as he pretended to zip his lips shut and hand me the imaginary key. I shook my head at his juvenile gestures, but my lips turned up into a smile.</p><p>\u201cShoot, what\u2019s so top secret that you\u2019ll threaten me with a memory wipe spell?\u201d Aiden asked as he took a sip of his tea. I wondered what it would be like to be a vampire. They could drink any liquid but had to give up solid foods. That would be some kind of hell in my mind, but Aiden seemed at home as a vampire. They weren\u2019t dead like a lot of the myths claim, just infected with a demonic virus.</p><p>I had found a magic encyclopedia a few years ago. In the book, I discovered that a demonic virus was responsible for vampires. God had cast the devil out of heaven and into hell; the devil didn't take it too well. Human books told why the devil was sent to the netherworld but none of the books told what the devil did because of it--too scary to advertise. He loathed God\u2019s children He believed they weren\u2019t worthy of receiving God\u2019s love, so he made children of his own, vampires. Perfect really, his children would feed off of God\u2019s children and infect them with a demonic virus.</p><p>The first vampires to ever exist were nasty creatures, bat-like wings, with sharp clawed feet and hands, who haunted the skies waiting for lone humans to feast upon. The allergy to the sun came from the virus being of the netherworld--dark; whereas God\u2019s children came from the light. Over time, the horrendous genes that made up the first vampires became diluted. Seemed the humans, although infected with the devil\u2019s virus were able to conquer the evil in it with the free will God had given them, eventually evolving into the vampires we had today. Incredible story really, I had read it at least five times, never tiring of the complexity of what made Aiden who he was today.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Aiden said, drawling me out of my thoughts, \u201cYou have a vision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t have visions without Aura,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>\u201cSo you were what, daydreaming about what would\u2019ve happened if you would have given into me earlier? I can put those thoughts to rest and show you; care to follow me upstairs?\u201d</p><p>Would I be a horrible person if I said I was thinking about taking him up on his offer? We were both single and adults, why not? The thought ran through my head as I watched Aiden over the rim of my teacup. Remembering that I had come here to discuss entirely different matters smacked the lusty thought from my head, much to my dismay.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything about the effect witches\u2019 blood has over new vampires? Anything called brew?\u201d I asked, steering the conversation back onto the track I intended traveling tonight. Aiden arched his brow as he thought about my question.</p><p>\u201cI have not heard that. What have you gotten yourself into, my Gwen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that, I\u2019m not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll in good time,\u201d Aiden promised, shrugging his shoulders as if it were only a matter of time before I came to my senses and lived happily ever after with him. I shook my head as annoyance snaked its way through my already stressed nerves.</p><p>\u201cWill you please stay on track? A young girl is dead because of this rumor, which is turning out to look more like a fact,\u201d I said, aggravated.</p><p>\u201cWhich girl is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy Harper, don\u2019t you read the newspaper?</p><p>\u201cNot unless I\u2019m searching the want ads,\u201d he smiled. Flora\u2019s newspaper had a small section that advertised willing blood donors from neighboring cities. Vampires could drink otherworldly blood but needed human blood to feed the virus and most vampires liked drinking live blood rather than bagged, which could have been sitting for who knows how long.</p><p>\u201cYou are so...infuriating,\u201d I remarked. I told myself I was pissed that he wouldn\u2019t take this serious, but there was a hint of jealousy at the thought of his lips on another woman\u2019s body, as irrelevant as it was. Hadn\u2019t I just got through telling him I wasn\u2019t \u201chis\u201d Gwen?</p><p>\u201cMy apologies...you obviously feel strongly about this and I wish I could help, but I haven\u2019t heard that a witch\u2019s blood could affect a baby vamp. If you like, I could ask around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t ask around, I wasn\u2019t even supposed to mention it to you. I just thought since you\u2019re a vampire you might\u2019ve heard something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure it\u2019s vampires doing this?\u201d Aiden asked, as if it were as crazy as him stepping into the morning sun.</p><p>\u201cYes, I went to the morgue and read Amy Harper\u2019s last thoughts. It was a vampire and he drained her using a needle. She wasn\u2019t killed in Flora though, so I don\u2019t understand why the vampire would drop her body here,\u201d I said, slowly drifting back into my thoughts as I tried to put together the pieces.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you getting involved in this? You\u2019re not a cop, Gwen. Please let the FPD handle it. If what you say is true, then I don\u2019t want you anywhere near these types of vampires. And, if you\u2019ve forgotten, you\u2019re a witch and a powerful one at that,\u201d he said, his tone deathly serious.</p><p>I ran a hand through my hair, \u201cThanks for the advice,\u201d I said as I hopped off the barstool and headed towards the door. Aiden was blocking my exit before I had taken three steps.</p><p>\u201cDoes this have to do with Micah?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I didn\u2019t even see Micah. As I mentioned earlier, I talked with Wyatt, and even if I had talked to Micah, it wouldn\u2019t be any of your business,\u201d I spat out as I tried to move past him, only to run into his rock hard arm.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you willing to stick your nose into something that may potentially get you killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, when I saw her last moments as she saw them...\u201d I stopped to take a breath, not sure how to portray what I had felt through Amy Harper\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe was so young, Aiden, and scared to death. I watched the bastard drain her like she was nothing more than a product. If I can help track this asshole down, then that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do. And you jumping on your high horse and ordering me not to won\u2019t change my mind,\u201d I finished, my voice slightly shaky with anger or nerves, I wasn\u2019t sure. Aiden lowered his arm from the doorway and I pushed passed him to leave.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d he said over his shoulder. I stopped but wouldn\u2019t turn around, my hand hesitating on the door handle.</p><p>\u201cIs it so much of a stretch to think that I wasn\u2019t trying to order you around? But was simply so pissed at the thought that someone could hurt you? I know I joke around a lot, but I really do care about you, Gwen, and I swear that if anything happens to you because of this case, then Micah and Wyatt are going to wish they never met me,\u201d he said, his tone unnerving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike you said, I\u2019m one powerful witch. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I told him, not feeling as confident as my words.</p><p>4</p><p>My feet pounded against the worn concrete as I tried to outrun him. It was a pointless action though; he ran faster than the wind. I knew that he was playing with me; he knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to escape. This town was desolate, no witnesses to the terror I was facing. I just had to keep running. I wasn\u2019t sure where he lurked, but he was close, I could feel the buzz of his energy dance on the night air. The empty buildings loomed over me like demons called from the netherworld, menacing and hollow.</p> <p>I ran through an alleyway to cut across to the next block, hoping that would throw my stalker off my trail. But the swoosh of air overhead as he jumped across the building\u2019s rooftop, was like death itself, laughing at my lame attempts to escape.</p><p>I came around the corner and produced a stake. I had been practicing exactly for this reason. It felt bulky and ominous in my palm, but it was my last and only option, since the vampire wasn\u2019t going to let me live. Anthony had been right about them. Why hadn\u2019t I listened?</p><p>I heard footsteps behind me but before I could turn my head, his arm wrapped around my throat, his familiar scent no longer welcoming.</p><p>I awoke with a start, only realizing I\u2019d been dreaming after Aura meowed at me. She was sleeping on the other side of my bed, where she gave me a pointed look through half slit eyes.</p><p>Amy Harper\u2019s memories haunted my dreams as if I had become her, feeling everything as she felt it. I shivered at the images and lay back down, running all of it through my mind. Everything was the same as it had been at the morgue but there was something else, some other information that I hadn\u2019t seen before. I tried to remember everything that happened in the dream, but it was muddled. I lay in bed for fifteen minutes before the answers popped into my head. In the dream, she had mentioned something about an Anthony and that the vampire\u2019s scent was familiar, someone she knew perhaps? But why would someone she knows want to kill her for such a horrific purpose?</p> <p>After I showered and dressed, I headed to the kitchen for breakfast. Fiona was tapping away on her laptop, while she magically made coffee. I ran into the floating coffee filter and was doused in coffee grounds. In our apartment I never knew what would be floating around when Fiona was home.</p><p>She pried her gaze from the computer screen, only after having noticed there was a rift in her magical production line. I brushed the grounds off of my shirt and shot a displeased look towards her.</p><p>\u201cYou should really watch where you\u2019re going,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cAnd you should really learn to do things without magic. It\u2019s too early in the morning to be on the lookout for flying objects in my own apartment,\u201d I countered. Luckily the coffee had been dry, so clean up was easy, broom and dustpan easy. I didn\u2019t like to flaunt my magic like Fiona did. Maybe I didn\u2019t like taking the easy route all the time.</p><p>\u201cWhy so grumpy?\u201d Fiona asked, as her eyes slid back to whatever was on her computer screen.</p><p>\u201cSorry, had a bad night,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting?\u201d I walked over to where she sat and peered at the screen. She had a website pulled up that had a black and red motif. A black banner with a pair of electric blue eyes decorated the top of the screen, followed by the words: Experience the Rush.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new club that\u2019s opening in Hemlock. Wanna go this weekend?\u201d she asked in an overzealous tone.</p><p>\u201cThe Founder\u2019s Gala is this weekend; I have to work at the shop.\u201d With two hundred humans visiting this weekend, it was the biggest shopping day of the year in Flora.</p><p>\u201cFounder\u2019s Day doesn\u2019t start until Saturday; we can go Friday night,\u201d she said, hoping I\u2019d change my mind. Flora only had one nightclub, Vain, and it was owned by a certain vamp I desperately needed to avoid. My last conversation with Aiden hadn\u2019t been the best but then again, none of our conversations ever went as planned.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll check it out but I can\u2019t stay out all night,\u201d I reluctantly told Fiona. I knew she\u2019d go with or without me and with Amy Harper\u2019s dead body etched into my brain; I didn\u2019t want Fiona going to a place like that alone.</p><p>\u201cYes, mother,\u201d Fiona said in a dramatic tone. I stuck my tongue out at her and headed for the door. When it came to Fiona and me, I was the more mature one. Fiona lived her life one day at a time and never thought about consequences. Being an only child of one of the wealthiest warlocks in town, she never had to face consequences.</p><p>Eleven cardboard boxes were waiting to be unpacked when I got to my shop. Penny, my part-time associate, was busy filing the invoices while I eyed the boxes with derision. There were special companies that produced products for my store but I hadn\u2019t anticipated getting eleven shipments in one day. They still needed to be priced, inventoried, and stocked. I could manipulate and form objects but I\u2019m not a spell caster, so potions and charmed objects weren\u2019t my forte and had to come from an outside source, if I wanted to stay in business.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Gwen,\u201d Penny said. Today she had her chocolate brown hair pulled up into a ponytail and was outfitted in a black skirt, black V-neck blouse and red and black striped tights. Penny was only nineteen and still coming to terms with being a witch. It didn\u2019t matter whether our parents were witches; the magic had to choose you. Both of my parents were human, but my grandmother was a spell caster. Penny was currently going through a Goth stage, not yet knowing that being a witch didn\u2019t make her a freak, just unique.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Penny,\u201d I said, as I took a box cutter to my new inventory. I was greeted with a flurry of packing peanuts, as if a Styrofoam snowstorm had suddenly erupted in the middle of my shop. I watched as little white pieces swirled into the air and danced their way to the garbage can, where they fell. I checked the return address and smiled. In glittery purple ink was Ms. Ozland\u2019s name, one of the most talented spell casters in Flora. I had been buying her items for the shop since I opened, a year ago. In true Ozland fashion, she had enchanted the annoying Styrofoam peanuts to clean up after themselves.</p><p>\u201cThat was so cool,\u201d Penny gushed, with amused eyes. I nodded my head in agreement; I hated dealing this those damned things.</p><p>This month, Ms. Ozland sent enchanted compacts. When opened, the mirror spoke in a sexy male voice and complimented the person on their beauty, in specific detail. The one I was holding said, Beautiful Gwen, is it heaven I see before me? With eyes as blue as the sea and lips so kissable that dare to taunt my dreams. A cascade of ebony down thee back, there is nothing this heaven lacks.</p><p>A laugh escaped my lips at the thought that a compact had just recited a poem in my honor. I caught Penny watching me, as if I had lost my mind to be swooned by an enchanted compact. I flipped it shut and said, \u201cThese would be great as gag gifts or for a friend who just got dumped.\u201d Penny didn\u2019t look like she was jumping onto the smooth talking, compact bandwagon.</p><p>Penny and I were halfway finished with pricing our entire new inventory when Micah walked in. I was momentarily shocked. I hadn\u2019t seen him since our breakup and thought he\u2019d avoid me while I was working as a consultant with the FPD. His hair was darker than I remembered, almost black. His eyes were still the same amber hue that was associated with weres. He wasn\u2019t wearing his usual FPD attire, preferring jeans and a t-shirt instead.</p><p>My feet stayed planted behind the counter, unable to approach him at first. I wasn\u2019t a shy girl, by any means, but Micah was the one guy that broke my heart. Seeing him again was like viewing a wrecking ball that was aimed for the brick wall I\u2019d built around my heart.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d His deep voice addressed me. I busied myself with clearing papers and riffraff from around the register.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Micah?\u201d I asked with faux confidence.</p><p>\u201cWyatt would like to hire you as a full time consultant. He was very impressed with the work you did the other day,\u201d he said, leaning closer to the counter so that no one else would hear him. \u201cWe need all the help we can get on this Amy Harper case; you in?\u201d I considered him for a moment. Despite his nonchalant attitude that tried to persuade me he was comfortable, I wasn\u2019t buying it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe working with the FPD?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how good you are, Gwen. You could offer some valuable help towards our cases, that\u2019s the only thing that matters,\u201d he spoke matter-of-factly. Part of me was happy that I could continue to help the FPD, but the other half wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to work with Micah.</p><p>Amy Harper\u2019s face suddenly flashed into my thoughts again and made my mind up for me. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll do it. I have new information that might help,\u201d I told him, thinking of my dream the previous night.</p><p>\u201cWant to grab a coffee?\u201d He asked, surprising me again. \u201cSo we can go over the case,\u201d he quickly added, as if I thought he were asking me out purely to spend time with me.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said noncommittally.</p><p>I told Penny to hold down the fort and that I\u2019d be back in a half an hour. There was a cute little coffee shop, Espresso Self, just up the street from Broomsticks that we headed toward. We were silent as we walked, but I could tell Micah was tense being next to me. Good! Served him right. I was gaining confidence with each step we took.</p><p>Espresso Self only had a handful of customers but Micah and I took our coffees to a table that was isolated from any eavesdropping patrons. Micah was clearly uncomfortable and reluctant to start a conversation.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream last night,\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201cI should apologize,\u201d Micah said at the same moment I started to talk. I sealed my lips and waited for him to elaborate further. I knew it wasn\u2019t mature, but I was enjoyed his discomfort more than I should have. He exhaled a deep breath and began again.</p><p>\u201cGwen, I\u2019m sorry for how I ended things between us. I know I could have handled it better, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I considered his words, which sounded sincere. He had a new girlfriend so there was no reason for him to be feeding me a line. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, I was crushed when it ended, but I understand your decision and I\u2019m happy you found someone who can give you what you want,\u201d I told him honestly. In retrospect I should have known that it wouldn\u2019t last with him, weres always ended up with each other. Sure they\u2019d date outside their race when they were young, but those women were only temporary, mere substitutes until they met a were woman to settle down with.</p><p>\u201cYou heard about that, huh?\u201d he asked. I nodded my head but quickly said, \u201cFiona told me, she thought I\u2019d want to know, I guess,\u201d I added so he wouldn\u2019t</p><p>think I was stalking him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you? Seeing anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone on dates but nothing serious yet, not really looking for a relationship right now,\u201d I said, keeping my expression blank. He didn\u2019t need to know that he was the reason for the issues I had with men. There was an awkward silence that settled between us and I wondered if we\u2019d ever get over our past and act normal around each other. We had ended on a bad note, but Micah wasn\u2019t a bad guy and if the FPD wanted to hire me as a consultant, we needed to learn how to function around each other.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you had a dream?\u201d Micah finally asked, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you had psychic dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. This dream was a replay of what I\u2019d seen in Amy\u2019s memories at the morgue. Except, somehow I was able to get new information from it. She mentioned an Anthony and it seemed like she knew her attacker. I don\u2019t know if that will help but at least we\u2019ve got a name of someone who might know something,\u201d I said.</p><p>Micah looked quizzically at me, \u201cHow do we even know there is an Anthony, maybe it was just a dream.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is where your handy-dandy detective skills would come into play,\u201d I said sarcastically, sending him a wry grin.</p><p>\u201cThanks smartass, I\u2019ll check into it when we visit Hemlock tomorrow,\u201d he said with amusement. My phone beeped to tell me I had a text message so I flipped it open and saw that it was from Aiden.</p><p>BE OVER IN AN HOUR, HAVE INFO</p><p>I flipped the phone shut and noticed Micah watching me curiously.</p><p>\u201cWell thanks for meeting with me today, I really appreciate it. I\u2019ve gotta get going, but please let me know how your visit to Hemlock goes,\u201d I said, as I got up to leave.</p><p>\u201cBad news?\u201d Micah asked, nodding towards the phone I held in my hand.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Aiden is stopping by in an hour and I need to talk to him,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t tell him that Aiden might have information on the brew rumors; that\u2019d get me kicked off the case in a heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cSo Aiden finally wore you down, huh?\u201d He asked with a less than enthusiastic tone. Micah and Aiden hadn\u2019t ever gotten along. It might have had something to do with Aiden trying to steal me away from Micah while we were together. Seeing how Micah and I didn\u2019t work out, maybe I should have let Aiden steal me away.</p><p>\u201cNo, but he\u2019s still trying,\u201d I smiled at the thought. I turned to leave but Micah stopped me.</p><p>\u201cWhen I said we\u2019re going to Hemlock tomorrow, I meant you and me, partner.\u201d My eyebrows arched up in surprise. Wyatt had made us partners? He was going to hear an earful next time I saw him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I protested. \u201cTomorrow night Fiona and I are going to that new club, Rush. It\u2019s in Hemlock so I\u2019ll just investigate myself.\u201d Hemlock was almost an hour away. I didn\u2019t want to spend all day there with Micah, only to come home and head back down there with Fiona all night.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the club I planned to investigate. I have a source that says they serve brew there. And Anthony most likely lives there. See you tomorrow night,\u201d he said, winking as he left.</p><p>5</p><p>October meant nightfall arrived earlier. It was only half past five when I got back to my apartment to meet Aiden. Being as old as he was, Aiden actually woke up a couple hours before the sun set but he couldn\u2019t set foot outside until twilight.</p> <p>When I pulled my Jeep into my parking spot, he was already waiting for me on the front steps. His dark hair lay in a tousled mess, as the wind played with it. His welcoming smile sent the butterflies in my stomach spinning into a whirlwind of fluttering wings. When he smiled, I couldn\u2019t help but smile also. I was grinning from ear to ear by the time I stood in front of him. It didn\u2019t matter that he knew how to touch every last one of my nerves, to the point of being maddening.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Gwen,\u201d he said, with his oh-so-sexy voice.</p><p>\u201cHello, Aiden,\u201d I said back, not entirely sure why I was still smiling like an idiot. It couldn\u2019t have been my time with Micah, I was definitely over him. Our conversation though helped a lot. It\u2019s amazing what an apology can do for someone. That had to be why I was in such a good mood. Having Aiden visit wasn\u2019t a bummer either.</p><p>I started up the concrete stairs that led to my second floor apartment, with Aiden following in my wake. I hoped that our place was halfway decent, since I hadn\u2019t been home long enough to really clean and Fiona only did the minimum, but I doubted Aiden would care.</p><p>I fished my keys out of my sweater pocket but was frozen in place when Aiden\u2019s energy pushed against my back, sending rivulets of power cascading all around me. I shivered against the feel of it as he pushed my long dark hair to the side and touched his lips to the nape of my neck. It was amazing, that he could turn me on with barely a touch. How I had resisted him for two years was beyond me.</p><p>Suddenly the warmth of his lusty power withdrew, leaving me shivering for a completely different reason. I looked over my shoulder just to make sure he was still there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, afraid of what he might say. He was leaning against the far wall with his arms crossed and looking at me with annoyance.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said this case wasn\u2019t about Micah?\u201d he said accusingly. In true Aiden fashion, he had turned me on, only to dump a bucket of ice-cold bullshit onto my head. Otherworldly men were incorrigible. Of course, he\u2019d be able to smell traces of Micah on me, even though we hadn\u2019t touched.</p><p>\u201cAiden, you can either stay and discuss the information you said you had, or you can leave. I don\u2019t have to explain myself to you,\u201d I forced out, with the sudden urge to smack the stupid out of him. Without waiting for his answer, I turned the key in the lock and strode into my apartment. I tried to fling my sweater off, but during my little rant, it got tangled around my arms and I was stuck with what looked like a cashmere straightjacket.</p><p>Aiden was in front of me, untangling my limbs by the time I had uttered my third cuss word. I looked up at him and tried to portray the anger I felt, but all I could do was laugh.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d Aiden chuckled as he unbuttoned the rest of my sweater. Finally free of my stupidity, I smacked him on the arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the most complicated person I\u2019ve ever met! One minute you\u2019re trying to seduce me and the next, you\u2019re pushing every single one of my \u2018piss-me-off\u2019 buttons. How I\u2019ve dealt with you for the past two years is beyond me. If...\u201d</p><p>My words were suddenly cut off when Aiden smashed his lips on mine. I resisted at first, my anger still burning. I pushed against his chest but he only held me tighter, wrapping an arm around my waist while his other hand tangled in my hair. His tongue darted out, teasingly and my anger was extinguished.</p><p>I opened my mouth and accepted what he offered, massaging my tongue with his. Tingles radiated up my thighs and settled between my legs as I felt his hardness press against me. Man could he kiss!</p><p>I snuck my hand under his shirt to feel the sinews of muscle that waited underneath. I had wanted to get my hands on his sculpted chest ever since I first met him and I was surely taking the opportunity now that I had it. He answered with a moan that I mimicked and suddenly, there were too many clothes between us for my liking. I made his shirt disappear so that my hands wouldn\u2019t run into any obstacles as I explored his beautiful landscape. He pressed soft kisses all the way down my neck, rendering my body into a boneless mass.</p><p>\u201cUm, hello?\u201d Fiona called from the front door. I quickly untangled myself from Aiden to see Fiona wasn\u2019t alone. Her father stood next to her with his steely gaze aimed at me. My mouth hung open in humiliation at what Fiona and her father had just witnessed. Aiden didn\u2019t seem to mind, though, as he held out his hand to Mr. Bennett who looked at it as if it held a deadly virus. Unfazed by the rudeness that was Fiona\u2019s father, Aiden wrapped an arm around my waist. I nudged him with my elbow and stepped out of his embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you had to see that,\u201d I grimaced. Fiona answered with an amused grin while her father remained silent. Luckily, I was still wearing my white tank top, but Aiden\u2019s shirt had been banished to God knows where.</p><p>\u201cDaddy and I are just coming back from one of his banquets and he wanted to see our apartment,\u201d Fiona explained. I\u2019d have to question her later about why her father suddenly wanted to be in her life. After what he saw tonight, he\u2019d probably demand that Fiona never speak to me again.</p><p>I nodded my head, unable to speak without offending Mr. Bennett in some way.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just get out of your hair,\u201d Aiden said, pulling me towards my bedroom. In normal circumstances, I would have stopped him but I really wanted to flee the judgment in the old man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>I grumbled and fell back onto my bed, ashamed of getting caught. Not that I really had any reason to be ashamed, I was an adult, after all, but Fiona\u2019s father could made me feel as big as a Tic-Tac.</p><p>Aiden lay on his side next to me and pushed a stray strand of hair out of my face, manifesting a sexy grin on his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2018s been entirely too long since I\u2018ve gotten to feel your lips!\u201d I smiled up at him, my bedroom instantly seeming perfect with a bare-chested Aiden in it. We had kissed a few months after Micah broke up with me but I was still in the process of licking my wounds. I couldn\u2019t offer Aiden what he wanted. I\u2019d been keeping my distance ever since that night but, like everything else, Aiden hadn\u2019t made avoiding him easy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I knew what you were hiding under your shirt, I would\u2019ve caved a long time ago. My imagination failed you.\u201d I said, eyeing his perfect chest.</p><p>\u201cI feel cheated, your shirt is still on. Come on, off with it, it\u2019s only fair,\u201d he teased as he pulled at the bottom of my tank top. We were in a sort of tug-of-war, with my shirt acting as the rope.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I managed to get out between laughs, \u201cWe should talk.\u201d Aiden immediately stopped, a somber look taking over his happy one.</p> <p>\u201cIf you tell me that this can\u2019t happen again and that we\u2019re better off friends, then stake me now; end my misery,\u201d he said, with amused sarcasm.</p><p>I sat up and straightened my hair that got messed up during our war over my shirt. \u201cI was going to say that we should take this slow, maybe go on a few dates to see if there\u2019s anything between us besides sexual lust. I\u2019m not looking to get my heart stomped on again or interested in just being a booty call,\u201d I admitted honestly. Aiden started laughing silently so I slapped his arm lightly, \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m serious when I say, that I have wanted you for two years, body and soul,\u201d He cupped my face in his hands and pressed a kiss on my forehead, \u201cBut I have no problem wining and dining you. Prepare to be wooed, my Gwen,\u201d a smile of accomplishment stretched across his lips to reveal perfectly white teeth. I smiled at him through a strand of my dark hair that acted as an ebony curtain. I eyed his chest and reluctantly, conjured a gray t-shirt to cover the masterpiece. Gray fabric crawled along his ribs and up towards his shoulders, stretching and connecting to form a shirt. He looked down in awe at his new garment,</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s this information you just had to see me about?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cI called a friend of mine that lives in Chicago and I pretended to be interested in finding something I could serve in my club that would attract younger vamps...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden! I told you not to mention anything,\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>\u201c...I didn\u2019t mention your name or anything to do with this case, I\u2019m not an idiot. Anyway, my friend told me about a new blood that I could sell that would keep a steady flow of young vamps coming. Guess what the blood was, Gwen?\u201d he asked with sarcastic pleasure.</p><p>\u201cBrew?\u201d I answered knowingly.</p><p>\u201cBingo! He said that it had come through Chicago a couple months ago and the vampires up there love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know what kind of blood it is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say and I didn\u2019t ask. There have been a handful of bloods that have been altered to expand our palate, so I wanted him to think I assumed it was one of those so I wouldn\u2019t raise suspicion,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>\u201cGood job, Nancy Drew,\u201d I laughed, \u201cI can\u2019t share this information with the FPD though because you\u2019re not supposed to know,\u201d I grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I thought about that? He\u2019s shipping me a sample and then if I like it, he\u2019ll have the dealer contact me,\u201d he said, giving me a smug grin, \u201cNancy Drew has nothing on my detective skills.\u201d</p><p>Could it really be as easy as Aiden getting the culprit\u2019s information just handed to him? I had to stay optimistic about the possibilities.</p><p>A knock sounded at my door and both Aiden and I turned our attention toward it.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I called. Fiona pushed the door open with her hand covering her eyes and said,</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone and I have pizza out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can uncover your eyes, Fiona, we\u2019re just talking,\u201d I told her. She dropped her hand and looked at us with humor.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you said you two weren\u2019t dating?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not, well we weren\u2019t. It just kind of happened tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a lack of trying,\u201d Aiden chimed in, \u201cI must thank you and your father for interrupting what could have been the highlight of my year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, he insisted on driving me home,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>\u201cUm, excuse me, we were just making out. It wouldn\u2019t have gone any further so you didn\u2019t interrupt anything,\u201d I told both of them. Fiona gave me a \u201cyeah, right\u201d look while Aiden smiled knowingly. I shook my head in aggravation; even I couldn\u2019t convince myself.</p><p>We all sat around the table, Fiona and I stuffing our faces with pizza topped with chicken while Aiden drank bottled water. I really wanted to play twenty questions with Fiona about her father but I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d want Aiden to know her business, so I resolved to just ask later.</p><p>\u201cSo I take it you\u2019re going to the Founder\u2019s Gala together now?\u201d Fiona asked between bites of pizza.</p><p>\u201cYep. Everyone will be envious of me with Gwen on my arm, no offense, Fiona,\u201d Aiden bragged. I looked at him, remembering I had told him that I already had a date to the Gala, so I decided to have some fun with it.</p><p>\u201cAiden, I\u2019m so sorry but I already have a date, remember?\u201d I said and pretended to wince at the thought of offending him. The look of shock on his face was priceless.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you were going alone?\u201d Fiona said, blowing my joke out of the water.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember saying that,\u201d I said innocently.</p><p>\u201cWhat his name?\u201d Aiden said with suspicion. Crap on a cracker, I hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead yet. I took entirely too long to answer but finally said,</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worse at lying than you are at resisting me,\u201d Aiden laughed. I smiled at him, knowing the truth was now out.</p><p>\u201cHey, with all the crap you\u2019ve put me through the last couple years, you deserve a little crap back,\u201d I said.</p><p>All three of us were laughing and talking when my phone rang. I flipped it open and noticed it was Micah\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHi, Micah, what do you need?\u201d I said into the receiver.</p><p>\u201cAnother body has been found; meet me at Hollow Creek Park.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>I pulled my car into the wood-chipped parking lot and went to the passenger\u2019s side to retrieve Aura, who wasn\u2019t too happy that I had woken her up. There were two black SUVs with red and blue lights flashing against the darkness of the park. Micah and Wyatt stood at the edge of the woods, looking down at a body. Gruesome things were not my strong point. I got faint at the sight of blood from a paper cut, but helping out the FPD was rewarding just to know I might help catch the lunatic behind these girls\u2019 deaths.</p><p>I walked over to where they stood, with Aura\u2019s bag on my shoulder. Upon approaching, I noticed that the woman was older than Amy Harper. She looked to be in her later twenties or early thirties. She had short blonde hair and was just as pale as Amy had been. She was wearing jeans and a green sweater that was ripped in various places.</p><p>\u201cHey Gwen, thanks for coming,\u201d Wyatt said. I gave him a sad smile, not really in the mood for pleasantries. It had only been a of couple days since Amy Harper\u2019s body was found and now another woman lay before us, having met the same fate. I had to wonder when and if this was going to stop.</p><p>\u201cWho found her?\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cJasper Binx. He was running through the park and smelled her,\u201d Micah said. Jasper Binx was part of the Flora werewolves and could have easily smelled the woman\u2019s body in wolf form.</p><p>I nodded my head. \u201cDo we know who she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Wyatt answered, \u201cWould you like to try and read her memories?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and set Aura\u2019s carrier on the dewy grass. I kissed the top of her head and knelt in front of the mystery woman. Her body looked like it had just been tossed, leaving her legs splayed, and one of her arms lay above her head while the other arm lay limply at her side. Anger bubbled within me like a volcano ready to erupt, but I quashed it. I needed to focus to find out what happened.</p><p>I placed my palms against her temples and blanked out my mind. I concentrated on the steady hum of energy that flowed from Aura and channeled it into the woman\u2019s mind, acting as the conduit.</p><p>Bright flashes danced within my view forcing me to squint my eyes. The darkness of the park gave way to a scene of a sunset-soaked park. Purple and orange smeared the sky and the woman pulled out a digital SLR camera to snap a picture of the beautiful landscape.</p><p>A twig snapped in the near distance and she turned her head to investigate. There was a couple walking on the blacktop trail and a man playing fetch with his dog, but no one was her. She turned her attention back to the beauty before her and snapped a few more pictures before putting the camera back into its bag. I noticed the name, Bridget Downing, was written on the inside flap of her bag.</p><p>The park disappeared and a flash of scenes rapidly played in my mind. I couldn\u2019t get a handle on any one thing but her fear overtook my senses and made me fall back on my butt, causing the connection to wane. I was breathing hard, to the point of hyperventilating. Wyatt knelt where I sat on the wet grass and offered me a bottled water. My breathing slowly regained normalcy, but my hands were shaking slightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Wyatt asked with concern. I took a drink from the bottle and a couple of deep breaths before I could answer. Looking into the woman\u2019s memories had affected me a lot more than Amy Harper\u2019s had.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. This woman hasn\u2019t been dead long, her memories were strong,\u201d I said with heavy breathing.</p><p>\u201cDid you get a name or location?\u201d Micah asked.</p><p>\u201cI saw the name Bridget Downing on her camera bag but I\u2019m not entirely sure if that was her name. She was in a park at first, but then it changed, and all I saw were incoherent memory flashes.\u201d</p><p>Wyatt thought for a minute and then said, \u201cYou said she hasn\u2019t been dead long?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head with complete certainty.</p><p>\u201cI think we should change and try to catch a scent. The murderer\u2019s scent will still be strong enough and if we\u2019re lucky, they could still be around somewhere,\u201d Wyatt said to Micah. Micah nodded and began to take off his clothes, with Wyatt mimicking his actions. The change from human to werewolf always played hell on their clothes so they stripped to avoid having to replace the damaged ones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I regained my footing and picked up Aura\u2019s pet carrier. I petted her head and told her she was a good girl. She rewarded me with a head nudge and loud purring.</p><p>Micah and Wyatt were already stripped down to their boxers and I averted my gaze from their exposed skin. I didn\u2019t want Micah getting the wrong idea, should I enjoy the view too long. Both of their bodies were impressive. Broad shoulders that tapered to a thin muscled stomach and strong muscular legs.</p><p>\u201cAm I done here?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll be awhile so you can head home. You okay to drive?\u201d Wyatt asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, waving off his concerns.</p><p>\u201cOkay, thank you, Gwen. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I said my goodbyes and headed for my Jeep. Once I got in the driver\u2019s seat, Wyatt and Micah were already transformed into wolves. Wyatt, in wolf form, was a rich brown color with red hints to his fur, while Micah\u2019s wolf form was a caramel color with white decorating the tip of his tail. Seeing his wolf brought sad memories back to me that I quickly kicked to the curb, before starting my Jeep.</p><p>Once back home, I hopped in the shower to ease the tension of my vision. I had only experienced it that strongly one other time, and I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it again.</p> <p>The images of her memories occupied my mind while the hot water pounded against my back. I tried to remember more details but they happened too quickly. Whoever had killed her hadn\u2019t wasted anytime, which wasn\u2019t good; it meant they needed more of their supply.</p><p>Wyatt had said that brew was addictive. If that was the case, then this dealer had a strong following already. Nausea set in my stomach at the thought of their supply being the very blood that ran through my veins. I hadn\u2019t ever been bitten by a vampire and now I was dating one. My fear made me question whether I should break all ties with Aiden, but that was my anxiety running wild with my thoughts. Supposedly brew only affected young vampires and Aiden, at 315 years old, posed no threat to my blood or me and made the thought vanish from my cluttered mind.</p><p>I sauntered out to the kitchen in my bright blue robe and almost got hit upside the head with a Pepsi can. Fiona cringed at the near miss. I blew out a breath and shook my head, opening the fridge to get my own Pepsi.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. I waved off her apologies and sat at the table with her. She was flipping through a bride catalog and I arched my eyebrows with worry.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Liam popped the question already? Just because your father says you should be married doesn\u2019t mean you automatically have to. At least date the guy for six months before you say yes,\u201d I said, worried my best friend was making a monumental mistake.</p><p>\u201cWill you relax? I\u2019m looking for a dress for the Founder\u2019s Gala, geez, Gwen,\u201d she said. I silently thanked God and sent her an embarrassed smile, \u201cSorry. I know you\u2019re smarter than that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d she said with a head nod, \u201cSo, you\u2019re working with the FBD again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing with seeing Micah again?\u201d</p><p>Fiona knew how upset I was when Micah dumped me and, like a true best friend, she helped me drown my sorrows with large amounts of alcohol. Never mind the hangover from hell the next morning, her intentions had been good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. He actually apologized earlier today. I didn\u2019t realize how much resentment I held against him, but after the apology it was like a weight had been lifted,\u201d I said.</p><p>Fiona smiled. \u201cSo since Micah said he was sorry for breaking your heart, you opened yourself up to Aiden, literally?\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped and Fiona laughed harder. I had always been attracted to Aiden but stayed a safe distance from him. The closure Micah had given me had lowered my protective shields a little bit.</p><p>\u201cThe furthest I\u2019ve gone with Aiden is what you saw tonight, thank you very much!\u201d I said, defending myself.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,yeah, so does he kiss as good as he looks?\u201d she wiggled her eyebrows and I snorted at her lack of boundaries.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d I said, smiling in remembrance, \u201cAnyway, how the heck are you going to get a dress out of a catalog by Saturday?\u201d</p><p>Realizing that I wouldn\u2019t elaborate any further on Aiden\u2019s talents, she held the catalog up to show me a long pastel green gown with a deep v-neck.</p><p>\u201cI just need a picture of the gown I want so Andy can make it. It only takes him a day and he already knows my measurements from all the clothes I buy from him. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Andy was a wiz when it came to creating something from nothing. Like most fairies, he had creative genius.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and you\u2019ll look amazing in it,\u201d I smiled at her. Aura jumped on my lap and I ran my hands through her thick, long fur. Petting her comforted me and after the day I had, I needed all the comfort I could get.</p><p>I realized Fiona was asking me something but it sounded muffled and drowned out by white noise. The scenery of the kitchen slowly began to be sucked inward with darkness following it. My heartbeat thumped against my ribcage like a captive animal fighting to escape. My fingers clenched Aura\u2019s fur as if she were my anchor to reality but my kitchen kept disappearing until all that was left was darkness.</p><p>A gray figure sluggishly stepped forward, standing out like a spotlight against the blackness. Its head was hung and its hand outstretched, as if inviting me to touch it, but my dread had frozen me in the chair I remained seated in. Strobe-like flashes disoriented me, changing the blackened abyss into an abandoned house. Tattered curtains blew against the yellowing walls and the smell was redolent of mold. Stacks of old magazines and newspapers occupied various spots.</p><p>I caught movement out of my peripheral vision, and looked in the direction of the staircase. The gray figure was standing on the stairs, looking at me. When I didn\u2019t move toward it, it continued up the steps, as if floating. I swallowed the lump of dread that had lodged itself in my throat and cautiously followed. The stairs groaned with each step I took, threatening to collapse under my weight. When I came to the second floor landing, the figure wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen. Unrelenting, I made my way down the hallway. The wallpaper was peeling in various places and a thick layer of dust blanketed everything.</p><p>There were three bedrooms and a bathroom on this floor. I pushed the doors open to make sure no one was waiting at the ready to attack me, but only eerie silence greeted me. The last bedroom I went into was decorated in feminine tones; white wallpaper with small rosettes encased the walls, and a twin-sized canopy bed that jutted out from the far wall. I moved closer to the dresser and picked up a picture of a woman. She looked to be in her teens but I didn\u2019t recognize her.</p><p>Something passed quickly by the door, making me swing around. I caught a glimpse of shadow so I hurried to the door and just as I peeked my head out, the figure disappeared into the second bedroom. I took a deep breath and slow steps, making my way to where the apparition had gone. It was standing in the corner, facing the wall. It looked to be five-foot-four but any other distinctive features were washed out in a cloud of dark gray.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I said in a small voice, but only silence responded.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I tried again. It slowly looked over its shoulder at me and I had to tell myself that my heart couldn\u2019t literally bust through my ribcage, although it was trying its damnedest. Whatever the thing was, it scared the hell out of me.</p><p>Before I could blink, it was standing a couple feet in front of me, with its hand outstretched like before. Deciding I should go along with whatever this thing wanted if I wanted answers, I reached out to touch it. Ice cold prickles erupted all through my body once I made contact, causing my hair to stand on end.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>The voice was in my head but I knew it had come from the ghostly outline that was currently grasping my hand. Panic and sadness washed through me, eroding any rational thoughts I had. My mind ran amok with paranoia that I couldn\u2019t understand. Someone has been watching me...they\u2019re going to kill me...</p><p>Although the thoughts ran wild in my head, I didn\u2019t understand why I was thinking them. The figure let go of my hand and stood stock still in front of me, waiting for me to understand.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d a familiar female voice said. It sounded like someone was speaking down at me, so I looked up at the cracked ceiling, but nothing and no one was there.</p><p>I brought my attention back to the shadow, but it was starting to waver in and out of solidity. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I told it, afraid it\u2019d disappear again.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d another voice said, only this time it was a male voice. I looked around but only the shadow and I occupied the room.</p><p>The ghostly entity was almost a white gray now, fading, so that I could see the room through it. I tried to grab its hand again, but my fingers fell through it, leaving a cold breeze to caress my skin.</p><p>\u201cWait, who are you?\u201d I tried asking again but it was already disappearing. I looked around for the owners of the other voices but they were nowhere to be found. When I looked back at the ghost, it was gone.</p><p>\u201cCome back, Gwen, back to me,\u201d a familiar male voice said. My eyes felt heavy and my body weak with exhaustion. I slid down the wall, unable to hold myself up any longer, and collapsed into oblivion.</p><p>7</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s coming around,\u201d a male voice said. I was lying on something hard and I could tell that someone was next to me but my head was a mass of confusion and fog.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d a female said.</p><p>I squinted against the bright light that was in sharp contrast to the dark place I had just been. The first thing I saw was the light on the ceiling in my kitchen. I had been meaning to clean it for months now.</p><p>The back of someone\u2019s hand caressed my cheek, so I turned my head to see Aiden. His face depicted worry, which made me worry. I sat up too quickly and was greeted with extreme dizziness.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, take it easy, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed the dizziness from my head and looked up, noticing for the first time there were three other people were watching me. Micah was standing by the sink, Wyatt was next to the table, Fiona was sitting in a chair by my feet, and Aiden was standing right next to me. They all gave me looks of uncertainty, as if I were in danger of losing consciousness again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGwen, are you okay?\u201d Fiona asked with worry inflecting her tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I murmured, closing my eyes against the lingering waves of nausea that wafted through my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. One minute we were talking, and the next your head lolled back and you passed out,\u201d Fiona said, \u201cYou scared the shit out of me.\u201d A bottle of water was held out in front of me and when I looked up, I noticed it was Micah holding it. I grabbed it, thankful to be able to wash the dryness out of my throat.</p> <p>Aiden slipped a hand under my legs and another around my back, lifting me up. He carried me into the living room and placed me on the sofa. It was a lot more comfortable than the hardness of the kitchen table. He sat down with me, propping my legs onto his lap.</p><p>Everyone filed into the living room, observing me like I was something strange to them. Self-consciously, I realized I was still in my blue bathrobe, and that my legs were mostly uncovered. I adjusted the robe, not wanting Micah or Wyatt to see any more of my exposed skin.</p><p>\u201cDid you guys find anything out about the woman in the park?\u201d I asked the brothers, assuming that was why they were here.</p><p>\u201cI called them,\u201d Fiona answered, \u201cI was really scared, I didn\u2019t know what was happening to you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d Aiden asked as he rubbed my feet. I thought back and came up blank for an answer. I hadn\u2019t ever experienced anything like that before.</p><p>\u201cThere was a shadow, a ghost, I think. It was like the kitchen disappeared and I was standing in an abandoned house,\u201d I said, not entirely sure how to describe what had happened. It was one of those instances where \u201cyou had to be there\u201d to really understand.</p><p>\u201cGwen, you don\u2019t have psychic abilities. You\u2019ve never been able to see ghosts before,\u201d Micah said, with a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw, Micah,\u201d I retorted, even though he was right.</p><p>\u201cIt was Aura,\u201d Fiona said, drawing our attention to her, \u201cShe jumped into your lap when it happened and she wouldn\u2019t let any of us get near you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. I draw energy from her, she doesn\u2019t project the spirit world at me,\u201d I said, unable to make the connection.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps she can, this was just the first time a spirit wanted to get in contact with you. When Aura finally got her off your lap, that\u2019s when you regained consciousness.\u201d</p><p>It made sense; Aura was my link to the spirit world. But I couldn\u2019t figure out who would want to contact me, or why? The spirit hadn\u2019t said anything other than the voices it projected into my mind. Aura must have made the connection when I started petting her, sneaky cat.</p><p>\u201cSomeone has been watching me, they\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d I whispered, replaying the voice I\u2019d heard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Aiden asked, \u201cWho\u2019s going to kill you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot me, that\u2019s what the spirit said.\u201d</p><p>This whole situation put me out of my comfort zone. Sure, I was a witch, but I wasn\u2019t a spirit seer. Now that I\u2019d had a taste of what those witches went through, I held a new level of respect for them.</p><p>It was late, almost midnight, and everyone was looking a little exhausted themselves. I felt horrible that I was the reason for their sleepiness, excluding Aiden who didn\u2019t sleep at night.</p><p>\u201cThank you guys for coming over, but I\u2019m fine. You should go home and get some sleep,\u201d I told Wyatt and Micah. Relief showed on Micah\u2019s face, who most likely was feeling uncomfortable at being around me and Aiden, in the very same apartment he used to visit.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Wyatt asked.</p><p>I nodded my head and gave him a reassuring smile, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then Micah will pick you up tomorrow night around six. Good night, guys,\u201d Wyatt said. Micah looked between Aiden and me and gave a short head nod, then followed his brother out the door.</p><p>Fiona said she was tired and slipped off to her bedroom, but I expected she was giving me alone time with Aiden. I was actually tired and not interested in spending any quality time with Aiden at the moment. Whatever I had went through drained me.</p><p>My legs were still resting in Aiden\u2019s lap but he sat rigid, as if touching me might turn him to ash. I pursed my lips and gave him a questioning glare, \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d He shifted to look at me and his eyes went black as coal. Vampires\u2019 eyes only went black for two reasons, anger or horny; I would bet my entire savings that it wasn\u2019t the latter.</p><p>\u201cI waited patiently for you to come to your senses over that dog, and I even believed you when you said this case had nothing to do with him. But what I can\u2019t understand is why is he going to be picking you up tomorrow night when you\u2019re supposed to be going to Rush with Fiona?\u201d Aiden asked, his tone as cold as the December snow.</p><p>To say I was shocked would be an understatement.</p><p>\u201cYou might try asking nicely first before you go all black-eyed on me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Gwen please tell me, why is Micah going to pick you up?\u201d he asked in a sarcastic, but pleasant voice.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to Rush with us, on an investigation we need to do. There is nothing between him and me anymore and your insecurity isn\u2019t very attractive. For the record, you and I are not an item either. I agreed to go on a couple of dates with you to see if we could become more, so don\u2019t get your boxers in a twist,\u201d I snapped, not at all in the mood to deal with a grumpy vampire.</p><p>He pushed himself between my legs and paused just inches from my face. I could see my reflection in his onyx eyes, and my heart tapped harder with either anticipation or fear, I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>He tilted his head a little to the side and spoke against my lips.</p><p>\u201cOnce I have claimed something, I don\u2019t let it go easily, and I\u2019ve claimed you.\u201d His breath caressed my skin as his words did funny things to my center. I knew Aiden, and he wasn\u2019t malicious or controlling in any form of the word. Vampires tended to be really territorial, and this vampire had declared me as his. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure how I felt about Aiden\u2019s words. On the one hand, his lust for me was hot as hell, but on the other hand, I hated that he made me feel like property. Before I could think of a snide comeback of my own, he kissed me. His lips were soft at first, like a breeze against my skin. But when I didn\u2019t kiss him back, his lips demanded cooperation. When he kissed me that way, I knew he meant what he had said, that I was his. This wasn\u2019t just lust overtaking his emotions, it was passion.</p><p>My libido overthrew any anger I had. I kissed him back with as much passion as he gave. I wrapped my arms around his neck and held him closer; afraid he\u2019d vanish if I didn\u2019t. He broke away from my swollen lips, showing his fangs had descended. He quickly pulled me up and onto him, his hardness yearning to break free underneath me.</p><p>Untying my robe, he licked his lips as he appreciated my bare breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou are absolutely delicious, my Gwen,\u201d he said. His hands cupped my ass while his tongue did circles around my excited nipples. I moaned through my desire and arched my back, sending my lower region to press harder against his erection. He growled deep in his throat and I felt the tips of his fangs scrape against my skin, sending fear to overthrow my lust.</p><p>I tried to get off his lap but he pulled me back down and, placing his hands on my hips, moved me against himself. Fire rocketed from in between my legs and up throughout my body.</p><p>What was it that I was afraid of again?</p><p>With vampire speed, he picked me up and before I realized it, we were in my bedroom. Aiden set me on the bed and watched me with unadulterated need. He stood at the footboard and watched me so intently, I started to scoot towards the headboard. Before I could reach it though, he grabbed my leg and pulled me, so that I was lying flat on my back, with my robe wide open, clad in only a black pair of panties. Starting at my ankles, he ran his hands the entire length of my body, sending every nerve ending to sit up and pay attention.</p><p>\u201cAiden, I don\u2019t think this is the right time for this,\u201d I reluctantly told him. He was in the process of pressing kisses up my leg and spoke against my skin. \u201cI\u2019ll need a good reason if you want me to stop,\u201d he said, as he continued to kiss my inner thigh. He was dangerously close to the one spot that would make me lose all protest. I enjoyed him for a few more seconds but pushed through the fog of horniness.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like our first time should be right after I come back from being unconscious and with my roommate right next door.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and hesitated, as if it were pure torture to stop his seduction. \u201cI\u2019ll only stop on one condition, otherwise I\u2019ll have you so fast your head will spin,\u201d he threatened.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the condition?\u201d I asked with caution.</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019re mine and only mine. Tell me that I\u2019m the only man who can taste you.\u201d</p><p>His words only turned me on more, was that his plan?</p><p>I took too long to answer so he stripped off all of his clothes in record time and I gasped at seeing him completely naked. His length was impressive and had me second guessing why I wanted to stop, Fiona wouldn\u2019t hear us if we continued, right?</p><p>He grabbed my arm and pulled me to my feet, causing our naked bodies to press against each other, so that his massive erection teased my stomach.</p><p>\u201cAiden,\u201d I said in warning.</p><p>He turned me around so that my back was pressed against his chest and reached a hand around to slip his fingers under my panties, as he played with the dark curls.</p><p>\u201cStop, Aiden,\u201d I told him, but my tone lacked conviction.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Gwen and I\u2019ll stop, or perhaps you don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>If I said it then he\u2019d win, he would get me to admit that we were actually a couple and I was his. Being very competitive, I had trouble with losing. But if he kept playing between my legs, I wasn\u2019t going to be able to stop this and I could hear Fiona in the bathroom, which meant she would be able to hear us. Call me crazy, but I don\u2019t like witnesses when I am intimate with a guy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Aiden said as he ripped my panties in two. They fell to the floor as if they were leaves falling from an autumn branch. I gasped when I felt the tip of his hardness edge closer between my legs.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2018re right,\u201d I shrieked, but he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Gwen, say you\u2019re mine!\u201d His lips were very close to my ear and I could feel the dominance in his tone as he pushed himself closer to my center. My head and my libido were at war with each other, as they contemplated what we really wanted. It would be so easy to let him take me right there and worry about the jabs Fiona would send my way later, but the humiliation wasn\u2019t really worth it, was it?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Aiden and no one else\u2019s,\u201d I reluctantly admitted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m the only one who can taste you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only one who will touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYES!\u201d I shrieked in annoyance.</p> <p>Aiden laughed and stopped his interrogation, \u201cOkay, okay, you don\u2019t have to yell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such an asshole,\u201d I told him with a frustrated smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m your asshole,\u201d he said, sending me a wink.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t really going to keep going if I didn\u2019t say it, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m not a monster, Gwen,\u201d he laughed in victory and pressed a kiss to my lips before retrieving my bathrobe and placing it over my shoulders. \u201cSuch a shame to cover a canvas as beautiful as yours,\u201d he said with a headshake.</p><p>\u201cRight back at cha,\u201d I said as I held his boxers out to him. I had literally just started seeing Aiden, but I felt really comfortable around him, even butt naked. We\u2019d been friends for two years sure, but I\u2019d never moved this fast with a guy before. He was vexatious, egotistical, and a smart ass; but for some unknown reason, it only made him more attractive in my eyes. Of course, his romantic side didn\u2019t hurt either.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow. I have to check in with Vain,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHas your friend sent you a sample of brew yet?\u201d Just saying that word was like a punch in the gut. I knew vampires drank blood, but when they took it as far as killing, especially witches, then I took it personally. I wondered why Aiden even knew someone like that, but I was afraid to ask, afraid of what I\u2019d find out.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, you\u2019ll be the first person to know as soon as the shipment comes.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head, hoping the shipment never came. I\u2019d have to ask Micah and Wyatt if they knew of any witches being murdered in Chicago since the vampires up there were obviously brew addicts. If they weren\u2019t stopped soon, we\u2019d have a big problem on our hands. I didn\u2019t want to have to watch over my shoulder for potential witch poachers.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep, Gwen,\u201d Aiden said, kissing me softly on the lips.</p><p>Aura jumped onto the bed once Aiden left and I intertwined my fingers into her long, dark fur. Having her beside me put me at ease, as if she were the missing puzzle piece that I was lacking. The last thing I remember was the rumbling of her purring reverberating against my hand, and then I was out like a light.</p><p>8</p><p>My morning had been nothing but hectic since I set foot out of my apartment. Tourists were arriving so the streets were flooded with humans pointing cameras at everything and everyone.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t spent a lot of time at Broomsticks since I\u2019d been helping the FPD, so some of my inventory was still unpacked and in cardboard boxes. I had at least fifteen people browsing my shop and Penny was running late.</p><p>A girl accidentally broke a potion vial and was engulfed in dark purple clouds. Her mother screamed and tried to vigorously fan the clouds away, but they didn\u2019t budge. Coming around the counter quickly, I picked up the broken vial and the label read, Old Bitty. I breathed a sigh of relief, this spell was easily countered.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, everything is going to be fine. She isn\u2019t in danger,\u201d I told the hysterical mother. When the eggplant colored clouds dispersed, the girl who was only twelve now looked to be seventy. Her long strawberry blonde hair had been replaced in a waterfall of gray. Her flawless young skin now had deep, wrinkled valleys and her blue eyes held wisdom she had yet to learn.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d The mother shrieked. Everyone in the store had formed a circle around the mother and daughter and gasped at the change in the young girl\u2019s appearance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple age manipulation spell. Have your daughter drink this,\u201d I handed her a bright yellow liquid that she took with uncertainty. \u201cIt\u2019s the counter to that spell; she\u2019ll be as good as new within five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a picture first, Mom,\u201d the young girl said. Her mother looked at her like she\u2019d lost her mind but pulled out a small digital camera and snapped a picture.</p><p>The girl poured the yellow potion into her mouth. We watched as yellow smoke twirled around her small frame. Although I knew everything would be all right, I felt horrible for the mother. I could see she was afraid for her daughter\u2019s safety. I produced a tissue magically and handed it to the distraught woman.</p><p>Within seconds, the smoke faded to reveal the young girl back to normal. Her mother enveloped her in a hug and the surrounding witnesses all clapped.</p><p>\u201cPlease feel free to pick something out, it\u2019s on the house,\u201d I told her. Luckily after her daughter was safe, the woman was fine and held no animosity toward witches, or me in general. There are people who would have wanted to burn me at the stake over something like that.</p><p>Penny showed up an hour later, allowing me to take a moment to actually breathe. I could see a significant difference to the shelves, a lot emptier than when I opened in the morning, and it was only noon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was late, Gwen. I just found out a friend of mine died,\u201d Penny said. I had been so busy that when I stopped to look at her, I noticed her eyes were red and puffy.</p><p>\u201cOh Penny, I\u2019m so sorry. Why didn\u2019t you just call in? I would have understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to stay busy and you need the help,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t be at home right now. All everyone is talking about there is Bridget\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open and I stared wide-eyed at Penny. Bridget wasn\u2019t a common name. It had to have been the same Bridget that Wyatt and Micah found in the park.</p><p>\u201cBridget Downing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Penny gave me a strange look and said, \u201cYeah. How\u2019d you know? It\u2019s not in the newspapers yet.\u201d</p><p>How was I supposed to tell her that I had seen where her friend\u2019s body had been dumped and that I had seen her final memories? The FPD didn\u2019t want anyone to know about brew and if I told Penny that I was working with the police then she\u2019d want to know why, after all, I\u2019m just a shop owner. I don\u2019t advertise my rare gift.</p><p>\u201cMy ex-boyfriend works for the FPD; he mentioned it last night,\u201d I said, not lying completely. \u201cHe wanted to know if I knew who she was but I hadn\u2019t heard of her, was she from Flora?\u201d</p><p>Penny relaxed slightly. \u201cYeah, she was my babysitter when I was younger and I always thought of her as a sister. I can\u2019t believe what happened to her.\u201d</p><p>My motivation to find the sicko responsible for the murders just skyrocketed. Of course, it was horrible that two witches had been drained, but finding out that one of them was close to someone I knew, really jumpstarted my anger.</p><p>I wondered why this hadn\u2019t gotten out to the otherworldly public yet. Brew is addictive, according to the FPD, so why weren\u2019t hundreds of witches turning up dead? Hopefully we\u2019d find some answers tonight in Hemlock. Fiona still didn\u2019t know that Micah would be going with us. She planned on tonight being a girls\u2019 night out; how was I supposed to tell her that I had to investigate?</p><p>Five hours later, and I was happily closing the shop for the night. I loved all of the business but was too anxious for tonight to really concentrate with the chatty humans that swarmed my store.</p><p>Before stopping home, I swung by Andy\u2019s shop to pick up Fiona\u2019s dress, as her voicemail had so eagerly demanded that I do. I had to park a million miles away because the streets were lined with cars that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be there. Tourists still strolled the sidewalks, looking in shop windows and snapping pictures of Flora\u2019s residents. I shook my head in annoyance and pushed through the crowd.</p><p>Andy\u2019s shop, Fairy Fabulous, was desolate compared to Broomsticks. I guess the tourists didn\u2019t need new digs as much as they needed frivolous potions and enchanted items.</p><p>I\u2019d been in Andy\u2019s shop a handful of times but was always shocked at how beautiful it was. The floors were covered in rich hardwood, the walls painted a deep purple with copper damask stenciling. He had installed three crystal chandeliers that hung by chocolate brown velvet ropes.</p><p>Forget the run-of-the-mill racks that you find in every other store, Andy displayed all of his gowns on mannequins. Somehow he had positioned a mannequin so that it looked like she was coming through a mural on the wall of an eighteenth century bedchamber. She wore a long, midnight blue gown, made of some sort of sateen fabric and her long blonde hair was intricately braided.</p><p>The floor was set up as if a masquerade ball was occurring. Plastic dummies looped arms and because of their beauty, they almost looked real. The women wore breathtaking gowns, (that was Andy\u2019s niche), while the males wore tuxedoes.</p><p>\u201cAh, Gwen. So nice to see you,\u201d Andy said, noticing me gawking in awe at the masterpiece that was his store. He was a good looking guy, blonde hair that looked like it was bleached by the sun, violet eyes, and cheekbones that would\u2019ve made even the Roman gods envious. He stood around my height, five foot nine, and was dressed to impress, as usual.</p><p>\u201cHey Andy. Your store amazes me every time I see it; it\u2019s absolutely beautiful.\u201d Fairies were good at everything when it came to creativity, whether it was folding napkins, or creating clothes so beautiful, they made royalty jealous.</p><p>Looking at him, most would assume he were gay. He\u2019s not, just metro sexual. He once said that the reason he was so good at what he did was because he appreciated the female body so much. It made me blush at the time, but maybe he had a point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe only beauty I see is before me,\u201d Andy said. He could smooth talk practically anyone out of their panties. Except me.</p><p>We had gone on a date once and, although he\u2019s beautiful and charming, I could see right through his web of charisma. I\u2019m convinced that the phrase player was specifically named after him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to pick up Fiona\u2019s dress,\u201d I told him, ignoring his compliment.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said with a head nod. Andy went into the back of the store to retrieve Fiona\u2019s dress while I walked through the maze of lifelike mannequins, running my fingertips along the exquisite fabric.</p><p>My phone rang, echoing Paramore\u2019s \u201cHeart\u201d through the empty store.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to pick up my dress,\u201d Fiona\u2019s overly excited voice said.</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAwesome! Now maybe you can tell me why Micah is standing in our kitchen waiting for you?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip at her displeased tone. \u201cThere is someone in Hemlock we need to talk to who might have known Amy Harper.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019d contact the guy myself, but he insists on coming along. Plus we think Rush might serve...might hold some answers to our many questions.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at the near miss of mentioning brew, but luckily Fiona hadn\u2019t caught it.</p><p>\u201cHow are we supposed to have fun with an uptight Micah acting as a third wheel?\u201d Her voice was on the verge of being whiney.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll investigate and then you and I will have some drinks and dance. Micah will just have to deal with it.\u201d A thought occurred to me, what were we going to do with Fiona while we were investigating? We couldn\u2019t leave her alone in the club. I gritted my teeth because I knew of one way to keep her safe while Micah and I were questioning Anthony, but I doubted she would like it.</p><p>\u201cUm, Fiona, I think Aiden should go with us too.\u201d</p><p>She released an irritated sigh and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t all of your love interests come, geez, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitches are being murdered, Fiona, I think that\u2019s more important than shaking our asses to Beyonce. Aiden needs to come so that you\u2019re not left alone while Micah and I question the guy,\u201d I spat out; annoyed that she was being so difficult.</p><p>\u201cFine, but you\u2019re buying my drinks all night to make it up to me,\u201d she compromised and then I heard the click of the call ending. I flipped my phone shut with a little more pressure than I meant to. I hoped that Fiona\u2019s date with Liam would go really well tomorrow night, that girl needed a distraction.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d Andy said holding out a white garment bag.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said as I grabbed the bag. \u201c\u2019Night Andy.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to just throw her dress into the back of my Jeep but that would be immature, so I carefully laid it across the backseat and headed for home.</p> <p>I flipped my cell phone open and dialed Aiden; he would\u2019ve been awake for an hour now.</p><p>\u201cYes, my Gwen?</p><p>I felt slightly embarrassed about what had happened between us the night before but not enough to let it bother me. He was gorgeous and I was single, so we hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.</p><p>\u201cAre you busy tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, are you planning our first official date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to Hemlock tonight with Fiona and Micah. I wanted to know if you\u2019d do me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, how could I forget that you\u2019ll be with Micah tonight. What is this favor, my Gwen?\u201d he asked, his voice only slightly annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI need you to come with us so that Fiona won\u2019t be alone while we question someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to baby-sit while you go off with your ex?\u201d</p><p>I cringed, not because he sounded mad, but because what I was asking sounded really bad. I was one hundred percent sure I was over Micah and interested in Aiden, but I was doing a lousy job of showing it.</p><p>\u201cJust for a short time and then we can spend the rest of the night dancing,\u201d I told him, hoping that would be enough to entice him.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise me some really good dancing, maybe a lap dance?\u201d I could hear the amusement in his voice. I cringed at the thought of grinding on top of Aiden in a room full of people.</p><p>\u201cPossibly, I wouldn\u2019t risk not coming if I were you!\u201d I could play games just as well as he could.</p><p>\u201cConsider me intrigued,\u201d he said, his voice low and sexy. A flashback to our intimacy the previous night invaded my mind and sent chills racing through my entire body. He had that effect over me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pulling into the apartment complex right now. We\u2019re leaving within the hour,\u201d I told him and then I flipped my phone shut. Grinning like an adolescent girl. I grabbed Fiona\u2019s dress and headed up the concrete stairs.</p><p>She had the stereo blaring, so when I opened the door, I was hit with the thumping bass line to some kind of techno song. I threw my purse and jacket on the kitchen table and made my way back to Fiona\u2019s bedroom. She was in the process of standing in front of her full-length mirror and trying on different outfits. One minute she was wearing a skimpy red dress and then it was instantly replaced with a sparkly white one. Magic was a sure way to save a girl time when it came to choosing an outfit.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the best friend in the whole world?\u201d I said as I held out the heavy garment bag. She gave her reflection one last glance and then shifted it to me. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, grabbing the bag out of my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still pissed at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would I be pissed at you? I mean, I planned for tonight to be a girls\u2019 night out and then I learn that not only is it not going to be just the girls, but you invited your ex-boyfriend as well as your new boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I knew she was really pissed because she flung her custom made dress from Andy onto her bed. Under normal circumstances, she would have taken it out and admired it before carefully placing it back in the bag and hanging it up.</p><p>Fiona and I used to go out all the time when we were younger and liked to party. But since breaking up with Micah and opening my shop I hadn\u2019t gone to a club in almost two years. She wasn\u2019t so upset that guys were going with us; it was the fact that she wouldn\u2019t have my attention all night. We wouldn\u2019t be able to dance together or hit on cute guys together, she\u2019d be the odd man out.</p><p>\u201cLook I\u2019m really sorry. I told Micah that I couldn\u2019t go with him to Hemlock because I had plans with you tonight but he planned on going at night anyway, so he invited himself. The interview shouldn\u2019t take that long and then we\u2019ll have the whole night free to have fun, I promise. The only reason Aiden is going is because I want you to be safe. Amy Harper was from Hemlock, so whoever killed her could be from there too and we could be targeted,\u201d I explained, hoping this would be the end of it. Fiona had a hard time seeing the big picture because she lived in the now. She wouldn\u2019t worry about being caught by the murderer, until she was caught.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t mean to be so bitchy. I guess when my father told me that I was too old to still be single, it got to me. I wanted to have a fun night like we used to, so I still felt young,\u201d she said, her words winding down to only a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only twenty-six. If we\u2019re still single when we\u2019re forty, then you can worry. You should know not to let anything your father says bother you.\u201d I threw an arm around her shoulder and pulled her into a hug. I could feel her tightened muscles instantly relax and she leaned her head on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d go with the red dress,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Ten minutes later, after scarfing down a turkey sandwich, it was my turn to try on outfits. I couldn\u2019t really go all out club glam because I had to look semi-professional. I didn\u2019t want to show up in a mini and stilettos to our interview, that wouldn\u2019t be a good first impression. Deciding on a pair of black skinny jeans, red halter top, cropped black leather jacket, and a red pair of Manolo Blahniks I borrowed from Fiona. I left my long dark locks down so that they flowed down my back and magicked my makeup. I hated putting it on myself.</p><p>Content with my appearance, I headed back to the kitchen. Micah and Aiden had both arrived, looking a little testy to be standing so closely to each other. It\u2019s a myth that vampires and werewolves are mortal enemies. I\u2019ve known a lot of vampires who dated weres. In terms of Micah and Aiden, it was simple; they just didn\u2019t like each other.</p><p>Micah was dressed in dark washed jeans that looked brand new. His shirt clung tightly to his broad chest, naturally muscular from being a were with an incredible alpha line.</p><p>Aiden was dressed completely opposite. He wore black pinstripe dress pants with a turquoise dress shirt that had the first two buttons undone, showcasing his smooth toned chest. His dark hair framed his face and contrasted beautifully against his blue eyes. \u201cHey guys, looking good,\u201d I told them as I went to get a bottled water from the fridge. Arms wrapped around my waist and pulled me against the hardness of a chest. Even if it wasn\u2019t obvious, I would have known it was Aiden, even if I was blindfolded. His energy affected me like nothing else. The scent of spices and soap wafted all around my body and I inhaled the pleasure of his essence. Aiden always smelled amazing.</p><p>He pulled my hair to one side to reveal my neck. A shiver danced up my spine. He pressed a kiss at the crook of my neck and I leaned against him, forgetting Micah was standing only five feet away.</p><p>Fiona cleared her throat in an overly loud tone, her way of telling us to break it up. I turned to face her and blushed when I noticed Micah staring at me.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are worse than two horny teens,\u201d Fiona said. Aiden chuckled and I wanted to die of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI find it\u2019s hard to contain myself whenever my Gwen\u2019s in the room.\u201d His hand trailed down to rest on my ass and I nudged him with my elbow. He was purposely trying to piss off Micah and although it wasn\u2019t prominent, Micah\u2019s jaw line had tightened the tiniest bit.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, Gwen is a mouth-watering piece of ass; can we get a move on?\u201d Fiona said with humor. If there was ever a person who did not crave the limelight, it was me. I grabbed my purse and gave Aura a head rub before heading for the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>9</p><p>Rush had a long line that wrapped almost around the block. It was only eight o\u2019clock, still early for the club scene to be as busy as it was. We parked a block away and set off toward the red neon sign that seemed to be beckoning us to approach. It sounded strange to get the heebie-jeebies from a sign, but everything about the club set me on high alert.</p><p>After waiting for what seemed like an eternity, it was finally our turn for admittance. The bouncer, who I suspected had been a bodybuilder before being turned vampire, inspected me and Fiona\u2019s I.Ds. carefully. Micah and Aiden were ushered inside with a nod of his shaved head. In the few otherworldly communities that existed in the United States, it was law that our species be listed on our driver\u2019s licenses. Mr. big, bald, bouncer guy seemed overly excited that two witches were willingly walking into Rush. I figured there would only be one reason they\u2019d be excited about witches, and it had everything to do with brew.</p> <p>The meathead stamped both of our hands with an ink I couldn\u2019t see; maybe it showed up under a black light? With a sly grin, Fiona and I were also given the head nod to enter. The fact that the bouncer\u2019s fangs had peeked out ever so slightly, should have been a warning that this night wasn\u2019t going to go as smoothly as I had hoped.</p><p>The inside of Rush was dark. Green and blue laser lights pulsated in sync with the loud techno music while the entire floor was alive with gyrating bodies. Only their shadows were visible, lending a sort of eerie feeling. I could tell there was a balcony that surrounded the entire floor, but I couldn\u2019t see who or what was up there.</p><p>During the car ride, we agreed that Micah and I would pretend to be a couple, while Aiden and Fiona would do the same. Aiden had not been happy about it, but since they would be left at the club while Micah and I went to interview Anthony, it was the logical thing to do.</p><p>Micah wrapped a protective arm around my waist and I felt the tiniest bit safer with it there. Aiden caught the motion and his fangs descended as he stared bullets at Micah. I gave him a look that said he\u2019d better knock it off. It wouldn\u2019t be helpful if our covers were blown within the first couple of minutes. Reluctantly, he pulled his attention away from Micah and wrapped his arm around Fiona.</p><p>Pretending to be normal club goers, we went to the bar and ordered drinks. The bartender, a woman in her early twenties, seemed to be experimenting with her look. Her hair was jet black with hot pink streaks throughout and cut so asymmetrical, it looked like a child had taken scissors to it. I noticed she eyed my hand when I grabbed my mojito and cast a glance up toward the balcony. Weird, I thought.</p> <p>Once everyone had their drinks, we made our way to the dance floor. I could feel bodies pressing up against me while we pushed through the congested crowd. I noticed glowing blue eyes in my peripheral view, so I swiveled my head to get a better look but they were gone. The bar was so dark, I shouldn\u2019t have been able to see anyone\u2019s eyes, let alone eyes that electric blue.</p><p>Finally finding a spot big enough for the four of us, we stopped and started to dance. It was really uncomfortable dancing with Micah, but I focused my mind on the task at hand, instead of the way his hands felt on my body. Within five minutes, the blue eyes appeared in the darkness again, six feet in front of me but I still couldn\u2019t make out who it was or why they were watching me so intently.</p><p>I leaned into Micah, wrapping an arm around his neck so that I could press my lips close to his ear. The music was loud but weres have terrific hearing.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is watching me,\u201d I told him in a whisper. I knew he\u2019d be able to hear me but if I spoke above a whisper, any vampires surrounding us would hear also, and I didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>Pressing his cheek against mine, his lips hovered right next to my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cWho is it? Interested guy or bad guy?\u201d His voice was a little louder because witches don\u2019t have supersonic hearing like vamps and weres. I hoped his words hadn\u2019t triggered any one. I also caught Aiden eyeing us with disgust. His hands were fisted at his sides while he danced, but when he caught my gaze, he slipped an arm around Fiona\u2019s waist and pulled her so close to his body that you couldn\u2019t tell where he began and she ended. Trying to make me jealous?</p> <p>It took me a moment to answer Micah because I was too busy glaring at Aiden. His hips were slowly grinding into Fiona\u2019s while his hands roamed down her sides suggestively. Fiona wasn\u2019t as uncomfortable as she should have been, considering she was practically dry humping my so-called boyfriend right in front of me. And because Aiden was a cocky shit, his eyes were on me the entire time with an arrogant smile on his lips.</p><p>Deciding to ignore his show, I turned my attention back to Micah.</p><p>\u201cI think bad guy. I don\u2019t have any proof except the inner voice in my head telling me something isn\u2019t right.\u201d No one\u2019s eyes should be able to break through the darkness of the club. A nagging thought tugged at my memory and then recollection set in; I had seen those eyes before. When Fiona had the website pulled up, there had been a pair of electric blue eyes at the top of the website. I\u2019d never seen vampires\u2019 eyes turn that color. It left me confused as to what it meant.</p><p>Micah spared a glance at his watch and then leaned closer to speak in my ear again. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to meet Anthony.\u201d I nodded and once we told Aiden and Fiona that we\u2019d only be about an hour, we headed for the door. I quickly drank the rest of my mojito and threw the cup away. I spared one more look toward my best friend and Aiden but was distracted when I saw multiple sets of blue eyes. They seemed to be in various spots all around the club and my heart jackhammered against my ribcage.</p><p>Micah was holding my hand, pulling me towards the front door and I desperately hoped that whatever was going on in Rush, Aiden would be strong enough to resist it.</p><p>Once we were outside, the bouncer dude gave me an incredulous look. I was guessing that the witches that went into Rush, didn\u2019t come out.</p><p>Micah had called almost every Anthony he could find that lived in Hemlock. It wasn\u2019t until the tenth one that he found the Anthony from Amy Harper\u2019s thoughts. We were meeting him at a restaurant called Fannie\u2019s Flapjacks. Hemlock was mainly all otherworldly residents but some humans were allowed to call it home after undergoing a lengthy interview process. Mainly, they were families of witches or donors for vampires. It turned out that Anthony was human and also Amy Harper\u2019s brother.</p><p>Micah turned down a side street and then took another couple of turns before we saw a big sign announcing Fannie\u2019s Flapjacks was just ahead. The parking lot had a few cars. That was good; we would have some privacy to speak with Anthony. Micah had been unusually quiet on the short drive and I didn\u2019t see any reason to start up a conversation. What could I say? It was awkward being around a guy who dumped me just as I was beginning to fall in love with him. Everything about him was a painful reminder to the time my heart was shattered. When Micah had broken up with me it had crushed me. There weren\u2019t any meds I could take for the pain I felt. Time was the only thing that eventually healed me.</p> <p>I heard the click of a door opening and noticed Micah was getting out of the car. Tucking my thoughts back into that dark corner of my mind, I followed suit. The air felt thick and opaque like someone was breathing down my neck. For a Friday night, this part of town wasn\u2019t very active. Only the sound of our feet on the worn parking lot broke the silence.</p><p>Micah held the door open for me and I stepped inside Fannie\u2019s Flapjacks. It looked like any normal mom and pop restaurant. Horrid white paneling, fake wood laminate tables, red vinyl chairs, and black and white tile floor. It looked like whatever money Fannie made from her fabulous flapjacks wasn\u2019t being reinvested in upgrading her restaurant.</p><p>A guy in his mid-twenties waved at us from across the room. Assuming he was Anthony, we walked over to his table. There were evident similarities between Amy and the guy, but nothing that would warrant the conclusion that they were as close as brother and sister.</p><p>\u201cAnthony Sindle?\u201d Micah asked. I looked at the man curiously, not expecting him to have a different last name. Micah saw my confusion and said, \u201cDifferent fathers.\u201d I gave Anthony a small smile and nodded my head.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Anthony said with a nervous look, motioning for us to take the seats in front of him. His hair was strawberry blonde and neatly styled. His features were ordinary, as was his clothing.</p><p>\u201cMr. Sindle, I\u2019m Micah; we talked on the phone. This is Gwen Sparks or Hudson, she works as a consultant with the FPD.\u201d</p><p>Anthony gave both of us a head nod and then shifted his eyes around the room. There were only three other people in the restaurant, not enough to trigger anxiety, but he was nervous about something.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell us about your sister\u2019s attacker?\u201d Micah asked and Anthony brought his eyes back to the table. I could tell that the magic hadn\u2019t chosen him like it had his sister. He was one hundred percent human. He began to speak just as the waitress came over and told us about the specials. We politely declined and she sauntered over to the next table.</p><p>Anthony gave her one last look before turning to us and speaking. \u201cI think it was Ben who killed her but I don\u2019t have any proof,\u201d he said in a voice low enough that I had to strain to listen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the last name?\u201d Micah asked.</p><p>\u201cCrowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you think this Ben Crowly had something to do with Amy\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>Anthony took a drink of his iced tea.</p><p>\u201cHe was her boyfriend and also a vampire. The police said her body had been...drained,\u201d He took a moment to regain his composure. \u201cBen\u2019s a roughneck that Amy met a couple months ago. He constantly drank too much from her and left her almost passed out. It had to have been him.\u201d</p><p>I could tell that Anthony was getting angry so I reached my hand across the table and put it on his. His eyes stared at it for a couple seconds before looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cWe know this isn\u2019t easy for you but whatever you tell us could lead to catching the person responsible for Amy\u2019s death,\u201d I gave him a small smile and pulled my hand away. He released a heavy sigh and seemed to calm down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWas Ben English?\u201d I asked, remembering that the guy who had stuck the needle into Amy\u2019s arm had a thick English accent.</p><p>Anthony shook his head, \u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a vision of an Englishman around Amy,\u201d I said, not telling him that it had actually been Amy\u2019s memories that created my vision. I didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d handle that too well or if he\u2019d want to know every last detail of Amy in her final moments. Either way, it wouldn\u2019t be a good.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she knew anyone from England,\u201d he said. Well, darn, it would have been too easy if this Ben guy were the one with the accent.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell us about Mr. Crowly? Micah asked.</p><p>\u201cBesides him being a dirt bag? He\u2019s from Texas, as far as I know, and was turned vamp only two years ago. I didn\u2019t care for him so I never got to know much about him,\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrown hair that he keeps buzzed close to this head. He has brown eyes and is around my height and build. He dresses in casual clothes, jeans, t-shirt, sneakers or black boots. He usually wears a gold hoop in his right ear and has a tattoo of a crow in between his shoulder blades.\u201d</p> <p>What the hell was Amy Harper doing with a guy like that? She seemed like a nice girl, the type of girl that dated the Ivy League types, not ruffians.</p><p>\u201cThank you Mr. Sindle. We\u2019ll look into contacting Ben Crowly. If there is anything else you think of, please don\u2019t hesitate to call the FPD,\u201d Micah said, standing up and offering his hand to Anthony.</p><p>Once in the car, Micah and I looked at each other. Something wasn\u2019t quite right with that guy and we had both picked up on it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not telling us everything,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI agree. He was nervous about something, maybe whoever killed his sister got to him, made some threats.\u201d Micah said. I didn\u2019t understand. If it had been my sister, I wouldn\u2019t let any thugs scare me into not telling the truth. But Anthony was human and living in an otherworldly city. He didn\u2019t have magical defenses like I did.</p><p>We made our way back to Rush within ten minutes. The line had shortened but not by much. When we went to go inside though, the bouncer stopped us.</p> <p>\u201cWe already paid the cover,\u201d I said, holding up my hand to show the stamp. I looked at Micah\u2019s hand but the bouncer hadn\u2019t stamped his.</p><p>\u201cYou can go in, he can\u2019t,\u201d the bouncer said.</p><p>\u201cBullshit, I know you remember me,\u201d Micah snarled. The bouncer gave a sly smile worthy of making me feel uncomfortable. \u201cLadies only, get lost, dog.\u201d Micah was having a hard time controlling his anger, his wolf simmered just below the surface, waiting to break free. I put my hand on his arm and made him look into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in and get Aiden and Fiona; we\u2019ll meet you out here in ten minutes.\u201d I wasn\u2019t thrilled about going into a club known to serve brew, but I didn\u2019t have a choice. I needed to get Aiden and Fiona out of there.</p><p>Micah pulled out his FPD badge and presented it to the bouncer.</p><p>\u201cFPD, she doesn\u2019t go in without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour badge isn\u2019t a VIP pass, bucko. Go chase some deer and let the pretty lady have some fun,\u201d bouncer guy said as he slid an arm around my waist. My skin crawled when he wrapped his knobby fingers around my waist.</p><p>Micah growled so deeply, that I could see his shirt vibrate against it. If I didn\u2019t do something, he\u2019d end up shifting and things would get uglier than they already were. I called upon my magic and zapped the guy\u2019s hand just enough to make him let go of me. He drew his hand away and shook it as if to put out a fire that didn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>\u201cWhoo, we\u2019ve got a feisty one, fellas,\u201d he said to two other vamps that had come out of the club to serve as his backup. They laughed and appraised me hungrily.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, jackass, touch me again and you\u2019ll lose that hand,\u201d I told him and then turned to head into the club.</p><p>\u201cGwen, I don\u2019t want you going in there alone,\u201d Micah protested.</p><p>I turned to face him and said, \u201cThey left their cell phones in the car. I have to go in. I can handle myself and we\u2019ll be back within minutes.\u201d Ignoring Micah\u2019s qualms about my safety, I proceeded to head into Rush again. I hoped it would be as simple as I had told Micah it would be.</p><p>The techno music had been replaced with alternative; The Kill was currently playing by 30 Seconds to Mars. The lights that flashed overhead had been replaced with a red pulsating light that lent a dangerous feeling to the packed club.</p><p>Trying to find Aiden and Fiona in this heap of darkness was next to impossible, with only the silhouettes of bodies visible. Each person I passed looked at me hungrily. I watched them cautiously but kept moving forward. I felt like I was being stalked. The vampires were eyeing me like I was covered in blood.</p><p>\u201cAiden,\u201d I called, hoping he\u2019d be able to hear me over the loud speakers. I waited ten minutes but he didn\u2019t show. I moved onto the dance floor and noticed the bodies that had been gyrating were now swaying slowly with their heads back and eyes closed. They all moved in sync with each other almost mechanically. I swiveled my body and absorbed the weirdness that I was standing in the middle of.</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>Marilyn Manson\u2019s Sweet Dreams played and the crowd instantly shifted their movements to rocking, almost like a shallow head banging.</p><p>\u201cAiden!\u201d I called a little bit louder, not caring if I drew attention to myself. I could defend myself with magic but not against this many vamps. Arms wrapped around my waist and I was instantly flown away from the dance floor and onto the balcony. I shrieked and struggled but a hand went around my mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Gwen,\u201d Aiden\u2019s voice said into my ear. I released the breath that had caught in my throat and he lowered his hand. He pulled me into a curtained room and I saw that Fiona was passed out on the black velvet couch that sat against the wall. A lot of vampire clubs had privacy rooms for feeding and I didn\u2019t like that Aiden was in one with Fiona.</p><p>I rushed to her side and checked her neck to see if there were any bite marks, but all I saw was clear flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d I asked. Aiden held a finger to his lips to tell me to be quiet and he peeked outside the curtain then walked over to where I sat by Fiona.</p><p>\u201cI think her drink was drugged. I started noticing she was acting funny when we were dancing, but after she had a second drink she became dizzy and I brought her up here where she passed out,\u201d Aiden looked at Fiona\u2019s hand and then at mine and I could tell he noticed something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Fiona were marked,\u201d he said. I looked at my hand and at Fiona\u2019s; they both had a stamp of an eye on them. Micah\u2019s hand had no stamp and neither did Aiden\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMarked for what?\u201d I asked, although I had an idea.</p><p>\u201cBecause you guys are witches, I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re marking you for capture.\u201d Chills broke out along my skin at the memory of the way the bouncer and every other vampire had watched me with more interest than necessary. Fiona and I had been marked like cattle and now we were in the belly of the slaughterhouse.</p><p>I tapped Fiona\u2019s cheek, trying to wake her, but she didn\u2019t even stir. I checked her pulse and was relieved to feel the slow thump of her heartbeat. Aiden was peeking out of the curtain so I stood up and joined him. Women in short skirts and bras were carrying trays of what looked like shot glasses through the crowd. Each person took a glass and threw back the liquid. As soon as their glasses were empty, they dropped them to the floor and within seconds, their eyes turned the bright blue I had seen before.</p><p>\u201cIs it brew?\u201d I asked Aiden.</p><p>\u201cHas to be, I don\u2019t know of any blood that would turn a vampires\u2019 eyes that color.\u201d</p><p>The situation just went to hell in a hand basket. I had no clue how the three of us were going to get out of a club full of vampires tripping on witches\u2019 blood. I could phone Micah and have him call for the cavalry, but I wasn\u2019t sure if even they would be able to handle all of these vampires. I had no clue how brew affect vampires. It seemed it turned them into salivating monsters.</p><p>\u201cCan you make yourself and Fiona invisible? Aiden asked. I gave him an unbelievable look.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no I forgot my cloak of invisibility at home,\u201d I told him sarcastically, \u201cWhat do I look like, Harry Potter?\u201d I know he was trying to think of an easy exit, but my sarcasm boiled to the surface whenever I felt backed into a corner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to hear any ideas you have,\u201d he snapped back. I thought for a couple of minutes and realized I could use magic to remove us from the premises.</p><p>\u201cI might not be able to make us invisible, but I can use glamour,\u201d I told him. Now it was his turn to give me an unbelievable look.</p><p>\u201cGlamour doesn\u2019t work on vampires, Gwen,\u201d he said, as if I were a child he was explaining colors to.</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of glamour, glamour as in appearance. I can change what we look like to them.\u201d</p><p>As far as ideas went, it was the best we had. I got to work, starting with Fiona. I channeled my magic and waved my hands over her body, envisioning her as a young man with skin the color of creamed coffee. Instantly, Fiona\u2019s skin started to darken and her feminine features turned masculine. It only took a couple of minutes before Fiona looked like a Frank.</p><p>We heard footsteps coming closer, so I pushed Aiden onto the other couch and waved my hand over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat...?,\u201d he exclaimed, but I shook my head to tell him to be quiet. I magicked his eyes to change to the electric blue, blending in with the tripped-out vamps, and then I changed my eyes to match. I straddled his lap and planted a kiss onto his surprised lips. He was hesitant at first, but that quickly faded and he began to kiss me back with a different kind of hunger.</p><p>The curtain was pulled back and I turned to face our intruders. To them, we just looked like two vampires tripping on brew and taking advantage of our so-called high. Two women stumbled inside, their eyes bright blue. They giggled and smiled at what they saw, but didn\u2019t leave. They lazily walked over to the couch and plopped themselves down, next to Aiden and me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCare for more company?\u201d The first girl asked. She looked to be in her mid to late thirties. Her hair was cut in a pixie style and bright purple. Her clothing looked like it had been pulled straight from a 80s movie: denim skirt, fishnet stockings that were ripped in various places, and a sweater that had the top cut to hang off her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t share,\u201d I told them with as much aggression as I could scrape up. 80s girl began to stroke Aiden\u2019s arm while the other girl, who had been quiet, began to rub my leg.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him what he wants?\u201d</p> <p>Aiden looked at me and then helped me off his lap. He gave me one last kiss before turning his attention back to the trollop twins. They smiled at him and licked their lips while I stared, dumbfounded. I didn\u2019t know what Aiden was going to do, but if he so much as touched one of them, I\u2019d zap his ass.</p><p>He moved so quickly that all I saw was a blur of motion and then the limp bodies of the two girls, their necks in an awkward position.</p><p>\u201cYou killed them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to, Gwen; they saw what we looked like. If I let them live, it would put you at risk and I\u2019m not going to let that happen,\u201d he said, his voice lacking regret.</p><p>I stared at the two limp bodies in shock. I knew Aiden had probably killed before, since vampires were a predatory species, but to actually see him kill was a different story.</p> <p>\u201cI could have wiped their memories,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cThese are two women who drink witches\u2019 blood, who would kill you just to get a high. Are you telling me they didn\u2019t deserve to die?\u201d</p><p>I understood where he was coming from but it didn\u2019t mean I had to like it. He picked up Fiona and I quickly changed my appearance into a large muscular man. My head was shaved and my black t-shirt was stretched to its limits against my faux muscles. I expected Aiden to make some smart-ass comment but he was silent, maybe worried that I thought of him differently, now that I\u2019d seen him kill.</p><p>I\u2019d worry about that later, Right now; we had to get out of there. We stepped out of the small room and made our way down the stairs. All of the vampires were in some sort of trance. The heavy metal music thumped through the speakers while the vamps rocked to the beat.</p><p>I tried to portray the facial features a big muscular man might have. I drew my eyebrows together and scowled at everyone, hoping I looked more threatening than ridiculous. When we got to the last step, I noticed the barmaids were back with humans in tow. Some vampires were in the middle of having sex on the various couches that lined the wall. I gawked in surprise, but drew my attention back to the exit sign.</p><p>A short black man thrust a human into me and I barely caught her before she collapsed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m finished, now it\u2019s time to find a piece of ass,\u201d he said as he made his way through the out of control crowd. The girl looked up at me with fear and interest. I didn\u2019t say anything to her; instead I grabbed her arm and continued to the exit. She looked like she\u2019d seen better days. The word \u201cjunkie\u201d came to mind when I observed her appearance. Her hair was messy and her clothes looked stained in various places. She was so skinny, her bones were clear against her pale skin.</p><p>I shot a quick glance over my shoulder to see that Aiden was still following. The door was just ahead and it seemed I couldn\u2019t get there quick enough. I picked up my pace and burst through the doors.</p><p>The night air was a blessed relief after being in the stuffy club. Micah was leaning against the building and instantly went on alert when he saw that Aiden had two men with him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Gwen?\u201d he snarled. I waved both of my hands over my body and felt my disguise slip away. The girl shrieked and Micah stared in surprise. I\u2019d have laughed if I hadn\u2019t been so drained from the tension of what I\u2019d just witnessed. If Fiona wanted to get me back to my partying frame of mind, she\u2019d just failed immensely.</p><p>After calming the girl down and casting a forgetful spell, (so she\u2019d stay away from future vampires), we were finally in the car and on our way back to Flora. Fiona was still asleep in the backseat with Aiden. Everyone in the small car seemed to choke on their words. I knew Micah wanted to know what happened, but I was still in shock at everything I\u2019d seen and not in any state of mind to elaborate on the details.</p><p>In my twenty-six years, I had met a lot of vampires but they had all seemed civilized and maybe the ones I knew actually were. The ones I saw tonight, however, the druggies such as they were, were a different story. I couldn\u2019t get over how their bodies swayed with an inhuman grace against the music and the icy blue of their eyes. The way they bit into the humans and the roughness of their sexual desires. In that state, there was nothing human about them; in that state they were beasts.</p><p>The weight that Wyatt had felt drop onto him when he suspected the first murder had to do with brew, now felt like it was sitting comfortably on my shoulders. If brew was addictive, how long before every young vampire started drinking it? How long before witches became their main target? How long before the Witches Council took matters into their own hands and a war between our two species arose?</p><p>There was a short scream from the backseat and I turned to see what had happened. Micah swerved but regained control and shot a look through the rearview mirror. Fiona had woken up and was looking at her arms with shock and confusion.</p> <p>\u201cGive me a mirror,\u201d she said as she observed her hands. I fished through my purse and pulled out a small compact to hand to her. Once she opened it though, it began to recite a poem to her. After the enchanted mirror finished sweet-talking her, she closed it and everyone in the car looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? They\u2019re new at the store and I thought they were cool,\u201d I said, defending a very embarrassing moment.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I look like, Taye Diggs?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a glamour spell; we had to have a disguise to get out of the club.\u201d Fiona released a heavy sigh and waved her hands over her body, causing the disguise to slip away. She rubbed her head with the palm of her hand and groaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have a hangover from hell in the morning,\u201d she said and then paused to think. \u201cBut I only had two drinks,\u201d she added. I thought about the mojito I had had and didn\u2019t remember it tasting funny or feeling the slightest bit different. Maybe it took two drinks?</p><p>\u201cI think your drink was drugged,\u201d Aiden said to Fiona.</p><p>\u201cWhy would they drug her?\u201d Micah chimed in.</p><p>\u201cGwen and Fiona were both marked. They stamped their hands. I think it\u2019s how they single out the witches and then they drug their drinks so that they can kidnap and bleed them,\u201d Aiden said in a disgusted tone.</p><p>Micah looked at me with a steely gaze and it took me a moment to understand why his anger was directed at me. I bit my lip when I realized that Aiden had just admitted that he knew about brew and that I was the blabbermouth that had told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Fiona asked, concern dripping from her voice. Micah let out a heavy sigh and I shrugged my shoulders at him.</p><p>\u201cAiden\u2019s a vampire; I thought he might have heard something. Plus Fiona should know what\u2019s going on because it is our blood that\u2019s being poached,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t think Micah really wanted to tell Fiona what was going on, but she already knew we were keeping something from her and that cat couldn\u2019t be put back in its bag; she\u2019d nag us until she got her way. I could understand why the FPD wanted to keep this hush-hush, because if the witch population got wind they were being murdered specifically for their blood, all hell would break loose. The FPD wanted to handle this as quickly and quietly as possible but if they didn\u2019t put a stop to it soon, the Witches Council would have no other choice than to intervene.</p><p>\u201cIf I tell her, what\u2019s to say that she won\u2019t run off and tell her father or some other witch who will then turn around and tell someone else? It\u2019s a snowball effect that I\u2019m worried about, since you yourself told someone,\u201d Micah said, sounding aggravated.</p><p>\u201cI only told one person and that\u2019s only because he\u2019s a vampire, someone who I thought could help. I haven\u2019t told any witches and if you\u2019re worried about Fiona telling anyone than I\u2019ll bewitch her gossip pertaining to this topic.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure that Fiona would like to have a spell cast upon her, but it was necessary so that word didn\u2019t get out and cause panic amongst the witches.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m right here, so quit talking like I\u2019m not,\u201d Fiona snapped. I gave her an apologetic smile and waited for Micah to give me the go ahead. His head nod was reluctant but good enough for me.</p><p>\u201cFiona, as Micah has boldly stated, this isn\u2019t public knowledge,\u201d I said with a serious look. She nodded her head and just to make sure the information I was about to spill would in fact stay in the car, I intertwined magic with my words so that Fiona wouldn\u2019t be able to repeat what she\u2019d heard. If she tried to say anything about brew, the words would catch in her throat, unable to form or be uttered by her lips. She had often used this spell on me whenever she wanted to keep a wild weekend that had gotten a little out of hand from leaving my own lips. It was harmless but effective when you wanted secrecy.</p><p>I went on to tell her everything Micah and Wyatt had told me about brew. Her eyes grew wide with the news but she kept quiet so that I could explain everything. Although the FPD wasn\u2019t comfortable with me sharing this news with my best friend, it was for her benefit. Maybe with this news she\u2019d be more careful and consequently, not end up like the other witches, just a body in a ditch.</p><p>\u201cThis is not to be spread around,\u201d Micah said, giving me a warning look.</p><p>I smiled and said, \u201cAsk her what I just told her.\u201d He gave me an unbelievable look but shot Fiona a glance through the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Gwen just tell you?\u201d</p><p>Fiona thought for a moment and then opened her mouth to speak but her lips just closed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you,\u201d she said happily. Micah squinted an eye at her, not quite sold on the fact that I had magically booby-trapped my information. You\u2019d think after dating for eight months he\u2019d realize and understand magic, but Micah\u2019s a cop, and therefore has no faith in things he can\u2019t see. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, Micah,\u201d I said to get his attention back on me. He turned his head to shoot me a look and I smiled. \u201cDid you know that that a duck\u2019s quack doesn\u2019t echo?\u201d Everyone in the car became silent and looked at me like I\u2019d lost my mind. I smiled at Aiden and nodded at Fiona, she knew what I was up to.</p><p>\u201cMicah, what did Gwen just tell you?\u201d Fiona asked. Micah thought for a moment and with certainty opened his mouth to repeat what I had told him, only to have his lips shut and remain quiet. I had laced the information with magic and for that reason, Micah couldn\u2019t repeat what I had told him. I smiled victoriously and Fiona laughed.</p><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a lopsided grin and nodded. For the rest of the car ride home, we discussed brew and by the time Micah pulled in front of our apartment building, I was feeling depressed. It didn\u2019t help my mood when the happy tourists were still roaming the streets at midnight. Most sane humans wouldn\u2019t be out this late at night, but the vampire wannabes and the men and women looking for vampire romance, like the ones they\u2019d read in so many books, still trolled the streets.</p><p>Fiona and I got out of the car and headed for our apartment but I noticed Aiden staring at a group of women walking across the park. He had to feed every other day so today must be feeding time. It wasn\u2019t illegal to feed on humans in Flora so long as the human was consenting and no vampire glamour was used. He noticed my glare and gave me a sly smile that I wasn\u2019t in the mood to return. Whether dealing with a werewolf or vampire, there would always be stipulations. Maybe a nice human boy would be the smarter choice for my heart. If I dated a human guy, then we could eat together, have children together, and be on the same sleeping schedule.</p><p>I let out a heavy sigh and turned to walk up the concrete stairs with Fiona trailing. After showering and eating some leftover pizza, I headed for bed. Tomorrow was the beginning of Founders Day and I would need my sleep to deal with the bustling crowds. Fiona and I hadn\u2019t talked much since returning home. Maybe she was realizing the severity of the situation. I drifted off to sleep, those electric blue eyes haunting my dreams.</p><p>10</p><p>The old farmhouse looked as decrepit as I remembered. I was standing in what would be the living room, surrounded by a sea of stacked newspapers. I wasn\u2019t as scared this time, since I knew what was going on. I looked for the spirit I had seen before but I was alone at the moment.</p> <p>I scanned the dates on the papers that stood in stacks all over the musty worn carpet. The first paper was from 1980 and a picture of Bridget Downing stared back at me. She was young, probably only seven. The article went on to say that this little girl had used magic in her second grade class.</p><p>The Otherworldly Revelation happened in 1983, so Bridget had been discovered three years prior to the world finding out about us non-humans. From the articles, it seemed the world was in an uproar over a seven-year-old magic user. Most didn\u2019t believe such a thing could be real and attacked the school and media for treating Bridget like a science project.</p><p>I flipped through the other papers and discovered they were all about Bridget and the Otherworldly Revelation. I caught a dark shadow out of the corner of my eye and swiveled my head in the direction.</p><p>\u201cBridget?\u201d I called to the emptiness. There was a doorway leading into the kitchen that I could see, the moonlight lending enough glow to illuminate the house. I stood up and walked toward where I had seen the silhouette. The kitchen was small and looked like it had been built in the seventies, orange countertop, cracked yellow linoleum, and dark wood cabinets. A small table sat against the wall and sitting in one of the worn chairs was Bridget\u2019s ghost.</p><p>I froze momentarily and then remembered that she didn\u2019t want to harm me. I\u2019d always heard from witches with psychic abilities that ghosts just have unfinished business; maybe Bridget needed my help.</p><p>\u201cBridget?\u201d I said again. She had been looking down at her hands that were folded in her lap, but looked up at the mention of her name. She was no longer just a figure of gray. I could make out the woman I had seen lying at the edge of the forest.</p> <p>\u201cDid you want to tell me what happened to you?\u201d She watched me with confusion. Maybe she didn\u2019t remember what happened; maybe she didn\u2019t realize she was dead. I had no clue how to handle a ghost who seemed to pull me away from my reality and into the ghostly plain.</p><p>\u201cHe was watching me,\u201d she said, her voice sounding garbled. Her eyes were wide with what looked like fear, so much that I actually turned around to see if someone was standing behind me. After realizing the empty living room was the only thing behind me, I turned my attention back to Bridget.</p><p>\u201cWho was watching you?\u201d I asked. I needed more information and I wasn\u2019t sure if her spirit was strong enough to give it to me. It had only been a day since her death so her spirit could still be confused. When she didn\u2019t answer, I walked a little closer to where she sat and knelt on a bended knee until I was at eye level with her.</p><p>\u201cBridget, who was watching you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire,\u201d she responded.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name Bridget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEngland.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d I tried again. She began to waver like a heat mirage and I knew that she\u2019d soon disappear. I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d see her again and I needed to know who killed her.</p> <p>\u201cWho killed you?\u201d I said louder. She held out a faltering hand and I grabbed it without hesitation this time. White noise filled my head and I tried to discern anything useful.</p><p>A scene played within my memory, of a warehouse, just like the one I\u2019d seen with Amy Harper. A man in jeans and a dark, zip-up hoodie was standing at the end of a cot and I could just make out his voice when he spoke to someone behind him. His accent was English.</p><p>My eyes shot open and I stared at my bedroom ceiling. Aura was lying on my chest staring at me as if she knew what I\u2019d just witnessed and, most likely, she did. The man I\u2019d seen from Amy Harper\u2019s memory was the same man Bridget had shown me. Whoever this vampire was, he had a strong English accent. You might think that would be an easy thing to track but most vampires were older than the United States so most have accents to begin with. Aiden was born in Florence, Italy but had been in the United States for so long that he\u2019d learned to speak without an accent, making him sound American. I had a feeling, though, that if I were around this specific vampire, I\u2019d be able to recognize him</p><p>My alarm clock rang out loudly, making me jump. I slapped it so that it would shut off and reluctantly got out of bed. I was abnormally tired, as if I hadn\u2019t slept all night. I went through the motions of showering and dressing, but still couldn\u2019t wake up.</p><p>At the shop, I lazily watched customers buzz around the glass shelves as they looked at all of the otherworldly goods. Penny had been talking to me about some new band and I caught myself saying a lot of \u201cuh-huhs\u201d and \u201cyeahs\u201d. I felt completely drained and even coffee from Espresso Self couldn\u2019t get me out of my funk. I rang and bagged sales in a fog, not thanking or smiling at my customers.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d I heard my name called. I turned to see that Penny was watching me with worried eyes. I sluggishly turned my head to see if the threat was behind me but saw nothing menacing there, just customers.</p><p>\u201cGwen, are you feeling okay?\u201d Penny asked.</p><p>\u201cJust tired.\u201d I shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWere you up late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I got to bed around one in the morning but I still got seven hours of sleep,\u201d I told her. My normal sleep pattern was six hours so I had actually gotten an extra hour in. I usually had a lot of energy, even with only four hours of sleep. I had no clue why I was so tired today.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take your lunch and go see Ms. Ozland; maybe she\u2019ll have a remedy for your sleepiness?\u201d</p><p>I looked around the store; we still had a lot of customers. Penny must have seen the wheels turning in my head because she said, \u201cI can handle the store.\u201d I nodded my head and grabbed my purse that I stowed under the front counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back within forty minutes.\u201d</p><p>I bumped into a few patrons on my way up the block to Ms. Ozland\u2019s house. She lived in a small cottage-style home with a weathered picket fence outlining her property. Worn wood shutters decorated her windows, and brightly colored flowers filled her front yard. She had a handful of pixies that lived in her garden that kept her flowers in bloom all year long.</p><p>I pushed open the wooden gate and walked up the stone walkway. I knocked twice on her rounded door and waited for an answer. It had been rainy and cold all day so I wrapped my arms around myself to preserve any warmth I retained. The front door opened to reveal Ms. Ozland\u2019s petite frame. She was only five-foot-one with long salt and pepper hair. Her eyes were the bluest I\u2019d ever seen and her skin was almost too young for her age of sixty-eight years.</p><p>\u201cGwen, please come in,\u201d she said in a melodic voice. I smiled at her and stepped inside her home. If you\u2019ve ever seen a fairytale cottage in movies, then you have a good idea what Ms. Ozland\u2019s home looked like. Worn wooden floors, exposed beams on the ceiling, very rustic and charming.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the inventory I sent you?\u201d she asked, motioning for me to sit while she poured tea.</p><p>I nodded my head. \u201cYes, thank you. I love the compacts and I have your payment.\u201d I had written the check out the other day and forgot to drop it by, so I handed her the check and lifted my teacup. I didn\u2019t know much about Ms. Ozland, besides her talent for spell casting. As far as I knew, she didn\u2019t have any family in Flora and hardly ever came out of her house.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you need, my dear?\u201d she asked with knowing eyes; maybe she held a little psychic ability? I set the teacup back on the floral saucer and clasped my hands in my lap.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you might have something for exhaustion. I slept last night but I\u2019m still tired,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a visitor last night?\u201d She looked at me through her eyelashes as if she already knew the answer. I thought for a moment, not quite getting what she was saying. I shook my head, </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I was alone last night.\u201d It was odd that old Ms. Ozland was asking about my sex life. Sadly I hadn\u2019t had sex in almost two years, but I wouldn\u2019t tell her that.</p><p>\u201cNot of the solid body sense, girly. I\u2019m talking about the spiritual sense. Your aura is all over the place, purple swirled with dark gray. I\u2019ve only ever seen dark gray with spirit walkers and as far as I know, you\u2019re not one of those, are you?\u201d She strummed her fingers against her knobby knee and waited for an answer. Spirit walkers were few and far between and I hadn\u2019t ever met one. I read about them in the Magic Encyclopedia. They were witches who could jump from our reality into the realm of death and walk amongst the spirits. Not like regular psychics, who could only see spirits, but were prohibited from going where they lurked.</p><p>\u201cI...there is a spirit, Bridget, who\u2019s been visiting me. I had a dream about her last night and the other day it felt as if I were sucked into a dark void where she was. I don\u2019t purposely visit her though. My cat is my link to the spirit world and allows me to read the thoughts of the dead,\u201d I told her.</p> <p>Witches all have special abilities and some are more powerful than others. You had your spell casters, like Ms. Ozland, who made potions and could enchant objects. There were psychics who could communicate with the dead and see glimpses of the future. Seers who could predict the future, and witches who could literally shoot magic from their fingertips. It seemed I had a mixture of abilities, from being able to manipulate and form objects, to producing magic in my hand; but the last, and maybe most rare, was my ability to see glimpses of the memories of the deceased, with the help of Aura. I\u2019d never thought about being the only witch I\u2019d ever known who could see into the memories of the dead. Maybe that was a tiny power of a spirit walker?</p><p>\u201cYour cat can act as a conduit between yourself and the spirit world, but she can not project you into the realm of the death, which I suspect is where you were last night and why you\u2019re so tired today. It takes a lot of practice and energy to walk amongst the dead. It seems you have a little spirit walker in you, and with a little practice, I imagine you\u2019ll find that you can do more than you ever thought you could. Interesting...\u201d Ms Ozland said with awe coloring her tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that I wasn\u2019t in my bed last night, I was actually in what?...the ghostly plain?\u201d The whole thing sounded ludicrous and had me wondering if Ms. Ozland had taken one too many potions that might be affecting her head. I instantly regretted coming to the old woman\u2019s cottage, because if she were right, then my whole world was about to change. I couldn\u2019t say that I was excited about the news. If I were, in fact, some kind of spirit walker, then I\u2019d be treated like a freak in a circus sideshow. Step right up and see one of the last spirit walkers.</p><p>\u201cThat gray swirling within your aura isn\u2019t a fluke my dear, that\u2019s death. The dream you speak of wasn\u2019t a dream, you were in the realm of the spirits,\u201d Ms. Ozland said matter-of-factly. I noticed she was watching me with a sort of curiosity that made me feel like a specimen under a microscope. I rose to leave, still feeling lethargic, but Ms. Ozland held up a hand to stop me. Without saying a word, she went to her rustic kitchen and opened cabinets as she searched for something. I rolled my neck, hoping to ease the tension that had settled within its muscles</p><p>As I waited for Ms. Ozland to find whatever she was looking for, I thought about spirit walkers and why there weren\u2019t many of them. It seemed odd that their gift was a limited commodity. Every being that held magic had gotten it from nature itself. Everything was connected with a web of energy that we could not see. This energy somehow flowed through our veins and allowed us to do amazing things that humans often feared. Maybe since spirit walkers could walk from our reality into a darker dimension, it wasn\u2019t nature\u2019s magic but something else, something more sinister. Gooseflesh broke out along my arms as I had the mental conversation with myself and when Ms. Ozland returned, she was holding what looked like a Zip-loc baggie full of teabags.</p> <p>\u201cYour gift isn\u2019t to be feared, Gwen, it\u2019s a rare and unique magic.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my arms as if it would make the goose bumps disappear. Ms. Ozland was holding the baggie out to me and I accepted with an arched eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an energetic potion you drink in the form of tea. Drink it only when you return from the ghostly plain and need to regain your energy.\u201d I tucked the baggie inside my purse and pulled out my wallet, fully intending to pay Ms. Ozland for her help.</p><p>\u201cHow much do I owe you?\u201d She waved a hand in the air as if to erase my question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy to help one of the few spirit walkers still alive today, free of charge.\u201d I reluctantly tucked my wallet back in my purse and gave her a nervous smile, not completely convinced I was what she said I was.</p><p>The drizzle had turned into a steady rainfall and I cursed myself for not taking my car the short distance. My hair was plastered to my face and my makeup was surely ruined. I picked up my pace as if I could outrun the rain that seemed hell-bent on drowning me. I stopped into Espresso Self, hoping a large mocha and muffin would lend me some energy until I could have a cup of Ms. Ozland\u2019s tea.</p> <p>Broomsticks was nearly empty when I returned. I set down the coffee I\u2019d gotten for Penny and gave her an apologetic smile. All of the shops were closing early tonight for the Founder\u2019s Day Gala and the weather had kept the curious tourists tucked in their hotel rooms. I had to wonder if a resident of Flora wasn\u2019t responsible for the downpour.</p><p>Penny took a sip of her coffee and I wrapped both of my hands around my own cup to absorb all the warmth it offered. With a smile, Penny grabbed a handheld mirror we kept behind the counter and held it out so that my face was reflected in it.</p><p>\u201cDrowned rat on aisle one,\u201d she said with amusement. My mascara ran south and my dark hair clung against my head in a stringy mess. I groaned at my appearance, embarrassed I\u2019d gone into Espresso Self in such a condition. I quickly covered my face with both hands and concentrated on being free of any makeup. When I removed my hands, my face didn\u2019t hold a gram of the stuff. I ran my hands down my hair and willed the strands to be dry. I checked the mirror again and although I now looked like a plain-Jane, it was better than how I looked before.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just conjure an umbrella?\u201d Penny asked, like it was the obvious answer.</p><p>\u201cMy mind\u2019s been in a fog, otherwise I would have, or taken my car like a smart person,\u201d I told her. A man in his forties stepped up to the register and deposited his items on the counter. I let Penny ring him up and waited patiently while she finished the sale. Once he paid and was on his way out, I went to the door and locked it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re closing extra early,\u201d I told Penny. We normally closed at six and today stores were closing at three to allow enough time for everyone to primp for the enormous soiree that evening. I was only closing the shop two hours earlier than usual; I loved being the boss.</p><p>I rushed home, hoping to get a couple hours of sleep, although I was afraid what might happen if I closed my eyes. Would Bridget be waiting to pull me back where she waited in that depressing farmhouse? I still wasn\u2019t convinced that I had anything to do with my visits from her. Wouldn\u2019t I have had some inkling if I were a spirit walker? Unless my ability to read death\u2019s memories was linked to a spirit walker. Once again, I had too many questions and no answers.</p><p>I pulled into my normal parking spot and quickly ran up the stairs to my apartment. I had to push a little harder on the front door to get it to open, the moisture causing it to stick. Surprisingly, the apartment was empty, except for Aura who slept on the arm of the sofa. I shook off my leather jacket and hung it on the rack by the door. There was no telling where Fiona was, she didn\u2019t work. Most likely she was getting pampered at the salon for tonight. A pang of jealously stuck in my gut but I quashed it and went to my bedroom. The party didn\u2019t start until eight so I could get at least two hours of sleep before I had to primp myself.</p> <p>I forced my wet jeans down and stepped out of them and did the same with my shirt, so that I was only wearing my underwear and bra. I climbed into the warmth of my bed and thought I\u2019d literally died and gone to heaven. I couldn\u2019t remember ever being so exhausted. It wasn\u2019t long before my eyes sealed shut and the many questions that floated within my brain were dissolved into oblivion.</p><p>Flashes of memories played through my mind, but not of the spiritual sense. Pictures of Aiden occupied my mind, like a slide show. The flashes stopped on the day we met, two years ago. I was sitting in a caf\u00e9 with my laptop, going over the store\u2019s finances. I could feel someone watching me, that intuitive feeling everyone possesses. I looked up and a slight blush colored my cheeks upon noticing a man with impeccable cheekbones, bright blue eyes, and jet black hair watching me. I gave him a small smile and returned my attention to my computer screen. I couldn\u2019t concentrate on what I was doing though;, I looked up again and saw that he was still watching me. He was, by far, the most beautiful man I\u2019d ever seen. He smiled at me, revealing perfectly white teeth and in response I smiled back. It seemed he was infectious, I couldn\u2019t ignore him. I quickly remembered I already had a very handsome boyfriend, so I gathered my stuff and began to leave. Unless I wanted to walk all the way around the caf\u00e9 to avoid this man\u2019s table, I had to walk right past him.</p><p>Luckily, he didn\u2019t say anything to me when I walked by his table. I released a breath I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been holding and pushed through the doors. I had taken maybe ten steps before I heard a man\u2019s voice say \u201cHey\u201d. I turned around to see if he was talking to me and it was the man from the caf\u00e9. He walked to where I stood and silently laughed. I looked at him sheepishly and waited to find out what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Aiden. When I saw you, I couldn\u2019t risk not introducing myself to such a beautiful woman,\u201d he said, in a voice as smooth as velvet. I laughed nervously and said,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gwen.\u201d I didn\u2019t comment on his compliment, not knowing how to respond. He held out his hand and I looked at it before deciding it was rude to ignore it. I clasped his hand and noticed the lukewarm temperature, he was a vampire. It didn\u2019t matter what he was, he was beautiful to look at. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We held hands a little too long and I quickly pulled free of his grasp. \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Aiden,\u201d I told him and then turned to leave. Once my back was to him, a smile broke out along my lips that I couldn\u2019t restrain.</p><p>\u201cWould you join me for dinner tomorrow night?\u201d he called from behind me. That made my smile widen, knowing that vampires didn\u2019t eat and that he was just trying to see me again. I half turned to face him and his eyes burned into me with a feeling that I couldn\u2019t fathom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m dating someone,\u201d I told him. He nodded his head as if he expected that much.</p> <p>\u201cDinner among new friends then?\u201d I laughed at his persistence but shook my head. I\u2019d only been dating Micah for four months and didn\u2019t want him to think I was cheating on him, especially if he saw how hot Aiden was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI understand, but I will see you again,\u201d Aiden said with certainty. I didn\u2019t question how he\u2019d see me again, since I didn\u2019t give him my phone number or address, but turned and headed for home.</p><p>The memory faded away and was replaced with another. In this one, Micah and I were sitting in Smiths, a bar that set at the edge of town. Smiths was your average sports bar, pool tables toward the back and large flat screen TVs lining the walls, displaying almost every sporting event. Five other of Micah\u2019s pack members circled around the pool table as I concentrated on making my last shot. I sunk the eight ball in the desired pocket and jumped up and down in victory.</p><p>\u201cI let her win,\u201d Micah said with a sly smile. He got a lot of crap from his pack members for a girl beating him and, just as I was finishing rubbing in my victory, I noticed a pair of blue eyes twinkling at me. I shifted my head so that I could see the owner of such mesmerizing eyes and, once the waitress moved out of the way, I saw Aiden sitting on one of the barstools. He raised his glass toward me with an amused smirk.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d Micah grumbled. It had been two months since I met Aiden in the caf\u00e9. I had seen him again, just as he promised, and it didn\u2019t seem like he was going away. It should have bothered me more that I was being followed by a sort of stalker but it didn\u2019t. Aiden wasn\u2019t creepy or scary and it secretly made me giddy to see him in a crowd with his eyes always on me.</p><p>\u201cProbably having a drink, like we are,\u201d I told Micah, but I knew he was here for a more personal reason. I bit my lip to stop a smile from showing on my face and I turned my attention toward the pack members.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d I called, holding out the pool cue.</p><p>The scene faded away and like before, another replaced it. I instantly recognized this memory; it was when Micah broke up with me. Earlier that day, he told me the bad news and, after telling Fiona what happened, she suggested we have a girls\u2019 night in. A mountainous pile of snotty tissues was next to me while I held up a shot glass Fiona had poured for me. I watched it with blurry eyes, and as the tears continued to fall, I downed the whiskey. The taste didn\u2019t even affect me like it had the first couple of times. I was definitely shit-faced. My eyes were red and puffy and my hair was in a messy ponytail atop my head. The phone rang and Fiona stumbled to answer it. I had a sudden urge to get away from everything. I got up and told Fiona I was taking a walk. She shot me a strange look but was too preoccupied and drunk, to care.</p><p>I stumbled down the stairs, luckily not breaking my neck, and headed down the street. It was midnight and most of the town was asleep, except for the vampires. I made my way to Willow Creek Park and collapsed on a park bench. Micah\u2019s pack had come here often to run and I had accompanied him many times. I was lying on my back with my knees bent up, when a face appeared over me. Even in my plastered state, I immediately recognized Aiden. I covered my face, not wanting him to see me looking like the mess that I was. I just wanted to be alone and cry, without any witness who felt sorry for me, or looked as gorgeous as Aiden.</p><p>Aiden swooped me up into his arms. I felt safe in that moment; I lay my head against his chest and allowed him to carry me. I must have fallen asleep because when I opened my eyes again; Aiden was pulling me out of his car and carrying me again. I vaguely remembered seeing a large home but the alcohol was making everything spin.</p> <p>The next thing I saw was me being laid onto a plush bed. Aiden brushed a stray strand of hair out of my face and I gave him a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare shed another tear over a man who\u2019s stupid enough to let you slip through his fingertips.\u201d As if my tear ducts had a rebellious personality of their own, tears began to fall. I dated a handful of guys but Micah was most definitely my first love. The pain was worse than any physical injury and I just wanted it to go away. Aiden\u2019s thumb caressed the salty tear away. My eyelids were heavy from crying and sleepiness. Tired of holding them open, I drifted off to sleep.</p><p>The next memory quickly filed after the last one and Aiden and I were standing within inches of each other in his backyard. I stopped by for a reason I couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he sternly ordered. I turned to look at him, not wanting to see the fire in his eyes that was directed at me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you what you want, Aiden,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even try. You know we\u2019re perfect for each other, you felt it that first night in the caf\u00e9. I want you, Gwen; I knew that at first sight. Don\u2019t let what Micah did ruin what we could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon and I will not go through the heartache again, I can\u2019t.\u201d My voice had started off strong but at the thought of how it felt to have my heart shattered, my voice dwindled to nothing more than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been five months, Gwen,\u201d Aiden said, his voice soft. Tears welled in my eyes and I willed them not to fall but the sons-of-bitches betrayed me and flowed freely down my cheeks. I stared into Aiden\u2019s eyes and wished it were as easy as he wanted it to be. I would love nothing more than to forget all about Micah and see what developed between Aiden and me.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said again softly. Aiden stepped closer and placing a finger under my chin, tilted my face up. I couldn\u2019t look at him so I focused on his yard. The truth of it was that I did have feelings for him, and had since I met him. But that didn\u2019t change the fact that I was currently hurting over Micah. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to Aiden if I agreed to date him while I was still thinking about another man.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cKiss me and if you don\u2019t feel what I\u2019ve been feeling, then I will leave you alone, you\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d</p><p>At his words, I brought my eyes back to his and saw that he was serious. I knew I couldn\u2019t stand not seeing him but I also knew that wouldn\u2019t happen, I felt the same as he did. He leaned down and his lips hovered so close to mine that I could feel his breath caress my skin. I suppressed the shiver that crept along my spine and didn\u2019t move. He softly pressed his lips to mine, just a brush of lips to lips. I closed my eyes and felt his energy swirl around me like he had a million hands beckoning me to give in to him. He sucked on my bottom lip and goose bumps broke out along my arms. He deepened the kiss, his tongue darting into my mouth and I massaged it with my own. He wrapped an arm around my waist and pulled me into the hardness of his chest. We kissed for what seemed like hours but had only been minutes by the time I put my hand on his chest and pushed him away. His eyes had gone black with desire and I stood frozen in place as I replayed what had just happen. My breathing was labored so I took in a deep breath to calm my sporadic heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I told him and quickly left with Aiden watching my retreat.</p><p>My eyes grudgingly opened and I stared at my bedroom wall. My dream had left me sad and confused. The remembrance of Micah wasn\u2019t welcomed and my relationship with Aiden was terrifying. Aiden was definitely close enough to break my heart if he chose to. My dream had made me realize that I\u2019d had feelings for him since day one and those feelings had only become stronger over the years. I had forgotten about most of those memories, I thought, but they\u2019d stayed safely filed away in the corners of my mind, waiting for me to realize what they meant.</p><p>11</p><p>The royal blue dress that Aiden had gotten for me clung to my body as though it were painted on. The bust area showed off a lot of my cleavage and the light captured the Swarovski crystals to make them sparkle like a million diamonds. My hair was pinned up, something I\u2019d seen in a bridal magazine and magically repeated.</p><p>Fiona left twenty minutes earlier, while I sat at our kitchen table and waited for Aiden. I hadn\u2019t spoken to him since the previous night and a small voice inside my head wondered if he\u2019d done more with his dinner than just eat. I heard that a vampire\u2019s bite could drive an orgasm to skyrocket; something in their saliva acted as an aphrodisiac. I also knew that most vampires got turned on whenever they fed. I knew by the way he watched the tourists the night before that he was going to feed, but what else had he done?</p><p>Two small knocks sounded at the door and made my jealous thoughts disappear. I carefully got up from the table, trying not to step on the small train that followed behind me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d I said when I opened the door. I expected Aiden to be standing on the other side of the threshold but it wasn\u2019t him. A tall man with dark blonde hair and crystal blue eyes looked back at me. He was amazingly beautiful and I was momentarily speechless.</p><p>\u201cGwen Sparks?\u201d he asked with a sexy smirk.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Ian. Aiden is running late and asked me to escort you to the Gala.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning late?\u201d I asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cHe apologizes, something to do with business. Shall we?\u201d Ian said, holding out his arm. Aiden owned three businesses and it would make sense that something might have come up, but of all the nights for something to happen! I considered Ian and after debating on whether I should show up with him or by myself, he won. I waved a hand in the air to shut the lights off and then grabbed my small purse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We made small talk while Ian drove his black Mercedes to the party. When we arrived, Ian walked around the car and opened my door, with a hand outstretched to help me out. I gave him a small smile and stepped out. The party was in the middle of the forest that made up Willow Creek Park. That would seem strange to most but in a community full of magical creatures, it was the norm.</p><p>My heels made it hard to traverse the wood-chipped parking lot. Ian held onto me so that I didn\u2019t trip and we made our way to the path entrance. We stepped through a curtain of shimmering white lights to the worn path. It seemed every tree was aglow with twinkling orbs of lights, most likely pixie glitter. A stroll in such magical woods seemed a little too intimate to be sharing with a stranger. I silently grumbled that Aiden had stood me up but only allowed my bad mood to surface for seconds before I reined it in. Tonight was a celebration of Flora and otherworldly existence; and I was going to enjoy myself.</p><p>\u201cYou are very beautiful tonight,\u201d Ian said. I looked up and noticed he was watching me. He was a couple inches taller than I, making him around six foot. His cheekbones were more defined when he smirked at me and his eyes seemed to sparkle as he thought about something I didn\u2019t care to question. A smile escaped my lips and I quickly looked away, unable to stare at him and walk at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told him and then shot him another look. \u201cYou look very nice also.\u201d He was wearing a black pinstripe suit with a black dress shirt underneath and an icy blue tie.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re one of Aiden\u2019s vampires?\u201d In the 615 years Aiden had been a vampire, I knew he had changed a handful of willing people. I\u2019d met a couple of them over the years but there were a lot I hadn\u2019t. Ian chuckled and stared ahead as we neared the entrance of the party.</p><p>\u201cI am over eight-hundred years old. Aiden and I are old friends.\u201d He didn\u2019t comment further. An elf waited at the entrance to the party and upon our arrival, held out a short arm to stop us.</p><p>\u201cName?\u201d he asked with a high-pitched voice.</p><p>\u201cGwen Sparks and Ian Despereaux,\u201d Ian answered. The elf held out a small microphone and waved us through, announcing us as we walked through a screen of purple orbs. All heads turned toward us, making me feel uncomfortable at the attention. It was amazing to see the woods transformed into such a beautiful ballroom. Normally, there isn\u2019t a clearing in the forest but with magic, the trees had been replaced with wood floors. White linen covered tables sat on the right and left while the middle was open for dancing. An orchestra played itself on an upraised stage while aerialist silk dancers twirled and did impressive acrobatics from a ceiling that didn\u2019t exist. The ceiling was just a mirage of ivory and crystal chandeliers.</p> <p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d I said to myself.</p><p>\u201cNot compared to you,\u201d Ian leaned down to say. Who the heck did this guy think he was? He was supposed to be Aiden\u2019s friend but he was hitting on me? I removed my arm from his and took off to find Fiona; I couldn\u2019t deal with Mr. Smooth Talker anymore. I politely pushed through the crowd and searched for my best friend. There were well over three hundred attendants and more coming. Pixies patrolled the perimeter, their wings aglow with pixie glitter.</p><p>I spotted Fiona sitting at one of the tables, looking less than entertained. Her elbow supported her head, a cheek resting in her palm as she stared at the dancers. Liam was in the middle of a discussion with people who looked important.</p><p>\u201cBoo!\u201d I said from behind her. She jumped slightly and I laughed. She looked absolutely beautiful in her light green gown. Her blonde hair was pinned up with a few curly tendrils dangling gracefully against her neck.</p><p>\u201cExcuse us, Liam, we\u2019re getting a drink,\u201d Fiona told her date and then grabbed my hand. We practically flew through the crowd and as far away from her table as possible.</p><p>\u201cThank you for rescuing me,\u201d Fiona said.</p> <p>\u201cNot going well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so boring! If you hadn\u2019t come along I would\u2019ve fallen asleep.\u201d I laughed and grabbed a drink from an elf that was carrying a silver tray full of champagne glasses. The tourists would have had a field day at our little party.</p><p>Witches, vampires, and ogres, oh my!</p><p>The Founder\u2019s Gala was specifically for otherworldly residents though. Fiona was checking her makeup in her compact so I scanned the crowd. I spotted Micah with a brunette woman on his arm. She was pretty enough, just average pretty, but they looked happy together. He caught my glance as I was observing him and his date and I quickly looked away.</p><p>\u201cWill you get over him already? Besides, you have a yummy new vampire to play with,\u201d Fiona said, following my gaze. \u201cSpeaking of, where is Aiden?\u201d I turned my back towards Micah and his new girlfriend and took a sip of my champagne. I knew I was completely over Micah, but I still wasn\u2019t comfortable seeing him or a new woman on his arm.</p><p>\u201cDealing with business supposedly, he sent a chaperone,\u201d I said, pointing at where Ian stood by a tall pillar. His eyes were riveted on me and a slight blush colored my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAiden must be really confident to send someone that looks like that to escort the woman he\u2019s been in love with for two years,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in love,\u201d I argued.</p> <p>\u201cYou might not be, but Aiden\u2019s definitely head over heels in love with you,\u201d Fiona said with a smirk. I shook my head, not ready to believe that Aiden felt that way. I knew I had strong feelings for him, and had since day one, but I couldn\u2019t let myself fall in love, not ever again, if I had anything to say about it. I\u2019d date Aiden and have fun with him but I\u2019d try my damnedest not to say that stupid four-letter word that could cause my heart to shatter again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Fiona asked. I banished my thoughts and brought my attention back to our conversation. She was staring at Ian, her eyes swimming with lustful interest. A small smile broke against my lips; her father would have a heart attack if his daughter dated a vampire.</p><p>\u201cIan Despereaux.\u201d I spared a look at the man in question and saw that he was making his way toward us. He was very good looking but I wasn\u2019t interested in listening to him use cheesy pick-up lines all night. I decided that I would save my anger for Aiden. He was the one who stood me up and left me with a tempting playboy.</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Ian\u2019s smooth voice said from behind me. I looked at Fiona first and saw that she was grinning like a young girl who was face to face with her crush. I rolled my eyes and turned to face Ian, who was smiling just as broadly. Ugh!</p><p>\u201cCare to dance?\u201d Ian asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I said with a bit of attitude. It wasn\u2019t his fault that Aiden had stood me up but did he have to be so gorgeous and flirtatious?</p><p>\u201cI was asking your lovely friend,\u201d he said with a grin. An instant flush colored my cheeks from my embarrassment, but I noticed the interest in his eyes when he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d Fiona said and braided her arm through his. She pulled him toward the dance floor and I jealously watched. I pulled my cell phone out of my small purse and dialed Aiden but after three rings it went to voicemail. I flipped it shut and threw it back into my purse, emptying my champagne glass.</p><p>A half hour later, Fiona was still gliding with Ian on the dance floor while I occupied a chair at an empty table. I was on my third glass of champagne when Micah interrupted my pity party.</p><p>\u201cHaving a good night?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from where my head rested on my hand and said, \u201cHaving a blast, you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at my sarcasm. \u201cThese things aren\u2019t really my thing but I\u2019m expected to attend, being the alpha\u2019s son.\u201d His tone sounded bored and a tad angry. I knew Micah loved his pack, but he hated the politics that came with it. Wyatt was the next in line to become alpha but if anything happened to him, Micah would become alpha, something he didn\u2019t want.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, somewhere,\u201d Micah said. An awkward silence settled between us, neither of us entirely sure how to be around each other yet. I felt better though, with Micah by my side.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to dance, would you?\u201d he asked, shocking me.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t your girlfriend be pissed if we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, unwilling to elaborate further.</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders, unable to find a reason why we couldn\u2019t dance together. We had both moved on and had other people in our lives and I should have at least one dance before I went home and crawled into my bed.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, rising up.</p><p>We stepped onto the dance floor, Micah offering his hand. I grasped it and he placed his other hand on the small of my back. The heat that radiated off him soaked into my skin and a shiver tickled my spine. For reasons unknown, weres always ran hotter than other species. Aiden\u2019s temperature was always lukewarm, not ice cold like a lot of the myths claimed. Vampires only turned ice cold when they were starving and it was dangerous to be around a starving vampire.</p><p>We moved with the crowd, in a sort of waltz. I focused on the movements of my feet instead of the closeness of our bodies or the familiar woodsy scent that clung to Micah. I was very aware that my cleavage was propped up and on display, thanks to Aiden\u2019s choice of dress. I also noticed that Micah\u2019s eyes appreciated the view. I kept my eyes on my surroundings, unable to make eye contact with the man who had broken me.</p><p>The feel of his hand on my lower back, though, kept interrupting my thoughts. I mentally shook the feelings and searched out Fiona and Ian. They had been dancing for a while now and I spotted them directly across from where we were. Fiona smiled up at him like he was the cat\u2019s meow, while he held onto her with his own devilish grin. It was strange that I hadn\u2019t met him before. If he lived in Flora, I should have met him at least once. I knew a lot of the vampires because of Aiden, but I\u2019d never seen Ian before or even heard Aiden mention his name.</p><p>Micah pulled me closer, pressing my body into his. I looked up and noticed that the music had changed to a slow melody. His strong arms enveloped my body, leaving no space between us. Familiar feelings that I thought I had erased completely crept within me like a cold breeze against my skin. We danced for a few seconds before I realized that it wasn\u2019t right. Micah had no business holding me like he was and if I weren\u2019t smart, I\u2019d end up getting hurt all over again. I pushed away from him and without a word, walked off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Someone grabbed my wrist and I whirled around, ready to face Micah. Instead, I found Ian was my captor. He pulled me to him and slid an arm around my waist.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a dance,\u201d he said quietly. Deciding that this was the perfect opportunity to question him, I began to move with him. I noticed Micah\u2019s confused and angry features watching me. He was still standing at the spot I\u2019d left him and once he saw me with Ian, he angrily walked off the dance floor. What the hell was wrong with him?</p><p>I didn\u2019t appreciate the way Ian watched me like I was something to be devoured. Aiden was going to get an earful the next time I saw him. There was something about him that made me nervous. It could be chalked up to how gorgeous he was but I didn\u2019t think that was it. There was something in his eyes, like an inside joke I wasn\u2019t getting.</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you known Aiden?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAlmost a hundred years,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat kept him tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething at Vain,\u201d he said with indifference. I was hoping this question would have let something slip but he seemed confident in what he told me. I found it odd that Aiden hadn\u2019t called me himself to let me know that his friend would be escorting me to the Gala.</p><p>Ian ran his hand up and down the length of my back, sending gooseflesh to break out on my skin. He leaned down so that his lips were close enough to my skin that I could feel his breath. My heart raced at the intimacy of our closeness but I didn\u2019t pull away, simply because I wanted to see if I could find out anything useful.</p> <p>\u201cAiden is a fool to let you out of his sight,\u201d Ian said, his voice thick with either hunger or lust, or both. His lips pressed against my neck and I closed my eyes at the rush of desire that ran wild through my body. He flicked his tongue against my flesh and I visibly shivered, unable to regain my wits. Before I could stop him, his lips were on mine. Common sense finally pushed through the fog of attraction and slapped me silly. I broke the kiss and slapped him across the face, hard. He didn\u2019t react the way I thought a vampire would; instead, he laughed and gave me his devilish glare.</p><p>\u201cAiden will know about this,\u201d I said, warning him.</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>I caught Fiona\u2019s gaze as I made my way off the dance floor and her shock and hurt were apparent. She had fallen for Ian\u2019s smooth talking and had just seen him kiss me. She ran away when she saw that I was coming toward her. Well shit, could the night get any worse?</p><p>I was so over the entire evening, I retrieved my purse and headed for the path that led out of the woods. If I thought I could leave without a problem, I was sorely mistaken. Micah stepped out of the woods and onto the path, blocking my way. He had acted strange on the dance floor and whatever he had to say, I did not want to hear.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were with Aiden,\u201d he said. I took a deep breath so that I could regain my composure because I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene.</p> <p>\u201cI am with Aiden,\u201d I said, pausing. \u201cAnd you\u2019re with someone also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Jamie and I have is...\u201d He stopped to think. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an arrangement than love. It\u2019s not what we had, Gwen. If you\u2019re with Aiden, then why did you kiss the new guy?\u201d He arched an eyebrow as if reprimanding a child, although I doubted whether or not he cared if I cheated on Aiden. I shook my head and crossed my arms. I so did not need this crap right now.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks...about you and Jamie I mean, and I didn\u2019t kiss the new guy, he kissed me. Your detective skills should have made you also notice that I slapped him,\u201d I said, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI did see that.\u201d Micah smiled; suddenly quiet for a few seconds, enough to annoy me even more.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Micah?\u201d He looked up from the beaten path and hesitated to speak. I widened my eyes as a sign to \u201cget on with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Gwen. I know it\u2019s my fault that we\u2019re not together but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t still love you,\u201d he said nervously. Most girls would have loved to hear the man who broke their heart say that they regretted ever doing so, but at the moment, I was not in the mood to ride the emotional rollercoaster with Micah. I had wondered what I would do if Micah wanted me back. The only emotion I felt was anger. Aiden\u2019s face flashed through my mind and I knew that he was the one I should have been with, not Micah. Werewolves were not the committed type to any other species except other werewolves. It didn\u2019t matter that Micah thought he still loved me, it couldn\u2019t work and I wouldn\u2019t chase that fairytale again.</p><p>\u201cMicah...\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, just know that I still love you, Gwen, and being with Jamie won\u2019t change that.\u201d He gave me a small smile and disappeared into the woods, leaving me utterly speechless.</p> <p>12</p><p>Fiona wasn\u2019t home when I arrived back at our apartment. I tried her cell but my call went unanswered. I tried Aiden again but he didn\u2019t pick up either. It seemed everyone I wanted to talk to was ignoring me and the people I didn\u2019t want to talk to were admitting stuff I didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>I carefully hung my dress up and crawled into bed. It was only eleven o\u2019clock but my night hadn\u2019t been the magically romantic evening I had planned on. I let myself think about what Micah said for a couple minutes and then extinguished my intrigue. We both knew that our relationship was a losing battle; our feelings for each other wouldn\u2019t change that. If my life were a movie, Micah would have chosen me over his duties. Sadly, no one\u2019s life turned out like the movies. I felt sorry for Micah, being in a relationship that was more out of convenience than love all because his father expected him to produce purebred were children. The more I thought about what Micah was going through, the more I realized that my life and heartache hadn\u2019t been all that bad. Sure, it sucked that the first guy I really loved had to kick me to the curb for being the wrong species, but at least I didn\u2019t have to marry and have children with someone I didn\u2019t love.</p><p>A fast moving shadow brought me out of my thoughts. I sat up quickly and looked where I had seen the movement in my peripheral. Nothing and no one was there. Easing myself out of my bed, I tiptoed toward my bedroom door. I hadn\u2019t heard the front door, but maybe Fiona had come home while I was lost in my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cFiona?\u201d I called into the hallway. Her bedroom door was wide open and the light was shut off. Taking a deep breath, I stepped out of my bedroom and walked toward the kitchen. The only light came from over the stove and a lamp I\u2019d left on in the living room; both rooms were empty. Confused and a bit frightened, I made my way back to my room. As soon as I stepped into my room, a shadow passed behind me. I felt it more than saw it. I whirled around, backing up toward my bed as I watched my door.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I said to the emptiness.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if really wanted one but it seemed like every time someone was scared in a home they always called out \u201chello\u201d only to be terrified if they actually got a response. I knew I was home alone but I also knew that something else was with me. Aura meowed and nearly gave me a heart attack. When I turned to see what my cat wanted, I noticed she was pawing at the air with a cocked head.</p><p>Chills broke out along my skin as I watched Aura interact with something I couldn\u2019t see. The ceiling light flickered lazily and then more urgently, eventually going completely out, leaving me in darkness. My head felt full and an instant headache ricocheted through my head, sending me to my knees. I grasped both sides of my head with my hands and tried to get a grip on what was happening, but the pain demanded my attention.</p><p>Icy cold pin-pricks caressed my skin and I fell onto my side from the surprise. Dizziness overwhelmed my senses and I could tell I was close to passing out. I tried to conjure the telephone, but the agony wouldn\u2019t allow me to focus on my magic.</p><p>When the pain dulled and the dizziness disappeared, I was lying on cold cement. I squinted my eyes at the new location, unsure if what I was seeing was real or not. I was in a large building with steel walls that were worn. Steel beams spanned the ceiling with large industrial lights hanging from them. Once I got my bearings, I realized I was in a warehouse. The warehouse I\u2019d seen from Amy Harper\u2019s memories.</p><p>A few cots were set up in the middle of the floor while rusty piles of scrap metal and a few broken refrigerators sat in a far corner. Dirty windows lined the entire top of the twenty-foot walls and allowed a small amount of moonlight to penetrate the otherwise dark warehouse. I stood up and stumbled a few steps, still feeling the last waves of dizziness. Closing my eyes, I tried to focus on standing still and shaking the waves of nausea that teased my stomach. When I opened my eyes again, the dizziness had vanished.</p><p>\u201cBridget?\u201d I called, my voice echoing in the empty expanse. The ghostly realm or whatever it was, was quickly becoming annoying. One minute I was at home and the next I was waking up in creepy deserted places. At least I only had one spirit pulling me away and not more. That would be a sure fire way to drive me insane.</p><p>Bridget didn\u2019t answer so I walked hesitantly toward an office-like room. The door gave way and I stepped into the small room. Clipboards with names and numbers sat on a worn desk. I picked one up and scanned the many names but wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I was looking at. When I got about half way down, I froze. In crisp black ink, was the name Aiden Blake. Was this a list of vampires buying brew? If so, what was Aiden\u2019s name doing on it?</p><p>\u201cThis is their headquarters,\u201d a voice said from behind me. I dropped the clipboard and whirled around to face the potential threat. Hovering in the doorway was Bridget. She was more solid than I\u2019d seen her before, the gray giving way to a more colorful hue. I could see the blonde in her hair and the purple of her shirt. Her eyes were filled with sadness and despair, a look I desperately wanted to forget.</p><p>\u201cTheir headquarters?\u201d I repeated, hoping she\u2019d give names. She nodded her head and turned back to look at the cots that sat in the middle of the floor.</p><p>\u201cThe vampires, the ones who are draining witches.\u201d She disappeared before me and reappeared in front of the cots, as if she just teleported. She reached a hand out toward me, so I walked over to where she stood and without hesitation, grasped her hand. I didn\u2019t think too much about how it was possible to touch a spirit. I assumed the same rules didn\u2019t apply in the spirit realm as they did in the living reality. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as I made contact with Bridget, the warehouse awoke and was active. My eyes widened when I saw Bridget laying on one of the cots and a needle sticking out of her arm. Her skin was paler than a vampire\u2019s. She was lying in her bra and a pair of jeans and had bruises on her arms. I looked over to my spirit friend and noticed that her face wavered in and out but, as I watched, I noticed the sadness consume her face, she was crying. I gripped her hand tighter and drew my attention back to the other Bridget. She gave a shallow cough and then her arm fell limply at her side.</p><p>A man walked out of the office over to where she lay. He pressed his ear to her chest and listened for a few seconds before removing the needle and retrieving the bags full of Bridget\u2019s blood. I was so furious at what I was seeing, that I lunged for the man but fell straight through him and landed on my face on the other side of him.</p><p>I picked myself up and followed him toward the back of the warehouse where I saw six other men sitting around a table full of bottles and funnels. It was a blood filling station. Nausea instantly overwhelmed my stomach as I watched the men filling brew orders. All of the men looked ordinary and unfamiliar, all except one. The man I\u2019d seen before in jeans and the zip-up hoodie stood next to the table with a clipboard and checked off names. When he looked up however, his face was blocked to me. Weird. Where his face should have been was a mass of black, like those identity blobs you see in front of peoples\u2019 faces on the news, the ones that don\u2019t want to be identified.</p> <p>I pointed a finger at the hidden man and turned to Bridget.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways hidden from us,\u201d she said, her voice garbled as if she were speaking underwater. The only way he could hide who he was would be to cast a spell. Was the leader of the brew distribution a warlock? Not knowing was killing me! I had seen the man a few times now and still had no clue who or what he was.</p><p>Movement behind me made me turn to see a man lift Bridget\u2019s dead body up and over his shoulder where he carried her to a door. I followed and saw that a van was waiting just outside the building where the man threw Bridget into the back. The van took off. I already knew where her body would end up, in Willow Creek Park. The whole place was absolutely horrible. These men were heartless cowards that deserved to be staked.</p><p>My anger was bubbling when I began to feel dizzy again. The air felt like it was being sucked out of the room me along with it. It felt as if I were floating toward the door when oblivion struck and everything went black, again.</p> <p>13</p><p>The next morning, I woke up on my bedroom floor, right where I had passed out the night before. I was groggy and lethargic but I managed to stand up and make my way to the kitchen where I sat before reaching for the telephone. I didn\u2019t know how, but I knew we had to find that warehouse, because it would lead us to the person behind the operation.</p><p>I dialed Micah\u2019s number and waited for him to answer. After the third ring, a woman\u2019s voice greeted me.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, pausing. \u201cI need to speak with Micah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment,\u201d the woman said with uncertainty.</p> <p>The woman was most likely Jamie, Micah\u2019s new flame. I thought about what Micah told me the night before and wondered if Jamie felt the same detachment towards Micah as he did towards her. I shook my head, it wasn\u2019t my business anymore and I shouldn\u2019t care what kind of relationship they had. Aiden, I need to focus on my relationship with Aiden.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Micah said into the phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Gwen. Are you busy today?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe pack is having a cookout, but nothing important, why?\u201d</p><p>Werewolves loved to eat. I\u2019d been to many pack cookouts and remembered how fun they were. They would change into their wolf forms and play football. Big wolves that crashed into each other as they caught the football in their large mouths, it was amazing to watch. Being around weres was fun; most were laid back, good ol\u2019 boys, so much different from vampires.</p><p>\u201cI saw the warehouse again last night and I thought we could drive around and try to find it...or if you\u2019re busy, maybe Wyatt can come with me?\u201d I felt strange asking Micah to spend the day with me when his current girlfriend was probably standing within hearing distance, but I hadn\u2019t called him for romantic purposes. If it were nighttime, I would have called Aiden to go with me, even if I was still slightly ticked at him for standing me up at the Gala.</p><p>\u201cWyatt is busy. What do you mean you saw the warehouse again last night?\u201d Micah asked with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cBridget Downey\u2019s ghost keeps pulling me into the realm of death and showing me things. Last night she showed me the warehouse I\u2019d seen in Amy Harper\u2019s memories and it was horrible. We have to find it, Micah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you think we\u2019ll be able to?\u201d he countered. I shrugged my shoulders, suddenly realizing that he couldn\u2019t see me.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be close to Flora since the bodies are showing up here. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to drive too far away from their headquarters.\u201d I didn\u2019t know this for sure but it made sense, time was money and they wouldn\u2019t want to spend a lot of time driving to dump bodies.</p><p>Micah was too quiet for my liking and I suddenly felt stupid for calling him. \u201cNever mind, I can go by myself.\u201d I\u2019d be safe during the day, since vampires weren\u2019t active until nightfall. If the man with the hidden face was a warlock, though, I could run into some trouble, but I wasn\u2019t going to tell Micah that.</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me here in an hour?\u201d Micah finally asked.</p><p>\u201cReally Micah, I can go by myself. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your day. It\u2019s just...I need to put an end to this, I need to catch the bastard behind this.\u201d I suddenly felt really tired, like I did the other day. Walking with the dead was exhausting.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I want to catch this asshole? Meet me in an hour at my house.\u201d His voice said that it was a done deal and I heard the click of the phone. Well, looks like I would be visiting the Flora weres today.</p><p>I had to be in top shape if I was going to track down a warehouse and possibly a warlock so I grabbed the baggie of teabags Ms. Ozland gave me and plopped one into a mug of hot water. It smelled of spices, cinnamon and possibly nutmeg. The smell however, did not match the taste; it was horrible. I bit back the bile that threatened to surge and quickly downed the cup of tea, rinsing my mouth with a glass of orange juice right after. I coughed and gagged but didn\u2019t vomit, thank the Goddess!</p><p>Within seconds, I felt my energy returning, so much so, that I could feel the familiar hum of magic within me radiate against my skin. The tea might have been disgusting, but it worked fantastically.</p><p>After hopping into the shower, I dressed in jeans and a white sweater and slipped on a pair of brown leather boots. October was normally decent in Missouri, but this year, it had been abnormally cold. I brushed my hair into a side ponytail and was ready to leave. I checked Fiona\u2019s room before I left, but it was empty. I jotted down a note for her to call me when she got in and taped it to her door. If she were mad at me from last night for supposedly hitting on the guy she was interested in, then she\u2019d most likely be over it by today. Or, at least once she talked to me, she would understand that I hadn\u2019t kissed Ian. I magically filled Aura\u2019s food and water bowls and then picked her up and snuggled her against my chest. She was too anxious to eat, so I set her down and left.</p><p>To humans, Flora looked like a cornfield, owing to the enchantment spell that\u2019s cast over it. In truth, Flora was pretty big. The werewolves owned a small part on the outskirts of town where the forests were thick, allowing them plenty of running room. It took about fifteen minutes to reach the weres\u2019 territory and as soon as I hit their area, my nerves leapt like jumping beans and I had to take deep breaths to calm myself. The whole pack knew why Micah and I weren\u2019t together anymore. They knew that it wouldn\u2019t last when we first started dating, even when I didn\u2019t.</p><p>There was only one were I did not want to see and that was Micah\u2019s father, the man who pressured his son into being with a were woman, instead of me. I knew the entire fault couldn\u2019t be laid on Micah\u2019s father\u2019s shoulders. Micah was a big boy, after all, and fully capable of making his own decisions, but I was more comfortable putting most of the blame on his father.</p><p>Micah lived in a small ranch style house with a large tree filled yard. He had remodeled it since I had seen it. It now had wood siding, new windows, and a large porch on the front. I didn\u2019t know if Jamie was living with him yet, but I suspected the remodeling had been for her.</p><p>I pulled my car into his driveway and got out before my nerves overcame me and made me turn right back around. I shouldn\u2019t have been so nervous around Micah anymore but his words from the night before had left me confused and piqued my anxiety. The front door was open, leaving the screen door as the only obstacle blocking my path. I knocked twice and waited uneasily and, just my luck, Jamie answered the door. Her brown hair had hints of auburn and was pulled half up in a barrette. Her eyes were the same amber color as Micah\u2019s and she was around five-foot-five. She was pretty, though and had the same edginess most weres had. She may look sweet but she could easily rip a head off.</p><p>\u201cYou must be the infamous Gwen,\u201d she said with a smile. I looked away, unsure of how I was supposed to respond.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Gwen. Not sure I\u2019m infamous though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the witch who captured the wolf\u2019s heart. So much so, that he almost gave it all up for you?\u201d Her tone wasn\u2019t snide or rude. I arched my eyebrows in shock. It was the first time I had heard anything of the sort and wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about it, because in the end, he hadn\u2019t chosen me over his alpha father and politics.</p><p>\u201cOh...well...almost doesn\u2019t count,\u201d I said with complete honesty. Micah almost giving everything up didn\u2019t matter to me; the thought didn\u2019t mean much when it wasn\u2019t followed by an action.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Jamie said with a grin. I smiled back and felt my anxiety slowly disappear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said with surprise.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, Micah\u2019s just getting out of the shower.\u201d She opened the screen door wide enough for me to step inside and I followed her to the kitchen where I sat on one of the barstools. It was weird being in the house again. Micah had remodeled inside also, new floors and an entirely new kitchen. I noticed Jamie watching me with a question lingering in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou must think what Micah and I have is strange, considering what you two had had been real.\u201d Jamie commented. I had no interest in having this conversation with her.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business,\u201d I said, hoping she would drop it. In all honesty, it did hurt a little more after finding out that Micah had given me up to be with a woman he didn\u2019t even love. The wounds Micah had inflicted had healed, although the scars remained. I didn\u2019t want to open them up again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but it\u2019s what we weres do. Some of us are lucky enough to find love within the pack, but for those of us who don\u2019t...\u201d She shrugged as if what they were doing was a common thing and maybe it was. I didn\u2019t know much about were politics. I nodded my head, unwilling to comment on how I really felt.</p><p>\u201cAre you dating someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just recently started dating someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warlock?\u201d Her face was hopeful, like she wanted me to be happy with my own kind.</p> <p>\u201cVampire,\u201d I said with a smirk. She laughed and leaned against the kitchen counter, crossing her arms in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou like the ones you shouldn\u2019t be with, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I was quickly becoming annoyed with Jamie\u2019s chatty personality. Who the hell did she think she was to question my personal life or me?</p><p>\u201cI just mean, first a werewolf that is destined to marry his own kind and now a vampire that craves witches\u2019 blood.\u201d</p><p>Heat rushed to my cheeks as my anger rose to a boiling point. Micah had given me attitude for telling Aiden about brew. The hypocrite was he had told his girlfriend about the case also. Would it be immature to make the kitchen faucet explode? I noticed my magic amped up with my anger, side effects of the tea I drank, maybe?</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, that\u2019s none of your business and second, not all vampires are drinking witches\u2019 blood,\u201d I spat out, giving her a glare to match my feelings. Her pupils dilated a little and began to change to a yellowish color, her wolf must have felt threatened. Micah came into the kitchen to witness his ex-girlfriend and his current girlfriend staring daggers at each other.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Jamie dipped her head and took a couple deep breaths to calm herself. I hopped off the barstool and headed for the door. Once outside, I took a couple of deep breaths myself. The conversation with Jamie had started off okay, but I didn\u2019t need her nose poking into my dating life. Aiden had never drunk from me nor showed an abnormal fascination in doing so. Maybe I was a little touchy when comparing Aiden to the monsters I\u2019d seen in the warehouse the previous night.</p><p>Micah stepped out of the house and walked over to where I was leaning against the hood of my car. I hesitated to make eye contact but my pride forced me to look at him. He didn\u2019t look angry, which was good. I couldn\u2019t spend all day with him being in a bad mood.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I caused any trouble.\u201d I said, not sure why I was apologizing. I didn\u2019t regret anything that I said but it felt like the right thing to say in this situation.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault. Jamie is a little too inquisitive and stepped out of line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her about the case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe heard about it while I was on the phone with Wyatt.\u201d</p><p>Like vampires, weres had exceptional hearing and could easily hear a phone conversation from another room. I nodded my head but didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, I hopped into the driver\u2019s seat of my car. Micah walked around to the driver\u2019s side and leaned on the door.</p> <p>\u201cScooch over, I\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>Deciding not to argue, I climbed over the middle console and plopped ungracefully into the passenger\u2019s seat. Micah was chucked and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat. I scrunched up my face in annoyance.</p><p>Micah started the car and backed out toward the road while I messed with the radio so that the silence wouldn\u2019t cause any uncomfortable moments. We had been driving for about ten minutes before Micah turned the volume down and looked over at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat night Wyatt and I came to your apartment, when you passed out. How often does that happen?\u201d He glanced between the road and me. I held up fingers as I counted how many times I remembered being in the realm of the death. Everything was happening so quickly, that I had a hard time remembering for sure.</p><p>\u201cThat night was the first night, but it\u2019s happened two other times since then. I think Bridget will be restless until we capture her murderer,\u201d I said uneasily. Of course, I wanted the culprit caught but I didn\u2019t know how many more visits I could handle from Bridget, especially when I wasn\u2019t getting any helpful clues. We were as close to finding out who was responsible as we were the first day. Something in the back of my mind told me that if we found the warehouse, it, in itself, would tell us what we needed to know.</p><p>\u201cSo you think Bridget is responsible for your passing out? Like she\u2019s haunting you?\u201d Micah asked, his voice less than convinced of that theory. I shrugged my shoulders because, in all honesty, I didn\u2019t know what the hell was happening with me.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ozland seems to think I may be part spirit walker but that\u2019s just crazy. I mean, no witch has had that power in over seventy years and the ones who do have it, are either insane or on every villain\u2019s hit list.\u201d The perps didn\u2019t like getting ratted on by their victims. Only a handful of people in Flora knew that with the help of Aura, I could see the memories of the dead. Bridget was the first spirit I had actually interacted with and that was dangerous, for me. I trusted Micah, though, and didn\u2019t think he\u2019d announce that the dead woman they found by the woods had been talking to one of Flora\u2019s witches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, Gwen. I\u2019ve never met a witch who could see memories of the dead. Is it so far of a stretch to think you could actually interact with them? You could very well be a spirit walker.\u201d</p><p>I cringed at the thought, but had to admit there was a possibility, even if I didn\u2019t want there to be. The first time I\u2019d ever seen into the mind of the dead was right after an elder had given Aura to me. Witches were gathered for the celestial celebration that was held every five years and Holly Humphrey, a member of the council, presented me with Aura. During the celebration, gifts were always exchanged, but I hadn\u2019t thought much of the adorable black kitten I received; witches and cats went together like peanut butter and jelly.</p><p>I\u2019d been holding my new cat when someone screamed from within the large hedge maze that occupied the backyard of the Council building. We ran toward where the scream had come from and found a woman standing over the body of a warlock. He had a large hole burnt through his chest and his eyes were glassy. I almost vomited at seeing my first dead body, but even more so when Holly urged me to check for a pulse. Under normal circumstances, I would have told the person to go to hell, but Holly was a Council member and therefore demanded my respect. I crouched down and, with a shaky hand, reached for the dead warlock\u2019s wrist, while holding Aura with my other arm. A buzz of energy flowed all through me and then I was looking through the warlock\u2019s eyes. It had scared me so much that I instantly let go of the man\u2019s wrist and fell backwards.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, dear?\u201d Holly asked me. I looked up at her in fear, not sure how to explain what happened. She gave me a knowing smile and later on told me that I was meant for great things. At the time, I thought her words were only for encouragement but thinking back to that night had me wondering if she knew all along what I was capable of.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner we end this case, the better,\u201d I told Micah with disdain. He nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see last night? You said it was horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was.\u201d I paused, remembering the horrific scene I\u2019d witnessed as if I were there. \u201cBridget was being drained on a cot, she died while I was there. A guy slung her over his shoulder and threw her into the back of a white van like she was trash.\u201d I took a deep breath to calm my anger. \u201cThere were eight men in the warehouse; six of them were filling orders. I saw the same man I saw in Amy Harper\u2019s mind, but his face was blocked.\u201d The more I thought about that man, the more I wondered if he was a warlock, since vampires couldn\u2019t cast spells. I felt betrayed that one of my kind could be killing my sister witches.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, his face was blocked?\u201d Micah asked.</p><p>\u201cWhenever I looked at him all I saw was blackness covering his face, like a spell was protecting his identity. Bridget said she never saw his face either. It\u2019s starting to look like the ringleader might be a warlock.\u201d Micah looked over at me in surprise and then was silently submerged in his thoughts.</p><p>We had been driving for about thirty minutes when Micah pulled my car to the side of the road. I looked up from my cell phone and realized why he\u2019d stopped. A warehouse-type building sat in the near distance, surrounded by overgrown weeds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d I told Micah.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a feeling, it doesn\u2019t look familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re checking out every warehouse we encounter.\u201d</p><p>We both hopped out of the car and pushed our way through the tall grass and toward the warehouse. As soon as we got closer to the building, I knew with absolute certainty that it wasn\u2019t the one we were looking for. The walls weren\u2019t tall enough and neither was the overall size. The warehouse I\u2019d seen was a very large one; this one looked like it had been used for maybe storing farming equipment.</p><p>Micah tried the door but it was chain locked. \u201cUnlock it,\u201d he said.</p><p>I shot him an unbelievable look and said, \u201cKinda ironic that a detective is telling me to break into a locked building.\u201d I laughed and focused my magic on the corroded padlock until the chain fell to the dirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDetectives first,\u201d I said, holding my arm out. He drew a gun I hadn\u2019t realized he had on him and stepped into the darkened warehouse with me right behind him. He looked to the left and then to the right, his eyes roaming over every inch of the building\u2019s interior. I stepped around him and repeated what I said earlier, \u201cThis isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d remember a big ass rusty tractor sitting in the corner.\u201d Micah rolled his eyes and holstered his gun. After locking the doors, we headed for the car and were on the road again. The towns that surrounded Flora were all farming towns so there were a lot of back roads with expansive distances between them. It felt like we\u2019d been in the car for hours and I was beginning to go stir crazy when Micah slowed down and pointed to another building.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about that one?\u201d</p><p>The building in question was indeed a warehouse of sorts but not the right one. It didn\u2019t have any windows and the one I had seen had. I was starting to think the whole idea was dumb. We\u2019d already been driving for two hours and had only spotted two warehouses that weren\u2019t anything like what I\u2019d seen. I didn\u2019t even know what town we were in anymore.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I said with aggravation.</p><p>\u201cAlright, how\u2019s about we get some lunch and we\u2019ll pick this wild goose chase up after I have a full stomach.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders with indifference. I wasn\u2019t really hungry but werewolves ate all the time, so going two hours without eating was probably torture for Micah. We stopped at a small diner that looked like it should\u2019ve been shut down. The paint was peeling off the wood siding and the inside wasn\u2019t much better. It had a long counter with barstools lining the length of it while a few booths sat along the front wall, similar to a diner. Micah and I slid into a booth and waited for the waitress.</p> <p>I only ordered a glass of iced tea while Micah ordered almost everything on the menu. The waitress looked shocked but was nice enough not to comment on Micah\u2019s appetite; besides, it\u2019s not like Micah was fat. Werewolves have a high metabolism rate that helps burn off their high calorie diets, something I envied.</p><p>While we were waiting for our food, I stared out the window but turned to face Micah when I felt his eyes watching me.</p><p>\u201cRemember that little diner we stopped at in Illinois?\u201d he asked. I released a heavy sigh and nodded, not wanting to comment further. Micah, Wyatt and I had gone up to Chicago to see a Cubs game. We\u2019d stopped at a small diner along the way where Micah and I had done the deed in the women\u2019s restroom. We had an ongoing game to see how many public places we could have sex in without getting caught. If I remembere correctly, we\u2019d made it up to ten. I didn\u2019t appreciate him bringing up that specific piece of history.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t talk about these sorts of things,\u201d I said, giving him a glare. Maybe he didn\u2019t realize how hard our breakup had been on me but that was no excuse to talk about our intimate moments now that we were both with other people. If he thought this hole in the wall was going to be number eleven, then he was about to be disappointed.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about what I told you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I lied. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t get you, Micah. You could have been with me for as long as you wanted but because daddy says you need to have were babies, you dump me and shack up with a woman you don\u2019t even love. Then, as if that\u2019s not bad enough, you tell me you still love me and bring up our sexual history.\u201d My voice had risen along with my temper and right as I finished my rant, the waitress delivered Micah\u2019s food. She looked between the two of us nervously, like she\u2019d just interrupted a lover\u2019s quarrel.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told her when she set my iced tea in front of me. She gave me a tight-lipped smile and walked away. I spared a glance at Micah but quickly looked away. I didn\u2019t care for a man who didn\u2019t know what he wanted. Or one who knew what he wanted and didn\u2019t go after it. Aiden had always showed interest in me and hadn\u2019t given up on pursuing me until I was his, something Micah needed to learn.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand my world, Gwen,\u201d Micah said through a mouthful of hamburger. I took a sip of my tea and hoped it\u2019d wash the bad taste out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but you don\u2019t understand love. What exactly do you expect from me?\u201d I was positive that once the case on brew distribution was done I wouldn\u2019t talk to Micah again. If the occasion arose again and the FPD wanted my help, I would only work with Wyatt. Micah didn\u2019t seem to know what he wanted and I didn\u2019t like the confusion it caused me. I instantly wanted to see Aiden; where the hell was he and why wasn\u2019t he answering my texts?</p><p>I could see the wheels turning in Micah\u2019s head as he thought about my question, no doubt trying to come up with an answer that wouldn\u2019t set me off. At the moment, I wasn\u2019t sure anything he said wouldn\u2019t piss me off.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it\u2019d be this hard,\u201d he began, pausing to think. \u201cI knew I\u2019d miss you but I thought I\u2019d done the right thing. Most were men mate with were women while they\u2019re still dating their other girlfriends. I didn\u2019t want to do that to you. Still I wonder if I should have, because at least then I wouldn\u2019t have to see you with Aiden.\u201d</p><p>I was quiet as I considered his words. If he had gotten a were woman pregnant while he was still with me, well, there was no doubt that that would have been the end of us. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay with him knowing he had a baby with another woman. The breakup had sucked, but it could have been worse, I realized. I shook my head in frustration because Micah wasn\u2019t getting the overall concept of our problem.</p><p>\u201cThank you for not doing that,\u201d I said. \u201cbut the problem isn\u2019t whether you could have cheated or not. The problem is that you chose breeding new weres over our relationship. That\u2019s not love, Micah. If you had truly loved me, you wouldn\u2019t have given me up so easily. As for Aiden, he\u2019s been there for me since I first met him. He\u2019s gone to the extreme to protect me from harm. What we had is history; let\u2019s just leave it at that and try to be civil for the sake of closing this case.\u201d</p><p>Aiden had killed two women at Rush to protect my identity, and, at the time, I had been sickened at how easily he killed. However, after seeing the lowlifes that filled orders for witches\u2019 blood, I wanted all of them turned to ash.</p> <p>Micah was quiet for the rest of his lunch and soon we were back in the car and driving again. He had taken a bunch of side roads and we ended up in a town that looked desolate. A few closed-down shops lined a cracked blacktop road, making it look like a ghost town. I wasn\u2019t sure why, but the place looked vaguely familiar. My eyes inspected the scenery and buildings as I tried to make the connection. The proverbial light bulb went off. Bridget hadn\u2019t been the one to show me this place; it had been Amy Harper\u2019s memories. It looked different during the daytime, but I was sure it was the city where Amy Harper had been kidnapped.</p><p>\u201cThis is the place,\u201d I told Micah without a doubt. Micah pulled the Jeep to the side of the road and I hopped out and ran to the corner. There was an alley about ten feet up the sidewalk so I ran to it and, standing in the entrance, looked back at Micah to see if he was following. I stared down the long alley and closed my eyes as memories flashed through my mind. Amy Harper, scared and alone, had stood in this exact spot. She searched overhead but didn\u2019t see anything, then ran down the alley in hopes of losing her pursuer. I opened my eyes and followed the same path Amy had. When I reached the end of the alley, I was standing on what looked like the edge of town; cornfields and barbed wired fences lined one side of the street and, alongside the corn, was the warehouse.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Micah said from behind me.</p><p>\u201cThis is what Amy Harper showed me,\u201d I told him. \u201cI think that\u2019s the warehouse.\u201d I pointed to the building in question and started across the street. I was so anxious with the discovery of the warehouse that I stumbled over a stump. I would have fallen into the barbed wire had it not been for Micah\u2019s arms catching me. He wrapped a muscular limb around my waist and stopped my tumble. But, without thinking, my hand flew out to grab at anything and ended up on the wrong end of a barb. I pulled my palm away quickly and shook it as the stinging sensation shot through my palm. When I turned my hand over to see what the damage was, my palm was holding a pool of blood.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d I said through gritted teeth. I was used to getting hurt, being born with two left feet and all, but it still hurt like hell. Micah pulled off his t-shirt and ripped it in two, using one half to soak up the blood and the other half to tie snugly around my wounded palm.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take you anywhere,\u201d he said with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of par for the course,\u201d I agreed. My head was down as I watched Micah\u2019s white t-shirt turn red with my blood, but the realization that he was standing in front of me shirtless helped distract me. I looked up through my lashes and absorbed the broadness of his shoulders and the depth of the valleys that formed his impeccable muscular form. His brown hair brushed his shoulders as the wind played with it. His face had just enough stubble to be considered ruggedly sexy. He met my eyes with a longing I didn\u2019t want to see from those familiar eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked in a soft tone, full of concern. I nodded my head because I was afraid my voice would crack. I quickly looked away and focused on the warehouse so that I wasn\u2019t staring into Micah\u2019s honey-colored eyes. I\u2019d been a fool to think that being around him wouldn\u2019t affect me. It had been almost a year since we\u2019d broken up, but being around him and hearing that he still loved me was hell on my heart, especially since I had a very sexy vampire who wanted to claim me as his. I still wasn\u2019t sure what Aiden and I were. In my terms, if I said I wouldn\u2019t date anyone else and only be with one guy, then we were dating. In vampire terms, claiming someone as theirs could mean I was his property, under his protection and forbidden to be touched by any other vampire. I had known Aiden for two years and that didn\u2019t fit with his personality. I knew he liked me as more than a piece of property, but the last couple of days he\u2019d been scarce. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Micah said. I looked back at him and arched my eyebrows in a sort of \u201cHmm?\u201d response. My head was a cloudy, foggy mess, thanks to Micah and Aiden. Now was not the time to figure out my love life.</p><p>Micah leaned down slowly so that his lips were right in front of mine and I froze with surprise. When he pressed his lips to mine, I melted right where I stood. His tongue darted into my mouth and claimed my own as it swirled around and sent fire to erupt within me. He wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me against his body, his warmth soaking all the way to my core.</p><p>\u201cStop...we have to stop,\u201d I said, pulling away from him. The nausea that floated through my stomach was enough to make me want to vomit. I pushed away from him and walked a couple feet before bending over and sucking in deep gulps of fresh air. I was ashamed and pissed at myself for ever letting something like that happen. I cared about Aiden, possibly loved him and had just betrayed him with a man he hated.</p> <p>\u201cGwen, I know you want to be with me. I can see it when you look at me. Are two people not supposed to be together because of the other people in their lives? I\u2019ve never stopped wanting you.\u201d Micah spoke against my back but I couldn\u2019t turn around to look at him or speak to him. If he wanted me so much then why had it taken him a year to mention it, did his phone stop working within that time? Was seeing me again igniting old feelings that were causing him confusion also? Working with him again had been a mistake.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you, Micah,\u201d I said quietly, like I was testing how the words tasted on my tongue. \u201cThat was a mistake I won\u2019t ever repeat.\u201d I turned to face him and searched within myself for the courage not to cry. The realization suddenly dawned on me that what had been between me and Micah had been false. Werewolves were primitive in their thinking and I had fallen for what I thought was love, when the only thing between us was attraction. I couldn\u2019t deny that the sexual tension between us went through the roof, but looking at him now, I knew it hadn\u2019t been full blown love. It wasn\u2019t what Aiden made me feel. With Aiden, I was smitten with the anticipation of his glance, or the sensation of his skin on mine whenever his fingertips brushed against my hand accidentally, the light in his eyes when he watched me or the sporadic beating of my heart whenever he was close. All of the little things that give you hints of internal emotions that can\u2019t be expressed through physical contact. Micah was comfortable to me, familiar, but he wasn\u2019t what my heart wanted. And, even if he didn\u2019t realize it yet, I wasn\u2019t what his heart was looking for either.</p><p>\u201cYou love the vampire.\u201d He said matter-of-factly. I grinned at the blatancy of the statement and nodded my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI do love you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI almost gave it all up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you did love me, you would have.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think Micah completely grasped the difference between \u201calmost\u201d and \u201cdoing\u201d. It was a big step for him to even consider giving up expansion of the pack for me; no werewolf would do that. The bond that through a were pack is stronger than anything I\u2019d ever seen and, if he had given it up for me, he wouldn\u2019t have been happy.</p><p>In the end, I could finally see that the hurt I had gone through had been the best thing for the both of us. Micah would go on to have little were babies with Jamie and possibly fall in love with her, while I would give myself wholeheartedly to the man I had loved for two years. And although Micah isn\u2019t a frog by any means, the kiss between us had made me realize who the real prince was. Aiden.</p><p>After our nice little chat and my revelation, we finally made our way to the warehouse. I magically unlocked the door and waited just outside as Micah checked the inside. A lot of witches had learned to fight with their magic but I wasn\u2019t one of them. I could conjure a bat and hit someone upside the head, but I doubt I\u2019d be quick enough against a vampire. Seeing how the vampires had become our number one enemy, maybe the NAWC should require magical fighting techniques as part of our public education.</p><p>\u201cAll clear,\u201d Micah said, peeking his head out the door. I stepped inside the warehouse, already knowing what it looked like. The broken down refrigerators I\u2019d seen the night before sat in the far corner. Two cots occupied the middle of the floor and off to the left was the office area. I walked toward the office, like I\u2019d been here a millions times and knew what I was doing. Micah followed and looked over my shoulder as I picked up the clipboard I\u2019d seen previously. I scanned the list of names and my breath caught as my eyes found Aiden\u2019s name. I had been hoping that I imagined that part of my night.</p><p>\u201cClients?\u201d Micah asked.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d I told him and magically made Aiden\u2019s name disappear from the list. I didn\u2019t need the FPD knowing my vampire beau was on a suspicious list of brew users. Out of curiosity, I searched for Ian Despereaux\u2019s name but it wasn\u2019t on the list. I handed the clipboard to Micah and searched the area for any other information. There was a computer sitting on the desk but it was password protected. Finding nothing else useful, I left the office and walked around the corner where I had seen the men sitting at the table. The table was right where I expected it to be but there weren\u2019t any supplies atop it. There were a few built-in cabinets along the wall but nothing of interest inside them.</p><p>Micah pulled out his cell phone and rambled off the address to one of his co-workers. If the distribution team showed up, the FPD would catch them. I walked over to where I had seen Bridget\u2019s body and sat gently on the cot. I placed my hand on the pillow that had absorbed her tears and my own eyes welled up from the sadness. I\u2019d never had experience with junkies, but I had heard that they would do anything for their next fix, even kill innocent witches. It was an entirely different matter when the drug in question ran through my veins. Magic was a truly fantastic element that no one completely understood; but what separated us from the other supernatural species, could also get me killed.</p><p>\u201cReady to head back?\u201d Micah asked.</p><p>I nodded my head. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The ride back to Flora was quiet. Micah was either embarrassed or pissed at what occurred between us. I knew a small part of my heart would always be occupied by Micah but it was more of a fossil from my history, than a sore spot.</p><p>Once back at Micah\u2019s house, I thanked him for going with me and got into the driver\u2019s seat to head back to my apartment, leaving what had happened between us in the rearview mirror.</p><p>14</p><p>Spending the day with Micah had left me exhausted, the effects of Ms. Ozland\u2019s tea having worn off. I was happy with the fact that I was able to lead Micah to the warehouse where Amy and Bridget had been drained. If the bastards stepped foot in there, they\u2019d be ambushed by the FPD. I smiled at I thought of the case finally coming to an end.</p> <p>I was curled up on the couch watching reruns of I Love Lucy when Fiona...and Ian, walked into our apartment. What the hell was she doing with him? I must have dozed off during Lucy because I hadn\u2019t even realized it was nightfall. Fiona messed around in the kitchen while Ian made his way into the living room. He was dressed in jeans, a navy thermal, and a black leather jacket. His blonde hair was perfectly gelled and his blue eyes sparkled against the faint glow of the lamplight.</p><p>He sat on the arm of the couch and after observing what I was watching, smiled down at me.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Gwen,\u201d he said, his tone light and a grin on his lips. I quashed the attraction I felt towards him and gave him a tight-lipped smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked, sounding ruder than I\u2019d intended. He hadn\u2019t done anything to me, per se, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that everything wasn\u2019t all it seemed with Ian Despereaux.</p><p>\u201cDo you fault me for wanting to see you again?\u201d he asked in a low voice so that Fiona wouldn\u2019t hear. I wondered what exactly was going on between him and my best friend, especially since he was showing interest in me. I made a note to track down Aiden later on and ask him about his so-called friend, even if he had been ignoring my calls and texts.</p><p>\u201cAnd why did you want to see me again?\u201d I asked with indifference. There was a glint in his eyes that sent butterflies erupting into a whirlwind throughout my stomach. Whether I trusted him or not, he was hot! Vampires aren\u2019t gorgeous like some ridiculous books portray them to be. In reality, they look just like they did before vampirism. Aiden and Ian had been dealt a generous hand when it came to the looks department, although I preferred Aiden to Ian.</p><p>\u201cHow serious are things with Aiden?\u201d Ian asked out of left field.</p><p>\u201cHow serious are things between you and Fiona?\u201d I retorted, reminding him that he had come waltzing through the door with my best friend. It was obvious enough that Fiona liked Ian, too much for him not to notice. I didn\u2019t appreciate him leading her on if he didn\u2019t share her feelings. I mentally wondered what Ian had said to Fiona about our kiss. Thinking about the kiss left me feeling cheap. In the day I\u2019d been away from Aiden, I had kissed two different guys. I cringed internally at the thought of Aiden thinking I was a whore. The butterflies Ian had figuratively placed in my stomach disappeared into a cloud of nausea.</p><p>\u201cFiona is a wonderful woman but we\u2019re friends. I find myself enamored with her roommate.\u201d He winked and I wanted to throw up. I was spared having to come up with a witty comment because Fiona walked into the living room and stood next to Ian as if she were struck with anxiety from being away from his side for even a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, looking between Ian and me. I shrugged my shoulders and nodded toward the television.</p><p>\u201cWatching I Love Lucy,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d My voice held a curious edge that I hoped Fiona wouldn\u2019t decipher as jealousy. I wanted to know if Ian had led Fiona on into thinking that they were more than friends, and then, when her back was turned, planned to start making advances on me. I had enough to deal with, I didn\u2019t need a vampire playboy stomping all over my and Fiona\u2019s friendship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIan and I were on our way to Vain. I just needed to pick something up,\u201d Fiona said, giving Ian a lingering glance that worried me. I felt like an old mother hen as I watched my best friend crush on the wrong guy. I wanted to forbid her from seeing him, but unless I wanted Fiona pissed at me for who knows how long, I couldn\u2019t exactly stop her from seeing Ian. What I could do, was act as a chaperone.</p><p>\u201cOh, that sounds like fun! Care if I join you?\u201d I asked with a wide smile. I could see the hesitation in Fiona\u2019s eyes, whereas Ian\u2019s held nothing but amusement.</p><p>Fiona began to speak, but Ian interrupted her before she could politely tell me that she preferred to be alone with Ian tonight.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d Ian said with a smile. I beamed at Fiona, not Ian, so that she would see that I had no interest in spending time with him. The only thing I wanted from Ian was information on who he really was and why he was so interested in fooling my best friend.</p><p>I felt the familiar tingle of my magic as I switched out of my pajamas and into a black ruffled mini skirt, purple halter top and matching purple stilettos.</p><p>\u201cAll ready!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I speak to you for a minute?\u201d Fiona all but forced out. I hopped off the couch and followed her back to her bedroom. I knew exactly what she was going to say but that wouldn\u2019t change my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Fiona whirled around to face me with ire in her eyes. My own eyes shot wide at her tone, not realizing my tagging along would make her so pissed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked, feigning innocence.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you going after Ian when you know that I like him?\u201d Whoa, I hadn\u2019t seen that one coming. My eyes roamed her small bedroom as I tried to think of a way to tell her that the only interest I had in Ian was keeping him away from her. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d swallow that pill easily.</p><p>\u201cYou have Aiden and obviously Micah stills loves you; are two men not enough?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho do I have? Liam?\u201d She let out a sarcastic laugh. Fiona had always been perceptive, able to read people easily. So why weren\u2019t her warning bells chiming when she was around Ian?</p><p>I let out a sigh. \u201cFiona, I have no romantic interest in Ian. I just...don\u2019t trust him,\u201d I finally said, ready for her to blow up. When she was too quiet for my liking, I said, \u201cI also wanted to go to Vain because I haven\u2019t heard from Aiden.\u201d She gave me a look that said she wasn\u2019t buying it and I resisted the urge to literally shake some sense into her. Why did she think that I was after Ian? The kiss! I had forgotten, thanks to my drama- filled day that Fiona had seen Ian kiss me. I still didn\u2019t know what he had told her, or if he had told her anything</p><p>. \u201cIan kissed me, I didn\u2019t want it, that\u2019s why I slapped him. The only vampire that\u2019ll be kissing me is Aiden.\u201d At least, that\u2019s what I hoped. He might not want anything to do with me after finding out Ian and Micah had kissed me.</p><p>A sharp stinging sensation erupted across my cheek, sending me whirling into dizziness for a few moments. I placed a hand on the side of my face and realized that Fiona had slapped me! My mouth hung open and my eyes shot wide as I looked at my best friend full of anger and hatred directed at me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell, Fiona?\u201d I asked, flabbergasted.</p><p>\u201cMy father warned me that you were trash and it seems he was right! Stay away from Ian and me. I\u2019ll get my things out of your crappy apartment tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Tears instantly filled my eyes, causing my vision to go blurry. I was so confused by what was happening, all I could do was gape at Fiona, as if I\u2019d never met her before.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I managed to get out. Fiona turned around and sneered with disgust, like I was clothing from the Goodwill.</p><p>\u201cYou kiss the guy I\u2019m dating and then ask me why I\u2019m pissed?\u201d I shook my head with denial; hadn\u2019t I just told her Ian kissed me? Furthermore, she had seen the kiss, I knew with absolute certainty she had, so why was she acting like this was the first she\u2019d heard of it? I didn\u2019t get a chance to respond because Fiona stomped out of her bedroom and within seconds, I heard the door slamming. Tears cascaded down my cheeks like graceful waterfalls as reality slammed into my brain. Fiona hated me and wanted to move out.</p><p>Anger slowly replaced my hurt as I thought about how things had been fine until Ian Despereaux showed up. If it were the last thing I did, I\u2019d expose the fa\u00e7ade he was parading all over town.</p><p>I pulled into Aiden\u2019s driveway and marched up to his door, slamming my fist against the expensive timbered door. Aiden would know what to do where Ian was concerned and I was going to make him talk to me.</p><p>The door opened to show Aiden half-dressed, his hair disheveled and a drop of blood along the side of his mouth. I swallowed the bile that threatened to escape my lips.</p> <p>\u201cWell, hello, my Gwen,\u201d he said in a sultry voice. He stepped onto his porch and wrapped his arms around my waist while his nose roamed up and down the length of my neck. A shudder flowed through my entire body as his breath tickled my skin. I leaned into him, not realizing that I needed his comfort so much. Before I could blink my eyes, he had picked me up and carried me into his house, setting me on his sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell has gotten into you?\u201d I asked, half turned on and half scared. Aiden was always flirtatious but gentle in his actions; this was a side of him I hadn\u2019t seen before.</p><p>\u201cI find myself craving you.\u201d His eyes gobbled up my short mini skirt, halter top and stilettos which I formed when I thought I was spending the night at Vain. The reason</p><p>I was not there slammed into the forefront of my mind and erased any ounce of lust I possessed.</p><p>I stood up from the couch, but Aiden slid up behind me, his erection straining through his pants and pressing against my backside. He drew my hair to one side to expose my throat and began trailing kisses down the nape of my neck. My eyes closed with pleasure as he began to grind against the back of me. This certainly hadn\u2019t been the welcome I anticipated, but I wasn\u2019t complaining. His hand caressed the bare skin of my legs, disappearing underneath my skirt. When his fingers trailed between my legs and pushed on my center, a moan escaped my lips, which he echoed. He bent me over and ripped away my panties in one quick motion, his fingers sliding into my wetness. I grabbed the sofa as the friction from Aiden\u2019s fingers sent me over the edge.</p><p>When he withdrew his fingers from me, I silently pouted. He turned me around and pushed me back onto the sofa, edging himself between my legs with a sexy glint in his eyes. His head disappeared under my skirt and I bucked up as his tongue discovered a different set of lips. With sheer desire, I arched my back against the sofa and moaned with delight; the boy could do wonders with his tongue!</p><p>All of my euphoria was squashed as soon as I heard footsteps on the stairs. I turned my head and froze with anger, seeing a woman as naked as the day she was born descend to the first floor. Her hair was auburn and hit just below her shoulders and her breasts were as fake as Aiden\u2019s feelings for me. She gave me a smile but I could see a hint of jealousy as she watched Aiden between my legs. My chest heaved with anger rather than pleasure and my breath seemed to fail me as I gasped for understanding.</p><p>I formed a white orb of magic in my hand and sent it to the side of Aiden\u2019s face, throwing him six feet across the living room. He quickly regained his footing and snarled.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d I yelled, pointing to the woman in question. Aiden shot a look at the nude woman as if it were a perfectly normal to have naked women in his house. Had Aiden\u2019s claim on me meant something entirely different than what I had thought? It didn\u2019t fit; I knew Aiden loved me as sure as I knew that if he didn\u2019t explain the woman\u2019s presence, I\u2019d fire another shot of magic at him.</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d Aiden said, his voice sounding confused as he looked between the woman and me.</p><p>\u201cYou are some kind of asshole, you know that? And to think, I was ashamed of kissing Micah when all the while you were playing me like a fiddle. Kudos, you really had me fooled.\u201d I shook my head as if trying to dislodge the information I just learned from my memory but I wasn\u2019t that lucky. The thoughts that I\u2019d been betrayed by the man I just realized I loved, swirled around my brain like a hailstorm. His half-dressed appearance and the drop of blood on his lip all explained themselves to me now...What a night this had turned out to be.</p><p>\u201cYou kissed Micah?\u201d he asked in a tone as cold and sharp as an icicle. I felt stupid and wanted to ball up in my sheets and cry until the whole mess worked itself out, but in my experience, disasters didn\u2019t clean up after themselves. Aiden\u2019s hand stopped me from walking through his door and just as I was about to throw another orb at him, he caught my hand. It was hard to catch a vampire off guard. The only reason I was able to earlier was because Aiden\u2019s focus was on more carnal needs. His eyes seemed to be at war with his thoughts as he looked at me, but those gorgeous blue pools wouldn\u2019t fool me again.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming back upstairs?\u201d the naked woman whined. Aiden kept hold of my hand but turned to face the bimbo and said, \u201cGet out.\u201d The woman\u2019s fear was evident as she scrambled upstairs only to rush back down with a pile of clothes in her hands. She pushed past me and I cringed when one of her fake boobs brushed against my arm, I wanted to vomit!</p><p>\u201cLet go of me!\u201d I snarled and fought to break free but my attempts were about as effective as trying to tip the Statue of Liberty over. Aiden\u2019s grip didn\u2019t budge as I pulled away from him.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he said.</p><p>I laughed bitterly. \u201cCalm down? I just caught you with a naked woman!\u201d I kicked my leg out, landing a blow between Aiden\u2019s legs, which rewarded me with a snarl and being pinned to the floor. He held my hands to the cold tile while his hips pinned my legs. Fear rushed through me when Aiden\u2019s fangs fell from his gums and his eyes turned as black as his heart. Tears I couldn\u2019t stop, fell from my eyes as I wondered if this would be the end of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a very hard time controlling myself, so unless you want to end up drained, you should calm down,\u201d Aiden hissed. I stopped fighting against him and closed my eyes, taking deep breaths to calm myself, per Aiden\u2019s instructions. When I opened my eyes, Aiden\u2019s head was hung as he himself took deep breaths. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can hear it calling to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHear what?\u201d I whispered, fearing the answer.</p><p>\u201cYour magic. Your blood. Your body. I crave it like nothing else.\u201d</p> <p>My heart didn\u2019t care that I was trying to remain calm; it began to speed up and thump rapidly against my chest as fear-induced adrenaline raced through my body. Aiden\u2019s name in black ink instantly flashed into my subconscious as I remembered the client list we found at the warehouse. Aiden wasn\u2019t acting like himself. He was acting like an addict.</p><p>15</p><p>Aiden had climbed off me and allowed me to get up but still held onto my arm so that I couldn\u2019t throw anymore magic or try to leave. A silence settled over the house as I tried to think of how to deal with a vampire Jonesing for what ran through my veins. I wanted nothing more than to flee from his house and never look back, but I\u2019d have to play willing captive if I had any hopes of escaping.</p><p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d I asked, avoiding eye contact. If I looked at him, the tears would resurface and I needed a clear head.</p><p>\u201cRemember my friend from Chicago that was sending the sample?\u201d I nodded my head. \u201cWell,\u201d Aiden continued, \u201che brought it down here himself and insisted I try it for myself. I don\u2019t know if he was suspicious or just excited to have me try something so fantastic, and it was, the most fantastic thing I\u2019ve ever tasted, Gwen.\u201d Aiden\u2019s eyes had gone distant as he thought about the brew he sampled.</p> <p>\u201cI thought only younger vamps could be affected by it.\u201d Of course, that little tidbit of information was only hearsay; in truth, we didn\u2019t know what the hell the effects of witches\u2019 blood did to vampires.</p><p>\u201cNo, it can affect any vampire. For the younger ones, it causes a high much like speed and ecstasy mixed. For the older vampires, such as myself, the magic gets absorbed in the blood and...\u201d Aiden stopped, unsure if he should tell me what our blood could do.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I urged.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cIf we drink enough of it, we can use the magic in the blood. Perform magic. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s the most incredible thing I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at his excitement while my insides remained frozen in fear. Witches, like every other species, have authorities we have to answer to, should they use their magic for harm instead of good. If vampires could somehow absorb the magic in our blood, then they could use it for whatever they wanted without having to answer to the NAWC (North American Witches Council). Vampires had their own politics and answer to certain kings and queens; if the NAWC got wind that vampires were stealing our magic, all hell would break loose. Not only would the witches be fighting against the vampires, but our two governments would be in combat as well.</p><p>Finding out that Aiden had been drinking brew was like a sucker punch to my gut. The man I had only recently decided I possibly loved, was involved in the case Micah and I were fighting to end.</p> <p>\u201cHow much have you drunk?\u201d My voice came out shaky, matching my trembling hands. The beautiful man that I\u2019d known for two years, who I\u2019d come to love, was quickly turning into one of the bad guys. A strand of his dark hair escaped and hung over one of his aqua-blue eyes. I yearned to brush it back and continue where we left off, before the bimbo made her appearance known. Aiden\u2019s head snapped up and he inhaled the air as if he smelled something, his eyes closing and a sigh escaping his perfectly kissable lips.</p><p>He pulled me on top of him and claimed my mouth with a ferocity that only caused me fear. I pushed against him but he held onto my hips so that my panty-less center was perfectly atop his erection. His eyes were black when he looked up the length of me and his fangs had emerged again. My hands were pressed against his chest, to keep that fang-filled mouth as far away from me as possible. I knew if he wanted to bite me, my hands on his chest wouldn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>\u201cI can smell your desire for me, my Gwen.\u201d Without warning, his fingers slipped inside me and moved back and forth, causing a conflict of emotions to erupt within me. I was fighting the lust that he ignited with every thrust of his long delicate fingers, and losing.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he asked, his voice thick with desire. I nodded my head because I wasn\u2019t able to speak; my mouth was too busy moaning. I heard a zip and then felt the warmth of skin against my leg. When I looked down, Aiden had freed his rock hard erection and it was sitting happily against my leg, like a dog waiting to be petted.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I objected, falling backwards off his lap, in my attempt to get away from him. I had just learned a plethora of bad news and he was trying to get his rocks off! I ran toward the door, only to slam into the hardness of Aiden\u2019s chest. I bounced back and before I could slam into the ceramic tiled floor, Aiden caught me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t run from me, Gwen. I couldn\u2019t handle it if you feared me.\u201d He trailed a finger down the side of my face and I could smell my scent on his hands. I pushed against him but once again, but it was useless.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me, Aiden? Your next fix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd, I\u2019d never hurt you. I want you to understand what is happening to me and ... help me.\u201d</p> <p>I stopped my struggle as I heard that he wanted help in fighting this addiction that was consuming him. I nodded my head and his grip on me loosened. Although I feared this side of Aiden, I wouldn\u2019t let it turn him into a monster. I\u2019d help him in any way I could.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, what the hell was the bimbo doing here? Why should I help you if all you are is a cheating bastard?\u201d If my heart kept up at its rapid pace, I would have a heart attack but the whole situation was gut wrenching. I worked on calming myself but my whole body shook with anger, hurt, and fear. My eyes were puffy from crying and they weren\u2019t done yet, tears lazily fell against my cheeks as I waited for Aiden\u2019s answer.</p><p>\u201cShe was a gift, from Louis,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a low level witch that sells her blood to vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why she was butt ass naked and you\u2019re shirtless. I thought...\u201d I paused to catch my breath which seemed to be sucked from my lungs with each new piece of information Aiden gave me. \u201c...I thought you and I were an item. Obviously I was wrong.\u201d I hugged my arms across my chest as if to hold my heart from literally bursting through my ribcage. Aiden watched me with remorse and longing, which did nothing but piss me off. It was too late to apologize for something as extreme as sleeping with another woman.</p><p>\u201cHer other vampire clients use her for sex while feeding, it heightens the experience, so she thought I\u2019d want to also. When she arrived, I had just gotten out of the shower and hadn\u2019t put a shirt on yet. When I went upstairs to feed, she was naked on my bed. Nothing happened, except feeding, I promise, Gwen. I know this looks bad, but I would never hurt you purposely.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips as I considered his words. I wasn\u2019t gullible, by any means, so instead of taking his word for it, I cast a truth spell on him. I sent my magic out toward him and watched as wiry waves of light blue, invisible to him, swirled around his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have sex with the bimbo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you touch her in any sexual way?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much witches\u2019 blood have you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d His voice had a robotic tone as my magic worked on him. Deciding that I was happy with the information, I pulled my magic back to me and dissolved the spell. It was tempting to question him about his feelings toward me, but I decided that if he were to say he loved me, I\u2019d want to hear it without the influence of magic.</p><p>He blinked and looked at me as if wondering what had just happened. I gave him a small smile, feigning indifference.</p><p>\u201cSo brew is a fast acting addiction?\u201d</p><p>Aiden nodded his head. \u201cIt is. I\u2019ve only tasted low level witches, but your magic calls to me like a bar to a wino, it\u2019s stronger than I\u2019ve tasted.\u201d Aiden\u2019s eyes were fixated on my neck as he spoke.</p><p>I snapped my fingers in front of his face and said, \u201cPay attention.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met mine apologetically. \u201cYou interrupted my feeding and I\u2019m finding it difficult just to be around you.\u201d Well, that was just fucking dandy! Not only had Aiden not drank enough, but the magic in my blood was so strong that he couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything other than my jugular.</p><p>\u201cYou have any bagged blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t drink that stuff and even if I did, it doesn\u2019t taste right without the magic in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not okay with you drinking witches\u2019 blood, Aiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m just...so...hungry.\u201d His eyes had turned black the more we talked about blood and his fangs were exposed. I knew it was dangerous to be around a starving vampire. I didn\u2019t know what to do, he wouldn\u2019t drink regular blood and I wouldn\u2019t put a fellow witch in the path of Aiden\u2019s fangs.</p><p>\u201cDrink me.\u201d The words slipped out of my mouth before I could stop them. I knew it was the only way to satisfy his thirst, but I also knew that I was fueling the fire that was his addiction, either way I looked at it, it was bad news.</p><p>Aiden looked at me like I\u2019d just sprouted two heads, but the hunger in his eyes told me that he wanted nothing more than to taste what I was offering. I had never been bitten by a vampire, let alone an addicted vampire. I knew that if Aiden wanted to drink me dry, he could, and I couldn\u2019t stop him. I knew the risks of letting him drink from me, that he could kill me. But knowing that another witch would be spared because I had taken care of Aiden\u2019s thirst was comforting, even if just barely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous if you don\u2019t. I trust you; you won\u2019t kill me.\u201d I said matter-of-factly. Aiden was struggling with something that I didn\u2019t understand, but I knew he wouldn\u2019t take it too far. He licked his lips in anticipation while my stomach dropped with fear. Vampires\u2019 bites are said to be pleasurable, but those two sharp pointy teeth didn\u2019t look capable of inflicting anything other than pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed my hand gently and said, \u201cUpstairs.\u201d I reluctantly followed him up the wooden staircase to his bedroom. The bed linens were perfectly undisturbed which proved that no hanky-panky had gone on up here. He stepped behind me and untied the neck of my halter top, letting it fall away from my breasts like a theater curtain revealing the silver screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make love to you while I feed, it\u2019ll help me not focus so much on the blood.\u201d He admired my breasts for a moment. \u201cYour body is enough to shake anyone\u2019s focus.\u201d He slipped his thumbs under the hem of my skirt and pushed it slowly to the floor where it pooled at my feet, pressing kisses along my legs. I began to step out of my stilettos but Aiden stopped me.</p> <p>\u201cLeave them on. There\u2019s something sexy about a naked woman in heels.\u201d He winked at me and a grin teased my lips. It seemed sex was helping me not focus on feeding Aiden as well. I was more anxious to feel him inside of me rather than his fangs piercing my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise me one thing since I agreed to feed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, my Gwen?\u201d he asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re done, I don\u2019t want to feel my legs,\u201d I said with a wink. I at least deserved some hot sex out of the horrid ordeal. Aiden answered me with a nod and a smirk of his own. I unbuttoned his pants and pushed them to the floor to reveal that he wasn\u2019t wearing any underwear and his unit was very much ready for action. I wrapped my hand around his shaft and enjoyed the moan that escaped his lips. I moved my hand up and down, enjoying the hardness beneath my palm.</p><p>I looked into Aiden\u2019s black eyes as I handled his erection and licked my lips as the desire grew thick between us. When it seemed Aiden couldn\u2019t handle much more of my teasing, he picked me up and sat me on the bed where his head lingered between my legs. I watched him down the length of my body and shivered when his tongue tasted the wetness he had caused. He worked his tongue with a talent I hadn\u2019t experienced, and if I were to ever become addicted to anything, it\u2019d be Aiden\u2019s talents. I moaned as my orgasm shot euphoria throughout my entire body, causing my body to feel limp and relaxed.</p> <p>Aiden laughed at my pleased expression and climbed on the bed to lean against the headboard. He held out both of his hands and waggled his fingers in a \u201ccome and get it\u201d motion. I\u2019d never been one to back down from a challenge, so I turned over and crawled slowly towards the sexiest man I\u2019d ever laid eyes on. I crawled between his legs and hovered my face just over his hardness, looking up at him through my lashes. He watched me with such want and desire that my own skyrocketed. I ran my tongue from the bottom of his shaft to the tip, like licking a lollypop. Aiden growled with anticipation but I wasn\u2019t done teasing him yet. I licked his length a few more times before swirling my tongue around the tip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy.\u201d He complained and I chuckled. Deciding he\u2019d had enough, I placed my mouth over his impressive length and let the heat and friction of my lips please him. After a few moments, I continued my way up the length of his body where I kissed his lips and let out a gasp as Aiden thrust his member inside me. He placed both hands on either side of my hips and moved me against himself. I moaned when he caught my nipple in his mouth and sucked.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said, staring up at me. I opened my eyes and looked down into the eyes of the man I loved.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful.\u201d I gave a small smile but my heart was full of happiness. Our bodies felt like they were meant for each other and there was nothing more beautiful than what we were sharing at the moment. It wasn\u2019t just screwing; it was lovemaking, intimate and personal. I absorbed the feel of him as another orgasm waited to be released. Aiden must have been close to the edge as well because he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me down so that I would be closer to his mouth. I felt a sharp pain on the side of my neck, causing me to shriek. The pain subsided and washed waves of ecstasy throughout my body, causing my orgasm to erupt five times stronger than the first one. I melted against Aiden\u2019s chest as I enjoyed the finishing waves of pleasure that wafted throughout my entire body. I didn\u2019t know how it was possible, but Aiden\u2019s bite had heightened my orgasm. The more he drank, the longer the orgasm lasted. I was delirious with satisfaction and too far gone to worry if he was taking too much, if his bite felt this good, he could drink me dry, at least I\u2019d die happy.</p><p>Aiden snarled and pushed me away, causing confusion to replace my exhilaration. When I looked back at where Aiden sat, I noticed his eyes were closed and he was panting heavily. Another myth was that vampires didn\u2019t need to breathe. That was false, blood needs oxygen for it to be any good and vampires need to breathe to feed the oxygen to their blood like everyone else.</p><p>\u201cAiden?\u201d I said cautiously.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. You\u2019re so strong, Gwen.\u201d He opened his eyes and I gasped at the eerie change. For whatever reason, the magic in our blood turned a vamp\u2019s eyes a bright electric blue. I didn\u2019t like seeing Aiden like this.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, clearly noticing that I was afraid of him.</p><p>\u201cYour...eyes.\u201d He tilted his head to the side as if curious by what I meant and the action sent gooseflesh to pebble my skin. Aiden had always been beautifully dark but with his eyes that color, he was eerily beautiful. He hopped off the bed and walked into the master bathroom to inspect his eyes.</p><p>I expected a gasp or some sort of curse when Aiden saw what I had seen, but only dead silence greeted the bedroom. I flung my heels off and wrapped a sheet around my still naked body to see what he was doing. When I entered the bathroom, Aiden was staring at his reflection.</p><p>\u201cAiden?\u201d I softly asked, not wanting to startle him. My life had never been normal, being a witch and all, but this wasn\u2019t how things were supposed to go after making love. We were supposed to lie in bed and enjoy the feel of our skin next to each other while we caught our breaths and replayed how amazing the sex had been. I had been so stupid when I decided to feed him, but even if it were a stupid decision, what other option did I have? I couldn\u2019t let him loose to find brew elsewhere, where he could possibly kill.</p><p>\u201cI can feel your magic dancing through my body,\u201d Aiden finally said, looking back at me. \u201cYou\u2019re in here too.\u201d I arched my eyebrows in confusion and fear, not sure what the hell that meant. I\u2019ve lived alongside vampires for almost ten years, but I hadn\u2019t made it my mission to figure out their abilities.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Aiden abandoned his post in front of the mirror and walked over to where I stood in the doorway of the bathroom. Grabbing both of my hands in his, he said, \u201cI can feel your emotions. You\u2019re afraid right now...of me. That\u2019s the worst part about being hooked on brew. I don\u2019t want you to fear me, Gwen and I apologize that you have to see me like this. I will never hurt you. If I have to say it a million times before you believe me I will.\u201d I nodded my head, unable to speak. Deep down, I knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt me but that didn\u2019t mean that the situation didn\u2019t scare me. I didn\u2019t want a boyfriend addicted to the magic in witches\u2019 blood or have to worry that I could lose him forever to such an addiction.</p> <p>Aiden held a rose out in front of me and I gasped with shock. \u201cDid you just conjure that?\u201d I asked with disbelief. Aiden\u2019s smile was all the confirmation I needed. He had only drunk witches\u2019 blood three times now and he could already conjure objects; that wasn\u2019t good. I didn\u2019t realize my magic was as strong as he claimed but it made sense; he\u2019d only been drinking low-level witches, which consisted of psychics, tarot card readers, and mediums. I, on the other hand, am a full fledge witch, capable of producing my own magic. I was a lot stronger than what he had tasted.</p><p>\u201cAiden you can\u2019t use magic! Do you realize that the FPD is currently searching for the vampires responsible for this entire mess, and that they intend to imprison them for a hundred years, or worse, stake them?\u201d I suddenly couldn\u2019t breathe. I gasped and grabbed at my chest as if I could push the air back into my lungs. I was in the middle of a shit storm with no way to escape. My ex-boyfriend was hunting down the vampires responsible for the murders of witches, my current boyfriend was addicted to the blood of witches, and my best friend was obsessed with a possible lunatic. In my opinion it didn\u2019t get any worse than it already was, not that I wanted to test that theory.</p><p>Aiden was rubbing my back and saying, \u201cBreathe, Gwen, just breathe.\u201d I sucked in big gulps of air and closed my eyes as I listened to his soothing voice. The heaviness in my chest lessened and I could finally breathe. A thin dew of perspiration lined my forehead and my heartbeat was slowly returning to normal.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed; we\u2019re breaking your addiction tonight!\u201d I said, glaring at Aiden. I couldn\u2019t live with knowing that Aiden was able to produce magic because he had drunk the blood of a witch, my blood. If the information got out to the FPD or the NAWC, he\u2019d be ash by the end of the week. I didn\u2019t know exactly how we\u2019d break his addiction, but I knew one person who might have knowledge, Ms. Ozland.</p><p>16</p><p>Aiden wasn\u2019t too excited that his addiction could be broken tonight, but what addict got excited about quitting their beloved drug? I sat on Ms. Ozland\u2019s worn sofa, while Aiden paced her small living room, like a caged animal. I worried about telling her about Aiden\u2019s problem. This situation was personal for us witches. She could easily let it slip to the NAWC that Aiden was involved with drinking witches. Unfortunately, she was the only one I could think of that might be able to help with his problem.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Ms. Ozland began with her hands clasped in her lap. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d Ms.Ozland was dressed in a long flowery nightgown that looked too large for her small frame. Her salt and pepper hair was braided and reached the middle of her back. To most people, she looked like your average grandmother, but her magic could definitely pack a punch.</p><p>I released a heavy sigh, debating whether I was doing the right thing or not but I finally resolved to worry about that later. \u201cYou heard of the two dead women that the FPD found?\u201d I asked and she nodded her head. \u201cWell, it\u2019s vampires killing witches...for their magic.\u201d I let that statement sink in but Ms. Ozland didn\u2019t look as appalled or shocked as I had when I learned the news. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised,\u201d I said, wondering how she could hear the news she just had without revealing an ounce of surprise. She smiled sweetly at me, as if I were a child who just learned Santa Claus didn\u2019t really exist. I wasn\u2019t exactly sure how old Ms. Ozland was, since witches don\u2019t age the same way humans do. Once the magic chooses someone, your biological makeup also changes. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say she was close to one hundred and fifty years old, even though she only looked sixty. She had definitely seen and learned a lot more than I had in my twenty-six years.</p><p>\u201cThere are many secrets to our world that we wish to keep to ourselves but every so often one gets out and, as you know, it\u2019s our duty to retrieve it,\u201d she said, giving me a look I didn\u2019t fully understand. I nodded my head as if I understood, but mentally I was as confused as a person with Alzheimer\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWell...um, it seems witches\u2019 blood is addictive and causes the younger vamps to feel high while it allows the older vampires utilize its magic.\u201d Ms. Ozland nodded her head and frustration grew deep within me. Was I the only one new to this information?</p> <p>\u201cAnd your vampire friend here is one of the addicts?\u201d she asked as she stared at Aiden. I nodded my head. \u201cAnd you want to know how to help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is there a way to break this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is, but it\u2019s going to be painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle pain, I just want to stop this,\u201d Aiden finally chimed in. I wondered if he was having second thoughts and would run out of the house. I really didn\u2019t want to see him in pain but if it would end his addiction, then I\u2019d suck it up and do whatever I had to.</p><p>\u201cNot for you,\u201d Ms. Ozland said to Aiden. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very painful for you,\u201d she said looking at me. My eyes widened as I wondered just how painful it\u2019d be and why it had anything to do with me, I wasn\u2019t the addict.</p> <p>\u201cForget it, I can beat this on my own. I won\u2019t see Gwen suffer for my sins,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>Ms. Ozland smiled sweetly at him and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid once our magic intertwines itself in your system; this is the only way to get rid of it.\u201d Aiden looked at me like he was tortured at the thought of me being in pain. I tried to act like I wasn\u2019t scared and that this would be a walk in the park, but the truth was, I was terrified. There was no point in trying to hide it from Aiden. He could feel my emotions ever since feeding from me. I was a bit depressed that I wouldn\u2019t be able to experience his bite anymore. It had been one of the most amazing sexual experiences of my life. Aiden chuckled and I shot him a look, crimson coloring my cheeks. He may not have been able to tell what I was thinking exactly, but he must have known I was thinking about sex. He winked at me and I quickly looked away. I didn\u2019t like him knowing what I was feeling.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d I asked Ms. Ozland, getting my mind back on more important things.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Gwen,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>\u201cYou heard her, this is the only way. If it\u2019ll help you, I\u2019m doing it.\u201d I said, my voice saying that this wasn\u2019t up for debate.</p><p>The small coffee table that had been sitting in the middle of the floor, instantly levitated and slowly moved to the other side of the room.</p> <p>\u201cBoth of you sit,\u201d Ms. Ozland said, pointing to the empty space. I sat Indian-style on the floor and waited for Aiden to join me. I didn\u2019t know if he was being stubborn because he really didn\u2019t want to see me in pain or because he didn\u2019t want to give up how the magic made him feel; probably a little bit of both. Aiden reluctantly sat on the floor in front of me, a look of chagrin coloring his face. He sat with his knees propped up while his arms circled them, causing his shirt to press tightly against his bicep. I admired his body while a heat stirred in my southern region. Aiden\u2019s eyes found mine and a devilishly handsome grin made itself known on his kissable lips. It had been a year since I\u2019d slept with anyone, but Aiden had ignited a fire, I thought was doomed to go out, courtesy of my crappy love life. Like a real life Casanova, Aiden swooped in and rescued my forgotten libido.</p><p>I realized we were staring hungrily into each other\u2019s eyes when Ms. Ozland\u2019s tiny hand snapped in front of me. The heat that had been building in my stomach quickly rushed to my cheeks and showed my embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d she said to Aiden. He held his arm out, palm side up but his eyes were still fastened on me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Aiden snarled, his fangs descending and his eyes black. We looked down at his hand. Ms. Ozland held a small dagger; with a red tip Aiden\u2019s pointer finger dripped a deep crimson where she had stuck him with it.</p><p>\u201cSuck on his finger,\u201d she said, thrusting Aiden\u2019s hand towards me. I looked at her like she\u2019d lost her marbles and hesitated too long. Aiden\u2019s finger healed as if he\u2019d never been stabbed. Ms. Ozland let out an annoyed sigh and held the dagger towards Aiden\u2019s finger again but he snatched his hand away.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you it\u2019s very dangerous taking blood from a vampire without their permission,\u201d Aiden said, his tone deadly calm. I shot Ms. Ozland a worried look, afraid Aiden might attack her. She seemed unfazed by Aiden\u2019s unspoken threat and grabbed his hand again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to take a witches\u2019 blood as well,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should explain what we\u2019re doing,\u201d I said to her, hoping that would calm the tension that suddenly intruded into the small space.</p> <p>\u201cYou will need to drink his blood in order to reconnect with the magic you gave away. When the blood hits your tongue, withdraw the magic from it and take it back into yourself.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose in disgust. \u201cExactly how do I withdraw the magic?\u201d I was a young grasshopper next to Ms. Ozland and I could see the smile in her eyes as she observed the ignorance of my magical knowledge.</p><p>\u201cWhen the blood hits your tongue, your body will recognize the magic that\u2019s in it. Claim the magic as your own.\u201d Ms. Ozland explained. She held the dagger towards Aiden\u2019s hand and, with the nod from Aiden, pierced the tip of his finger again. She didn\u2019t need to throw his hand at me this time because Aiden willingly held it to my lips. I reluctantly plunged his finger into my mouth and sucked the blood that spilled from his wound. It seemed a little too intimate to have witnesses and I\u2019m sure my cheeks were the color of the very blood I was drinking.</p><p>\u201cNow, do you feel the hum of magic in his blood?\u201d Ms. Ozland asked. I concentrated on the metallic, slightly salty taste and tried to pick out the magic that lay somewhere beneath the normal tang. It was subtle at best; Aiden definitely hadn\u2019t been drinking brew for very long. My tongue became tingly, almost numb as I connected with the familiar hum of my magic.</p><p>Come back to me. I\u2019m willing you to return to my body. I thought over and over, feeling absolutely ridiculous. Luckily, Ms. Ozland and Aiden couldn\u2019t hear my lame attempts at reconnecting with my magic. When I thought all hope was lost and that this wasn\u2019t going to work, I felt a jolt of electricity shoot through my entire body. I fell back onto the floor and withered under the intense pain that seemed to be coursing through every inch of my body. My body shook with convulsions as a war raged within it, like my magic was a virus my body was trying to fight off.</p><p>\u201cMake....it...stop,\u201d I begged through clenched teeth. I was sure that if someone didn\u2019t save me, I\u2019d be dead within the next couple of minutes. It felt like my body was going to explode all over Ms. Ozland\u2019s quaint little living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to her?\u201d I heard Aiden ask harshly. If he decided to attack Ms. Ozland, I couldn\u2019t do a damn thing but watch her die. Tears streamed down face and my heart beat like a drum against my chest. My skin felt hot like my magic was sizzling me from the inside out and my muscles cramped as I fought against the pain.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine in a couple of seconds,\u201d Ms. Ozland said.</p><p>\u201cShe better be,\u201d Aiden warned.</p><p>\u201cIf not for you, she wouldn\u2019t be in this pain, vampire.\u201d</p><p>Aiden didn\u2019t comment on Ms. Ozland\u2019s words but knelt down beside me and brushed my hair out of my face. His eyes were terrified as he watched me.</p><p>Suddenly I was levitated in the air four feet and a strong burst of energy blasted into my stomach. I let out a bloodcurdling scream that I was sure the whole town heard. I felt weightless and at peace as soon as the energy settled itself within me.</p><p>Great, I\u2019m dead. I thought. I didn\u2019t feel any of the pain I\u2019d been subjected to just moments before and a strange calm washed through the entirety of my body. My hair flowed out from around my head like it was floating in an invisible pool of water I couldn\u2019t see. I stared up at the ceiling and wondered when the bright light would make itself known. I wasn\u2019t sure if supernatural creatures experienced the same death experiences as humans, but I had hope, and felt too curious not to see what lay behind the bright light.</p><p>I started to turn so that I was now hovering vertically rather than horizontally and I wondered if I looked like Bridget did to me, all gray and ghostly. At least I was wearing a cute outfit for eternity and not my rubber ducky flannel pajamas. Aiden was kneeling on the floor with hands bracing him and Ms. Ozland was sitting in her favorite floral chair, watching me. I arched my eyebrows at the thought that Ms. Ozland could see me.</p><p>When my feet hit the floor, I decided to try out my new ghostly advantages. I walked over to the nearest wall and started to go through it, only to run face first into it instead.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d I yelled as I cupped my nose. Ms. Ozland\u2019s laughter made me turn my head and I saw that Aiden was now looking at me too.</p><p>\u201cYou guys can see me?\u201d I asked with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be able to see you?\u201d Aiden asked. I looked down to where I had been lying, and then back at my audience. \u201cI thought...\u201d I started but had to suck in a deep breath as realization set in that I wasn\u2019t dead at all, somehow I\u2019d survived through the torment. \u201cI thought I was dead,\u201d I told them, visibly relieved that I was wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are very much alive my dear,\u201d Ms. Ozland said. My hand went to my heart as relief washed all over me.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I didn\u2019t know why I was so shocked, I mean I was warned that it would be painful, but I expected maybe a stomach ache or a headache. I hadn\u2019t expected it would feel like I was being burned from the inside out. The only evidence that I\u2019d just been tortured by magic was the thin layer of sweat that lined my forehead and the rats\u2019 nest that sat atop my head. I conjured a rubber band and ran my fingers through the knots; then drew it back into a ponytail.</p><p>\u201cYour magic was in a foreign place, a dark place so to speak. Magic is from nature, the energy that makes up everything, you see. It\u2019s not natural for it to settle into something so dark, such as vampire. We all know that the vampire virus is the devil\u2019s work, whereas magic is Mother Nature\u2019s. The dark and light cannot coexist together harmoniously. When you accepted the magic back into you, it was angry and had to reconnect within yourself,\u201d Ms. Ozland explained. In the grand scheme of things, it made sense, but to think of my magic as something capable of having feelings, such as being angry, was tough to swallow. It made it seem like I was possessed by my magic.</p> <p>\u201cIs he cured?\u201d I asked, nodding towards Aiden. He had been unusually quiet since I came out of my torture. He was leaning against the wall with his arms crossed and looking down at his feet with ire burning in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou took your magic away from him which I suspect was the strongest he\u2019s had?\u201d She asked and I nodded my head. \u201cThe rest of the magic is weak and will be out of his system by tomorrow night. He\u2019ll have to feed on regular blood tonight and tomorrow but should be fine afterwards.\u201d I shot him a look to get his approval but he wouldn\u2019t look at me. I sent him a glare that went unnoticed and then glanced back at Ms. Ozland.</p><p>\u201cThank you for helping us and I\u2019m sorry we bothered you so late. I\u2019ll be happy to pay you for your time.\u201d She waved off my attempts at paying her and ushered us to the door. Aiden pulled out a wad of cash from his pocket and placed it on the coffee table and then walked out the door. Ms. Ozland looked at the cash and then up at me. I shrugged my shoulders and smiled and then followed Aiden outside. Before Ms. Ozland could close the door, I turned around and said, \u201cThe other vampires, the ones who are addicted to our blood, would the same process work on them?\u201d It was painful, sure, but it\u2019d be worth it to clean up a horde of vampires to prevent them poaching on witches anymore.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cThose witches aren\u2019t alive anymore to reclaim anything. I\u2019m sure the NAWC is working on solving this problem, we\u2019ll just have to leave it in their capable hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe NAWC knows about this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, dear. The NAWC knows everything where witches are concerned.\u201d I bit my lip and nodded my head, wondering what the North American Witches Council had planned for cleaning up the mess. I was also hoping word about Aiden\u2019s small trip down brew alley didn\u2019t get out.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight Ms. Ozland and thank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, dear.\u201d</p><p>I walked down the small pathway and out through the gate to where Aiden waited for me. He didn\u2019t look at me when I reached him and when I grabbed for his hand he pulled away and walked over to his car after opening the passenger\u2019s side door for me. I hopped inside and he appeared in the driver\u2019s side almost instantly, starting the car and pulling away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I thought he was feeling guilty about what I had endured, that maybe he needed time to forgive himself. I thought that maybe losing my magic had put him in a bad mood, like an addict getting all pissy when they\u2019re without their drug. What I didn\u2019t expect was him pulling the car off to the side of the road and hopping out, slamming the door behind him. I turned in my seat to see where he went and noticed he was leaning against the back of the car. I opened my door and climbed out of his sporty Cadillac coupe, walking toward the back.</p><p>There was a full moon, high in the sky that cast a silver glow on our little town. In the distance, I could hear the werewolves howling as they hunted their dinner. They didn\u2019t need a full moon to change, but they couldn\u2019t fight the change during one. I kept far away from Micah during that time, it left him moody.</p> <p>\u201cAiden?\u201d I whispered. He looked up at me through a strand of his dark hair, his eyes showing that whatever he was about to say, was going to be bad. I lifted my hand to put on his shoulder but he pushed off the car and walked a couple feet away from me.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d he began. I crossed my arms across my chest, needing the security they offered as I waited for him to say whatever he needed to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you had to go through that tonight. I\u2019m sorry that I was the cause of it and most of all, I\u2019m sorry I let you down.\u201d I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his slim waist, resting my head on his shoulder. I loved the way his arms seemed to comfort me, the way no others could. One of his hands played with the strands of my hair while the other one rubbed my back. I closed my eyes, pausing a second to absorb the moment.</p><p>\u201cIf you were a smart woman, you\u2019d run as far away from me as possible and never look back,\u201d he said softly into my ear. I smiled and silently laughed, more to myself than for his benefit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2018d rather be dumb, if it means I get to be with you,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened tonight was as much my fault as it was yours. If I hadn\u2019t fed you blood, then I wouldn\u2019t have had to go through the pain of getting it back.\u201d I pulled away from him so that I could look into his eyes, a sudden thought demanding attention. \u201cIs Ian a brew addict also?\u201d Even though Fiona hated me, I still wanted to make sure she was safe.</p><p>\u201cIan who?\u201d Aiden asked casually.</p><p>\u201cIan Despereaux, your friend. The one you sent to pick me up for the Gala when you stood me up, which I haven\u2019t forgiven you for, by the way.\u201d I was smiling because I knew that there wasn\u2019t much Aiden could do that I wouldn\u2019t forgive him for, but I quickly lost my humor when he looked at me with confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Ian,\u201d I said again, hoping the third time would knock some sense into Aiden\u2019s memory. When he didn\u2019t reveal that he knew the name, a sudden dread snaked its way through my body and settled into the pit of my stomach.</p> <p>17</p><p>Aiden and I headed to Vain. That was the only place I could think of when it came to finding Fiona. I tried her cell but she wasn\u2019t answering my calls. If something happened to her, I\u2019d never forgive myself for allowing her to leave with Ian. I knew I should have trusted my gut feeling and now, because I didn\u2019t, something bad could happen to my best friend.</p><p>We made our way through the back door and I rushed ahead of Aiden toward the front of the club to search for Fiona. Vain was really busy with visiting humans wanting to experience a real life vampire club. I heard moaning coming from a curtained room. Vain allowed feedings, and while vampires could glamour humans into doing almost anything, Vain had strict consent rules. The vampires that wanted to feed off any humans had to check in with a receptionist and only after confirming that the human was willing and not under the vampire\u2019s hypnosis, could they feed in a private room.</p><p>I stood up on my tiptoes to see if I could see any blondes that resembled Fiona, but none of them looked familiar. Pushing through the club goers, I scanned everyone\u2019s face in hopes of finding either Ian or Fiona. A man with a large beer gut slapped my ass and before I could zap him, he screamed out in pain. I turned to see that Aiden had his hand twisted behind his back.</p><p>\u201cApologize to the lady,\u201d he snarled. The man winced with watery eyes and looked like he might piss his pants.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m...sorry...I didn\u2019t...mean to offend you,\u201d The man stuttered. I nodded. I really didn\u2019t have time to deal with a human who had had too many drinks and was feeling frisky. Aiden released the man, who collapsed in a nearby chair with shaky hands.</p><p>\u201cThat was a little extreme,\u201d I told Aiden.</p><p>\u201cI happen to hold you in very high regard. Have you seen Fiona?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. What if we don\u2019t find her? If something happens...\u201d Tears began to fill my eyes and threatened to spill as thoughts of the worst case scenario played through my mind. I had seen, through the memories of Bridget, exactly what the brew dealers were capable of. I couldn\u2019t deal with the idea of Fiona going through that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>\u201cHow? How are we supposed to find her when she won\u2019t take my calls?\u201d I knew he didn\u2019t have the answer but was just trying to make me feel better. Right now seemed like a good time to be optimistic. I had to believe that Fiona was okay and that Ian wasn\u2019t who I feared he was.</p><p>I saw a head of blonde hair near the private rooms and dashed like a madwoman across the dance floor. I got a lot of curses and snide remarks from the partiers but I didn\u2019t care. I reached the private rooms and pulled back the curtain of the room I had seen the blonde enter. A tall black man was sitting on the couch while the blonde stood in front of him. When she turned around, she gave me a fang-filled smile.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I thought you were someone else.\u201d I left the room feeling completely lost. I tried Fiona\u2019s cell phone one more time but my call went unanswered again. I never really knew what hopelessness and despair felt like until now; my optimism had clearly hauled ass out the window.</p><p>My phone went off and I quickly tried to flip it open but my hands were too excited and it dropped to the floor and slid down the hallway. I ran in a bent over position to retrieve my ringing cell phone and swiped it up, opened it, and pressed it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I said, my voice breathless. \u201cFiona?\u201d I hadn\u2019t looked at the caller I.D. in my mad dash to answer my phone.</p><p>\u201cGwen, it\u2019s Micah,\u201d his voice was somber at best.</p><p>\u201cMicah?\u201d My eyebrows pushed together with my confusion. I had been anticipating Fiona on the other end, so Micah\u2019s voice caught me off guard. I gripped the phone tighter. Micah only called when he needed me to read a dead body. I silently prayed he hadn\u2019t called about Fiona. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he continued, hesitant to speak. \u201cGwen, we need for you to meet us at the entrance of town, on the north side.\u201d I could tell he was hiding something. His voice held the heaviness of sadness that turned my blood an icy cold.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Micah?\u201d I whispered as I stared blankly at the wall in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk when you get here.\u201d I nodded my head without realizing that he couldn\u2019t see it and flipped my phone shut. An icy breeze gripped my neck, sending shivers to dance along my spine. We were inside, but I recognized that breeze. I\u2019d felt it whenever I saw Bridget. It was death.</p> <p>Aiden drove to the northern entrance of town and I stared blankly at the darkened landscape as it blurred past my window. When the car stopped, I noticed Micah and Wyatt standing by a large oak tree with their arms crossed and heads hung. I pushed the car door open and sluggishly stepped out. Aiden grabbed my hand but the gesture did nothing for me. I told him about the conversation with Micah and, although he didn\u2019t say it, I could tell he was worried. We walked through the tall grass and over to where Micah and Wyatt stood. There was a body, but unlike the others, this one had a sheet draped over it.</p><p>When I made eye contact with Wyatt, I knew who was under the sheet. He gave me a sad confirmation with a nod of his head and I collapsed to my knees as tears blurred my vision. Aiden\u2019s arms went around me as I sobbed against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI have to see her,\u201d I said, looking up with desperation. Maybe they\u2019d gotten it wrong. Maybe it was just someone that looked like her. Micah looked at Wyatt and then down at me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea, Gwen. She doesn\u2019t look like the others.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught in my throat and my entire body began to shake. I placed my hands out in front of me and dug my fingers into the moist earth, needing to steady myself with something solid. I took deep gulps of air into my lungs but it didn\u2019t fill the void that settled in the pit of my stomach. I crawled over to where the body lay and with unsure hands, folded the sheet back.</p><p>My hand instantly dropped away from the sheet when Fiona\u2019s face greeted me. It actually was her, my best friend. It hadn\u2019t been a case of mistaken identity like my subconscious prayed for. Her blonde hair gracefully lay flat while her face was turned away from me. She didn\u2019t look pale, like the other bodies. I turned her face toward me and red caught my peripheral. Her neck looked like an animal had taken a large chunk out of it. Dark blood colored her otherwise perfect skin, the contrast being unbearable.</p> <p>Aiden pulled me up off the ground and into his arms where I collapsed against him, unsure if my legs could hold me up. I grabbed fistfuls of his shirt while I screamed into his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have let her see that! What the hell were you guys thinking?\u201d Aiden yelled at the two detectives. It wasn\u2019t their fault; I\u2019d been the one who pulled the sheet away, the one who needed proof.</p><p>I wiped the salty tears away from my eyes and cheeks and took a deep breath to calm myself. It was useless of course. Fiona\u2019s body hovered in my peripheral, making calming down nearly impossible.</p><p>\u201cIt was Ian Despereaux,\u201d I said to no one in particular. Of course, I didn\u2019t have proof that Ian had killed Fiona, but I knew in my gut that he was responsible.</p><p>\u201cIs that the man you were with at the Gala?\u201d Micah asked. I nodded my head as I suddenly remembered Ian\u2019s lips being on mine. Nausea turned my stomach, threatening to make me vomit. It had been one big game to him, the story about Aiden working late, their friendship, and accompanying me to the Gala. I wasn\u2019t exactly sure why he was playing with me, but I vowed to myself that if it were the last thing I did, I\u2019d find out.</p><p>Wyatt pulled out a small radio and sent a message to one of his staff to bring in Ian Despereaux. That was easier said than done, he wasn\u2019t from Flora and we had no idea how to find him or get a hold of him. I knew that Fiona\u2019s death was a message to me personally. Ian knew that I\u2019d see her. Every time I was around him I felt as if he were watching me with an interest I didn\u2019t appreciate.</p> <p>Wyatt\u2019s radio went off and he held the button to talk into it. When he was done, he clipped it to his belt and said, \u201cIan\u2019s at the police station and he wants to talk to Gwen.\u201d I scrunched my eyebrows in confusion and anger at the thought of even seeing the man responsible for Fiona\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk to him, Gwen,\u201d Aiden said. I looked up at him and wondered how he expected me not to talk to him, to find out what he wanted; it was the least I could do for my dead best friend.</p><p>\u201cYes I do,\u201d I told him sternly.</p><p>Fiona\u2019s body had been moved to the morgue while Aiden and I accompanied Wyatt and Micah to the police station. It seemed like the night was endless. Not only had I dealt with Fiona hating me, but I also discovered my so-called-boyfriend was addicted to brew, went through torture to save him from himself, and found out that my best friend had been murdered. As I walked down the sterile hallway towards the holding cells, I knew this night was nowhere close to being over. I prayed for the sun to move on fast forward and give me an excuse why I couldn\u2019t see Ian, but we still had three hours until the sun rose.</p><p>Micah pushed through the swinging doors that led to the cells with me right behind him and Aiden bringing up the rear. The main jail area held six cells that were currently vacant, but we kept walking to the door on the far end that led to the cells designated for vampires. My heart pounded and slammed against my chest like a sledgehammer and my deep breaths did nothing to calm it. I knew who I\u2019d see beyond that gray door and what he had done; the adrenaline inundated my body like a flashflood.</p><p>Micah turned and said, \u201cAre you sure you wanna do this?\u201d His eyes searched mine for any hints of hesitation, but I was sure he couldn\u2019t find an ounce of doubt.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Aiden grabbed my hand and squeezed it the tiniest bit and then we all three walked through the door to confront Ian Despereaux.</p><p>18</p> <p>Ian was leaning against the interior brick wall with his arms crossed across his chest and his ankles crossed. His eyes followed me all the way down the small hallway until I was standing in front of his cell. I wasn\u2019t sure how I would react to seeing him again, but throwing a fit would have been understandable. Instead, I was calm. I eyed him with an anger I didn\u2019t even realize I could harbor. I was definitely calm before the storm; my insides churning like dark, cloudy skies, ready to explode.</p><p>Micah and Aiden flanked me while I stood front and center, ready for Ian to discuss whatever he wanted with me. My hands fisted at my sides as I waited for him to speak first, I wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of seeing me throw a temper-tantrum. He didn\u2019t know that what he had done to Fiona was gnawing away at me and destined to leave me in a heaping mess of tears and loss. I would not give him the satisfaction of witnessing the distress he caused.</p><p>Ian pushed off the wall and walked over to the bars that separated us. His hands wrapped around the thick bars and he quickly pulled them away as a thin wisp of smoke floated from his burnt hand. A smile tugged at the corner of my mouth but I quickly straightened it out and remained emotionless. The FPD made sure that the vampire cells were encased with pure silver. For reasons unknown vampires can\u2019t tolerate silver.</p><p>\u201cI take it you got my message?\u201d Ian said. I bit down on the screams that wanted to leave my lips; I would not go off on him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said softly. It tore me apart to know that he referred to Fiona as a message he was using to get to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, but it\u2019s you that we need and your attention was necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about just asking for what you want instead of murdering an innocent woman? Whatever game you\u2019re playing, your strategy sucks. There is nothing to hold over my head now,\u201d I spat out with a bitter laugh. Ian smiled devilishly and pressed his face close enough to the bars to keep from touching them but still close enough to my face. I wanted nothing more than to take a step back and away from him but I wouldn\u2019t back down from his taunts.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he began, running a finger over his bottom lip. \u201cafter our kiss, it\u2019s all I think about.\u201d His eyes turned black with desire as he stared intensely at me. Aiden\u2019s fist moved so fast, that all I saw was a blur as he punched Ian through the silver bars. When he pulled his arm away, his flesh was singed but otherwise okay.</p><p>\u201cLie again, asshole, and it\u2019ll be your head that\u2019s ripped off next,\u201d Aiden warned with a deadly calm tone. Ian licked the blood that dripped from his lip and I watched in awe as it healed before my eyes.</p><p>He laughed and made eye contact with me again. \u201cAsk her if I\u2019m lying?\u201d</p><p>I turned to Aiden and said, \u201cHe kissed me, I didn\u2019t kiss him,\u201d and then turned back to Ian and said, \u201cI slapped him for it.\u201d Ian laughed like the slap had been a playful one and not one of anger.</p><p>Then he shrugged. \u201cYou can defend your actions all you want, but I know what you felt in that moment; you can\u2019t lie about that.\u201d Aiden snarled, pacing up and down the small hallway as if trying to conceal his anger.</p><p>\u201cDoes your darling Aiden know that you shared a kiss with Detective Reynolds here?\u201d Ian nodded towards Micah. I openly gaped at him, confused as to how he had known about that. I hadn\u2019t told Fiona. I knew exactly what Ian was doing, he was trying to cause an argument between the three of us and I hoped it wasn\u2019t working. I told Aiden about me and Micah kissing when I found him with the naked bimbo, but he hadn\u2019t mentioned it since. It seemed like a million nights ago.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know about that,\u201d Aiden said as he stared holes into Micah. I thought I was going to have to witness Micah and Aiden fighting, but Aiden took a deep breath and said, \u201cQuit stalling. What\u2019d you want to talk to Gwen about?\u201d I had no clue why I was even standing in the jail, giving Ian what he wanted. I wanted nothing more than to go home, crawl under my blankets and cry. The more I thought about that though, the more I didn\u2019t want to go home. Fiona wouldn\u2019t be there and I wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the emptiness her death would cause. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are special, Gwen,\u201d Ian said, interrupting my thoughts. I brought my eyes back to him and cocked my eyebrow, unimpressed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me and if you don\u2019t get to your point, I\u2019m walking out those doors.\u201d I was slowly losing what meager control I had over myself and was on the verge of frying him to a crisp.</p><p>\u201cOh I know more about you than you think. We\u2019ve been searching for someone like you for a while now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m the only one who you\u2019ll deal with.\u201d</p><p>I released an annoyed sigh and ran a hand over my forehead. \u201cWhatever game you\u2019re playing, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d I turned to leave, not wanting to look at Ian anymore. It seemed he liked playing with me like I was prey that he was just waiting to kill.</p><p>\u201cEven if I could bring Fiona back?\u201d Ian called from his cell. I stopped in my tracks and half turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lying, Gwen.\u201d Aiden said. I ignored him and walked back to Ian\u2019s cell, my hand tingling with the magic that waited to be directed.</p> <p>\u201cYou already took her away from me, now you\u2019re going to taunt me with her resurrection? You are stupid aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s taunting? I am one hundred percent serious. I can bring her back on one condition,\u201d Ian said with a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you?\u201d I countered. Fiona meant nothing to him and I was sure that the only thing he wanted me for was my blood. He was currently stuck in jail and not getting out anytime soon. Not to mention, the dead couldn\u2019t be brought back. Their souls moved on to the hereafter and those who didn\u2019t, still couldn\u2019t connect with their bodies anymore.</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? Wouldn\u2019t you do anything to save your best friend? Whatever the price to bring her back is worth it isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ian asked with knowing eyes. It could have been my weariness or the loss I felt for Fiona, but I was actually thinking about his offer. He was right, it didn\u2019t matter what he wanted from me, if it meant Fiona would be okay.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Gwen, you don\u2019t have to put up with this,\u201d Aiden said, wrapping an arm around my waist and pulling me towards the door. I dug my heels in as best I could and ran back to Ian.</p><p>\u201cProve it, prove that you can bring her back and I\u2019ll agree to help you.\u201d A victory smile spread across Ian\u2019s lips while a shiver ran all through my body. I knew what I was saying was stupid but I couldn\u2019t risk not trying whatever Ian had up his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Absolutely not!\u201d Aiden yelled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to see her body to bring her back,\u201d Ian said, ignoring Aiden\u2019s protests. I looked expectantly at Micah but he didn\u2019t seem interested in what Ian was offering either.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Micah! What if it was Wyatt dead on that slab? What if there was a way to bring him back? Wouldn\u2019t you do it, or anything else to save him?\u201d I was at the point of begging, but the seeds of hope had been planted in my mind and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the possibilities. If Ian could prove to me that Fiona could be brought back, I wouldn\u2019t stop until it happened.</p><p>\u201cGwen, you don\u2019t even know if he can actually do it. This could be a ploy to escape. You should know better than anyone that the dead can\u2019t be brought back. If you agree to this, it\u2019ll be your body on that slab and I can\u2019t take that risk. I\u2019m sorry, Gwen,\u201d Micah said with finality.</p><p>\u201cI promise Gwen will not be killed. She\u2018s too special,\u201d Ian said. We all turned to look at him and Micah gave a gruff laugh.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for not believing a murderer.\u201d</p> <p>Ian pursed his lips in mock thought. \u201cDo you have proof I\u2019m a murderer?\u201d Micah began to speak but closed his mouth as he thought about what he could charge him for. Ian hadn\u2019t come right out and said he killed Fiona, or any other witch.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t kill her, then why did you turn yourself in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I came to the police station because I knew you\u2019d be looking to blame me. I\u2019m not worried, though, because you\u2019ll find no evidence that ties her murder to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know she was dead?\u201d I asked in disbelief. His story sounded all well and good but he couldn\u2019t dodge the fact that he had come to the police station knowing Fiona was dead already.</p><p>\u201cBecause I saw who did it and what they want,\u201d Ian said with a smile. I considered him for a few moments and crossed my arms across my chest. He reminded me of one of those animals I\u2019d seen on the Discovery channel. They tempt their prey into coming to them and then they strike. He knew the information would be too tempting for me to turn down. I could see myself getting closer and closer to the lions\u2019 den but I couldn\u2019t stop myself from exploring it.</p><p>\u201cWho killed her and what do they want?\u201d I asked. Aiden was leaning against the wall with a look that could kill and Micah stood just behind me waiting for Ian to answer my questions. I knew that Aiden was trying to keep me safe, but I couldn\u2019t risk ignoring Ian\u2019s tempting offer. I was powerful in my own right and could handle myself against Ian if I had to, or at least I hoped I could.</p><p>\u201cI cannot tell you who they are but I can say that you, Gwen, are on everyone\u2019s wish list. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t been kidnapped yet, actually. And you are very lucky that it was me who found you and not the others.\u201d</p><p>I laughed bitterly. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me, lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering the other option, you are,\u201d Ian said with a grave tone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you guys heard, but I\u2019m not different from any other witch.\u201d I released an aggravated sigh, annoyed that I was being targeted for the wrong reasons. Ian watched me with knowing eyes and I averted my gaze to the floor where I focused all of my attention on my stilettos.</p><p>\u201cShall we visit your friend then?\u201d Ian asked. My head popped up and I looked back at Micah expectantly. \u201cYou can keep him in silver while he tries to bring her back. If he can\u2019t do it, then you just throw him back in here.\u201d I hoped my eyes conveyed my hopelessness and that Micah would fall under the weight of my stare.</p><p>I was spared having to beg any further when Micah pulled out a pair of silver handcuffs and said, \u201cTurn around\u201d to Ian. Ian happily complied and stuck his hands through the small window that allowed Micah to handcuff him. The handcuffs were made out of pure silver and Micah made sure that they touched Ian\u2019s wrist so wisps of seared flesh floated through the small holding area. I breathed through my mouth so I wouldn\u2019t inhale the smell of burning flesh; but it didn\u2019t help, I could still smell it. Micah unlocked the cell door and grabbed hold of Ian\u2019s arm, pulling him into the hallway and toward the door. I quickly followed behind them and shot Aiden a look that I instantly regretted. He looked pissed!</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re falling for this, you\u2019re smarter than that, Gwen,\u201d he said, his tone filled with disdain.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me that this is stupid, I know that!\u201d I snapped back. \u201cBut...what other choice do I have, Aiden? If there is a small chance that he can bring her back, even if it\u2019s only a one percent chance, then I\u2019ll try it.\u201d I looked at him as my eyes blurred with unshed tears. The memories of what Fiona had looked like in the tall grass haunted my thoughts. I blamed myself for not watching after her like I should have. I knew that Ian was bad news and I still let her walk out of our apartment with him. If the FPD was looking for someone to charge with her murder, than I was as guilty as Ian. Okay, maybe not, but I felt like I was, I had seen her in the hands of the enemy and didn\u2019t rescue her.</p><p>\u201cPlease understand. Fiona is my best friend and she\u2019s been with me through so much. I can\u2019t accept that she\u2019s gone for good, not yet. Give me this one last piece of hope and then, if what Ian says is a lie, I\u2019ll deal with the loss of her, but not yet.\u201d The tears that blurred my eyes fell slowly down my cheeks and I quickly brushed them away, not wanting to be weak in a moment that called for strength. I needed to have a level head at the moment.</p><p>Aiden wrapped me in his arms and kissed the top of my head as I tried to gain my composure. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to get your hopes up. Have you even thought about how a vampire could be able to bring the dead back?\u201d He spoke with a careful tone, as if I was on the verge of losing it, and maybe I was, I had been through a lot tonight.</p><p>I lifted my head from his chest and wiped the tears away and sniffed, hoping that snot wasn\u2019t sliding out of my nose. \u201cHow, as a vampire, were you able to conjure a rose?\u201d I whispered so no one would hear. I had no clue what kind of tricks were up Ian\u2019s sleeve but I had hope that from his brew consumption, he could save Fiona. Aiden didn\u2019t say anything, knowing I proved my point.</p><p>\u201cYou guys coming?\u201d Micah called from the opened doorway. I gave Aiden one last look and headed towards Micah and Ian. I didn\u2019t expect Aiden to understand what mindset I was currently in, but I wished he\u2019d keep his pessimism to himself, he\u2019d have plenty of time for \u201cI told ya sos\u201d later.</p><p>We all rode in Micah\u2019s SUV over to the morgue. My hands wouldn\u2019t quit shaking and I couldn\u2019t stop from bouncing my knee as I anticipated what would happen. We only had an hour before the sun rose and Ian and Aiden would be dead asleep until tomorrow night. I couldn\u2019t wait an entire day without knowing whether Fiona was alive or permanently dead. My mind reeled with the memory of first meeting Fiona, ten years ago....</p><p>The NAWC headquarters was in a special otherworldly town called Moon. A lot of humans thought that Moon was a werewolf town but witches also lived there. The phases of the moon play a very important part in our magic. I was sixteen then, when my powers chose me. I had gotten a summons to appear in front of the NAWC so that I could be initiated into the world of witches. My parents had happily shipped me off, since they were very religious and not comfortable with having a witch for a daughter. My mother had let it slip that her mother had also been a witch and that she hadn\u2019t spoken to her in almost twenty years. I guessed she was telling me that even though I was her daughter, she wouldn\u2019t speak to me either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Being kicked out at sixteen had been one of the hardest things I had to deal with at the time. I didn\u2019t understand why the magic had chosen me but because of it, I had lost my family. I hated the gift that was pushed upon me. My parents were nice enough to pay for a one-way bus ticket to Washington State so that I would be the NAWC\u2019s problem. I had grown up in the countryside of Illinois and hadn\u2019t ever been out of state. I cried a lot on the bus, in the privacy of the small bathroom. I didn\u2019t understand how a parent could throw their child out for something that wasn\u2019t their fault and I wanted nothing more than to run back to Illinois and be with them again.</p><p>The bus let me off at the entrance of Moon, which just looked like the edge of a forest. My duffel bag hung on my shoulder as I watched the bus fade into the distance. I turned back to stare at the trees in front of me and had an overwhelming feeling of loneliness. I was in a strange state, stranded alongside the highway with nothing but forest on both sides of me. I started to walk, certain the bus driver had mistaken my destination when I heard a soft whooshing sound and a blonde girl around my age, step out of the woods. She was dressed in black tights, a red and black plaid skirt, and a gray turtleneck. She didn\u2019t look like she belonged in a forest. I watched her for a few moments, unsure of what to say.</p><p>\u201cHi, are you on your way to the NAWC?\u201d she asked excitedly. Who the heck was this girl that just popped out of the forest in the middle of nowhere dressed like she belonged in a private school? I thought. I nodded my head because my voice seemed to shy away from the bubbly girl.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d she said, grabbing my hand and pulling me towards the forest. I let her guide me through the forest; it beat walking down a deserted highway by myself.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Fiona Bennett. I arrived here last week although I\u2019ve always had magic; my father thought I should study in Moon this year. Daddy is a powerful warlock and expects a lot from me but I don\u2019t mind, I love magic and you\u2019ll love it too. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Fiona said with a big smile. I arched my eyebrows, shocked that anyone could be this enthusiastic about being a witch.</p><p>\u201cGwen Sparks,\u201d I said softly. We were standing at the edge of the woods and then Fiona pulled me over the edge and a warm breeze caressed my face and the forest disappeared into what looked like a town out of England, or at least the towns I\u2019d seen In English movies.</p><p>\u201cYou have like the perfect name for a witch you know that? Gwen Sparks,\u201d she giggled and wiggled her fingers as if she were about to cast magic at me. I smiled at her charades and the tiniest bit of my loneliness disappeared.</p><p>\u201cGwen? We\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>I looked up from my daydream and saw that Aiden was trying to get my attention. It had been a long time since I thought about my past.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, just thinking,\u201d I told Aiden and climbed out of the SUV. Flora had a small hospital that was just a small square building with the morgue in the basement. The last time I had come here it was when I read Amy Harper\u2019s memories. With each step closer to the hospital I knew that it wasn\u2019t Amy Harper who waited for me in the basement.</p><p>19</p><p>The screeching of the metal tray echoed through the small room like nails on a chalkboard. I concentrated on my breathing instead of who lay on the tray. Two men that worked at the morgue lifted the body from the cold storage space and laid it on the table that sat in the middle of the room. The black body bag was like a nightmare come to life. I had to turn away from it so that I wouldn\u2019t start hyperventilating. I didn\u2019t claim to understand why certain things happened, and usually I agreed that everything happens for a reason, Fiona\u2019s death, I couldn\u2019t see the silver lining.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay, Gwen?\u201d Micah asked from my side. I had been staring intently at the brick wall and at the sound of his voice, my eyes slowly found his. I sucked in a chest full of air and nodded my head quickly. Micah didn\u2019t look like he believed me and he was right, I wasn\u2019t okay. All I saw when I thought of Fiona was how lifeless her body had been in the overgrown grass, the red that colored her throat, and the emptiness of her eyes.</p><p>The two morgue men left the room, leaving the four of us to our privacy. I reluctantly turned around and ignored the heaviness in my chest. The bubble of hope that stuck in my gut was about to be busted and I needed to prepare myself for it. It goes against nature to be able to bring the dead back to life and I worried that if by some miracle Fiona was brought back, what would she be brought back as?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to put yourself through this, Gwen.\u201d Aiden tried to penetrate through my insanity again but I bit my tongue and kept my eyes focused on Ian. Aiden let out an annoyed sigh and leaned against the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Bring her back,\u201d Aiden snapped. Ian shook his wrist in a gesture that said he couldn\u2019t do anything with his hands bound.</p><p>Micah walked over to him and said, \u201cIf you try anything, you won\u2019t get any further than that door before you\u2019re dead, got it?\u201d Ian smiled like Micah hadn\u2019t just threatened to kill him and nodded his head, his eyes watching me. Once Ian\u2019s hands were free, he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt and watched me with unspoken words dancing on his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, my voice shrill.</p><p>\u201cI need blood,\u201d Ian said with a smirk. My eyes widened. \u201cWell we\u2019re in a hospital and they have blood.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stand the delay. Why couldn\u2019t he just snap his fingers and make Fiona pop up and say \u201cGotcha!\u201d I could accept that it was a cruel joke if it meant Fiona was alive. Maybe she had planned this to get back at me for supposedly being interested in Ian.</p><p>\u201cI need witches\u2019 blood,\u201d Ian announced and was answered with Aiden\u2019s snarls and a low growl from Micah. If the situation wasn\u2019t so stressful, I would have felt honored to have two strong men be so protective over me. Unfortunately, the situation was dire and their amped up testosterone wasn\u2019t helping.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cSo I can bring your friend back, of course,\u201d Ian said sarcastically. I glared at him with all of my pent-up anger and he held his hands up in surrender. \u201cI have to use magic to bring her back; for that, I need the blood of a witch.\u201d</p><p>Aiden had pushed off the wall and was standing in front of me as my own personal vampire blockade. His body was rigid with his rock hard muscles ready to rip Ian\u2019s head off. His hands fisted at his sides and his feet were braced shoulder-width apart. I placed a hand on his shoulder and walked around his tense body. I shrugged out of my jacket and held my wrist out towards Ian. Aiden was in front of me so fast, I had to blink back my surprise. His eyes were black with anger and his fangs fully emerged.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d he snarled at me. Considering what Aiden and I had just gone through to get my magic back from him, it was a stupid action. I knew Aiden felt bad for the torture I went through to reclaim my magic, but I knew that\u2019s not what he was angry about. Vampires didn\u2019t like to share their property and to Aiden, that was exactly what I was, his property. What was fueling his anger was jealousy.</p><p>\u201cI told you I was going to do whatever I could, if it meant bringing Fiona back,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice stiff. \u201cHe won\u2019t take too much,\u201d I said but I looked at Ian when I said it. I knew that I wasn\u2019t in any danger with Aiden and Micah there to protect me. I wasn\u2019t too thrilled to have Ian bite me, but I had to look at the big picture and that was Fiona.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t allow it!\u201d Aiden ordered and in return got a sarcastic laugh from Ian. Aiden was across the room and on top of Ian within milliseconds. Snarls and sickening cracks echoed through the room, leaving my stomach upset with nausea.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to do something?\u201d I yelled at Micah. He shrugged his shoulders as if the thought of ending the vampires\u2019 temper-tantrum was the very last thing on his to-do list. I grumbled my anger and walked over to the blur that was Ian and Aiden.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I yelled at them. I might as well have been trying to tell a tiger to change its stripes, for all the good it did. I was way past my boiling point and didn\u2019t have the patience to deal with two vampires going at each other like rabid dogs. My hands tingled to the point of numbness and with all of my anger directed at the blur, I held my hands out and a bright blast of blue magic shot from my palms and hit my two targets, sending them to be blown apart from each other. The room was small so they had only landed a couple feet from each other. \u201cEnough!\u201d I said strictly. Aiden and Ian groaned as they got to their feet and when it looked like they would go after each other again, I produced an apple sized orb of magic and held it at the ready as I eyed them both.</p><p>\u201cWe have less than an hour until the sun rises. We don\u2019t have time for games or jealousy.\u201d I took a moment to give them both a dirty look and then held out my wrist again. \u201cIan is going to drink from me and then he\u2019s going to bring Fiona back. If it doesn\u2019t work then I\u2019ll stake him myself. Aiden you don\u2019t have to be okay with this but you can not order me not to.\u201d They were lucky I didn\u2019t turn them to ash right then and there, I was so pissed off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of a bad ass aren\u2019t you?\u201d Ian said with one of his famous smirks. I wanted nothing more than to rip his head off myself and cut my losses, but I didn\u2019t. I arched a brow and gave a slight nod of my head, daring him to push me further. He bit his tongue and reached for my wrist. Aiden didn\u2019t say anything as he walked past me and out of the room, yelling a loud curse to echo in his wake. I knew that it had to be hard on him, but with the night I was having, I couldn\u2019t focus on my relationship woes.</p><p>I heard a click of a gun and saw a red laser dot on Ian\u2019s chest. I turned my head to see that Micah was holding some sort of fancy handgun with its aim on Ian. \u201cYou stop when I say, otherwise I\u2019ll pump you full of silver,\u201d he said. I couldn\u2019t help myself, I laughed. Surely the stress was causing me to go insane because the situation I was in was no laughing matter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou...sound...like some...kind of...gangster from the twenties,\u201d I said between hysterical chuckles. I kept picturing Micah in a pinstripe gangster suit with a thick New York accent. When it seemed no one was finding Ian\u2019s death threat as funny as I, I regained my composure and got back on track.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, holding back my laughter. Ian raised my arm toward his lips and all of a sudden, nothing was funny. I was in a real life dangerous situation, not to mention sexual. The memory of what Aiden\u2019s bite felt like made me question whether or not I should share something like that with Ian. We were in a hospital; I could have a nurse draw blood for Ian. As much as that sounded like an excellent plan, we were dangerously close to sunrise and if we didn\u2019t hurry, Ian would zonk out for the day.</p><p>My heart beat strongly against my chest as I waited for Ian to sink his fangs into my wrist. He captured my eyes and hesitated to bite. He was enjoying my nervous anticipation and drawing it out for as long as he could, or so I thought. He wrapped an arm around my waist and pulled me into his chest, leaning down so that only I would hear his words.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll do anything for your friend?\u201d He whispered. I nodded my head, unsure what he meant. \u201cOnce she is brought back, remember you said that and remember that I confirmed it.\u201d He stepped back and lifted my arm, leaving me utterly confused as to what the hell he was talking about but before I could question him further his fangs sunk into my skin.</p><p>I let out a yelp as waves of warmth washed through my entire body, leaving me yearning for more. His lips against my skin as he sucked blood from my body were a dark seduction I couldn\u2019t get enough of. Ian\u2019s bite was different than Aiden\u2019s, stronger. I moaned and worried that my knees would give out with the pure delight that overtook me. Ian pulled me closer to help hold onto me and I happily leaned into him. I rubbed my body against him with my lust in overdrive and my only thoughts were of how to get our clothes off as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Micah ordered from beside us. Ian growled and reluctantly let go of my wrist. He held me for a few moments as the waves of sexual pleasure wafted through my body and finally allowed me to stand on my own. Once clear-headed, I pushed away from him and put the table between us. I was so embarrassed I couldn\u2019t look at either one of the men in the room and was very thankful Aiden hadn\u2019t witnessed what happened. If the shoe were on the other foot, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to watch Aiden have an orgasm with another woman.</p><p>No one said anything about our blood exchange, luckily. Ian placed both of his hands on Fiona\u2019s temples and closed his eyes as his lips chanted an incantation that I couldn\u2019t understand. It was bizarre to see a vampire doing magic, unnatural.</p><p>I thought I saw Fiona\u2019s hand twitch out of the corner of my eye and the breath in my lungs caught in my throat. I stared wide-eyed at my best friend\u2019s body, willing her to wake up with silent prayers. Ian continued to chant and my impatience was getting the best of me. I stepped up to the stainless steel table and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Why isn\u2019t she waking up?\u201d I looked back at Micah but his thoughts showed all over his face; he didn\u2019t expect her to wake up. I turned back to Ian and Fiona and grabbed her hand, tears falling down my cheeks as I waited for her to come back from death.</p> <p>When it seemed all hope was lost, and that Ian had been lying about his talents, I hung my head in defeat. Deep down, I knew that it was improbable but I had pushed the doubt aside and held on to every ounce of hope I had. Hope that was now squashed like a bug.</p><p>Fingers trembled against my own and I looked at mine and Fiona\u2019s joined hands. Her fingers moved lazily but they moved! I was utterly speechless, full of disbelief and happiness that something was happening.</p><p>\u201cFiona?\u201d I said softly but didn\u2019t get a response. Ian said one last round of chants and all of a sudden, Fiona gasped loudly and her eyes popped open. It was like the world stopped moving and everything was in slow motion. I watched Fiona sit up on her own and look around the room in confusion. My feet were firmly planted to the floor and my mouth gaped with my surprise. I stared at her like she was something my brain couldn\u2019t comprehend and in truth, she was. She was death that had been resurrected, something that shouldn\u2019t have been possible.</p><p>\u201cGwen, what am I doing in the morgue?\u201d Fiona asked with a scratchy voice. As soon as I heard her speak, I was brought out of my shock and encased her in one of the tightest bear hugs I could manage. Her body was slightly cold but otherwise normal.\u201cI...can\u2019t...breathe!\u201d Fiona choked out. I loosened my grip but didn\u2019t let her go. I was laughing and crying all at once, if there were such things as miracles, Ian had performed one.</p><p>\u201cCan someone please tell me what is going on? Why am I in a body bag?\u201d Fiona\u2019s voice trembled with fear. I broke our embrace so that I could look into her eyes. I wasn\u2019t sure how to explain what had happened. How was I supposed to tell my best friend that she was stone cold dead only minutes ago?</p><p>\u201cYou were...dead,\u201d I said cautiously. I expected her to start crying or hyperventilating; I didn\u2019t expect her to burst out laughing. I eyed both Ian and Micah worried that Fiona had lost her mind. Surely, she was entitled to be a little insane with what had happened; I know I was on my way to insanity.</p> <p>\u201cFiona?\u201d I asked. She held up one hand and waved me off while she tried to control her giggles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...fine. You really got me.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cDead.\u201d My eyebrows scrunched as my confusion took over. Did Fiona think that I was playing a trick on her?</p><p>\u201cFiona, this isn\u2019t a joke, you were really dead. Ian brought you back.\u201d She stopped laughing and looked between Ian, Micah and me and then took in her surroundings and finally stared at the black body bag she was currently sitting in.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Am I a zombie? Am I going to start craving brains?\u201d Fiona was past her confusion and was now heading to the paranoia stage. I held back my laugh because I could see the horror all over her face and knew she wouldn\u2019t appreciate me laughing, even though it was difficult not to.</p><p>\u201cNo, Fiona you are not a zombie and brains are not on the menu,\u201d I told her. \u201cSomehow Ian was able to bring you back and you look like yourself, and you feel like yourself, right?\u201d She thought for a few seconds and then nodded her head. I knew her personality was all her so that was good.</p><p>\u201cBut how did I die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey thought I killed you,\u201d Ian chimed in. I shot him a look, still not convinced he hadn\u2019t had something to do with it. At the very least, he knew who had killed her.</p><p>\u201cIan wouldn\u2019t ever hurt me,\u201d Fiona said. I silently grumbled that my best friend still seemed to be enamored with the devil\u2019s advocate. I had hoped that coming back from death would put her self-preservation mode in overdrive, but it hadn\u2019t affected her whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a peach,\u201d I said, glaring at Ian. \u201cWe\u2019re not exactly sure what happened to you but Ian knows and he\u2019s not talking.\u201d I had hoped that the new information would set Fiona\u2019s inner diva off, but did it? NO. She pulled her legs out of the horrible black body bag and hung them over the side of the table, bracing her hands on the edge to steady herself. She took a couple of deep breaths and then hopped off the table. I stepped closer to help and she grabbed my outstretched hand. I pulled her into a hug again, too overwhelmed with happiness.</p><p>\u201cWhoever...killed me must be dangerous and Ian doesn\u2019t want to put us in anymore danger by telling us who they are,\u201d Fiona said, pulling back from me. I rolled my eyes at her faith in Ian Despereaux but didn\u2019t say anything. It wasn\u2019t the time to fight with my newly resurrected best friend about her bad taste in men.</p><p>\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Ian agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to the FPD, the sun will be up any moment,\u201d Micah said. I glanced at him, forgetting that he was in the room; he\u2019d been so quiet. Maybe he was freaked out about seeing the dead come back to life.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Fiona asked. Her eyes looked like they were tired and her body seemed to struggle to hold up her weight. I laced my arm around her waist and helped steady her.</p><p>\u201cIan is still in custody of the FPD until he tells us who is behind your death and the other witch killings.\u201d Ian mumbled something angry but it wasn\u2019t clear enough to make out. He held out his arms, with his wrists together, so that Micah could put on his silver bracelets again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy, Micah, Ian didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Fiona said lazily, like it was a huge effort for her to speak.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure that out later, we should get home so you can rest,\u201d I told her. Luckily Fiona\u2019s inner diva wasn\u2019t up to fighting at the moment. She let me escort her out of the room and outside. We had driven there with Micah, so I had no clue how we were getting home. Nor had I any clue as to where the hell Aiden went. He had been pretty pissed, so he\u2019d probably went home or to get dinner. Micah led Ian outside and noticed that we didn\u2019t have a car so he ushered us into the SUV.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drop Ian off and then take you guys home, is that alright?\u201d I nodded my head and settled Fiona into the front seat so that she wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near Ian and then climbed in the back.</p><p>After driving for five minutes, Fiona was sound asleep. I imagined it took a lot out of a person being brought back from the dead. Ian leaned over so that his lips were close to my ear and I tried not to think of how his bite had felt. I was putting that experience in the denial department, it never happened.</p><p>\u201cYou can start paying me back tomorrow night,\u201d he whispered. Micah glared at us through the rearview mirror but I ignored him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not feeding off me again,\u201d I said with authority.</p><p>Ian smiled. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to, you are delicious and powerful, but I have other ideas in mind.\u201d His blue eyes watched me with interest but I quickly looked away, not interested.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not having sex either.\u201d Ian laughed and Fiona stirred in the front seat. I glanced up at her but she had already gone back to sleep. I crossed my arms across my chest and looked out the window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d do anything if I brought your friend back, remember?\u201d I looked over at Ian with disgust. He was right, I had said I\u2019d do anything for Fiona to be brought back but that didn\u2019t mean I\u2019d give up my life to act as a blood whore to Ian Despereaux. I\u2019d kill him before that happened.</p><p>Ian must have noticed my unease because he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, little witch I prefer my woman to be willing. You will meet me tomorrow night to put an end to the big man in charge.\u201d My eyes shot wide and my mouth hung open in surprise.</p><p>Ian wanted me to help him take down the man behind the brew distribution? He didn\u2019t need to ask me twice, I nodded my head. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p> <p>20</p><p>I felt like my life revolved around vampires. I had stayed up all night with them which left me to sleep it off the next day. I called Penny to see if she would open the store for me. I\u2019d have to give that girl a raise for all the help she gave me.</p><p>It was just after the sun had set. I sat at our kitchen table, eating a bowl of vegetable soup. I couldn\u2019t even remember the last time I\u2019d eaten, which tended to happen whenever I was around creatures that don\u2019t eat regular food. I dipped a cracker into my soup and scooped up vegetables onto it, then placed the whole thing in my mouth. I was either starving or the soup was the best vegetable soup in the world, probably the latter.</p><p>Fiona trudged into the kitchen and sat across from me, leaning her head on her propped up arm. She looked like she hadn\u2019t slept at all, dark circles shadowed her eyes and her skin was pale. My worry overtook my appetite and I pushed the bowl of soup away from me.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I asked. Fiona looked up at me with bloodshot eyes and gave a small smile.</p> <p>\u201cTired, but alive.\u201d I watched her for a few moments and then got up and filled a cup with hot water, placed it in the microwave and retrieved the tea bags Ms. Ozland had given me for energy.</p><p>Two knocks sounded at our front door so I walked the short distance to answer it. Ian stood on the other side with crossed arms and a smile. His blonde hair was perfectly gelled into a spiky style. He wore jeans with a gray turtleneck sweater and a black leather coat. I squished the thought that appeared in my mind on his attractiveness. I turned on my heel when the microwave beeped, leaving the door open and my invitation unspoken. Vampires had to have an invitation to enter a home, but Fiona had already invited Ian in, so he didn\u2019t need me to say it. If I were smart, I\u2019d rescind his invite so he couldn\u2019t come into our apartment without both of our okays.</p><p>\u201cThey let you out?\u201d I asked, astounded. I plopped a teabag into the cup of hot water and set it in front of Fiona. She started to self-consciously fix her hair and I noticed she had magicked makeup on her tired face. I hated that she was worrying about impressing Ian when she needed to focus on resting.</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t hold me without evidence and the person I was accused of murdering is quite alive, and looking very lovely.\u201d I rolled my eyes at Ian\u2019s sickening smooth talk and took my seat. Ian walked over to Fiona and lifted her hand in his and pressed a kiss atop it. Fiona giggled, while I silently gagged. What the hell was the matter with her? How could she not see that Ian Despereaux was bad news?</p><p>After whispering sweet nothings to Fiona, Ian straddled the seat next to her and wrapped his arms around the back of the chair. I took a drink of my bottled water and waited for him to say something, hoping he had forgotten about me helping him with his plan. I had no qualms about capturing the psycho responsible for the killings, but I didn\u2019t want to work with Ian.</p><p>Two more knocks sounded at the front door. I pursed my lips at Fiona but got up and answered it. Aiden and Micah stood next to each other, Micah with his arms crossed and a scowl on his face. Aiden smiled at me and I smiled back, happy that he wasn\u2019t pissed at me for feeding Ian.</p> <p>\u201cHey guys, what are you doing here? I looked between both of them. Micah had been leaning against the rickety railing that was meant to protect anyone from falling from our second story apartment hall and when he turned, his right eye was swollen, with red and purple coloring the surrounding flesh. I gasped and said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicah learned that he shouldn\u2019t kiss another man\u2019s woman,\u201d Aiden said with a grin. My eyes shot wide and I stepped out of the apartment to inspect Micah\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cLike you left me alone when I was Micah\u2019s?\u201d I shot back at Aiden. Some girls love when men fight over them, but I wasn\u2019t that type. I didn\u2019t want to be the cause of anyone\u2019s pain.</p><p>\u201cI did leave you alone, at least in the physical sense, and you shouldn\u2019t coddle him, he deserved it,\u201d Aiden said with a sneer. As much as I would have loved to argue with the fact that Micah didn\u2019t deserve it, I couldn\u2019t. Micah shouldn\u2019t have kissed me when we were both with other people, but I still didn\u2019t want him to be punched over the violation.</p><p>\u201cDid you come to punch me also?\u201d Ian said from the kitchen. Aiden stepped over the threshold with me following quickly behind, worried that a full-blown fight would start in the middle of my little apartment.</p><p>\u201cIf you guys break anything, you\u2019re paying to fix it,\u201d I warned. It was pathetic, at best, but I threw it out anyway.</p><p>\u201cI came because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting Gwen be alone with you for a second, but now that you mention it...\u201d</p><p>Aiden was across the room in a flash as his fist connected with Ian\u2019s face. Luckily, Ian didn\u2019t fight back and the commotion was over within seconds. Ian held his face but sniggered. A punch in the face to a vampire was as painful as a stubbed toe. He\u2019d heal before any bruising.</p> <p>Fiona jumped up from the table and rushed to make sure Ian was okay. I\u2019d been slapped over the kiss, why shouldn\u2019t Ian be punched for it also?</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d I asked Aiden. Micah walked into our apartment and shut the door. His bruising was already turning yellow. Werewolves could heal at an exceptional rate but vampires healed quicker. His eye would be yellowish for a day and then it\u2019d be good as new.</p><p>Aiden wrapped his arms around my waist and said, \u201cI\u2019d much rather rip their heads off, but this will suffice, I suppose.\u201d He leaned in and gave me a soft kiss that radiated tingles throughout my body. I smiled at him but realized that we had an audience so I reluctantly unwound my arms from him and turned around.</p><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been another body found, has there?\u201d I asked Micah. He rubbed the back of his head in embarrassment and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cNo. I knew that Ian would be coming over here to have you help him and I didn\u2019t trust him to be alone with you, so...\u201d he said, leaving the sentence to hang. So I had two bodyguards against Ian; that was comforting.</p><p>Aiden snickered behind me and I elbowed him and smiled at Micah and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d He nodded his head as if to say \u201cno problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m offended,\u201d Ian said. We all turned to look at him, begging him to prove it. He shrugged his shoulders and crossed his arms across his chest.</p><p>Fiona looked like she was dead on her feet, so I went over and wrapped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cMaybe you should go lie down.\u201d She looked apprehensive to leave but nodded her head. I walked her back to her bedroom and helped her get settled into her bed. Then I flipped on the television and handed her the remote. She smiled up at me but I could tell there were unspoken words dangling on her lips. After a moment, she finally spoke. \u201cGwen, I\u2019m sorry for slapping you and saying that I was moving out. I don\u2019t know why I acted like that. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d love to keep living here.\u201d</p><p>I sat on the edge of her bed and held her delicate hand. It wasn\u2019t the first time Fiona and I had fought, and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. I loved her like a sister and because of that, I would put up with anything from her.</p><p>\u201cI understand you were upset and I\u2019m sorry for hurting you. Of course, you can live here, for as long as you want, or until the building collapses,\u201d I laughed. \u201cI love you, Fiona, and I only want you to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gwen, you really are a great friend.\u201d</p><p>I smiled down at her and squeezed her hand. \u201cGet some sleep.\u201d</p><p>I left her room and returned to the kitchen where I would have to deal with three stubborn men. I\u2019d much rather crawl into bed with Fiona and watch reruns of Ghost Whisperer with her. All three men were sitting at my small table, eyeing each other with contempt. I released a heavy breath and took a seat next to Aiden, with Micah directly in front of me.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan for tonight?\u201d I asked. We all looked at Ian and waited for him to come forth with his information.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know is, how Ian knew I was indisposed the night of the Gala and why he came galloping to escort my girlfriend to the ball?\u201d Aiden said, his hands balling into fists from his anger. I arched an eyebrow at Ian, wondering the same thing. Obviously he had lied when he said he knew Aiden and that Aiden had sent him to escort me.</p><p>\u201cLouis told me to escort Gwen and find out what she was. Aiden had let it slip that a woman from Flora was able to read the dead. Louis thought you might be a psychic, but he still wanted to be sure. He made sure Aiden wouldn\u2019t make the Gala,\u201d Ian said. \u201cOf course, that night didn\u2019t go as I planned, so I wasn\u2019t sure about your spirit walker status until I drank from you.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him with disgust and Aiden glared at him with hatred. \u201cSo you killed Fiona so you would have the opportunity to drink from me? Because you knew I\u2019d do it if Fiona\u2019s life was in danger?\u201d I kept my voice low so that Fiona wouldn\u2019t hear, but I put all of my anger into my whispers.</p><p>\u201cFiona was never dead, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she wasn\u2019t really dead? I saw her, she was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew you\u2019d allow me to drink from you if it was for her life. I\u2019ve been drinking brew for about a year now. I\u2019ve learned how to do wonderful things with the magic,\u201d Ian grinned. \u201cFiona was under a spell, one that was meant to make you think of what could happen if you didn\u2019t go along with Louis\u2019 plans.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mouth hung to the floor in astonishment. Since the night of the Gala, Ian had a plan that I knew nothing about. Sure, I knew there was something he was hiding, but I didn\u2019t think it involved me.</p><p>\u201cFirst off,\u201d I started, talking slowly. \u201cwho is Louis? And what exactly does he want from me?\u201d I watched as Aiden stood up and paced my small kitchen, thoughts running wild in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLouis is my friend from Chicago, the one I told you was sending me the sample of brew,\u201d Aiden replied, shooting daggers at Ian with his eyes. \u201cI know for a fact, I did not mention anything about Gwen to anyone.\u201d Ian shrugged his shoulders. \u201cThe first time drinking brew is much like a human being drunk, you don\u2019t always remember what you do or say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re drinking witches\u2019 blood?\u201d Micah said with disgust. Great, the last person I wanted to know about Aiden\u2019s stroll down brew alley, was the FPD.</p><p>\u201cNo, he is not. He drank it twice and that\u2019s because Louis made him,\u201d I said in Aiden\u2019s defense.</p><p>Aiden held up a hand to say that it was okay. \u201cYes, I drank witches\u2019 blood because Louis made me, but afterwards I wanted it. It\u2019s highly addictive and because of Gwen, I\u2019m getting over my addiction.\u201d Micah snorted and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the last spirit walkers, Gwen, what do you think Louis wants from you?\u201d Ian said. I</p><p>shrugged my shoulders and shook my head, at a loss for what a vampire in Chicago would want with me. \u201cMy blood?\u201d It seemed like the obvious answer. Ian laughed and shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to taste you, but he has more permanent plans. You\u2019re very rare and he\u2019d love to claim you as his.\u201d Ian watched me with an emotion I didn\u2019t understand, nor did I care to. I laughed bitterly.</p><p>\u201cSo what, I\u2019m like a collector\u2019s item to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Ian said. \u201cI don\u2019t claim to know his reasoning. I only tell you what I know.\u201d I eyed him and tried to decide if he was telling the truth or feeding me another story. I could have laced my words with magic, a spell to make him tell the truth, but somehow I thought he\u2019d be able to dodge it, using the magic he\u2019d already learned.</p><p>\u201cSo, Louis is the big man behind the brew distribution? Why do you want to take him out if you\u2019re working for him?\u201d I asked. Aiden stopped pacing and crossed his arms across his muscular chest, curious at Ian\u2019s answer. Micah shifted so that he was sitting sideways and could watch Ian. It had only been a little over a week since Amy Harper was killed, but it seemed like it\u2019d been forever. I knew I was ready to put all of this to bed and, from the look on Micah\u2019s face, so was he.</p><p>\u201cLouis is most definitely untrustworthy but he is not the man responsible for the witches\u2019 deaths, nor is he responsible for the distribution. The man who I have reason to believe is responsible is Liam Fawns. As to why I want to stop him, let\u2019s just say I have my own reasons.\u201d Micah, Aidan and I all looked at Ian like he\u2019d lost his mind. Liam Fawns was a major bigwig and one of the founders of our town. He\u2019s also a warlock.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your evidence?\u201d Micah asked, voicing the question we were all wondering. A grin lifted the corners of Ian\u2019s face and he leaned back in his chair, propping one leg atop his knee. He was devilishly handsome. His blue eyes seemed to twinkle with the information they held. He took so long to answer, enjoying our suspense that I finally motioned with my hands to \u201cget on with it already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only ones who\u2019ve been trying to find him. The brew distribution is just like any other drug world. There are heavy hitters who want to take over the drug running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>Ian laughed and shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my neck as I felt my magic tingle against my skin from my anger. I could feel it travel all the way down my arms until a bright blue glow emanated from my palm. I stood up quickly and raised my hand out towards Ian. I threw my built-up energy right at his chest. Ian anticipated the magic and jumped out of the way. The orb of magic smashed into my cabinet and left a dark brown scorch mark.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Ian asked, leaning against my refrigerator. My magic was still revved up and I worked on controlling my anger so that I could extinguish it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of listening to all of this. You talk as if brew is something as simple as a human drug; it\u2019s not! Witches are being murdered for their blood and you act like it\u2019s nothing. Add to the fact that you, yourself, are a brew user and now you want us to help you take out Liam so \u2018someone\u2019 can take over his drug business?\u201d</p><p>Fiona rushed down the hallway and into the kitchen, no doubt having heard my magic crashing into our cabinet. \u201cWhat happened? I heard a cracking and yelling?\u201d she asked me. My magic instantly went out and I took a few deep breaths to calm my anxious nerves.</p><p>\u201cSorry I woke you; everything\u2019s fine,\u201d I told her. Her eyes found the scorch mark on the cabinet and she gawked at me like I had gone crazy.</p> <p>\u201cWere you purposely trying to burn down our apartment?\u201d She sounded like she was scolding a child. I eyed Ian with ire and Fiona gasped as she realized that I had actually been trying to burn Ian down.</p><p>\u201cWhat has he ever done to you? We\u2019ve only known him for a couple of days, geez Gwen,\u201d Fiona rushed to Ian\u2019s side to look him over for any injuries. The anger I thought I had gotten under control spiked back up. Fiona\u2019s fascination with Ian irked me.</p><p>\u201cListen I don\u2019t wanna fight with you but, from what I\u2019ve learned in those couple days, Ian deserved that and much more. I don\u2019t fire my magic off willy-nilly Fiona.\u201d I told her, keeping my voice as calm as my anger would allow. A thought suddenly dawned on me as I looked between Ian and Fiona. \u201cDid you glamour her? Is that why she\u2019s all gaga over you?\u201d Fiona gasped from embarrassment and gave me a look of anger. I wasn\u2019t trying to embarrass her though. I\u2019d known Fiona for ten years and she had never acted this involved with a guy, especially one she\u2019d only known for a couple days.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, vampires can\u2019t glamour witches, Gwen,\u201d Fiona said sarcastically. I dragged my gaze away from her angry eyes and to Ian. He had a thin-lipped smile but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWell, did you?\u201d I asked him. He looked down at Fiona and then back at me, releasing a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cI had to, I needed to get closer to you, to find out if you really were a spirit</p><p>walker and I knew you wouldn\u2019t see me otherwise.\u201d Fiona\u2019s hurt was apparent as she considered his words and I walked over to comfort her, but she shrugged off my embrace.</p><p>\u201cUndo it,\u201d I told Ian. I was hoping that once Ian\u2019s glamour was lifted, Fiona would be back to her normal diva self.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he told Fiona. She lifted her eyes from the floor and met his unwillingly. I couldn\u2019t imagine what having a glamour put on me would do but I doubted I\u2019d like it. I could tell that Fiona really thought she liked him, even without having any reason to. No one is that hard up for a person they just met. I worried that once the glamour was lifted, Fiona would be heartbroken, but in the end, I knew it was the best thing for her. Ian Despereaux was bad news.</p><p>\u201cI release you,\u201d Ian said as he stared into Fiona\u2019s eyes. A tear slowly started to travel down her pink cheek but as soon as Ian spoke those magical words, Fiona\u2019s hurt disappeared. She blinked a of couple times at Ian and then looked around the kitchen, as if wondering what was going on. She looked back at Ian again and then turned and went down the hallway, slamming her bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine, she\u2019s pissed off, but otherwise okay. Now, can we get started on capturing Liam or would anyone else like to take a crack at me?\u201d Ian said. I pursed my lips as I considered taking him up on that offer.</p><p>21</p><p>Hiding out in brush wasn\u2019t the smartest idea. I had stumbled over my stilettos and grabbed onto a thorn bush to steady myself. A stinging sensation cut into my palm as the thorns dug into my flesh. I cursed under my breath and shook my hand, as if that would make the pain go away. Aiden grabbed my hand and his tongue licked the length of my palm. I was about to yell at him for drinking my blood, but, when the stinging sensation waned, I realized he was only trying to heal me. I mouthed the words \u201cthank you\u201d and settled in for our stake out.</p><p>Liam\u2019s home was a very large Victorian style that looked like it\u2019d come straight out of the pages of Better Homes and Garden magazine. Wood siding, painted white, covered the entirety of the house. Arched windows lined the whole front of his home. A large wooden wrap-around porch hugged the front of his house. Intricate detailing along the dormers and porch lent a gingerbread feel. Liam Fawns seemed more of the modern type, not the homey kind. I had only met him twice and our conversations had never lasted more than five minutes. Still, when I had spoken with him, I never imagined his home to have a white picket fence. His lawn was perfectly manicured, not one piece of nature out of place.</p><p>\u201cThis is so stupid, there\u2019s no way Liam is responsible for the witches\u2019 deaths,\u201d I said to Micah and Aiden, my stakeout partners. We\u2019d gone along with Ian\u2019s plan to visit Liam\u2019s home while he went inside, outfitted with a recorder. I trusted Ian Despereaux about as far as I could throw him, which wasn\u2019t far.</p><p>\u201cGwen, I\u2019ll follow any leads at this point. Whoever is responsible is good at covering their tracks. The most we have on this guy is what you\u2019ve told us and that isn\u2019t much,\u201d Micah said.</p><p>My feet were killing me so I abandoned my crouching pose and sat on my butt in the dewy grass in Liam\u2019s backyard. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe that Micah was going along with this. First of all, Micah was a hell of a detective and took his job seriously. He wasn\u2019t one who followed crazy ideas without proof. Second, we were in the middle of staking out one of the founders of our town, a major bigwig who could have Micah\u2019s job should he find out what we were up to. It wasn\u2019t like Micah had gotten a warrant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExactly, the man I saw wasn\u2019t Liam. He was British and had light hair, two features that Liam doesn\u2019t have. Ian openly admits that Louis wants to collect me and we\u2019re stalking Liam? Am I missing something?\u201d I was beyond annoyed by the whole situation. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Ian was up to something yet again and Aiden and Micah were just going along with it. Was I the only one who saw him as a sleazeball?</p><p>\u201cYou also said that you thought he might be a warlock because his face was blocked from you, like he used a spell to protect his identity. That\u2019s why I\u2019m following Ian\u2019s crazy plan,\u201d Micah said, defending his detective status. I was quiet while I considered his words. Witches and warlocks could glamour their appearances, so Liam could have changed his, but it still didn\u2019t sit well with me. I couldn\u2019t say anything else though; I\u2019d already voiced my objections to the whole nonsense, now I\u2019d have to wait until my intuitions proved right.</p><p>I decided watching Aiden would be a much better use of my time. I admired the way his muscles played under his white, long sleeve t-shirt and the way his muscular legs filled out his jeans. I felt a familiar heat radiate through me, the same one I\u2019d felt every time I was around him. He was beyond beautiful and even if I saw him twenty-four hours a day, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to appreciate his mouth-watering good looks.</p> <p>Aiden\u2019s body stiffened and if I hadn\u2019t been staring at him, I wouldn\u2019t have caught the way he sniffed the air. His head swiveled around and his eyes burned into mine. I sucked in a deep breath at the intensity, but licked my lips as my desire grew.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right back, we\u2019re going to check on the other side of the house,\u201d Aiden said to Micah, holding a hand out to me to help me from the ground. I looked at him quizzically but followed him around the house. Liam\u2019s yard was large and covered with trees, plenty of spaces for us to hide.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I whispered, once we were hidden behind a large oak tree. Aiden peered around the tree and then turned to me, his lips on mine before I could even gasp. I happily returned his kiss, twisting my tongue with his as the heat stirred within my stomach. His hands roved all over my body, igniting every last one of my nerves on fire. I was breathless when his lips broke from mine. He trailed kisses from my ear and all the way down my neck until he got to the top of my breasts.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly the best time for this,\u201d I said breathlessly. My hormones wanted to smack me for telling Aiden to stop. My body definitely thought it was the perfect time to experience Aiden again.</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have been thinking naughty thoughts earlier,\u201d he laughed.</p> <p>I arched my eyebrows and said, \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d I moaned as he pulled open my jacket and ripped my shirt down the center, exposing my breasts. He flicked his tongue against one of my excited nipples and I thought I\u2019d spontaneously combust from the thickness of my lust.</p><p>\u201cYour magic may be gone from my system, but your blood still runs through my veins, I\u2019m attuned to you, my Gwen. Plus I could smell your desire.\u201d He grinned at me and I returned the smile. In normal circumstances, it would embarrass me that he could smell my desire, but all it did was turn me on more.</p><p>His finger slipped under the waistband of my jeans and popped the button open easily. He pushed my jeans all the way off so that I stood in only a pair of thin, red panties. I was half excited about what we were doing and half scared of getting caught. I was, in no way, a prude but I also wasn\u2019t that big on PDA, especially in the yard of one of the founders with my ex-boyfriend within hearing and smelling, distance.</p><p>Aiden\u2019s jeans disappeared quickly and I gasped when his erection was hard and ready for action. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d I whispered. I thought I should throw it out there, even if I didn\u2019t believe it, I wanted nothing more than to feel him inside me again. Flashes of our first time together flooded my mind and I visibly shuddered with want.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid we\u2019ll get caught? Or that Micah will hear us?\u201d he whispered, his lips close to my ear. I closed my eyes as tingles traveled all through my body. The boy knew how to turn me on.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d I said huskily.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fun of it.\u201d He grinned and without another word, lifted me up so that I was straddling his waist and thrust into me. I clung onto his strong shoulders and absorbed the feel of him inside of me. Everything about Aiden set me on fire. His energy swirled around me like a million electric currents caressing my skin, sending my lust into overdrive. I found his lips and kissed him feverishly. I moaned against his mouth and shook as an orgasm erupted within me. Aiden pumped a few more times and held onto me tightly as he reached his orgasm. We held onto each other, kissing, touching and absorbing each other. When Aiden reluctantly set me back on the ground, I started to giggle. I felt like a teenager who\u2019d just done something extremely naughty.</p><p>I noticed that my panties lay torn in two on the ground. I hadn\u2019t even remembered him doing that. I picked them up and pulled my jeans up in the process.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing hell with my underwear supply,\u201d I said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI prefer you panty-less anyway,\u201d Aiden said, leaning in and pressing a soft kiss on my lips.</p><p>We were walking back around the house, holding hands when we noticed a loud crash from inside the house. I looked up at Aiden and then to where Micah still stood by the rosebushes. Three things happened all at once. Micah ran toward the house, a loud crack of bright green magic sent Ian flying through the window that Aiden and I were standing in front of, and the magic didn\u2019t stop with Ian. It slammed all the way through Ian and still traveled its path, directly toward me. Aiden screamed, \u201cGwen!\u201d and tried to shove me out of the way, but was too late, a burning sensation hit my chest like a Mack truck and I hit the ground, falling into oblivion.</p><p>22</p><p>I awoke on the ground in front of Liam\u2019s house, the spot where I fell when his magic hit me. Aiden cradled my body in his arms and screamed for me to wake up. The atmosphere had changed though, to a colorless, gray. I knelt down beside Aiden and my body and stared in confusion. All I could do was stare stoically at my limp body in his arms, a large burn right between my breasts.</p><p>\u201cAiden?\u201d I said, unsure if he could hear me. I had to be dreaming, passed out from the hit. I couldn\u2019t be dead; my mind wouldn\u2019t accept that.</p> <p>Aiden\u2019s head snapped up and he stared right at me, but his eyes didn\u2019t see me. That\u2019s weird, I thought. Can he hear me?</p><p>\u201cAiden, I\u2019m here,\u201d I said again and his eyes widened as they searched the surrounding area and then down at my lifeless body in his arms.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d He shook my body and pressed two fingers to check the pulse of my carotid. He was still for a few moments while he listened to the thump of my heart, only to drop my hand in defeat when he didn\u2019t feel a pulse. Bloody tears trailed down his flawless skin as he cried. My heart swelled with his pain. It was the first time I\u2019d ever seen a vampire cry. It was eerily beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Aiden,\u201d I said again and set my hand over his. He jerked and his eyes roamed the area in front of him.</p><p>Micah came bustling out the front door with Liam and Ian, both in special handcuffs. He pushed them down on the lawn and told them to \u201cstay put\u201d after seeing my body cradled in Aiden\u2019s arms. He rushed over to where Aiden was and knelt down beside him, his eyes wide with fear.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked softly. Aiden\u2019s energy was swirling around him like a storm. I\u2019d never been able to actually see his energy but now that I was \u201cpassed out\u201d I could see the vibrant brick red energy he held.</p><p>\u201cWho cast the magic?\u201d Aiden asked, his voice deathly calm. He looked up at Micah with an expression that would have frozen me with fear, had it been directed at me. Micah\u2019s eyebrows arched and he looked back at where Ian and Liam sat and then back at Aiden, like he was wondering if he should say. Aiden looked like he was ready to tear someone\u2019s head off.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, I\u2019ll kill them both,\u201d Aiden said, just as calmly as before.</p><p>\u201cLiam cast...\u201d Micah barely got out before Aiden was up and holding Liam by the throat, three feet off the ground. Liam\u2019s body flailed and fought against Aiden\u2019s hold.</p><p>Micah approached cautiously, knowing that a pissed off vampire wasn\u2019t an easy thing to calm down and Aiden was beyond pissed. While Micah tried to talk Aiden out of committing murder, I noticed Ian watching me. I looked down at my body and back at Ian. He wasn\u2019t watching my body, he was watching me, my spirit self. I walked over to where he sat and noticed his eyes followed me the whole way.</p><p>\u201cYou can see me?\u201d I asked, completely flabbergasted. Out of all the people I would want to see me, Ian was the last. He nodded his head instead of speaking and drawing attention to himself. Anger surged within me and I motioned toward where the other three men stood.</p><p>\u201cTell them! Tell them you can see me, that I\u2019m not dead!\u201d I said. In all honesty, I didn\u2019t feel dead. I may have been in spirit form but I was still very much attached to my body. Ian\u2019s lips curved at the edges as he tried to conceal his smile. I cursed loudly when I realized that Liam hadn\u2019t been the one to cast the magic. I saw it as clearly as if I had been inside that house. I didn\u2019t know how but it all played through my mind.</p><p>Ian was inside Liam\u2019s house, taunting him about the witches\u2019 murders. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sticking your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong and now I have to teach you and the NAWC a lesson,\u201d Ian said to Liam. Liam wasn\u2019t someone to mess with. He was a very powerful warlock. They were standing in Liam\u2019s office. The walls were covered with dark red wallpaper, a dark wood desk sat against the far wall, while a sitting area occupied the other side of the room. Desk lamps and a glow from the fireplace illuminated the English style office causing dark shadows to play off Liam\u2019s and Ian\u2019s angry features.</p><p>\u201cWho are you to teach me a lesson?\u201d Liam asked with authority. Ian walked over to the fireplace and propped an elbow on the mantle, acting as if he weren\u2019t in the presence of a powerful warlock who could turn him to ash in a matter of minutes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe man you\u2019ve been looking for. I don\u2019t appreciate being hunted so I\u2019ve decided to kill the hunter,\u201d Ian said with a grin. Liam\u2019s magic revved up and soon he held a bright green orb within his palms. His light brown hair stirred within the air that swirled around him; His brown eyes pinned on the vampire threatening his life.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the vampire responsible for killing my kind and you come to my home and think you\u2019ll do the same to me?\u201d Liam said the words and instantly cast the magic at Ian. Ian had anticipated the move though, and got behind Liam before the magic crashed into the fireplace. Without hesitation, Ian sank his fangs into Liam\u2019s neck and greedily drank as Liam tried to fight him off. When it seemed Ian had had his fill, he released his hold on Liam\u2019s neck, turned him around quickly and punched him squarely in the jaw.</p><p>Ian closed his eyes in concentration and soon held Liam\u2019s same bright green magic. It seemed Ian was a sponge, absorbing the powers of those he drank. He shot a blast of magic through the window, strong enough that it would hit me, and jumped backwards through the broken pane. To Micah, Aiden and me, it looked like Liam had cast his magic at Ian and we were none the wiser to Ian\u2019s game.</p> <p>When the vision faded, I focused my eyes on Ian, who watched me with amusement. I quickly looked over to where Aiden had Liam by the throat and realized that Micah had called for backup. Wyatt and Micah sprayed Aiden with a liquid silver that burned through his clothes, searing his flesh. I screamed for them to stop but my pleas went unanswered. Aiden dropped Liam and fell to the ground, screaming in pain. Wyatt quickly cuffed his burnt wrists with silver handcuffs and carried him to the back of his police SUV.</p><p>\u201cIan, you son of a bitch!\u201d I screamed as I watched the chaotic scene play out. The smile on Ian\u2019s lips said that everything was going according to his plan. Micah cuffed Liam and escorted him to his SUV, then retrieved Ian from the ground and put him in Wyatt\u2019s SUV. Once all three men were contained, Micah and Wyatt walked over to where my lifeless body lay.</p><p>I tried to run over to tell them I was still alive but in my haste, I actually floated towards them, my feet four inches off the ground.</p><p>\u201cMICAH!\u201d I screamed. Micah flinched like he was dodging an annoying bug that buzzed his head and looked around.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d he asked his brother.</p> <p>Wyatt looked at him and then listened for a moment, shaking his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d Micah pursed his lips and looked behind him and then down at my body. I floated towards him and put my hand on his shoulder. He shivered like a chill had just crept up his spine and stepped back, looking around again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Wyatt asked. Micah was momentarily dumbstruck. He stared at Wyatt and then down at my body again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here Micah, I\u2019m alive. It\u2019s Ian, Ian\u2019s the bad guy,\u201d I spoke loudly into his ear, praying that at least my last words got through to him.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Micah said to the area where my voice had come from. Wyatt looked at the empty space and then at his brother, arching his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Wyatt asked.</p><p>\u201cI just heard Gwen\u2019s voice, twice. You didn\u2019t hear it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I think you might be losing it. I know how much she meant to you and it\u2019s horrible what happened, but she\u2019s dead, Micah,\u201d Wyatt said slowly. Micah growled deeply in his chest and Wyatt growled back. Wyatt was in a higher position, next in line to become the alpha of the Flora weres. No one challenged him, not even his brother. I knew they wouldn\u2019t start fighting; Wyatt was just putting Micah in his place.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a spirit walker; you don\u2019t think that her spirit might still be here? How do we know this isn\u2019t another one of Ian\u2019s spells? He made us believe that Fiona was dead too,\u201d Micah said, his voice strained with anger.</p><p>\u201cYou said that Liam attacked Ian and that his magic hit Gwen, how would Ian have had time to bewitch her?\u201d Wyatt watched his brother with remorse, knowing that Micah was taking my death hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M HERE!\u201d I screamed as loudly as I could, so loudly that my throat burned with the strain. Panic was slowly consuming me at the thought of watching my body go through the process of embalming and then being buried. Even though I was in spirit form, I felt my emotions as if I were still solid. My heart still beat strongly and at the moment, it was like a battering ram against my chest. My lungs constricted with my panic and my hands shook with bewilderment. I had no clue what I was supposed to do to save myself. The one person who knew I wasn\u2019t dead was the bad guy, who had no plans of letting it be known. I knew, deep in my heart, that I wasn\u2019t, even if I were a ghost, trapped within the spirit realm. It was like I was Alice trapped behind the looking glass. I saw everything that was happening in real life but I couldn\u2019t interact with it. The few times Aiden and Micah heard me was the closest I\u2019d come to being noticed.</p><p>Both Micah and Wyatt reacted to my bloodcurdling scream and looked at each other with perplexed stares.</p><p>\u201cYou heard her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Micah asked Wyatt. Wyatt nodded his head, too confused to speak. They both looked down at my body and then at the space where I hovered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the vampire can give his blood and heal her, maybe she\u2019s not all the way dead. I\u2019ve heard of people having out of body experiences when close to death,\u201d Wyatt said with a shrug of his shoulders. I knew that they were both at a loss of what was happening and I loved them for not giving up so easily on me. Vampire blood could heal a human but I wasn\u2019t so sure it would do anything for me or the fact that I was just having an out of body experience.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d A female voice said from behind me. I turned; stunned that someone was talking directly to me. Standing only a couple feet away was Bridget.</p> <p>\u201cBridget, what are you doing here?\u201d I asked. I only saw her when I was sleeping and I knew I wasn\u2019t currently asleep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my world now,\u201d she said, her voice somber as she watched me. I knew I was within the ghostly realm, the world seemed gray from this point of view and the air blew an icy chill along my skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d I said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be dead, spirit walker, to be in my world. I was drawn here, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said.</p><p>That was the first time I\u2019d had a lucid conversation with the ghost who haunted my dreams. She was clear in her spirit form. I could make out her features and her clothes just as clearly as I could my own. Confusion no longer colored her eyes and her image didn\u2019t flicker in and out like before. She had either come to grips that she was dead, or my acceptance of what I really was helped me to see her more clearly.</p><p>While I was talking with Bridget, I noticed that Wyatt retrieved Ian from the back of the SUV and brought him over to my body. My eyes shot wide at what was about to happen. When Wyatt mentioned the vampire giving me blood, I thought of Aiden, not Ian. I did not want Ian Despereaux\u2019s blood in my system. Obviously, Aiden didn\u2019t either; he slammed his body against the door of the SUV and soon the door popped off the hinges as easily as a dandelion head. Aiden fell out of the SUV and I gasped at his appearance. Where he\u2019d been sprayed with the liquid silver, his body was burned so severely that it looked like his skin had melted. Tears flowed down my cheeks at the mess of what was once his perfect, creamy skin and I wanted nothing more than to bash Micah\u2019s and Wyatt\u2019s skulls in.</p><p>Aiden stumbled over to where the men were gathered around my body, his hands bound with silver handcuffs.</p><p>\u201cGet..away..from..HER!\u201d He spat out, as if it caused him pain to speak.</p><p>\u201cAiden, I know you\u2019re upset about this, but I\u2019m trying to save her. We think Gwen might be alive but very close to death\u2019s edge. Ian\u2019s blood holds magic, something that could save her life,\u201d Micah replied. Aiden was so weak, they didn\u2019t even try to put him back in the SUV. My tears fell harder as I took in Aiden\u2019s state. I didn\u2019t understand how Micah and Wyatt could be so cruel as to watch him like he was beneath them.</p><p>Aiden fell over onto his side right in front of my body and stared at me with unblinking eyes. Eyes that held so much emotion, my heart literally skipped a beat. Warmth filled me as I watched Aiden\u2019s love for me. Even weakened and beat, Aiden would not give up on me. I floated over to him and placed a hand on his shoulder. He shuddered but remained still. I leaned down so that my lips were close to his ear and whispered the words I had feared saying since Micah. \u201cI love you.\u201d Aiden closed his eyes as my words floated on the air and into his ears. Bloody tears fell from his blue eyes and he screamed a bloodcurdling scream filled with despair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him!\u201d Bridget said as she peered around Micah\u2019s large shoulder. I looked up and noticed she was staring at Ian.</p><p>\u201cIan\u2019s the man responsible for killing witches?\u201d I asked her although I already knew the answer, ever since overhearing the conversation between him and Liam.</p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019d recognize his aura anywhere. He hid his face from us but I know it\u2019s him,\u201d Bridget said with urgency. I nodded my head, unable to do anything until I was back in my body. Relief washed over me though, knowing that Bridget would finally see her killer captured.</p><p>Ian bent down on his knees and lifted my body into his lap. He peered at me through his eyelashes and grinned. He bit into his wrist and held it to my still lips, all the time watching my spirit form. Our gazes were locked as his blood poured into my mouth. I tasted the coppery electric fluid and let it fill my mouth until my chest rose and fell heavily at our connection.</p><p>Ian finally closed his eyes and whispered something no one could hear. Micah and Wyatt stood behind him, unaware that Ian was chanting.</p><p>My body began to feel lighter and I looked up to Bridget with worry. I was slowly slipping away and it scared the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cThank you, spirit walker, for helping me, I won\u2019t soon forget it,\u201d Bridget said with a small smile. She turned and started to walk away, her body fading into the gray. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked down at my hands and gasped as they too were fading into nothingness. My head hung lazily as if I was drugged and my eyes fell shut as the rest of me faded away.</p><p>23</p><p>My eyes opened slowly, still heavy with sleepiness. It took me a moment to focus, but when my surroundings came into view I realized I was in my bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake!\u201d A female voice announced. I stretched and groaned, my body felt as if it hadn\u2019t moved in eons. My muscles strained when I stretched. I propped myself up on my elbows and noticed that Fiona was kneeling on the side of my bed with a huge smile lighting her face.</p><p>Aiden walked through my bedroom door and enveloped me in his arms. I inhaled his familiar scent of soap and spices and devoured the feel of him against me. The last time I had seen him, he was severely weakened by liquid silver, at the hands of Micah and Wyatt. Looking at him now, no one would ever know that his features were once mangled. His skin was back to its normal creamy perfection and his eyes shone as brightly as sapphires.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been out? What happened?\u201d I asked as I looked at Fiona over Aiden\u2019s shoulder. Aiden released me and sat on the side of the bed, grabbing my hand. Relief was evident when he looked at me and happiness filled me when I looked at him. The entire time the man for me had been right under my nose but I was too involved with Micah to notice...until now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out for three days, Gwen. It was touch and go at first, but I knew you\u2019d come back to me,\u201d Aiden said with a thin-lipped smile. My mind was in a whirlwind, three days I\u2019d been out? I couldn\u2019t remember much except being pulled away from Aiden\u2019s side as he lay by my side...and Ian.</p><p>\u201cIs Ian in jail? He\u2019s the one responsible for the witches\u2019 deaths,\u201d I suddenly said in a shrill voice, overly anxious to get the news out. Aiden\u2019s hand went to my back and rubbed small circles to calm my panic. I watched him expectantly, waiting for him to confirm that Ian was, in fact, in prison.</p> <p>\u201cIan fed you his blood in hopes of healing you, he seemed rather willing to do so too,\u201d Aiden paused as his anger momentarily overtook him. \u201cWhen he finished feeding you, he disappeared.\u201d</p><p>I gaped. \u201cWhat do you mean he disappeared?\u201d My heart slammed against my chest at the thought that Ian Despereaux was still wandering around freely. It seemed he had some sort of fascination with me and I wasn\u2019t looking forward to running into him ever again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it. One moment he was feeding you and the next minute he wasn\u2019t there anymore. Micah brought in Louis for questioning and found out some interesting things...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d I interjected quickly. Fiona had gotten up while Aiden told me the news and had returned with a cup of hot tea. She handed it to me and I took a slow sip. The warmth slid down my throat and settled happily in my stomach that felt completely empty. I\u2019d worry about not eating later; right now, I had to know about Ian. Fiona sat Indian-style on my floor and waited for Aiden to continue his story. I took a moment to look at her and asked, \u201cAre you okay, hearing about Ian and who he really is?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head with a bitter smile and said, \u201cAbsolutely, the only attraction he held over me was his glamour. What an idiot I was.\u201d I gave her a small smile but internally I jumped for joy that my best friend was finally free of Ian\u2019s charms. I looked back at Aiden, anxiously awaiting the information I had interrupted.</p><p>\u201cIt seems Ian is actually Louis\u2019 sire. Ian had made it seem like he worked for Louis, but it was all part of his plan not to draw attention to himself. Louis was hesitant to rat out his sire, but Micah and Wyatt found a way around that,\u201d Aiden smiled and I shuddered, thinking of the methods the FPD used to get a vampire to tell on his sire.</p> <p>\u201cLiam isn\u2019t in prison is he? It was Ian that hit me with the magic and it was on purpose,\u201d I said.</p><p>Aiden shook his head. \u201cNo, Liam projected his thoughts so that we saw what happened. I bet Ian hadn\u2019t expected he could do that,\u201d he snorted.</p><p>I rubbed my forehead as a million thoughts rushed through my mind. We now knew that Ian Despereaux was responsible for the killings and selling witches\u2019 blood, but it didn\u2019t feel like it was close to being over. I mentally cursed myself for ever getting involved in this mess but a small part of me was happy to have the knowledge I\u2019d gained from it.</p><p>\u201cFiona would you mind giving us a moment alone?\u201d Aiden asked. Fiona looked up at me and then nodded her head. She gave me a hug before she walked out of my room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Aiden\u2019s hands held my face as his blue eyes watched me with an emotion I no longer feared, love. He drew closer and pressed his lips softly against mine and I closed my eyes with the heat that stirred within me. When Aiden pulled away and looked at me with remorse, the heat was quickly doused, an icy chill replacing the warmth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked softly. I learned with this case, that nothing was ever what it seemed. I knew that Aiden wasn\u2019t telling me everything where Ian was concerned and I feared the words that dangled silently on his lips.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d he began, releasing a heavy sigh. \u201cIan fed you that night.\u201d A storm was brewing in Aiden\u2019s eyes and all I could do was wait for the torrential downpour of the words he hesitated to speak. I nodded my head as my stomach rolled with my anxiety.</p><p>\u201cRemember when we were out by the tree that night? How I could tell that you wanted me?\u201d Aiden asked. Through the chaos I had forgotten that Aiden and I had a quick tryst before everything blew up. A blush rushed to my cheeks and I smiled in remembrance. How wonderful if all I had to worry about in my life was getting caught for indecent exposure with Aiden as we experienced each other\u2019s bodies all over Flora.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said cautiously, unsure what he was trying to tell me.</p><p>\u201cI can sense your emotions because I\u2019ve drunk from you.\u201d Aiden paused and I widened my eyes, wanting him to just spit out the bad news already. I hated the suspense he was causing me.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan has drunk from you as well, which means he can also sense you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! My! God!\u201d I quickly said as the gravity of what Aiden was telling me sunk in. The one man who had a deep fascination with me, who was responsible for killing my kind, could find me as easily as if I had a tracking chip implanted.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to the bad news yet,\u201d Aiden said. My insides froze, not knowing how it could possibly get worse.</p><p>\u201cYou drank from him as well. When a vampire shares his blood with a person he has also drunk from, it forms a bond. Bonds are very serious, Gwen, and as vampires, we do not take them lightly. I tried to stop Micah and Wyatt from letting Ian feed you but I was too weak. I\u2019m so sorry, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Aiden but my eyes didn\u2019t see the dark haired, blue-eyed man I\u2019d come to love. I stared blankly past his beauty as I absorbed what he told me. Words failed on my stunned lips and air seemed to escape my panicked lungs. I shook my head back and forth, unable to believe that Ian and I were bonded.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be bonded for long. Ian will die by my hand the first chance I get, this I promise you, my Gwen.\u201d Aiden\u2019s words did little to comfort me. I knew that Aiden was strong and over six hundred years old, but Ian was over eight hundred years old and had magic on his side.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the bond mean?\u201d I mumbled as I looked up at Aiden.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be able to feel your emotions as much as you\u2019ll be able to feel his. You\u2019ll also be telepathically linked.\u201d Aiden explained.</p><p>I hung my head in my hands and tried to breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth. Like breathing exercises would calm me down after learning that I was bonded to Ian.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he wanted to bond with me,\u201d I said, but it came out in a mumble since my hands were covering my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the last spirit walkers, Gwen; Ian\u2019s interest is in your rarity. Try not to worry, he can only run so far before he\u2019s caught,\u201d Aiden said, trying to keep the anger from his voice. I knew he wanted me to look on the bright side of things, but when it came to Ian, there wasn\u2019t a bright side.</p><p>Two soft knocks sounded at my door and Aiden was up in a flash, opening the door. Fiona jumped slightly when the door whipped open, but quickly regained her composure. She peeked around Aiden so that she could see me and said, \u201cMicah is here to talk to you; do you want to see him?\u201d Aiden\u2019s hand tightened on the door handle, a grinding sound moaning under the pressure of his grip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin my door handle,\u201d I told him. He let go and crossed his hands across his chest instead.</p><p>\u201cI would love to see him, I have a few choice words I\u2019d like him to hear,\u201d I told Fiona. She nodded her head and disappeared down the hall. Aiden walked over to the bed and knelt in front of me, pushing his body between my legs. His hands cupped my face and he pressed a kiss to my lips. His tongue darted out and licked my upper lip before slipping into my mouth. I massaged his tongue with mine and ran my hands over his shoulders and up into his dark hair. My whole body yearned to be close to Aiden, to taste him, to feel him. When our kiss ended, I wrapped my arms around his neck and leaned my head on his shoulder. I enjoyed the comfort he provided me.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something,\u201d I whispered. He looked up at me and the sides of his mouth curled up as he grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, my Gwen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I began but was interrupted when Micah stepped into my bedroom. I looked back at him and sighed. \u201cCan we pick up where we left off after Micah and I talk?\u201d I asked Aiden. He kissed my forehead and got to his feet.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be in the living room.\u201d I nodded my head and turn on my bed so that I was sitting crossed-legged. Aiden glared at Micah and pushed past him. Micah closed the bedroom door and walked around the bed and leaned against the far wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you finally woke up; you had us worried,\u201d Micah said cautiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? What did I do?\u201d</p><p>I unwound my legs and dangled them off the side of the bed so that I could look at Micah directly.</p> <p>\u201cYou sprayed my boyfriend with liquid silver and you let Ian Despereaux feed me, which bonded us.\u201d I eyed him with my anger and let the words sink in.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Micah began, only to stop and think more about what I had told him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it would form a bond, Gwen.\u201d He paused and silently cursed. \u201cHe planned this all along. He bewitched Fiona so we thought she was dead and so that you\u2019d allow him to drink from you, and then he knocked you out with magic because he knew we\u2019d have him feed you to bring you back, forming a bond. I may hate the prick, but he\u2019s clever.\u201d Micah snorted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Aiden was trying to stop it but he was too weak from being sprayed with the liquid silver, thanks a lot.\u201d I spat out. I knew that Micah wasn\u2019t solely responsible, but I had a lot of anger stirring within me and I needed to direct it at someone. I found fault with Micah to a certain point making him a fine target for my anger. He may not have known what constituted a bond with a vampire, but he was the reason Aiden couldn\u2019t stop it from happening.</p><p>\u201cAiden would have killed Liam if we hadn\u2019t sprayed him. He\u2019s strong, Gwen. Wyatt and I could have subdued him for a little while, but not long enough to save Liam\u2019s life. Liquid silver was our only option.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Micah, my fury aimed right at him but I didn\u2019t speak; it\u2019d be pointless to repeat what I\u2019d already blamed him for. I wanted him to know how pissed I was for what he\u2019d done, whether it was for Liam\u2019s life or not.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well now my life is the one in danger. You guys let Ian get away and I\u2019m bonded to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him, Gwen. We ambushed the warehouse two nights ago and have all of his goons in custody. The VC (Vampire Council) came and killed four of them but the ones that are left are only alive because they are spilling all of the information they know about Ian\u2019s dealings. I suspect that they will be dead by the end of the week though, I don\u2019t trust the VC. Witches\u2019 blood benefits vampires too much for them to really care about taking action to stop it. We\u2019ve learned some interesting things though,\u201d Micah said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have a feeling that things are going to come to blows between the VC and the NAWC very soon. You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re a werewolf and not in the middle of the shit storm. What interesting things did you guys learn?\u201d My anger had eased, if only a tiny bit. I was more excited that I had been able to lead Micah to the warehouse where Amy Harper and Bridget Downing had been killed. It was a small victory though; the vampires would just move their operation to another secluded area.</p><p>\u201cRemember how you kept saying the main guy was British?\u201d Micah asked and I nodded my head. \u201cWell, Ian\u2019s goons told us that he\u2019s from Bedford, England. He probably disguised his voice while he was around us because the vampires say he normally speaks with an English accent. I wanted to be absolutely certain that Ian was, in fact, the man so I made sure to ask about that. He\u2019s learned how to use the magic very well so that\u2019s why no one could see his face. Without you\u2019re help, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to get this far, thank you, Gwen.\u201d Micah\u2019s eyes showed too much emotion for my liking. I broke eye contact and leaned my elbows on my knees, resting my head in my palm. I focused on the floor instead of the longing in Micah\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWere one of the vampires close to Amy Harper?\u201d I asked, remembering from Amy\u2019s memories that she had definitely known her attacker. Her brother, Anthony, had seemed nervous talking to us.</p><p>\u201cYeah, his name was Jason. He was only three years old, in vampire terms. He was one of the first ones that the VC killed. Amy had started dating him three months before she was killed.\u201d</p> <p>It was nice to see all the loose ends make some sense. I was still uneasy though. I knew the situation was far from over.</p><p>Aiden opened the bedroom door and said, \u201cSorry to interrupt, but Gwen and I have dinner plans.\u201d I arched an eyebrow at the news but with the mention of food, my stomach grumbled.</p><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019ll head out. I just wanted to catch you up on the case. Happy you\u2019re okay, Gwen, and I\u2019m sorry for letting Ian feed you but you have the FPD\u2019s guarantee that we\u2019re doing everything in our power to find Ian and put a stake through his heart.\u201d Micah gave me a small smile and then walked to the door but, before leaving, he turned to Aiden and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for spraying you with the liquid silver but we thought it was the only way to stop you from killing Liam. I understand what it\u2019s like loving Gwen, you\u2019d do anything to keep her safe.\u201d Micah looked back at me and then turned and left.</p><p>Aiden paid to have one of the nicer restaurants in Flora closed for only the two of us. Behind the restaurant was a brick patio, surrounded with wisteria-covered lattice for privacy. White twinkling lights wove through the lattice, making the purple flowers glow.</p><p>Our table sat in the middle of a gazebo and the white lights continued around all sides while an elegant light hung from the ceiling and lent a soft glow above our table. I had eaten here three years before, but somehow it seemed more romantic with Aiden on the other side of the table, with the lights reflecting off his sapphire eyes.</p><p>A waiter poured us both a glass of champagne while another waiter carried a silver dome-covered dish, placing it in front of me. He removed the lid to reveal an array of seafood, scallops, lobster, and grilled shrimp, on a bed of rice with lemons garnishing the sides. I smiled and looked at Aiden. I had mentioned a long time ago that I loved seafood and it seemed he hadn\u2019t forgotten.</p><p>The waiter\u2019s left and soft music began to float on the night air as Aiden and I watched each other over the rims of our glasses.</p><p>\u201cConsider this our first official date,\u201d Aiden said with a smile. I had told him that I wanted to go on a few dates before things between us got serious, but things had spiraled out of control while we were on the case and we hadn\u2019t had time for any dates.</p> <p>\u201cSeems like we\u2019re doing things backwards. Aren\u2019t we supposed to sleep together after dating?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have every intention of sleeping with you after this date,\u201d Aiden said with a devilishly naughty grin. I giggled and a blush rushed to my cheeks from the fire Aiden had ignited.</p><p>It was strange eating in front of Aiden since he didn\u2019t eat, but my stomach demanded the food so I tried not to shovel it into my mouth. Aiden watched me close my eyes as I forked a piece of lobster and put it into my mouth. The edges of his pupils had begun to darken with his growing lust and by the time I scooped the last bit of rice into my mouth, we were both ready to enjoy dessert.</p><p>Aiden definitely took his time exploring my body and an hour later, we lay next to each other panting and cuddling. He rubbed my arm while I lay on his muscular chest but when his phone rang, I grumbled and moved so that he could answer it.</p><p>He excused himself and walked out of the bedroom where I could hear him talking about some order that hadn\u2019t shown up at Vain. I made a note to check on my own inventory and give Penny a raise first thing in the morning. That girl was a peach and more responsible than any other nineteen-year-old I\u2019d ever met.</p><p>A slight pain rushed into my head and I cursed that I was getting a headache. But when the pain subsided just as quickly as it had come and a white noise took its place, I sat up. I bunched my eyebrows as I tried to understand where the noise was coming from. Aiden didn\u2019t have a television in his bedroom and the radio was off.</p><p>\u2018Ello, little witch, a voice said in a British accent. I jerked so strongly that I hit my head on the back of Aiden\u2019s headboard. I rubbed the spot and cursed, my eyes roaming the large room for the owner of the voice, for Ian.</p><p>I can sense that you just enjoyed Aiden. You\u2019ve got me all randy and it\u2019s your body I\u2019m craving. I will find you, Gwen, and you will be mine. Your body will be beneath me as your lips moan only my name. Until we meet again, little witch.</p><p>Aiden stepped back into the room and apologized for the call. He hopped back into bed and noticed that I was frozen with fear.</p><p>\u201cGwen, what\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d He was in front of me in a flash, both of his hands gripping my arms. I dragged my eyes to his. Tears dripped against my cheeks as I replayed what Ian had said.</p><p>\u201cIan communicated with me telepathically.\u201d I mumbled. \u201cHe said that he\u2019d find me.\u201d I left out all of the dirty stuff Ian said; Aiden didn\u2019t need to hear that part of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cDamn it\u201d Aiden said between clenched teeth. He drew me into his arms and said, \u201cI\u2019ll kill him, Gwen, I promise.\u201d I moved back and wiped the tears away, knowing that, from now on, I had to be strong if I had any chance of beating Ian at his own game.</p><p>\u201cThere was something I tried telling you before, in my bedroom, before Micah interrupted. I don\u2019t know what the future holds for me, Aiden, but I know I want you in it and if tomorrow doesn\u2019t come for me, if Ian finds me before we find him, than you should know...that I love you.\u201d I stared into his eyes and waited for his reaction. My heart pounded against my ribcage but it had felt great to say what I felt. I knew without a doubt that I loved him. But what if he doesn\u2019t love me? Maybe I jumped the gun.</p><p>Aiden smiled and laughed. He leaned close to my face so that his lips hovered in front of mine and in a whisper so soft, he said the words that melted my heart.</p><p>\u201cYou are my past, my present, and my future, all that I am, all that I aim to be is for you, my Gwen. Until my last breath I\u2019ll love you.\u201d Aiden\u2019s lips met mine and I knew that with him beside me, I could handle anything life threw at me. </p> </body></html>"]
