The freaks were dangerous, they insisted, with powers that none of them truly understood. Who knew what the monsters would do if someone pissed them off?</p><p>Then there were others who said they should be locked away and studied like lab rats. Perhaps their mutations could be used to help normal people.</p><p>Most, however, preferred to ignore Valhalla and the high-bloods ... as they preferred to be called ... living behind the dome.</p> <p>Until, of course, they needed them.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Kansas City, Kansas</p><p>Sergeant Duncan O\u2019Conner was late to the party.</p><p>Nursing a hangover from hell, he took two painkillers with a gallon of hot coffee and steered his POS cop car through the light Sunday traffic and entered the gated community in the Southwest suburbs.</p><p>The call had hit his cell phone at three in the afternoon. An hour before, he\u2019d hauled his sorry ass out of bed. It\u2019d taken another half hour under the shower to peel his throbbing eyes open and get rid of the stench of cheap whiskey and even cheaper cigars.</p> <p>His first thought had been to call in and tell them to find someone else. Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be his damned weekend off rotation? Let Caleb deal with the latest stiff.</p><p>Then the thought that the entire station would suspect he\u2019d spent the night of his ex-wife\u2019s latest wedding getting shit-faced drunk sent him stumbling to his car. Yeah, like his bloodshot eyes and old man shuffle weren\u2019t going to give the game away, he acknowledged wryly. But while he could take the razzing, he couldn\u2019t take the thought of them feeling sorry for him.</p><p>Never that.</p><p>He might be a pathetic loser, but he was a pathetic loser who was damned good at his job.</p><p>Entering the cul-de-sac, Duncan parked his car and headed into the brick house. He ignored the speculative glances from the neighbors who had gathered in a little clutch across the street. He was accustomed to females checking out his spare, well-honed body shown to advantage in a pair of faded jeans and black tee. Even with his short, pale blond hair damp from the shower and his stubborn jaw shadowed with a golden stubble, he had the look of a man who knew what to do with a woman. Match that with a pair of hazel eyes that sparkled with wicked charm and they were like putty in his hands.</p><p>The men tended to be more interested in the gun holstered at his side and the hard expression on his lean face that warned he only needed an excuse to kick someone\u2019s ass.</p><p>His own attention was focused on the house as he stepped into the small but elegant foyer. Not the sort of house a young woman could afford without some help. From daddy. Or more likely, from sugar daddy.</p><p>Not that he was being sexist. He couldn\u2019t afford a damned toolshed in this frou-frou neighborhood. Even if his old da chipped in every penny he made driving a cab.</p> <p>He continued to size up the bold black and white furnishings as a uniformed officer handed him a file with the pertinent details of the case. A beat later another officer arrived to lead him to the back of the house and a sunny kitchen with a perfect view of the pool.</p><p>He grimaced as the late spring sunlight sent a stab of agony through his throbbing brain, then lowered his gaze to the female who was lying naked in the middle of the tiled floor.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised that she was beautiful. Stunningly beautiful with long hair that glistened with chestnut highlights, pretty features, and a slender body that was tight with the muscles of an athlete.</p><p>What did surprise him was the lack of any sort of violence. She looked like she\u2019d simply lain down in the middle of the floor and quietly passed away.</p><p>In his experience, lovely young women who were killed on Sunday morning were beaten to death by a jealous boyfriend or raped and killed by a passing psycho.</p><p>Not ... what?</p><p>His brows jerked together as he took a swift inventory of the kitchen, noting everything was in pristine place, not so much as a coffee mug left in the sink. It could be the female never used the kitchen, preferring to eat out, or at her lover\u2019s place. It could be she was OCD and her kitchen was always spotless.</p><p>But his gut was telling him that she hadn\u2019t lived here long enough to stop caring if the place was a mess.</p><p>\u201cHola, O\u2019Conner. Looking a little rough around the edges,\u201d the silver-haired coroner drawled, unfolding a white sheet to drape it over the body. \u201cHeard that Susan found herself a decent man to make an honest woman of her.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, so decent he was banging her in Duncan\u2019s own bed.</p><p>Flipping off his companion, Duncan opened the file and glanced through the meager info that had been gathered on the female.</p><p>\u201cWho found the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA silent alarm was tripped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause of death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s missing her heart.\u201d</p><p>Duncan froze, his gaze searching the victim\u2019s unmarred skin and the obvious lack of blood.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell could she be missing her heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Frank Sanchez admitted, the bite in his raspy voice expressing his opinion of \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cBut I ran the portable MRI over her three times to be sure.\u201d</p><p>The older man could be a pain in the ass to work with, but he knew his shit. Nothing got past his eagle gaze. If he said the female was missing her heart, then she was missing her heart.</p><p>Crap. Duncan hated mysteries.</p><p>\u201cNo DNA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clean.\u201d Another growl as Frank gathered the tools of his trade to pack them in a black leather bag. \u201cToo clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo a freak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my guess.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Duncan read through the file.</p><p>Leah Meadows.</p><p>Twenty-six.</p><p>Single, originally from Little Rock.</p><p>Current occupation, dancer at the Rabbit Hutch.</p><p>That would explain her location, he cynically concluded. Her salary as a dancer wouldn\u2019t cover the rent, but the clients who frequented the high-end strip club would easily be able to afford this place to keep a current mistress.</p><p>It didn\u2019t, however, explain why she was lying naked in her kitchen without her heart.</p><p>Lifting his head, he met Frank\u2019s troubled gaze. \u201cYou made the call?\u201d</p><p>The older man grimaced, not needing any further explanation.</p><p>When there was a murder that didn\u2019t have an eyewitness or a legitimate suspect, it was protocol to call in one of the mutants. And when it might involve another mutant, they were called ASAP.</p><p>\u201cYep. She should be\u2014\u201d</p><p>On cue one of the uniforms stepped into the kitchen. \u201cThe necro is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect timing,\u201d Duncan muttered. \u201cShow her in.\u201d For whatever reason, necros were almost always females.</p><p>The young man nodded, disappearing back down the hallway while Frank snapped shut his black bag.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cue for a quick exit.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grinned. \u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned straight,\u201d the older man said without apology. \u201cFreaks give me the heebie-jeebies. I don\u2019t know how you can be in the same room with one.\u201d</p><p>A bitter smile touched Duncan\u2019s lips. Like draws to like ...</p><p>No. He grimly crushed the mocking words in the back of his aching head. He wasn\u2019t like those mutants from Valhalla.</p><p>Lots of people could see the souls of others, couldn\u2019t they?</p><p>He swallowed his grim urge to laugh, tilting his head toward the sheet on the floor. \u201cYou can be in the same room with a corpse, but not a necro?\u201d</p><p>Frank shrugged. \u201cI respect the dead. No one should be screwing around with their heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it takes a murderer off the streets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like getting my criminals the old-fashioned way. Necros should be abolished along with the rest of the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer the term \u2018diviner\u2019 if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d a soft, compelling voice whispered through the room, turning both men toward the door like a magnet.</p><p>Even prepared, Duncan felt the air being jerked from his lungs at the sight of Callie Brown.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that she was a stunning beauty with her short, spiky hair that was so dark red it shimmered like fire in the sunlight. Her pale features were perfectly carved with a sensual invitation for a mouth and a proud nose.</p><p>And her body ... hell, it was slender with just enough curves to make a man think of black silk sheets and long weekends. Today it was displayed to perfection in a pair of black spandex pants and a white stretchy top.</p><p>But for Duncan it was the white aura that flickered around her diminutive body that made his blood burn.</p><p>So pure. So completely and utterly innocent.</p><p>And like any bastard, he ached to be the one who debauched that wholesomeness even as he savored the rare beauty of her soul.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Frank muttered, heading for the door leading to the back patio. \u201cAdios, amigo.\u201d</p><p>His entire body vibrating with an awareness that went way beyond sexual attraction, Duncan barely noticed the hasty departure of the coroner. Not that he wouldn\u2019t have Callie flat on her back and her legs wrapped around his waist with the least hint of encouragement.</p><p>It was a sensation that should have scared the hell out of him. Instead a wicked smile curved his lips.</p><p>\u201cHello, Callie.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, regarding him through the reflective sunglasses that hid her eyes, her expression unreadable.</p><p>On the half dozen occasions Duncan had worked with Callie, he\u2019d never seen her be anything but serene. Which, of course, only encouraged him to try and provoke a response from her. Anything to know there was a flesh and blood woman beneath that image of calm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why it was so important to find that woman was another one of those things he put on the list of \u201cdon\u2019t fucking care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSergeant O\u2019Conner,\u201d she said, moving with an unearthly grace to stand beside the sheet.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d he insisted, shifting to stand across the body, his gaze never leaving Callie\u2019s pale face.</p> <p>\u201cHas the body been processed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as can be done in the field. You\u2019re free to do your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime of death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I should have time.\u201d She knelt down, reaching for the edge of the sheet. \u201cThe spark\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, no need explain.\u201d He held up a restraining hand. He might not share the prejudices of most of society against the freaks, but that didn\u2019t mean he wanted an insider\u2019s guide to necromancy. Christ. The mere thought made his stomach clench. \u201cJust see what you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Cool, indifferent. Then her body tensed. \u201cSo young,\u201d she murmured softly.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six.\u201d He crouched down, studying her silken skin unmarred by wrinkles. \u201cOlder than you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman never shares that information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou share nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you blame me?\u201d</p> <p>His lips twisted at the smooth thrust. Most people went out of their way to avoid freaks, but there were others who thought the only good freak was a dead freak. There were even a handful of cults where people trained to kill them. Mostly simpleminded idiots who needed someone to tell them what to think and angry outcasts who had nowhere else to go, but that didn\u2019t make them any less dangerous.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. Okay, he was vain. He\u2019d spent most of his life knowing women found him irresistible. The fact he wasn\u2019t certain if Callie had even noticed he was a male annoyed the hell out of him.</p><p>Then with a silent curse he shoved aside his ego and concentrated on the only thing important at the moment. Finding the son of a bitch who\u2019d killed this woman.</p><p>\u201cLeah Meadows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that her real name?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s all I got for now.\u201d</p> <p>She paused before giving a slow nod. \u201cIt should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need her name?\u201d He asked the question that he\u2019d wondered about more than once.</p><p>By law they couldn\u2019t give details of the death in the fear that the necro might be swayed into naming a murderer even if the victim couldn\u2019t reveal the truth.</p><p>But a necro always asked for a name.</p><p>\u201cIt helps me to connect with her mind.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked,\u201d she reminded him in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cDo you need any other details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d He pointed toward the forearm where Frank would have prepped the victim. \u201cIt\u2019s been sanitized.\u201d</p><p>She at last lifted her head. \u201cWould you make sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat no one enters?\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He abruptly frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s your Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>A necro never left the compound without a guardian Sentinel. Not only were they capable of opening portals to travel from place to place (a mysterious talent that was never discussed among the mundane mortals), but they were also trained warriors who were covered in intricate tattoos. From what little Duncan had been able to learn, the ceremonial markings protected the warriors from magic as well as any attempt at mind control.</p><p>And, oh yeah, they were capable of killing with their bare hands.</p><p>There were also rumors that there were other Sentinels\u2014hunters who weren\u2019t marked and could travel among the humans unnoticed. But info on them was kept top secret.</p><p>\u201cI asked him to wait outside.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you take such pleasure in tormenting him and he\u2019s too well trained to fight back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m not well trained?\u201d</p><p>She ignored the open invitation to point out that he was barely civilized and instead returned her attention to the victim.</p><p>\u201cThe door, please.\u201d</p><p>He slowly straightened, swallowing his groan as his head gave another protesting throb. Whiskey was the devil\u2019s brew, just as his ma had always claimed.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s coming in,\u201d he muttered, \u201cbut I\u2019ll keep guard at the door if it makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sergeant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan.\u201d His headache forgotten, he flashed a smile of pure challenge. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll say it. Hell, one day you might even scream it.\u201d</p><p>No response. With a low growl, Duncan made his way to the door, leaning on the doorjamb to make sure no one could enter, while keeping his attention on the woman kneeling beside the corpse.</p><p>She ignored his unwavering attention, lifting a hand to remove her sunglasses and setting them aside. At the same time the slanting sunlight spilled over her, catching in the sapphire blue of her eyes.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s heart forgot how to beat.</p><p>He\u2019d seen them before. At a distance. At the time he\u2019d thought they looked like expensive gems, perfectly faceted and shimmering with an inner light. Up close they were even more magnificent.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>The beauty of those eyes was hypnotizing.</p><p>Priceless jewels that revealed this was no ordinary woman.</p><p>Duncan would be pleased to know that it was only her years of training that allowed Callie to ignore his raw sexual magnetism.</p><p>He was the sort of primitive male that should have infuriated her, not tantalized her deepest fantasies.</p><p>Of course, the Mave would tell her that fantasies were meant to be filled with unsuitable desires. Why not lust after a bad boy cop? It wasn\u2019t as if she was going to do anything about it. She didn\u2019t know if his flirtations were a way to taunt her or if he was one of those groupies who got off on sleeping with \u201cfreaks,\u201d but either way, it had nothing to do with her as a person.</p><p>Still, it was only with an effort that she managed to crush the tiny tingles of excitement fluttering in the pit of her stomach and the dampness of her palms.</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time or place.</p><p>Tonight in her dreams ... well, that was a different story.</p><p>Clearing her thoughts, she laid her hands on the victim\u2019s arm and closed her eyes.</p><p>It took a second to slip from her own mind and into the female stretched on the floor. There was always a strange sense of ... floating. As if her consciousness was hovering between one body and the next. Then, focusing on the feel of the female\u2019s arm beneath her fingers, she murmured her name.</p><p>\u201cLeah.\u201d</p><p>The soft word was enough.</p><p>With a hair-raising jolt, she was sucked from her body and into Leah\u2019s mind.</p><p>She could easily sense the female soul, just as she could sense she was fading.</p><p>Fast.</p><p>Despite the ridiculous myths, a necromancer couldn\u2019t control or raise the dead. Her only ability was to tap into the mind of the murdered victim to see the last few minutes of their life.</p><p>And only within a very short time frame.</p><p>Once the ... spark, for lack of a better word ... was extinguished and the soul moved on, the memories were lost.</p><p>A meaningless talent for the most part. But on rare occasion it could mean the opportunity for justice.</p><p>With a well-honed skill, Callie touched on the female\u2019s memory center. Just being born a diviner didn\u2019t automatically mean that a person would be capable of reading memories. There were many necromancers who were never able to do more than enter the body and hopefully catch a stray thought.</p><p>Callie, however, was one of the most talented.</p><p>Which was why she was always sent when there was a suspicion the death might have been caused by a high-blood, as the freaks preferred to call themselves.</p><p>Finding the spot she was searching for, she delicately slipped into the fading memories and allowed them to flow through her.</p><p>Suddenly she was no longer kneeling on the hard floor. Instead she was in the attached garage, stepping out of her sleek black Jag. She sensed a pleasant weariness in her limbs, as if she\u2019d just finished a vigorous workout at the gym, a suspicion confirmed when she glanced down to see she was wearing a pair of stretchy pants and a matching sports bra.</p><p>Rounding the car, she moved to unlock the door that led to the house. She stepped into the small laundry room and stripped off her sweaty clothes to toss them in the washing machine. Now naked, she moved into the sun-drenched kitchen.</p><p>As she headed for the stainless steel refrigerator to pull out a bottle of water there was an ease in her steps that hinted this was a routine morning for her, and a comfort with her surroundings that said she had lived in the house for at least a few weeks.</p><p>Callie, however, could sense a faint surge of pride as she turned to study the large kitchen that looked like a picture out of a fancy magazine.</p><p>Leah had recently moved up in the world.</p><p>And she was fully enjoying her elevation.</p><p>Callie had barely managed to grasp the knowledge when Leah was stiffening, her head turning toward the French doors.</p><p>Was there a shadow lurking by the trimmed hedges that lined the patio?</p><p>She gave a strained laugh, lifting the bottle to drink the last of the water before tossing it into the recycle bin next to the fridge.</p><p>The neighborhood was the safest in the city. Besides, the house was guarded by a security system.</p><p>If there was a creep out there trying to sneak a peek through the windows, then he\u2019d set off a hundred bells and whistles the minute he stepped on the patio.</p><p>Brave thoughts, but a tiny shiver inched down the female\u2019s spine as the shadow moved, stepping away from the hedges to reveal\u2014</p><p>Without warning the image was snatched away.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>Callie blinked, expecting to have been returned to her body. When the spark left, it destroyed any connection that Callie had to the dead.</p><p>But instead she found she remained in Leah\u2019s body, standing in the center of the kitchen as if she were still in the memory ... without Leah. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t allow you to see any more,\u201d an unexpected male voice drawled.</p><p>Callie turned in shock to watch the tall man with silver hair pulled from his lean, darkly bronzed face stroll through the door leading into the dining room.</p> <p>She pressed a hand to her racing heart.</p><p>No one should be here.</p><p>No one but her and the soul she\u2019d connected to in the physical world.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one had given the stranger the handbook on necromancy. Instead of disappearing, he continued forward, the muted light revealing his painfully beautiful features. His brow was high and intelligent, his nose a thin blade, and his lips carved along full lines. And his eyes ...</p><p>They were gemstone like hers, only instead of blue they were perfectly clear, like diamonds glittering with a cold light.</p> <p>A male necromancer? Of the few she\u2019d met, none had those color eyes. And certainly they didn\u2019t have the sort of bone-chilling strength she could feel swirling through the air around him.</p><p>His muscular body was covered by a thick gray robe that covered him from neck to feet, although she caught a glimpse of slender fingers the same bronze shade as his face.</p><p>More terrified than she\u2019d ever been in her life, Callie struggled to speak. \u201cAre you the one who killed Leah?\u201d</p><p>He halted a mere foot from her, studying her as if she were a rare bug beneath a microscope.</p><p>\u201cA diviner,\u201d he at last said, his words edged with a faint accent. \u201cAnd one of astonishing power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this possible? Are you in Leah\u2019s mind?\u201d</p> <p>He seemed to pause, his eyes widening before he suddenly tilted back his head to laugh with a cold amusement.</p><p>\u201cCallie Brown. How very ironic.\u201d The diamond eyes glittered with a blinding light. \u201cIt must be fate that brought us here together.\u201d</p><p>He knew who she was? The thought disturbed her on a cellular level.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>A slow, mysterious smile curved his sensuous lips. \u201cThat\u2019s not the right question.\u201d</p><p>Did he think this was a game?</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She forced herself to hold the diamond gaze. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right, either,\u201d he warned, lifting a hand toward her face.</p> <p>Callie leaped backward, her heart slamming against her ribs with the force of a steam hammer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>His low chuckle seemed to wrap around her like sinful magic. \u201cThe question, my beautiful Callie, is\u201d\u2014he deliberately paused\u2014\u201cwho are you?\u201d</p><p>Her pulsing fear was disturbed by the unexpected sensation of Fane tugging her back to reality.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tried to fight against her Sentinel\u2019s ruthless pull, knowing that there was more at risk than the death of one young female. \u201cWait. Damn you.\u201d</p><p>Her last sight was of the stranger blowing her a taunting kiss.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Callie opened her eyes, puzzled to discover she was sprawled on the hard floor, her head cradled in Fane\u2019s lap.</p><p>As always the Sentinel looked like he\u2019d been carved from granite. At six-foot-three he had the chiseled muscles of a warrior and the strength of an ox. Not surprising considering he\u2019d been honed from the cradle to become a weapon.</p><p>He was also covered from the top of his shaved head to the tips of his toes in intricate tattoos that protected him from all magic.</p><p>There were two sects of Sentinels.</p><p>The first sect contained warriors who were born with superior senses and reflexes as well as innate strength but no magic. They were made into hunters since they were easily able to \u201cpass\u201d as human and were often used by the Mave to track down renegade high-bloods who had committed a crime or were a danger to themselves or others.</p><p>Those few born with superior physical abilities as well as a claim to magic were taken by the monks and trained to become guardian Sentinels. They were Sentinels that guarded high-bloods who were incapable of protecting themselves.</p><p>The monks did everything in their power to make them the most proficient, most feared killers ever to walk the earth.</p><p>And they surpassed all expectations with Fane.</p><p>He was death walking to his enemies.</p><p>And his enemies included anyone who threatened Callie.</p><p>She frowned, focusing on the bleak face of her guardian. The dark eyes were harder than usual and the stark features that were savagely beautiful beneath the swirls of black tattoos were set in a fierce expression.</p><p>\u201cFane, what are you doing?\u201d she demanded, startled when her voice came out as a croak.</p><p>\u201cThe cop came for me,\u201d the Sentinel said, his voice a low rumble. \u201cHe said you were in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Duncan\u2019s lean, annoyingly handsome face swam into focus as he moved to stand over her, the hazel eyes snapping with a combination of combustible emotions. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? You fell backward and started flopping like a damned fish out of water. I thought you were having a seizure.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly she recalled what had happened during her last seconds inside Leah\u2019s mind. \u201cOh,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>The hazel eyes narrowed. \u201cYou can say thank you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she forced herself to mutter as she sat upright.</p><p>A part of her was furious at having been pulled away from the stranger before she could determine what the hell he was. But a larger part realized that she\u2019d been in grave danger. Perhaps more danger than she wanted to imagine, if her throbbing head was anything to go by.</p><p>Duncan snorted. \u201cYour gratitude overwhelms me.\u201d</p><p>She reached to slide her glasses on. Usually, they were her personal armor against a world that considered her a freak.</p><p>Now, she used them to conceal the raw fear pulsing through her.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to Fane.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s features sharpened to his cop face. Hard. Unyielding. Pain-in-the-ass. \u201cNo one\u2019s stopping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She met his glare with a lift of her brow, allowing Fane to help her to her feet. Her knees briefly protested, threatening to crumble, but with a ruthless resolve she willed them to hold steady. She\u2019d survived being tossed in a Dumpster when she was less than a week old. She\u2019d survived thirty years of being hated, feared, and even hunted by crazy-ass norms.</p><p>She would survive this.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a request, Sergeant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my crime scene, Ms. Brown,\u201d he growled. \u201cAnd anything you saw in Leah\u2019s mind is evidence.\u201d</p><p>She paused. Legally he was right. Anything she discovered during her investigation went into an official transcript that could be used in court.</p><p>But technically Leah had already passed on when the stranger had popped into her mind. So that left jurisdiction ... fuzzy.</p><p>At least as far as she was concerned.</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with your case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cI\u2019ll decide what does or doesn\u2019t have to do with my case,\u201d he retorted, reaching to grab her arm. As if he thought she was intending to disappear in a puff of smoke.</p><p>Not an unreasonable fear.</p><p>Most people didn\u2019t understand how a Sentinel was capable of traveling. They simply assumed they popped place to place with some mysterious magic.</p><p>The cop, however, had forgotten an important rule when working with a diviner.</p><p>His hand was still inches away from her when Fane reached out to grasp his wrist in a punishing grip.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Touch. Her.\u201d</p><p>Duncan hissed, his gaze never shifting from Callie as he used his free hand to grasp the butt of the handgun that was holstered at his side.</p><p>\u201cCall off your dog,\u201d he commanded through clenched teeth.</p><p>Fane kept his grip as he stepped forward to stand at Callie\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m her Sentinel, not her servant. If I decide someone is a threat I\u2019ll do whatever necessary to protect her.\u201d Although casually dressed in a pair of combat pants and white muscle shirt, no one, absolutely no one, could mistake Fane as anything less than lethal. \u201cThat badge doesn\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFane.\u201d She laid a light hand on his arm. This went beyond Fane protecting her. The air was choking with male testosterone. One wrong word and things could get very, very messy. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday we\u2019re going to settle this,\u201d Fane snarled before grudgingly releasing his hold.</p><p>Duncan made a show of releasing his gun. \u201cSooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>Callie rolled her eyes.</p><p>Men.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the sergeant should hear this,\u201d she said, accepting that Duncan was going to dig and prod and generally make a nuisance of himself until he had what he wanted.</p><p>Or until Fane snapped and killed him.</p><p>As if to prove her point, Fane wrapped an arm around her shoulders, his touch as much a warning to Duncan as a support for her shaky balance. \u201cYou need to rest,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no time.\u201d</p><p>Fane frowned, not missing the edge of fear in her voice. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2014\u201d Duncan tried to hide his grimace.</p><p>She completed his sentence. \u201cI was able to locate her memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know what happened to her?\u201d Duncan asked.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. \u201cNot exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer soul left before I could access her final memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Duncan muttered, frustration smoldering in his hazel eyes. As annoying as he might be, his dedication to his job was never in doubt. He was as tenacious as a bulldog when it came to solving a case. \u201cThen you didn\u2019t see her murderer?\u201d</p><p>She shivered, vividly recalling the diamond-bright eyes.</p><p>\u201cActually ... he was still there.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stepped forward, his lean face tight with shock. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBack off.\u201d Fane lifted a warning hand before turning to study her with a searching gaze. \u201cCallie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man appeared. I think it was the same man who killed Leah.\u201d</p><p>Fane hissed, turning her so he could run an assessing gaze over her. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d he rasped. \u201cIs that why you were having a seizure?\u201d</p><p>She lifted an unconscious hand to her head. It was beginning to throb with an uncomfortable persistence. \u201cIt must have been, but I didn\u2019t feel his attack while we were speaking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need to see a healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d She placed a hand on his wide neck. It was a gesture of intimacy without being sexual. Trust between partners. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Duncan sharply intruded, his voice filled with annoyance. \u201cWas he a necro?\u201d</p><p>She turned back to meet his narrowed gaze, inanely noticing the bruises beneath the hazel eyes and the unusual pallor of his tanned face. Sick? Or just a late night?</p><p>Not that either was her business.</p> <p>\u201cHe must have some powers of necromancy, but he was more than that,\u201d she said, wrapping her arms around her waist as she returned her attention to Fane. \u201cMuch more,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cI must speak with the Mave. She may know who, or at least what, he might be.\u201d</p><p>Fane didn\u2019t hesitate, moving toward the door. On the point of following him, Callie was halted as Duncan moved to stand in her way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d he said, stubbornly holding his ground, although he was smart enough not to touch her.</p><p>Fane was on edge. One wrong move and he would explode.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, wrapping her in the scent of warm male and ... was that whiskey?</p> <p>Ah. So not sick, but hungover.</p><p>\u201cThen make it possible.\u201d</p><p>In the blink of an eye Fane\u2019s huge body was between them, his muscles primed for violence. \u201cA man with a death wish,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cWhat I am is a cop with a victim who\u2019s missing her heart with no visible wounds,\u201d Duncan countered.</p><p>Callie gave a soft gasp, stepping around Fane to regard the cop in horror. She never asked how a victim died. It might influence her when she was reliving their memories.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s missing her heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone, just like magic.\u201d He held her gaze, his expression grim. \u201cThat means the killer is a freak. I\u2019m not letting you out of my sight until I know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>It took a minute for her to realize she\u2019d just been insulted. Odd considering it happened with tedious regularity.</p> <p>\u201cAre you implying I would try and hide the identity of a murderer?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the bristling Fane as he moved to stand directly in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m implying that you\u2019re stuck with me, Callie Brown.\u201d</p><p>Fane growled, but before he could give in to his desire to smash his fist into Duncan\u2019s face, Callie turned to distract his attention.</p><p>\u201cWould you contact the Mave and tell her we\u2019ll be bringing a visitor?\u201d</p><p>Fane\u2019s lips tightened, but he gave a ready nod of his head.</p><p>When it came to her safety, Fane was in charge. But when she was making decisions as a diviner, she was boss.</p><p>Pulling the phone from his pocket, he moved toward the door. Calls to Valhalla were always made in private.</p><p>Of course, the Sentinel couldn\u2019t leave without halting long enough to offer Duncan a warning. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be on my territory, cop,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait,\u201d Duncan assured him, turning to watch the dangerous warrior exit the room.</p><p>\u201cIs that really necessary?\u201d Callie demanded in exasperation.</p><p>Duncan turned his head back with a snap. \u201cIs he your lover?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the abrupt question. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>He boldly reached to grasp her chin in his hand. \u201cSince you\u2019re going to be sharing my bed, I\u2019d say it\u2019s very much my business.\u201d</p><p>She scowled, pretending that her stomach wasn\u2019t fluttering with excitement. \u201cFane was right.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lowered to her lips, the heat smoldering in the hazel eyes promising all sorts of wicked pleasure.</p><p>\u201cRight about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a menace.\u201d</p><p>Duncan paced the long room that was painted in soothing shades of blue and filled with sleek furniture built of steel and upholstered with black leather.</p><p>It looked more like a reception room for an upscale plastic surgeon than the Funny Farm. No, not the Funny Farm. Valhalla, he grimly corrected himself.</p><p>He doubted the residents would appreciate the nickname the norms used to reference the strange compound hidden beneath the shimmering dome. And since more than a few of them could read his thoughts, he would be an idiot to deliberately provoke them.</p><p>His lips twisted as he came to the end of the room where images were being projected onto the smooth wall. It looked like the local news program, although he didn\u2019t bother to try and read the lips of the pretty anchorwoman. Instead he turned on his heels and continued his pacing.</p><p>He had to keep moving. If he stopped then he might remember being taken to a small monastery on the outskirts of Kansas City where he\u2019d stepped into a hidden chamber with Callie and her guard dog, Fane. At first he\u2019d assumed he was going to have to endure a few prayers to whatever gods the freaks worshipped. After all, Sentinels were raised by monks and while they never seemed overly pious, it had to have some effect on them.</p><p>But there\u2019d been no praying when Fane demanded they all touch the strange copper post set in the middle of the barren room.</p><p>In fact there\u2019d been nothing but silence before the world abruptly melted.</p><p>There were no other words to explain what\u2019d happened.</p><p>One minute Duncan was standing close to Callie, breathing in her delicate scent and thinking thoughts that could get him arrested, and the next there was ... nothing.</p><p>A vast emptiness that made his stomach fall to his feet and his mouth dry.</p><p>For a frantic few minutes he feared that he\u2019d been tossed into an endless oblivion. Which was strange. His ma had always assured him that he was destined for the fiery pits of hell.</p><p>But the blackness lasted only seconds before the world flickered back into focus and he found himself in a room so similar to the one that they\u2019d just left that he wondered if it\u2019d been no more than an elaborate joke to scare the stupid human.</p><p>Then he\u2019d been led out of the room and through a labyrinth of hallways that could only mean they were at the infamous Valhalla. A knowledge that had done nothing to soothe his raw nerves.</p><p>Neither had Fane\u2019s gruff command to stay in the room and not touch anything before he\u2019d left with Callie to speak with the elusive Mave.</p><p>\u201cWalk here, O\u2019Conner. Wait there, O\u2019Conner,\u201d Duncan mocked beneath his breath. \u201cLie down and play dead like a good doggie, O\u2019Conner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you call us freaks?\u201d a female voice drawled from behind him. \u201cAt least we don\u2019t talk to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Pulling his gun, he whirled to watch a stranger stroll into the room from a hidden door, his fingers instinctively tightening on the trigger.</p><p>Not that she looked like someone who needed to be shot. Hell, she looked like she\u2019d been created to fulfill a man\u2019s deepest fantasy.</p><p>Statuesque, with lush curves that were shown to jaw-dropping perfection by a pair of black leather pants and red bustier, she had a long mane of raven hair that contrasted with her pale skin.</p><p>But there was a dangerous glint in the light green eyes that warned that this was no harmless sex kitten. This woman had claws she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use.</p><p>Especially on him, if her slow smile of anticipation was any indication.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She halted in the center of the room, her legs spread wide and looking impossibly long in her knee-high boots with three-inch heels.</p><p>\u201cSerra,\u201d she offered, a hint of a Russian accent edging her voice.</p><p>He studied her. Not as a male interested in a woman. He\u2019d already chosen his next lover, even if Callie hadn\u2019t accepted the inevitable.</p><p>But as a cop assessing a loaded weapon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a necro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my power isn\u2019t necromancy. And no\u201d\u2014her lips curled in a taunting smile\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not a witch.\u201d</p><p>He hissed. That hadn\u2019t been a lucky guess.</p><p>\u201cA reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDing, ding. Give the dog a Milk-Bone.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to hide his unease. Why bother? A reader was capable of rummaging around in people\u2019s minds. Or at least, that was the word on the streets.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean he was going to roll over and let the bitch intimidate him.</p><p>\u201cLet me go out on a limb and guess you don\u2019t like me,\u201d he said, his smile designed for maximum annoyance. \u201cIs it because I\u2019m not a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d she murmured, her eyes crystallizing with a dangerous power.</p><p>\u201cHigh-blood?\u201d he finished.</p><p>She sashayed forward, her every move a wicked invitation. \u201cYou upset my friend.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Okay. That wasn\u2019t what he was expecting. \u201cYou mean Callie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you didn\u2019t get the memo.\u201d He shoved the gun back in his holster. No sense asking for trouble. He couldn\u2019t shoot the female just because she pissed him off. Besides, it was more likely she would force him to put a bullet in his own head before he could squeeze off a round in her direction. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who upset her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the one who scared the hell out of her, but you upset her every time she\u2019s forced to work with you.\u201d</p><p>Upset her? How the hell could he ... ah. This time his smile was genuine.</p><p>So the lovely, frustratingly aloof diviner wasn\u2019t completely indifferent to him.</p><p>Thank god.</p><p>\u201cBecause I remind her that she\u2019s a woman?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cHow can that be a bad thing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you a \u2018freak\u2019 groupie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d She narrowed her gaze. \u201cWhat do you want from her?\u201d</p> <p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to read my mind to guess what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie might not be a virgin, but she\u2019s an innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>There was a startled pause before the female strolled forward, circling him like a predator sizing up her prey.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d she at last drawled. \u201cWhat secrets are you hiding, Sergeant O\u2019Conner?\u201d</p> <p>Duncan went rigid with fury. \u201cGet the fuck out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, but before she could continue her tormenting there was a prickle in the air and a misty shape began to form in the center of the room.</p><p>\u201cSerra,\u201d a soft voice chastised.</p><p>Astonishingly, the Queen Bitch was hastily stepping forward to perform a deep bow.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Inhera.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. The figure remained misty, making him assume that it was some sort of projected image. Like the TV on the far wall.</p> <p>Technology or magic?</p><p>Impossible to say.</p><p>\u201cPlease see that a room is prepared for our guest,\u201d Inhera commanded, the misty vision hinting at a female, although it was impossible to determine her features. \u201cThen return to me so we can continue your studies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt once,\u201d Serra instantly agreed, her tone deeply reverent. Then, the second the image flickered she turned to send Duncan a glare. \u201cO\u2019Conner?\u201d</p><p>He kicked his chin up a notch. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt Callie in any way, shape, or form and I\u2019ll give you nightmares that will make you scream.\u201d She smiled with an evil intent. \u201cLiterally.\u201d</p><p>She left the room with the fluid grace that most freaks seemed to possess, her heels clicking on the polished wood floor.</p><p>Once again alone, Duncan heaved a shaky sigh. Teleportation with tattooed Sentinels, mind-reading chicks in SMBD leather, projections of females that could appear and disappear, and a necro who made his blood run hot even when she was treating him as if she were cold as ice.</p> <p>\u201cMy da warned me to stay away from the freaks,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>The office of the Mave was designed for maximum impact.</p><p>Done in shades of black and white, it was lined with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and low leather chairs set opposite the heavy ebony desk. The floor was covered by a white carpet with a black geometric pattern. And the far wall was made entirely of glass to provide a stunning view of the formal rose gardens.</p><p>Not that the female currently seated behind the desk needed the traditional trappings to prove her authority.</p><p>The leader of the high-bloods barely looked thirty and was a stunning beauty with her smooth curtain of black hair and pale, oval face. But there was a thunderous power that shimmered in her storm gray eyes and a dignified calm that was oddly intimidating. And while the more daring men might covertly lust after the tall, slender body that was casually displayed in a pair of faded jeans and a cashmere sweater, it only took one glance at the birthmark on the upper curve of her breast that she deliberately exposed to make them treat her with respect.</p><p>The small mark in the shape of an eye proved that she was a born witch, and the brilliance of the shimmering emerald color revealed that her powers were off the charts. The darker the color, the greater her magic.</p><p>The fact she was also one of the most talented telepaths ever recorded only added to her considerable arsenal.</p><p>And her reputation.</p><p>Being called to the Mave\u2019s office had been known to make the most bad-ass Sentinels piss their pants.</p><p>Thankfully Callie had already had all the piss terrified out of her by her unexpected powwow with the stranger in the mind of a dead woman. Now she was just desperate for answers.</p><p>The Mave sat perfectly still, her classically beautiful face unreadable as she considered Callie\u2019s bizarre story.</p><p>\u201cYou say his eyes were clear?\u201d she at last asked, her slender fingers drumming a steady beat on the glossy desktop.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Callie shivered as she recalled the cold brilliance of the stranger\u2019s eyes. \u201cThey were faceted and shimmered like diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his hair was gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore silver, I think,\u201d she clarified, not entirely sure what might be relevant.</p><p>\u201cFrom age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain.\u201d Callie felt Fane\u2019s hand gently land on her shoulder. The warrior stood behind her chair, offering a silent support that she desperately needed. \u201cHis face looked mature, but it\u2019s impossible for me to guess his age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnusual.\u201d Tap, tap, tap went the finger.</p><p>Callie didn\u2019t know if that meant the Mave was troubled by what she was saying, or simply bored.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t leaving until she had some answers.</p><p>\u201cAnd his power ...\u201d She gave another shiver. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything like it.\u201d</p><p>Fane gave her shoulder a squeeze, his growing disapproval heating the air. Sentinels\u2019 body temperature naturally ran higher than others\u2019. And the heat spiked with their mood.</p><p>It gave a whole new meaning to a man being smoking hot in bed. Not that Callie knew from personal experience, but she\u2019d heard the rumors.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been over this a dozen times,\u201d he growled, his tone respectful\u2014barely. \u201cShe needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>Callie reached up to pat her guardian\u2019s hand, worried he was going to get himself tossed in the dungeons. And yes, there were dungeons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Fane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s right. You\u2019re weary and I need to do some research.\u201d She sent them both a warning gaze. \u201cFor now I want this kept strictly between us. Until I know more there\u2019s no point in allowing the gossips to get ahold of the story and cause an uproar.\u201d</p><p>Callie nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The Mave smoothly rose to her feet. \u201cRest for an hour or so and we\u2019ll speak again.\u201d</p><p>Callie was out of the chair before she even realized she was moving.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sergeant O\u2019Conner?\u201d Callie demanded.</p><p>A wry amusement shimmered in the smoke eyes. \u201cA very stubborn man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get rid of him if you want,\u201d Fane promptly offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, we must work with the authorities. Our\u201d\u2014the Mave hesitated as she searched for the proper word\u2014\u201crelationship is difficult enough without humans worrying that we\u2019re trying to hide a murderer. Besides, I have a few questions I must ask him.\u201d She headed toward the door leading to her private quarters, pausing long enough to glance over her shoulder, a mysterious smile on her lips as she looked directly at Callie. \u201cI\u2019ve had him taken to the guest quarters if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity,\u201d Fane muttered as the Mave left the office and closed the door.</p><p>Callie frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s a pity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping for the opportunity to kick his ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you dislike him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask foolish questions, Callie.\u201d He moved to stand directly in front of her, capturing her chin between his fingers as he studied the faint bruises beneath her eyes. \u201cWhat did the healer say?\u201d</p><p>Fane had insisted on carrying her directly to the healers, growling at anyone who came close to her. Including Duncan, who\u2019d been led off before she could say a word to him.</p><p>\u201cThere was evidence of pressure on my frontal lobe, but no damage.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cThey suspect the stranger was searching my mind.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes glittered with the promise of revenge. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip, disturbed by the mere thought of Fane coming up against the stranger who\u2019d stolen a young female\u2019s heart without leaving a trace. \u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA premonition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any talent for seeing the future, but I do know that whoever, or whatever, I encountered isn\u2019t done.\u201d A chill crawled down her spine. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more deaths.\u201d</p><p>His expression was as hard as granite. \u201cWe should go to the Tabuk.\u201d</p><p>The monastery that was tucked in the Himalayas was a safe house for high-bloods who needed a time-out from civilization. It was not only hidden from the norms, it was so off the grid that it couldn\u2019t be found by the usual technology.</p><p>She gently tugged free of his hold. If it was up to Fane she would be locked away for the rest of her life.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in danger.\u201d The magnificent swirls and arcs of his tattoos appeared even more vivid against his skin as his muscles clenched with frustration. \u201cThis creature knows you. He\u2019s been inside your head. I won\u2019t allow you to be the next victim.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a brow. \u201cAllow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am your protector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate your dedication, Fane,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut if he had wanted me dead he could already have killed me.\u201d</p><p>Fane wasn\u2019t impressed with her logic. \u201cMaybe he likes the hunt.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue. She sensed the predatory nature of the stranger. But who or what it was hunting remained a mystery.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I can\u2019t leave. I\u2019m the only one who can identify the man.\u201d</p><p>The Sentinel scowled. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to identify him if you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>She reached to brush her fingers down the rigid muscles of his forearm. \u201cFane, with this man\u2019s power there\u2019s nowhere I would be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>She felt a familiar tide of affection for this man who\u2019d committed his life to keeping her safe. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she assured him, then dropped her hand when his cell phone beeped. It didn\u2019t take a genius to know who was trying to contact him. Fane lacked the sort of friends who would call him just to chat. \u201cWolfe?\u201d she asked as he pulled the phone from his pocket with a soft curse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for me to report.\u201d</p><p>Callie grimaced. Wolfe was the Tagos, the current leader of the Sentinels, and the only man scarier than Fane.</p><p>An amazing accomplishment.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to cause a riot,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou know how he hates to be kept out of the loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with the Tagos.\u201d He sent her a warning glare. \u201cYou ... be careful.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a teasing smile, drawing her finger over the middle of her chest. \u201cCross my heart.\u201d</p><p>With a shake of his head, he left the office.</p><p>Callie waited. No point in leaving until she was certain Fane was out of sight. If he knew she didn\u2019t intend to return directly to her apartment, he would throw her over his shoulder and carry her there.</p> <p>At last she slipped from the room and headed down the white corridor, which was painted pink by the encroaching dusk. The overhead skylights offered a perfect view of the sky, despite the magical dome that surrounded the compound. From the outside the spell hid Valhalla from prying eyes, but from the inside it was invisible.</p><p>She turned the corner, ignoring the gleaming silver elevators that would take her to her apartment.</p><p>Valhalla was a vast complex that sprawled over several thousand acres, with a number of workshops, garages, barns, a school, and a fully equipped hospital. The central building was constructed in the shape of a pentagon with a large inner courtyard.</p><p>Most people never saw beyond the official offices on the main floor or the formal reception rooms, although a small number were allowed the rare honor of being given guest rooms if their visit was expected to last more than a few hours. Certainly no one was allowed to explore the nine levels of private quarters and secret labs that were dug deep into the earth.</p><p>Ignoring the speculative glances from the occasional high-blood she passed, she followed the corridor until she took another turn. This one into the guest quarters.</p><p>Her steps slowed as she suddenly realized that she didn\u2019t know what the hell she was doing.</p> <p>Well, she knew that she didn\u2019t want to return to her empty apartment.</p><p>And that she had an odd compulsion to speak with the aggravating, sinfully sexy human cop.</p><p>But beyond that ... what was the plan?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she intended to march up to Duncan O\u2019Conner\u2019s door and start pounding. And she could hardly spend hours walking up and down the hallway, could she?</p><p>Busy mulling the wisdom of turning around and heading to her apartment, fate took the choice out of her hands as the door just down the corridor was yanked open and the man who\u2019d been gnawing at the edge of her thoughts since they\u2019d arrived at Valhalla stepped out of his rooms.</p><p>She came to a halt, her brows arching as he wandered in an absent pattern, his arm lifted over his head and his head tilted back.</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>His head snapped down as he realized he wasn\u2019t alone, his hand shifting to reveal the cell phone tucked in his palm.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to find a damned signal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pointed toward the skylight that offered a view of the darkening sky, reminding him of the invisible spell that was wrapped around the area. \u201cCell phones don\u2019t work at Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he muttered, shoving the phone into the front pocket of his jeans even as he prowled toward her, his hazel eyes studying her with an unnerving intensity.</p><p>\u201cThere should be a landline in your rooms,\u201d she said, barely resisting the urge to back away. She didn\u2019t know what it was with this man. He fascinated her even as he made her as twitchy as a deer caught in headlights. \u201cOr if it\u2019s an emergency the Mave can send a telepathic message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>His husky growl brushed over her skin like a physical caress. She shivered. Oh god. This was crazy.</p><p>She licked her dry lips. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hand lifted to cup her cheek, his brows drawing together as his piercing gaze seared over her face. Belatedly she remembered that she\u2019d left her glasses in the Mave\u2019s office. \u201cStay,\u201d he husked.</p><p>She stilled, wondering what he saw. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have shadows.\u201d His finger brushed the fragile skin below her eyes. His expression was grim, but his touch was gentle. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The healers took care of the damage.\u201d</p><p>His expression only hardened. \u201cDo you know who ... or what ... it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThe Mave will want to speak with you. She has some questions.\u201d</p><p>His finger stroked down her cheek to trace the lower curve of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes abruptly narrowed at the reminder. \u201cYes, you\u2019ve made your suspicions of our intent to protect a killer very clear.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t apologize. She doubted he knew how.</p><p>\u201cAt least tell me that your Mave has some way to make sure the bastard can\u2019t get inside your head.\u201d</p><p>Her skin tingled beneath his light caress, as if every nerve ending was being set on fire.</p><p>\u201cNo one can say for sure, but I suspect his powers are similar to a diviner\u2019s, not a telepath\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. The golden rule of every high-blood was never to discuss mutant powers with the norms. Not only did it give them another reason to fear the freaks, but talking about a person\u2019s talent was like talking about sex.</p><p>Way too intimate to be shared with just anyone.</p><p>But Duncan\u2019s position as a cop meant he had greater access to the secrets of Valhalla than most.</p><p>And more importantly, she suspected that he had a few secrets of his own.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll be able to touch my mind unless I\u2019m using my powers to enter the memories of the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re officially off duty.\u201d</p><p>Briefly lost in the gold-flecked hazel of his eyes, it took a beat for Callie to realize she\u2019d just been given an order.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>Pulling away from his lingering touch, she planted her hands on her hips. \u201cNot your call, Sergeant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d he insisted, the muscle in his jaw bulging with frustration. \u201cAnd I can make it my call. All it takes is one word whispered into the ear of the Head of Justice.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he didn\u2019t just go there, did he?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about you,\u201d he shot back. \u201cIf word gets out there was some sort of interference during your divining, then any info you manage to get will be tossed out of court.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. What the hell had she been thinking? She should have gone straight to her apartment. She could have been relaxing in a hot bubble bath with a nice glass of Chardonnay. Instead she was fighting the urge to kick this aggravating man in the nuts.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m off duty.\u201d She turned on her heel, marching back down the hallway. \u201cWhich means that we have nothing left to discuss.\u201d</p><p>With a speed worthy of a Sentinel, Duncan had moved to block her path.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your guard dog?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the unexpected question. \u201cIf you\u2019re referring to Fane, he\u2019s also off duty.\u201d</p><p>A sinful smile curved his lips as he reached forward to grasp her wrist and tugged her back down the hall.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Duncan had never been a Zen sort of guy.</p><p>His temper ran hot, his foot was perpetually stuck in his mouth, and he had all the charm of a pissed-off badger. But he was smart enough to know when he was being a jackass.</p><p>There\u2019d been no need to bark out orders like he was at the station house dealing with the usual dregs of society. Callie was an intelligent, reasonable female who would already have realized that she couldn\u2019t be called in on police cases. Not when there was some stranger lurking in the minds of the dead.</p><p>Unfortunately a dark fear that he\u2019d never felt before had roared through him with enough force to knock his brain off-line, leaving him at the mercy of his most primitive male instincts.</p><p>Never a good thing.</p><p>Now it was time for damage control.</p><p>And if he hadn\u2019t truly screwed this up ... maybe a chance to catch a glimpse of the woman beneath the diviner.</p><p>Reaching the door to his rooms, he pushed it open and pulled Callie over the threshold, getting her far enough inside to close the door before she was whirling to send him a wary scowl.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak in private.\u201d</p><p>Duncan watched as her gaze shifted to the small but tidy living room that was furnished with a pale green couch and matching chairs. There was a large window that offered a view of the surrounding countryside and a built-in kitchen painted a cheery yellow. He assumed the connecting door led to a bedroom, but he hadn\u2019t had time to check it out.</p><p>\u201cWe have no need for privacy,\u201d she at last muttered.</p><p>He deliberately leaned against the door, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cAfraid, Callie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy morals might be questionable, my manners are often compared to a rabid pit bull, but I would never hurt you, Callie Brown.\u201d He held her wary gaze, his expression somber. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll kill anyone who tries.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, clearly caught off guard by the lethal edge in his voice. And she wasn\u2019t alone, he wryly acknowledged. This female brought out a side of him he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a thing for freaks?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cOnly one.\u201d</p><p>Blink, blink. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His lungs tightened at the sight of the gemstone eyes glittering in the overhead light. Oh man. With those eyes and her flame-kissed hair she reminded him of the birds his ma used to take him to see in the zoo.</p><p>Brilliant. Exotic. And so fucking fragile.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d he asked in a distracted voice.</p><p>\u201cYou barely know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething I intend to correct.\u201d He straightened, catching a whiff of her sweet, feminine scent. Instantly he was hard. As if the enticing aroma had a direct connection to his cock. \u201cDo I need to lock the door?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took a step backward. \u201cOnly if you intend to hold me prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy charm is all I need to hold you prisoner,\u201d he said with a smug smile. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned with Fane charging in here to rip off my balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he decides to rip off your balls a locked door isn\u2019t going to stop him,\u201d she informed him, not appearing particularly worried at the fate of his dangly bits.</p> <p>\u201cNot comforting.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s only my guardian when I\u2019m traveling away from Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d A mysterious smile curved her lips. The sort of smile that should make a sane man run in the opposite direction. \u201cI\u2019m confident that someone else will soon convince him.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. He strolled forward, pleased by the thought of Fane being distracted by someone other than Callie.</p> <p>\u201cShould I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A nervous color touched her cheeks as she abruptly turned to pace toward the window. \u201cAre you satisfied with your rooms?\u201d</p><p>With a snort he followed in her wake, careful not to crowd her. He might enjoy poking at her shell of composure, but he never wanted her to feel threatened.</p><p>Not by him.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ask that question if you\u2019d ever seen my apartment,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy ex-wife was smart enough to hire a barracuda for a lawyer. She ended up with the house, the larger chunk of my paycheck, and the dog.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cOh, and the delivery man, who she married yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, the gemstone gaze studying him with open curiosity. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cA shitty apartment and a case of perfectly aged whiskey that I polished off last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>He never discussed his ex-wife. And he sure the hell didn\u2019t talk about the wracking guilt he felt at the painful demise of his marriage. But he needed Callie to understand that he wasn\u2019t living in the past. That he might have regrets, but deep inside he was relieved that Susan had moved on. Which, of course, made him a true ass.</p><p>Why was it important that she know? A question to be considered ... never.</p><p>Yeah, never seemed perfect.</p> <p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d she softly prompted.</p><p>\u201cSusan was a decent woman who got tired of waiting for me to be a husband instead of a cop,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give her what she needed so she found someone who could.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her expression thankfully free of censure. \u201cSo you\u2019re one of those men who live for their jobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a cop is who I am.\u201d Truer words had never been spoken. \u201cI can\u2019t leave it at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can.\u201d</p><p>He risked moving closer, laying a hand on her shoulder so he could gently turn her to face him. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spend a lot of time in very bad places. It can\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><p>He felt her stiffen at his question, as if no one had ever considered the cost of her gift. Strange considering she spent the last hideous moments in the mind of a victim watching a murder unfold in Technicolor.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, a shadow dimming the brilliance of her eyes. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept over the pale perfection of her face. \u201cDo you have nightmares?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause a man who\u2019s had as many sleepless nights as I have recognizes the symptoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat symptoms?\u201d</p><p>His hand trailed down the line of her arm until he could circle her tiny wrist with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cFor all your pretense of serenity you\u2019re all hard angles and fragile edges.\u201d He lifted her hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to the center of her palm. \u201cOne day I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to shatter.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Nightmares ...</p><p>Callie forgot to breathe as she allowed his words to seep through her fierce barriers.</p><p>He understood.</p><p>He truly, truly understood.</p><p>How odd.</p><p>She was surrounded by high-bloods, including three fellow diviners, and they all knew precisely what she did. But not one had ever asked her if she had nightmares.</p><p>Oh, it wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t care. The people of Valhalla were her family and they loved her. Not to mention the fact they would fight to the death for her.</p><p>But high-bloods were excessively protective of each other\u2019s privacy. A much needed rule considering that many of them were psychics, telepaths, and a rare few empaths. They would never press her to share more than she was willing.</p><p>But this man ... this supposed norm ... had peered deep in her eyes and seen far too much.</p><p>Not only seen, but understood.</p><p>She ignored the warnings in the back of her mind. She already knew that his ability to pierce through her walls of protection was dangerous. Almost as dangerous as the jolts of excitement from the press of his lips to her palm.</p><p>Instead, she squarely met his knowing gaze. \u201cHow do you deal with the nightmares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhiskey.\u201d His lips drifted to her inner wrist. \u201cWork.\u201d His tongue pressed against her thundering pulse. \u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, trying to pretend his touch wasn\u2019t setting her on fire.</p><p>\u201cPredictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a norm,\u201d he murmured, a teasing hint of gold in his hazel eyes. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been watching him so closely she would never have noticed his sudden tension.</p><p>\u201cAm I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA norm?\u201d</p><p>He nipped the pad of her thumb, his gaze watchful. \u201cWhat are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... see more than most humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a cop,\u201d he smoothly retorted. Too smoothly. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to see what other people don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She didn\u2019t try to hide her disbelief. \u201cI suspect there\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>Without warning his arms were wrapped around her waist and she was tugged against his hard frame. He lowered his head until they were nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cBecome my lover and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Logically, she knew he was trying to distract her. Physically, she didn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>White-hot excitement curled through the pit of her stomach, searing away her usual discomfort with allowing anyone to touch her beyond her most intimate friends.</p><p>It was ... terrifying, exhilarating. Glorious.</p><p>\u201cBlackmail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncentive.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a teasing brow. \u201cNot so certain of those O\u2019Conner charms you claimed would imprison me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t just been my nightmares that are keeping me up at night, sweet Callie.\u201d He placed her hand flat against the rapid beat of his heart, his breath brushing her cheek. \u201cYou share part of the blame.\u201d</p><p>She quivered even as she tried to pretend that his touch wasn\u2019t magic.</p><p>\u201cDoes that line actually work?\u201d</p><p>He traced a line of kisses to the corner of her mouth. \u201cFor once it isn\u2019t a line.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a shallow breath. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>He splayed his hands at her lower back, pressing her against his hardening cock.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I can\u2019t get you out of my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you want sex?\u201d</p><p>His sharp laugh ricocheted off the walls. \u201cThat would be the preferable explanation.\u201d</p><p>She tilted back her head to meet his brooding survey. \u201cAs opposed to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet another question I don\u2019t intend to consider,\u201d he muttered, his hand lifting to lightly cup her cheek. \u201cWere your eyes this color when you were born?\u201d</p><p>Wow. She struggled to follow his conversational leapfrog. Duncan O\u2019Conner clearly had a narrow list of subjects he was willing to discuss.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI assume they were the reason my parents abandoned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were abandoned?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not that uncommon. People expect to have a child who\u2019s exactly like them. They don\u2019t know how to handle a mutant.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened, as if he were angered by her answer.</p><p>\u201cPeople can be shitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t feel sorry for your parents, but I do.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, wondering if she\u2019d heard him right. Few among the high-bloods felt sympathy for the families who abandoned their own children. No matter how hard it might be to accept a freak.</p><p>\u201cFeel sorry for them?\u201d</p><p>His thumb stroked her cheek, as if fascinated by the texture of her skin.</p><p>\u201cThey have a beautiful, intelligent, outrageously sexy daughter who uses her gifts to make the world a better place.\u201d He lowered his head to speak directly into her ear. \u201cBut they\u2019ll never know you and that\u2019s their very great loss.\u201d</p><p>Desire, along with a far more dangerous sensation, spread through her until she feared she might melt into a puddle of need at his feet. Instinctively she lifted her arms to wrap them around his neck.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you do have a small smidgeon of charm,\u201d she grudgingly admitted.</p><p>The hazel eyes smoldered with pure sin. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing small about me, Callie.\u201d He tilted his hips forward, as if she\u2019d somehow missed the rigid length of his arousal pressing against her lower stomach. \u201cLet me prove it.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in his warm, sexy scent. She\u2019d never noticed the smell of a man before.</p><p>Of course, there were a lot of things about Duncan she noticed. The way his ass perfectly filled out his jeans. The stubborn line of his jaw that was usually shadowed by a hint of golden beard. The utter focus on his goal. Whether it was finding the bad guy, or making her tremble in anticipation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA friend warned me that if a man has to brag about his size it\u2019s because he knows it\u2019s going to be a disappointment,\u201d she murmured, her fingers teasing the hair at his nape.</p><p>\u201cLet me take a stab in the dark,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cWas this friend named Serra?\u201d</p><p>Callie made a sound of astonishment. \u201cYou know her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur paths have crossed.\u201d His lips found an exquisitely tender spot just below her ear. \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>She arched against the welcome hardness of his body, strangely pleased he didn\u2019t have the usual male reaction to her dearest friend.</p><p>\u201cMost men find her irresistible.\u201d</p><p>He kissed down the curve of her throat, the rasp of his whiskers making her tremble in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a man-eater.\u201d</p> <p>It was growing difficult to think. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he assured her, his hand gripping the back of her neck, his tongue doing wicked things as it traced the bodice of her stretchy top. \u201cThe only opinion I care about is yours.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back, offering Duncan greater access. He seemed to know what he was doing. Why interfere?</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never touched such soft skin,\u201d he rasped, his lips lingering on the gentle swell of her breast. \u201cIt\u2019s like heated satin.\u201d</p><p>Her nipples tightened, the tingles of excitement becoming a sharp-edged hunger that made her hesitate.</p> <p>Okay. This was spiraling out of control way too fast.</p><p>And one of the first things all high-bloods learned was that bad things happened when they let themselves be out of control.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d she abruptly demanded.</p><p>\u201cA kiss. That\u2019s all.\u201d He shifted to nibble her bottom lip. \u201cJust a kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Callie. I won\u2019t ever ask for more than you\u2019re willing to give.\u201d</p><p>Trust? Fane would tell her that she was crazy. That she couldn\u2019t trust anyone.</p><p>Especially not a norm who all but accused the Mave of being willing to harbor a murderer.</p> <p>But just for a few minutes she didn\u2019t want to be a necromancer who was feared and even hated by others. Or the shy woman who often faded into the shadows.</p><p>And more importantly, she wanted to kiss this man.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The word had barely formed before he covered her lips in a kiss that seared her to the tips of her toes.</p><p>Oh ... baby.</p><p>Serra\u2019s three-inch heels clicked against the floor of the hallway as she walked past the wide doors to the dining hall and then the art center.</p><p>As always the two floors directly beneath the main structure were crowded with high-bloods. The shared area was a place to relax and mingle. Or, for those who were of a more solitary nature, there was a vast library and a Japanese rock garden.</p><p>And for the elusive Sentinels, there was a fully equipped gym and attached firing range that allowed them to hone their skills to a lethal edge, while releasing the aggression that was so much a part of their nature.</p><p>And that\u2019s where she was headed.</p><p>Indifferent to the male, and a few female, gazes that followed her elegant body, shown to lush advantage in the black leather pants and red bustier, she gave a toss of her long, raven hair.</p><p>She was far more interested in the tall, lean man storming away from the gym with a thunderous scowl.</p><p>Even at a distance, Wolfe, the current Tagos and leader of all Sentinels, looked like a dangerous predator.</p><p>He was a hunter rather than a guardian like Fane, which meant he had no magic and no tattoos, but anyone stupid enough to think he\u2019d earned his position by being a slick politician was quickly taught the error of their ways.</p><p>He was faster, stronger, and more ruthless than any other warrior. He was also a cunning bastard who could charm the birds from the trees when it suited his purpose. And of course, he wasn\u2019t above using his potent sexual appeal to manipulate others.</p><p>With copper skin and eyes that were as black as ebony, he resembled an ancient Egyptian deity. He had a proud, hawkish nose and prominent cheekbones. His dark brows were heavy and his lips carved along generous lines. It was a striking face rather than handsome and so fiercely masculine that some women found it intimidating.</p><p>Just as striking was the glossy dark hair that brushed his shoulders with a startling streak of silver that started at his right temple. It was rumored that he\u2019d been touched by the devil when he was in the cradle. Something he never bothered to deny.</p><p>Hanging back until he\u2019d continued his ill-tempered stomping in the opposite direction, Serra headed into the gym. She might be fearless, but no one crossed paths with a rabid Wolfe.</p><p>Bypassing the mats and the boxing ring, she entered the weight room, honing in on her prey with practiced skill.</p><p>Too practiced, she wryly conceded, catching sight of Fane bench-pressing enough weight to crush most men.</p><p>How long had she been stalking this stoic, aloof Sentinel?</p><p>It seemed like an eternity.</p><p>Halting next to the stack of weights, she admired the ripple of muscle as Fane seamlessly lifted the massive weights in a smooth rhythm.</p><p>God Almighty. He was a masterpiece.</p><p>From the top of his bald head to the tip of his bare toes he was hard, chiseled perfection. As if he\u2019d been created by the hand of Michelangelo. Was it any wonder he\u2019d managed to capture her jaded interest?</p><p>And there was the added bonus of his sacred tattooing. The powerful spells made it impossible for her to read his mind, even by accident.</p><p>A necessary barrier for any psychic. Nothing like being in the moment and realizing your partner was fantasizing about another woman.</p><p>Yeah ... real turn-off.</p><p>Of course, the whole lack of high-def peekaboos into his mind wasn\u2019t all good.</p><p>The man kept his emotions locked down as if they were some precious commodity that could only be doled out in sparse measure.</p><p>His conversations were just as meager. A yes. A no. And an occasional grunt if she was lucky.</p><p>There\u2019d been times when she would have given her favorite Fendi boots just for a glimpse of what was going on behind the grim visage.</p><p>\u201cI just saw Wolfe stomping off,\u201d she said as Fane continued with his self-imposed task, ignoring her arrival despite the fact he would have sensed her presence the minute she entered the gym.</p><p>Aggravating asshole.</p><p>Good thing he was so edible.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not happy that I\u2019ve been forbidden to answer his questions,\u201d Fane said, at least speaking to her.</p><p>Sometimes he went into a deep trance that allowed him to block out everything but what he wanted to concentrate on.</p><p>A trick he was taught by the monks. As well as how to kill a man in three seconds flat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping he doesn\u2019t plan on confronting the Mave in his current mood,\u201d she murmured. The only person not afraid of Wolfe when he was on the warpath was the Mave.</p><p>She might turn him into a toad if he went charging into her office half cocked.</p><p>\u201cWolfe doesn\u2019t always choose the path of wisdom,\u201d Fane pointed out.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cFew of us do.\u201d No answer. Okay, new subject. \u201cHow\u2019s Callie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier to ask her that question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went by her apartment but she wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Clank. The weights were slammed onto the rack behind his head. Flowing to his feet, Fane grabbed a towel to wipe his bare chest, clearly determined to go in search of his missing chick. \u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>Serra felt the familiar irritation scour through her body. She adored Callie. They were, in fact, as close as sisters.</p><p>But the knowledge that this man was bound to the beautiful diviner on a level so deep it could never be broken was a constant source of frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t her babysitter, Fane,\u201d she said in sour tones. \u201cShe\u2019s allowed to travel around Valhalla without asking your permission.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes held an unspoken censor. \u201cShe\u2019s mine to protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours to protect or just yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow isn\u2019t the time for this conversation.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t press. She didn\u2019t need to be a psychic to know something was going on. Something bad. And that Fane would be hypercrazy\u2014well, even more hypercrazy than usual\u2014with his need to keep Callie safe.</p><p>But she was a female. Which meant she was allowed to be completely illogical when it came to the man she wanted.</p><p>Hell, it was her duty.</p><p>\u201cWhen will be the time?\u201d</p><p>His forbidding expression never altered. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I decide not to wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you, Serra.\u201d</p><p>The soft, unyielding response stole her thunder.</p><p>Dammit. Why couldn\u2019t he at least get mad like any normal man? A good shouting match was just what she needed to release the resentment that had reached a boiling level.</p><p>Instead she ran face first into a wall of truth. Never fun.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve always been brutally honest,\u201d she admitted, her lips twisting in a self-derisive smile.</p><p>He frowned, tossing aside the towel. \u201cYou can have any man you desire.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze compulsively slid over the broad chest, then down to the six-pack that begged to be licked.</p><p>\u201cObviously not any man,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cSerra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She held up a pleading hand. \u201cIt\u2019s so ... fucking tragic.\u201d Taking a step back, she folded her arms over her stomach in an unconsciously defensive gesture. \u201cAt least tell me that Callie is okay.\u201d</p><p>Fane hesitated, as if wrestling with some inner demon. Then, at last, he gave a dip of his head. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. She didn\u2019t expect him to share. Even routine duties the Sentinels performed were kept top secret. But her curiosity was making her nuts. She was desperate to know what was going on.</p><p>\u201cIt must have something to do with Callie\u2019s trip into the memories of the dead woman,\u201d she reasoned out loud. \u201cOtherwise the cop would never have been allowed into Valhalla.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a speed that was always unnerving, Fane was standing directly in front of her, the sudden heat in the air warning that she was at last provoking a reaction.</p><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t the one she wanted.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game, Serra. The Mave has taken personal command of the ... situation,\u201d he growled. \u201cShe won\u2019t be forgiving if she discovers you\u2019re poking your nose into her business.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time she\u2019d pissed off the higher powers.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s such a cute nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot cute,\u201d he denied in gruff tones, his finger lightly tracing the line of her nose. \u201cForceful. Proud. Unique. I wouldn\u2019t want to see it hurt.\u201d</p><p>Silence. And shock. And a whole lot of what-the-hell as Fane belatedly jerked his hand back.</p><p>It was a toss-up which of them was more astonished by his display of affection, but it was Serra who spoke first.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you care?\u201d she tried to tease, although the words came out as a croak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always cared,\u201d he said, crawling back behind his emotional no-go zone as he reached to pull on a cammo tee. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019ve told you to find a man who can offer you the relationship that you deserve.\u201d</p><p>Fury burned through her. \u201cDamn you, Fane, you\u2019re not my guardian,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t meet her glare. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop trying to protect me.\u201d</p><p>Afraid she might do something like punch him\u2014or worse ... kiss him\u2014Serra turned on her heel and stomped away.</p> <p>She was going to find out what Callie had gotten herself into.</p><p>One way or another.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Rocking a Hogwarts vibe, the lakefront house on the outskirts of Kansas City had over twenty rooms built among the sprawling wings and towering turrets.</p><p>Most people assumed that a reclusive rock star lived behind the high gates and armed security that patrolled the massive grounds. That or a gunrunner.</p><p>The last thing they would have expected was a professor.</p><p>Well, at least he called himself a professor.</p><p>Dr. Zakary had appeared in Kansas City eight months before, moving into the secluded mansion in the middle of the night. No one in the neighborhood had seen him, although if they\u2019d been looking they might have caught sight of the stretch limo that pulled between the heavy gates before disappearing into the five-car garage.</p> <p>Which meant, of course, they were eaten up with curiosity.</p><p>Not that Zak gave a shit. The nosy neighbors were the least of his concern.</p><p>Sitting in the library that was surrounded by shelves that towered two stories beneath the alcove ceiling, he studied the ancient scroll that was carefully stretched on the cherry-wood desk.</p><p>Light from the overhead chandelier spilled over his silver hair, which he\u2019d left loose to frame his lean, darkly bronzed face, and shimmered in his diamond eyes.</p><p>Eyes that marked him as different despite his deliberate choice of a black turtleneck sweater and silk slacks.</p><p>Of course, even if he kept his eyes covered he would never pass as a norm.</p><p>Not when his powers filled the air with a constant chill.</p><p>Few people could remain in the same room with him without being battered by the urge to flee. Not if they had a functioning brain.</p><p>In the middle of trying to decipher a particularly difficult passage, Zak reached for the Baccarat crystal glass that was filled with a priceless cognac.</p><p>He basked in the warm glow that slid down his throat, setting it aside as a knock on the door interrupted his blessed silence.</p><p>\u201cEnter,\u201d he called, resting back in his leather chair as the young, burly man hesitantly stepped into the room.</p><p>Stanley York had been released from jail less than a year before and anxious for a quick influx of cash. Which meant he was willing to do anything with no questions asked.</p><p>Wearing faded jeans and a sleeveless tee, his features were blunt with dark, cunning eyes and his hair buzzed to his skull. He had several tattoos, but none of them were magical. A ridiculous waste of ink.</p><p>Always edgy in Zak\u2019s presence, the ex-con lingered near the open door, his gaze darting around the room as if sensing unseen eyes. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have news?\u201d Zak asked in a soft, accented voice.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The henchman glanced toward Zak without meeting his gaze. For all his tough-guy attitude, he was as spineless as everyone else beneath Zak\u2019s diamond stare. \u201cTony retrieved the ... bundle.\u201d</p><p>Zak tapped a slender finger on the edge of the desk, his flawless features impossible to read. \u201cHe packed it precisely as I told him to?\u201d</p><p>The man grimaced. \u201cI promise he followed your directions as if his life depended on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise choice,\u201d Zak murmured.</p><p>It was amazing how eager his servants were to please him after witnessing him remove the heart of a fellow servant who was unfortunate enough to have returned to the house without their latest package.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Stanley cleared his throat. \u201cHe should be here in two hours. Maybe less, depending on the traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t do anything that would attract the attention of the authorities.\u201d His voice remained soft. Only a bully needed to shout and bluster. Zak led with pure, unrelenting fear. Far more efficient. \u201cI will be excessively displeased if my name appears in a police report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pro at avoiding the authorities. Everything\u2019s under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better pray that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Stanley paled to an interesting shade of gray. \u201cYes, professor.\u201d His hands twitched, as if he didn\u2019t know quite what to do with them. \u201cWill there be anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know the minute Tony arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Shuffling backward, Stanley shut the door before beating a hasty retreat back to the servants\u2019 quarters.</p><p>Zak reached for his glass, draining the cognac as he waited for the shadow to detach from the far bookshelf, revealing a female form.</p><p>He\u2019d sensed Anya\u2019s presence for the past half hour, but he\u2019d been in no mood to deal with her.</p><p>Now he accepted that she wasn\u2019t going to leave him in peace until she\u2019d had her say.</p><p>\u201cThugs,\u201d she muttered in disgust.</p><p>He set aside his glass, his gaze indifferently flicking over the tight black dress that revealed more than it concealed. With her long red hair flowing down her back in a shimmering river of fire, the witch was a fantasy come to life.</p><p>Not that he was in the mood to appreciate her beauty. Unlike most men he wasn\u2019t controlled by his cock.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but every general needs a few expendable soldiers to do the grunt work,\u201d he reminded his companion.</p><p>\u201cA pity they have to be so stupid.\u201d She halted next to the desk, the scent of herbs and blood clinging to her. A sure indication she\u2019d been in her rooms brewing up some concoction or another. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely their fault the body was found by the authorities.\u201d</p><p>Zak steepled his fingers beneath his chin. He didn\u2019t need the reminder.</p><p>He\u2019d been furious when his servant had returned to the house without the female that Zak had personally selected. That didn\u2019t mean, however, he was prepared to accept defeat.</p><p>\u201cCharles paid for his mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zak narrowed his eyes as the words deliberately trailed away. \u201cSay what you have to say, Anya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have chosen another female.\u201d She was the only creature in the world with the nerve to lecture him, although her tone was carefully devoid of censure. \u201cIt\u2019s too risky to take the body from the police morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took us twenty years to track down Calso and another six months trying to find a way past his security.\u201d He curled his lips in disgust. \u201cDid you want to throw it all away because you have cold feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot cold feet,\u201d she denied in petulant tones. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to be happy if we\u2019re forced to move again.\u201d</p><p>With a deliberate motion, Zak pushed himself out of the chair, the swirl of his power tugging on Anya\u2019s hair in icy warning.</p><p>The witch had saved his life when he\u2019d been burning on the stake. She was also the one who\u2019d managed to stumble across the means for his ultimate triumph.</p><p>But he\u2019d been born during a time when only the strong survived and he didn\u2019t believe in democracies.</p><p>He was in charge.</p><p>Which meant he didn\u2019t confess just whom he\u2019d encountered while he was in Leah\u2019s mind. Or that he\u2019d all but thrown down the gauntlet to those fools who cowered behind the walls of Valhalla.</p><p>He was done waiting for his unjust rewards.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no more running.\u201d</p><p>Belatedly realizing she\u2019d crossed a dangerous line, Anya took a step backward. \u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she hastily purred, lacing her words with a spell of soothing. As if her magic could actually sway a man with his powers. \u201cSoon you will have endless followers who will be worthy of your greatness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have promised for the past\u2014\u201d He deliberately paused. \u201cHow long has it been, Anya?\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened. \u201cNearly three hundred years.\u201d</p><p>Zak grimaced. He had a vivid memory of the night he\u2019d been captured by the local villagers and burned at the stake. Hard not to. It played and replayed every night. Like his nightmares were stuck on one channel.</p><p>The next hundred years had been spent in a protective cocoon of magic Anya had wrapped around his burnt body that had barely clung to life, followed by another tedious century of regenerating his physical form. Time that was fuzzy in his memories.</p><p>Thank the gods.</p><p>The past hundred years had been devoted to restoring his former powers. And more importantly, to locating the key to unlocking the ancient secrets to his ultimate destiny.</p><p>\u201cMy patience is at an end,\u201d he informed the witch.</p><p>\u201cI understand, I truly do, but our enemies are searching for you,\u201d Anya attempted to soothe. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous to draw such attention to yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zak stepped forward, the overhead light catching in his faceted eyes until they shimmered with blinding glitter that filled the room.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you want me to wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you taking unnecessary risks.\u201d Her chin tilted. \u201cI have devoted my life to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have devoted your life to the hope that I will make you a queen.\u201d</p><p>He watched her shrug. \u201cSo what?

You aren\u2019t the only means of taking me where I need to go.\u201d He smiled. \u201cUnderstood?\u201d</p> <p>The very gentleness of his threat made Anya grasp the small amulet hung around her neck even as she hurried toward the door.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they say,\u201d he murmured toward her retreating back.</p><p>Duncan had done some stupid things in his life.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d done stupid on a spectacular level.</p><p>There was the time he\u2019d emptied his savings account to buy a piece of shit sports car that died before he got it out of the driveway.</p> <p>The night he\u2019d chased a perp into gang territory and had the crap beaten out of him.</p><p>The day he decided to swing by home to surprise Susan only to find her enjoying a little afternoon delight in their bed.</p><p>And ten minutes ago when he\u2019d promised Callie all he wanted was a kiss.</p><p>Anyone who knew him realized that he had impulse control problems.</p><p>Like a five-year-old, he never believed in deferring pleasure when he could have immediate satisfaction.</p><p>But Callie had naively accepted his promise, melting into his arms with such trust he couldn\u2019t possibly take advantage of her.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Grimly shackling his desire that thundered through his rigid body, Duncan concentrated on the intoxicating taste of Callie\u2019s lips. Until this minute he\u2019d considered kissing a necessary step to getting a woman naked beneath him. It might be enjoyable, but only because it led to the ultimate destination.</p> <p>He\u2019d never truly appreciated the pleasure in simply ... smooching.</p><p>Now he savored every slow brush of their mouths. The wet heat when he dipped his tongue between her lips. Her shudder when he spread tiny caresses over her upturned face.</p><p>Cupping her nape with one hand, he allowed the other to stroke through the silken strands of her hair. It was perfect for this woman. Soft, yet with a spunky fire that would always keep a man in place.</p><p>At least any man fortunate enough to earn a place in her secluded world.</p><p>The reminder that he would soon be returning to his life of murders, sleepless nights, and empty apartments while this extraordinary woman remained hidden behind the magic of Valhalla had him fusing their lips with a kiss that bordered on desperation.</p><p>She returned the heat and fury for a blissful second, then with a faint frown she pulled back to study his brooding expression.</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wondered for so long what you taste like,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Her tongue peeked out to touch her swollen lips in an unconscious gesture that made him groan in agony.</p><p>He might have developed a sudden addiction to sweet Callie-kisses, but that didn\u2019t mean his cock was happy to be all revved up with no place to go.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the verdict?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDanger.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, the stunning gemstone eyes shimmering with an inner glow.</p><p>God ... they were glorious.</p><p>Mesmerizing.</p><p>\u201cI taste of danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. If she\u2019d been any other woman he would never have offered her such a powerful weapon. History had taught him that women, even good women, enjoyed holding the whip if a man was foolish enough to put it in her hand.</p><p>And knowing that a man was willing to give anything, pay any price, to have a female in his bed was one hell of a whip.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDo you always speak in riddles?\u201d</p><p>His eyes lowered to her lips. \u201cI\u2019d rather not be speaking at all.\u201d</p><p>A blush stained her cheeks, but even as his gut clenched with anticipation there was a sharp rap on the door.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d he snapped, his gaze never shifting from the invitation of her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou have a call.\u201d A male voice floated through the wooden barrier.</p><p>\u201cTake a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan, it could be important,\u201d Callie chided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your chief,\u201d the voice said with an unmistakable hint of satisfaction at the untimely interruption. A friend of Fane\u2019s or just another male anxious to be with Callie? \u201cShe says it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Duncan dropped his arms and stepped back. If Molinari was calling then it had to be important.</p><p>Which meant his brief time with Callie was well and truly over.</p><p>Obviously coming to the same conclusion, Callie moved to pull open the door just far enough to speak to the handsome young man standing in the hall. \u201cHas the call been transferred?\u201d</p><p>The man nodded, his gaze shifting over her shoulder to stab Duncan with a glare of open dislike. \u201cYes, line two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>The man sent one last glare through the doorway before turning to stalk down the hallway, but Duncan was already crossing the room to punch the extension number as he pressed the receiver to his ear.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Conner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem.\u201d As always Molinari was blunt to the point of rudeness.</p><p>The five-foot-five middle-aged woman didn\u2019t weigh a hundred pounds soaking wet, but she ruled the station house with an iron fist.</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe body\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d been expecting, but it sure the hell wasn\u2019t that.</p><p>\u201cLeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck happened to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows.\u201d</p><p>Distantly he was aware of Callie politely stepping away, giving him the illusion of privacy despite the fact she couldn\u2019t help but overhear the conversation. It wasn\u2019t as if he or Molinari were bothering to keep their voices lowered.</p><p>\u201cA body doesn\u2019t just disappear,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou checked the tapes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one saw anyone enter or leave the morgue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna come do my job?\u201d the chief interrupted, her tone warning he\u2019d trespassed on her last nerve. \u201cMaybe wipe my ass while you\u2019re at it?\u201d</p><p>Duncan grimaced. \u201cI want to know what the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen find out.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing his forefinger against the pain beginning to shoot through his temple, he tried to think.</p><p>Something that would have been a hell of a lot easier if freaky shit didn\u2019t keep happening.</p><p>\u201cThe usual chop shops wouldn\u2019t risk stealing a body from the police morgue,\u201d he muttered, referring to the gangs that occasionally made a grab for bodies in the hospital. If they could get them fresh enough the organs went for a fortune on the black market. \u201cUnless there\u2019s a new player in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Caleb checking out the usual suspects,\u201d Molinari said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind out if the freaks have an extra body hanging around.\u201d</p><p>Duncan rolled his eyes. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Callie leaned against the bar that separated the small kitchen from the living room.</p><p>Despite the rumors, all high-bloods were taught proper manners. She knew that she should leave the room so that Duncan could speak to his chief in privacy.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t deny an irresistible curiosity to discover if the human police had learned any information on the dead female. If they could determine why she\u2019d been chosen as the victim, they would surely be one step closer to finding the murderer, right?</p><p>And more importantly, she simply wanted to remain close to Duncan. At least for a little while longer.</p><p>Unconsciously her fingers lifted to touch her lips, still swollen from his kisses. She\u2019d half expected to be disappointed. After all, the sexy cop had filled more than one fantasy over the years. How could he possibly live up to her obscenely high expectations?</p><p>But he\u2019d not only lived up to them, he\u2019d blown past them as he\u2019d tutored her in the vast array of kisses from tender sweet to raw, bone-melting perfection.</p><p>She\u2019d been lost in the sensations that seared through her. The pounding of her heart. The squeeze of her lungs as she struggled to breathe. The aching need that twisted her stomach.</p><p>And all from a kiss ...</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she could survive a full-out assault.</p><p>Not that she wasn\u2019t willing to give it a try, she acknowledged with a shiver.</p><p>Realizing that Duncan was slamming down the phone, Callie fiercely squashed her renegade thoughts. A dead girl was missing. Now wasn\u2019t the time to be wishing that they\u2019d ignored the knock on the door.</p><p>They would have time later to explore the heat that sizzled between them. She intended to make damned sure of that.</p><p>Pushing away from the bar, she watched as he turned to meet her steady gaze, a surprising hint of color on his cheekbones.</p><p>Because his chief had called them freaks? Or because they were still considered suspects?</p><p>Probably both.</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to eavesdrop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He shoved his fingers through the pale gold of his hair, making her breath hitch at the desire to smooth the short satin strands. \u201cWe need to find out what happened to the body.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn.

The healer had clearly broken some rule that demanded community service. Not unusual for a young, impetuous man who\u2019d barely left his teens. And he wasn\u2019t a bit pleased with his duty of carrying messages.</p> <p>Especially when that duty included playing servant in front of an aggressive male norm.</p><p>He glared toward Duncan. \u201cThe Mave wants to see you in her office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood news travels fast,\u201d Duncan muttered.</p><p>Callie grimaced. Nothing happened in Valhalla that escaped the Mave\u2019s attention. And a call from the human police chief would have hit her radar at record speed.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather speak to her alone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>There was a snicker from Mel, as if he\u2019d never wet his pants when the Mave called him to her office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show our visitor to the Mave,\u201d she informed the young man.</p> <p>He sent Duncan another glare. \u201cShould I alert the dungeons they\u2019re about to have a guest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Callie said in dismissal, waiting until Mel turned to stroll down the hallway before leading Duncan in the opposite direction.</p><p>She kept the pace brisk, but there was no missing the cold, suspicious glances that followed their path.</p><p>\u201cFriendly bunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs friendly as your fellow cops would be if I strolled into the station house,\u201d she pointed out in low tones.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Callie turned the corner, headed directly for the Mave\u2019s office. It wasn\u2019t until they were standing in the small alcove directly in front of her door that she realized Duncan was dragging his feet. Halting, she glanced over her shoulder in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors about your leader,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>\u201cWhich rumors would those be, Sergeant O\u2019Conner?\u201d the Mave asked as she pulled open the door to offer Duncan a serene smile. \u201cThe one that claims I have actual horns and a tail? Or my personal favorite, the one that suggests I\u2019m nothing more than a myth? Like the Wizard of Oz?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Duncan was accustomed to shoving his size twelve foot into his mouth.</p><p>It was one of his few talents.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t used to being struck speechless.</p><p>Holy shit. He felt like he\u2019d been kicked by a mule as he caught his first glimpse of the mysterious Mave of Valhalla.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that she was drop dead gorgeous. He had a distinct preference for flame-haired pixies with eyes of sapphires. Or that she displayed her witch\u2019s mark with obvious pride. It was dark enough to warn even a thick-skulled norm that she had enough magic to turn them into something nasty if they didn\u2019t keep their prejudices to themselves.</p><p>No, it was simply the power of her presence.</p><p>It was etched onto the pale, perfect oval of a face. In the storm gray eyes. And flickered in the aura only his gaze could detect.</p><p>Even if he didn\u2019t know a damned thing about this woman, he would realize she was a force of nature.</p><p>\u201cGood god,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cNot quite, Sergeant O\u2019Conner,\u201d she murmured as she stepped back and waved an arm toward the black and white room behind her. \u201cWill you come in?\u201d</p><p>Awkwardly moving past her slender form, he headed toward the nearest chair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve heard worse.\u201d The Mave crossed to stand beside the large desk where a fully loaded tea tray was waiting. \u201cRefreshment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Callie stepped next to him, elbowing him in the ribs to remind him of his manners. \u201cThank you,\u201d he tagged on lamely, dropping into the leather seat.</p><p>Callie took the one next to him while the Mave slid into her seat behind the desk, her gaze on the young diviner.</p><p>\u201cCallie, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo headaches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The gray eyes shifted toward Duncan. \u201cI heard that you had a telephone call from your chief?\u201d</p><p>Refusing to answer wasn\u2019t an option. Not beneath that unnerving gaze.</p><p>\u201cLeah\u2019s body is missing.\u201d</p><p>Something darkened the gray eyes. Not the shock he\u2019d been expecting, but ... unease?</p><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegligence or theft?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, wise enough not to take offense at the blunt question. \u201cNo one knows for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your chief suspects that a high-blood was involved?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a groan. Why had he insisted on traveling to Valhalla? It should be Molinari sitting in this chair being grilled by the Mave.</p><p>Talk about a clash of the Titans.</p><p>Now he was forced to choose his words with care. \u201cShe\u2019s just covering all the bases.\u201d</p><p>A wry smile twisted her lips. \u201cVery diplomatic, Sergeant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not often accused of diplomacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Callie muttered beside him.</p><p>He flashed her an unrepentant grin before returning his attention to the powerful woman behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cThe chief has another officer checking out the usual suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing on the cameras and no eye witnesses,\u201d Duncan confessed. \u201cSo either it was an inside job or magic.\u201d</p><p>The Mave leaned back in her seat, her expression troubled. \u201cA pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping it was a common body snatching.\u201d</p><p>A ball of dread settled in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>If this woman was bothered by something then it had to be bad.</p><p>Bad on an epic scale.</p><p>\u201cYou know something,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>Taking a file from the top drawer, she handed it across the desk. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>His dread deepened as he opened the file to discover newspaper clippings, police reports, and faded photos.</p><p>\u201cParis. Vienna. Johannesburg.\u201d He glanced up in surprise. \u201cHow did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called in a few favors after I spoke with Callie. I thought it important to know if the strange death of Leah was an isolated incident or something\u201d\u2014she considered a beat\u2014\u201clarger.\u201d</p><p>Duncan read through the police reports, some that dated back fifty years, before moving to the newspaper clippings that were even older.</p><p>He suddenly understood the Mave\u2019s concern.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Callie reached to lightly touch his arm. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah wasn\u2019t the first murder victim to be missing their heart,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>The young diviner frowned, glancing at the file in his hands. \u201cHow could you not hear of them? I thought police shared that sort of information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all happened several years apart and on different continents. The first was nearly a hundred years ago.\u201d He returned his attention to the grainy photos. There was nothing to connect the victims. An aging priest. A rugged explorer. An artist. \u201cCan I share these with the chief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the Mave readily agreed.</p><p>He lifted his head to meet her steady gaze. \u201cDo these murders have any meaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>His cop\u2019s instincts picked up on what she wasn\u2019t saying. \u201cBut it might to someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost old tales have some kernel of truth at the heart of them,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cAre you speaking of a specific old tale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones that claim a necromancer can truly control the dead.\u201d</p><p>He shot a startled glance toward Callie, who held up her hands in denial.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to the Mave. \u201cIs it possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday I would have said no. Today...\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>Great. Just fucking fantastic.</p><p>He could already feel the panic that would spread through the human population if word got out there was a necromancer out there killing young females and stealing their bodies. They would load their guns, ready to shoot every freak they could find, regardless of their innocence.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about what these necromancers could do,\u201d he abruptly demanded.

At this point he\u2019d make a lunch date with Beelzebub if necessary. \u201cIf he has information I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s crazy or not.\u201d</p><p>The two women exchanged a look that spoke of secrets.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t here,\u201d the Mave at last admitted.</p> <p>\u201cHow long will he be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019ll have to go to him,\u201d the witch informed him.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019ll let you,\u201d Callie added in disgusted tones.</p><p>Okay. There were enough undercurrents in the room to drown an elephant. Or a very suspicious cop.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d</p><p>The Mave rose to cross toward the window, moving with a regal grace. \u201cBoggs is unusual even among high-bloods.\u201d</p> <p>A freakish freak?</p><p>Not comforting.</p><p>\u201cHow unusual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was born blind, but he insists that people and even objects whisper to him.\u201d Sympathy softened her grim expression. \u201cThat\u2019s why he lives in absolute isolation.\u201d</p><p>Well ... that didn\u2019t seem so bad. He half expected a lunatic who ate babies for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cWhisper what to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never the same. Sometimes the future ... or at least, a possible future,\u201d the Mave said. \u201cMore often it\u2019s the past or the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Callie muttered.</p> <p>Duncan studied her flushed face with a lift of his brows. \u201cDo I sense a history?\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her waist. \u201cHe demanded to see me on the day that Fane became my guardian.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s hands clenched at the thought of this woman being bonded to another. Platonic or not, the relationship made Fane far too possessive.</p><p>\u201cWas there significance in the date?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d Callie gave a wave of her hand. \u201cThe man is a whack job.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stilled, studying her growing agitation with a curious gaze. This was not the cool and composed Callie he knew.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. As I said, he\u2019s nuts.\u201d</p><p>Accepting that now wasn\u2019t the time to demand a full confession, Duncan glanced toward the Mave, who was regarding Callie with a worried expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I can learn from Boggs?\u201d he asked, barely leashing his instinctive urge to tug the fragile diviner into the protection of his arms.</p><p>The witch smoothed her features into an unreadable mask as she turned toward Duncan. \u201cHis gifts have allowed him to amass a vast amount of knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but is it trustworthy?\u201d He grimaced. \u201cWe have witnesses coming into the station on a daily basis claiming to have seen murders and kidnappings and even Elvis Presley in a spaceship.\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze for a long, unnerving minute. \u201cThat\u2019s for you to decide.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. Did she suspect that he had a few unusual talents of his own? He\u2019d never considered the possibility that so many freaks would sense he wasn\u2019t normal when he insisted on traveling to Valhalla.</p><p>Stupid of him.</p><p>He cleared his throat. Time for a diversion.</p><p>\u201cSo how do I find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d the Mave informed him. \u201cNot unless he wants to be found.\u201d</p><p>So the one person who could potentially give them a clue to the murders was impossible to find. Duncan rolled his eyes. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to contact him,\u201d the Mave promised, returning to her seat behind the desk. \u201cIf he\u2019s willing to speak with you then Fane will be able to locate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, I thought the day started off bad.\u201d Duncan shuddered, not happy with the thought of being yanked through space with the Sentinel. He didn\u2019t trust the bastard not to deliberately scramble his molecules. \u201cNow I have to spend more time with Lurch?\u201d</p><p>Callie snorted. \u201cI doubt Fane will be any happier.\u201d</p><p>The Mave glanced toward the young diviner. \u201cI fear he\u2019ll be even less pleased when he discovers you are to accompany them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Duncan smiled even as Callie turned a sickly shade of gray. \u201cThe day is looking up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Callie muttered.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Callie hadn\u2019t expected to eat.</p><p>The choice of taking Duncan to the dining hall and settling at a table next to the windows overlooking the inner courtyard had been more a case of self-preservation than a desire for food.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what would happen if they were alone together in a room, but she did know it would include heated kisses and missing clothes ...</p><p>A tempting way to spend the night, but not when they were destined to be interrupted.</p><p>When she finally had this man in her bed she intended to devote several hours to exploring his naked body.</p><p>But once the plates of salad, lasagna, and garlic bread arrived, she found herself polishing her plate and even indulging in a serving of tiramisu.</p><p>The chefs of Valhalla could work at any five-star hotel. Thank god her metabolism burned at an accelerated rate.</p><p>At last pushing back her empty plates, she looked up to discover Duncan glancing around the crowded room with a wary expression.</p><p>\u201cAre they glaring at me because I\u2019m a norm or because I\u2019m with you?\u201d he demanded sourly.</p><p>She shrugged. When this was all over with she was going to have her friends lining up for an explanation of why she\u2019d looked so cozy with Duncan O\u2019Conner, but for now she didn\u2019t care what they thought.</p><p>\u201cProbably because you\u2019re a cop.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a disgruntled frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany high-bloods have had unpleasant encounters with authority figures.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his chilled bottle of beer. \u201cHaven\u2019t we all?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her gaze at his casual disregard for what her people had suffered over the years. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. Most police assume we\u2019re evil by nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t take it personal,\u201d he denied. \u201cCops are always suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps recalling his coroner\u2019s reaction to her presence only hours ago, he took a deep swig of the beer.</p><p>\u201cChange takes time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they say.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his seat, setting aside the beer bottle. In the overhead lights his pale hair had the smooth sheen of polished gold and his lean features were more starkly beautiful than ever.</p><p>It made her regret her decision to choose the public dining room instead of her apartment.</p><p>At least until the next words fell from his lips. \u201cTell me what happened with Boggs.\u201d</p><p>It was the question she\u2019d been expecting since they\u2019d left the Mave\u2019s office, but it still managed to catch her off guard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>He focused on her with that stubborn concentration that made him such a good cop.</p><p>And an annoying dinner companion.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I want it to be my business?\u201d</p><p>She shifted to make sure her back was to the rest of the room. If any of her friends caught sight of her scowl they\u2019d be charging over in a heartbeat to rescue her.</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to let me pry into your privacy?\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love your wife?\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath, his hand clenched on top of the table. \u201cStraight for the jugular, eh, Callie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so eager to play now?\u201d she taunted.</p><p>There was a short, explosive pause before he folded his arms over his chest. \u201cI knew Susan from the first day of kindergarten,\u201d he said in clipped tones, his expression screwed down tight. \u201cShe was a good Catholic girl from the neighborhood who seemed exactly the sort of woman I should marry. My parents were delighted.\u201d</p><p>She knew she should back off. It was obviously still difficult for him to discuss his wife.</p><p>Ex-wife.</p><p>And she had no right to press. But a part of her had to know. It was like a thorn beneath her skin that was becoming unbearable.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d she said, her gaze never leaving his hard expression.</p><p>There was another long, painful pause.</p><p>\u201cI was truly fond of Susan, but I didn\u2019t crave her like a man should crave his wife,\u201d he abruptly admitted.</p><p>\u201cCrave?\u201d She blinked in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting choice of words.\u201d</p><p>He surged forward, grabbing her hand and pressing her inner wrist to his lips.</p><p>\u201cA relationship shouldn\u2019t be a comfortable arrangement,\u201d he growled against her racing pulse. \u201cIt should be heat and passion and raw emotions.\u201d</p><p>An electric jolt of excitement arrowed straight through her, making her squirm in her seat.</p><p>Yow. Talk about heat. She felt singed.</p><p>\u201cI get the picture,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Lowering her hand, he kept his fingers wrapped around her wrist, his thumb teasing the spot he\u2019d just kissed.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Boggs.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, but she made no move to pull away from his light grasp. If she were to be honest, she needed the comforting warmth of his touch. The memory of her visit to Boggs wasn\u2019t something she wanted to dredge up.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>\u201cHe sent word to the Mave that he\u2019d come across an artifact that spoke about a coming threat,\u201d she said in low tones.</p><p>\u201cThe usual mumbo jumbo of supposed prophets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said, her skin growing clammy as she remembered the dark cave that had been filled with stale air and piles of strange objects that looked like they\u2019d come from a Hollywood set. It\u2019d been creepy as hell. Especially for a girl who\u2019d rarely left Valhalla. \u201cHe insisted that he needed to speak with the \u2018young diviner with the eyes like sapphires.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe did get the eyes right,\u201d Duncan murmured. \u201cAre they unusual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost diviners have green or brown eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many diviners are there? Or is that a secret?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are less than twenty spread around the world.\u201d</p><p>He seemed startled by her confession. \u201cA rare gift.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYes, but not the most rare.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, as if wanting to know exactly what else might be out there that was even more rare than a necro, but then he gave a sharp shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSo Boggs demanded to see you?\u201d he asked, clearly refusing to be distracted.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. Even after twelve years she could still recall the sight of Boggs when he shed his robe and revealed his hidden power.</p><p>\u201cThat the dead rest uneasy in their graves.\u201d</p><p>He studied her carefully bland expression. \u201cYou weren\u2019t impressed?\u201d</p><p>Her lips stretched in a humorless smile. \u201cI\u2019d have been more impressed if he hadn\u2019t kept me waiting in a damp cave for ten hours only to tell me the exact same thing I\u2019d heard from a carnival fortune-teller when I was twelve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fortune-teller told you the same thing?\u201d</p><p>Damn. She wished she hadn\u2019t let that slip.</p><p>It made the coincidence seem far more important than it was.</p><p>Or at least, more important than she\u2019d always hoped it was.</p><p>Now ... well, she wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret I\u2019m a diviner,\u201d she said in what she hoped was dismissive tones. \u201cWhat else would they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d The hint of gold was suddenly more pronounced in the hazel eyes. A sure sign he was imagining her naked. \u201cMaybe that you were destined to meet a handsome cop who was going to rock your world.\u201d</p><p>The tight bands closing around her chest eased at his deliberate teasing. \u201cYou really have the most god-awful pickup lines,\u201d she said with a shake of her head.</p> <p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so modest.\u201d</p><p>His brief smile faded, his expression somber. \u201cAre you sure it wasn\u2019t more than just a fluke that you received the same warning from two different sources?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. It\u2019d been a question that had haunted her more than once over the years. And always, she came to the same conclusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it was?\u201d she asked with growing impatience. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do about restless corpses?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t disguise his shudder of horror. \u201cI\u2019m the wrong person to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the wrong person for a lot of things,\u201d Fane mocked as he came to a halt beside their table.</p><p>Duncan was instantly bristling with an overdose of male aggression. \u201cYou know I still have my gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could kill you before you ever got it out of the holster,\u201d the guardian promised, laying his hands flat on the table as he smiled with lethal promise.</p><p>Callie heaved a sigh as the entire room went eerily silent. Just like a Wild West movie when there was a looming gunfight.</p><p>Idiots.</p><p>She pulled her hand away from Duncan. No need to throw gasoline on a smoldering fire.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something, Fane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mave contacted me. We leave in an hour.\u201d His dark gaze shifted to study her pale face. \u201cYou should rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She offered a reassuring smile. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet at the chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She held his gaze, allowing him to see that she was strong enough to face the upcoming ordeal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to make sure of that,\u201d he swore, shooting a scowl toward Duncan. \u201cWatch yourself.\u201d</p><p>With his warning delivered, Fane turned to stroll out of the dining hall, impervious to the avid gazes that followed his exit.</p><p>Fane really and truly didn\u2019t give a shit what people thought.</p><p>Knowing the attention was bound to shift back to them the minute the Sentinel disappeared from view, Callie surged to her feet.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Duncan breathed a sigh of relief as they left the dining hall by a side door and entered the moon-drenched gardens.</p><p>He\u2019d always assumed that he knew how the freaks must feel when they were out and about in the world. The covert (and not so covert) stares. The bristling fear of those around them. The active dislike that could fill the atmosphere with a dark threat.</p><p>Now he had to accept that he hadn\u2019t had a clue. Logically understanding the basic concept of bigotry and actually enduring it in action were two separate things.</p><p>For several minutes they walked in silence, Duncan trying to shake off the lingering feel of suspicious gazes, and Callie clearly worrying over the upcoming encounter with Boggs.</p><p>At last he sucked in a deep breath and glanced around the rose beds that were already in full bloom despite the fact that it was only April. Velvet petals from deep burgundy to purest white perfumed the air while a marble fountain sent water dancing in a sparkling display. There were beautifully carved benches and birdbaths, and along the edge of the gardens were low hedges so perfectly trimmed they didn\u2019t seem real.</p><p>His lips twitched as he recalled his enthusiastic attempts to trim the hedges when he\u2019d owned a house. They\u2019d not only ended up as barren stumps, but he\u2019d accidentally taken out a few of the neighbors\u2019. Needless to say he hadn\u2019t been invited to the block party.</p><p>One upside to living in a shitty apartment building ... no yard work.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it would be so beautiful,\u201d he murmured, allowing his hand to brush hers as they walked along the flagstone path.</p><p>A strained smile curved her lips. \u201cMother Nature is always spectacular, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a witch as a gardener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He studied her upturned face, his cock twitching at the sight of her in the moonlight. She looked lovely. As always. But she didn\u2019t belong in this garden. She wasn\u2019t a hothouse rose. She was too rare, too exotic. Like a flower plucked from a distant, tropical island. \u201cWere you happy growing up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Her smile lost its tension, pleasant memories replacing her looming fear. \u201cChildren who are brought to Valhalla are given to foster families, but everyone is involved in raising them. I had a dozen mothers fussing over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never considered tracking down your birth parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey stopped being my parents when they dumped me in the trash,\u201d she said with blunt dismissal. \u201cI\u2019ve never had any urge to know anything about them.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. She had obviously been given all the love and protection she needed. Why would she want to know the bastards who\u2019d tossed her away like garbage? \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side. \u201cWhat about your childhood?\u201d</p><p>He instinctively slowed his pace as they neared a shadowed corner of the garden conveniently hidden by a trellis covered in climbing roses.</p><p>\u201cLoud, messy.\u201d He shot her a grin. \u201cOccasionally painful.\u201d</p><p>She came to a startled halt. \u201cPainful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had two older brothers who threw me out our bedroom window, hog-tied me and left me in the back shed until my da found me. They also dared me to kiss my fourth-grade teacher, who promptly kicked me out of school for a week.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow, not a hint of sympathy to be found.</p><p>\u201cAny sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains it.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together to hide his smile. He was about to be insulted. Amusement would only ruin her fun.</p><p>\u201cExplains what?\u201d he dutifully demanded.</p><p>\u201cYour assumption that women should adore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they should. I\u2019m adorable.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cWhat you are is spoiled.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny the accusation. Along with being a true pain in his ass, his sisters had shamelessly indulged him.</p><p>\u201cThere might have been a little spoiling,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She reached to pluck a rose bloom from the trellis, her fingers caressing the peach petals.</p><p>\u201cDoes your family live in Kansas City?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He cleared his throat. Damn, but the sight of those delicate fingers brushing over the flower made him hard. He wanted her hands on him. Stroking, exploring, maybe doing a little squeezing. \u201cMy ma would be devastated if any of her chicks flew too far from the nest.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou were fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t always feel like it. A big family can smother a young man trying to spread his wings.\u201d Nothing like two parents and five older siblings prying into his business. Privacy was more precious than gold when he was an oversexed, hormone-charged teenager. \u201cNow I\u2019ve learned to appreciate the O\u2019Conner clan.\u201d He paused, struck by a sudden inspiration. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take you to Sunday dinner.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Then blinked again. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She tilted her chin to a defensive angle. \u201cI doubt I would be welcome.\u201d</p><p>Duncan sucked in a sharp breath. It was frighteningly easy to picture Callie in his childhood home. The O\u2019Conners were loud and boisterous and rough around the edges, but they all possessed the same overriding urge to be protectors. One look at this fragile beauty with her jewel eyes and they\u2019d be tripping over each other to play mother hen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. My ma is a remarkable woman. She would never turn anyone away from her table,\u201d he assured her. Then he gave a short laugh as he thought of his da\u2019s reaction to Callie Brown. \u201cOf course, it might be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? She might stick me with a carving knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse, she might start sizing you up for a wedding gown.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More blinking. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ma is old school.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe believes a man is incapable of happiness unless he\u2019s under the rule of a wife.\u201d</p><p>Her expression was wary, as if she feared he might be playing a cruel game. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine she would ever be desperate enough to think of me as a potential daughter-in-law.\u201d</p> <p>He reached to sweep his hand over her spiky hair, his touch gentle despite the violent anger that surged through him. Man, he wanted to punch every ignorant jackass who\u2019d made this remarkable female feel she was anything but extraordinary.</p><p>Or maybe he\u2019d just shoot them.</p><p>Yeah. Shooting them sounded much more satisfying.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she want you?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re young, beautiful, and I presume you\u2019re capable of producing the mandatory grandchildren?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, sending another jolt of heat through his body. Okay. No more thinking of kids. Or how a man went about acquiring them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a freak who can see into the minds of the dead,\u201d she said.</p><p>He tugged a fiery strand of her hair. \u201cDarling, it\u2019s not exactly a secret. I\u2019ve seen you in action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMothers don\u2019t invite people like me to Sunday dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re special,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the better.\u201d</p><p>She studied him in puzzlement for a long minute. Then abruptly she narrowed her eyes. \u201cAh. I know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>She did?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad one of us does,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me from our upcoming meeting with Boggs.\u201d</p><p>True. He\u2019d certainly started out trying to tease a smile to those full, delectable lips, but somehow he\u2019d lost track of his goal.</p><p>And worse, he knew he wasn\u2019t going to easily dismiss the image of Callie surrounded by his family at his mother\u2019s kitchen table.</p><p>A dangerous fantasy.</p><p>Far better to concentrate on the simple lust that hummed through his body like a live current.</p><p>That was the kind of danger he could handle.</p><p>Skimming his fingers over the curve of her ear, he shifted to make sure he was blocking her from sight of anyone entering the garden.</p> <p>\u201cI have better ways to distract you,\u201d he murmured, lowering his head to nip her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she breathed, her hands lifting to grasp his shoulders.</p><p>He shuddered at her ready response. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>Cupping her face in his hands, he tilted her head to the exact angle for him to claim her mouth in a kiss that was a blatant sexual demand.</p><p>They had mere minutes before they would be forced to leave Valhalla. Not nearly long enough to do what he wanted to do with this woman.</p><p>But he intended to take advantage of every second.</p><p>Slipping his tongue into the silken heat of her mouth, he lost himself in the sweet addiction of Callie Brown.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Below the sweeping mansion the rooms weren\u2019t elegantly furnished or designed to impress.</p><p>In fact, it looked exactly like a morgue.</p><p>Probably because that\u2019s what it was.</p><p>The long, open room had white tiled floors and built-in stainless steel freezers along the walls, which filled the air with a soft hum. Overhead the rows of lights blazed as bright as the sun.</p><p>And in the very center of the room was a steel gurney where a young female was laid out, her skin as white as the blanket that covered her naked body and her chestnut hair spilling over the edges.</p><p>Zak crossed to the gurney, the hem of his gray robe brushing the floor. He peered down at her delicate features, clinically comprehending why a man would make a fool of himself over such a creature although his passions had been purged in the flames of his enemies.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He tilted her face to the side, examining for any defects. \u201cShe\u2019s exquisite.\u201d</p><p>The man standing beside him shifted in unease.</p><p>Tony was exactly what Anya had called him.</p><p>A genuine thug.</p><p>Short, with a barrel-chest, he was as strong as an ox and about as smart as one. His dark hair was slicked from a square face that had a crooked nose and small, beady eyes.</p><p>His personality was as pleasant as a pit bull, but he did have several relatives who always knew someone who knew someone who knew someone\u2014which meant he had a cousin who worked in the police station who was willing to switch off the surveillance tapes long enough for Tony to get in and out without setting off the alarms.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d the thug muttered, unconsciously wiping his beefy hands on his jeans.</p><p>Not everyone was as comfortable as Zak with the dead.</p><p>Strange. The man had reputedly killed over a dozen people, including women and children. How could you be squeamish about death when you were so good at dealing it?</p><p>Besides, corpses were far better company than the living.</p><p>\u201cYou may go,\u201d Zak dismissed.</p><p>\u201cThank god.\u201d The man bolted toward the door.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Zak halted his retreat.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to remind you that it would be extremely unhealthy to discuss anything connected to your job.\u201d</p><p>His voice was a gentle whisper, but Tony was suddenly as pale as the dead female. \u201cI swear, my lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t need to be told twice. Moving with a surprising speed considering his bulk, he disappeared out of the lab and up the stairs.</p><p>Dismissing the servant from his mind, Zak continued his inspection of the female. It wasn\u2019t for pleasure. He had to be certain that the coroner hadn\u2019t started his autopsy.</p><p>\u201cAre you satisfied?\u201d Anya purred as she entered the lab attired in yet another dress, this one a deep shade of green to contrast with her rich curtain of hair.</p><p>Unimpressed, Zak returned his attention to the pretty corpse.</p><p>\u201cWe retrieved her before any damage could be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can complete the ritual?\u201d</p><p>Assured that the female was still viable to complete her part of his plan, he straightened the blanket and moved to a counter that ran between two of the freezers.</p><p>\u201cAre you in a hurry now?\u201d he demanded, washing his slender hands in a sink before drying them on a towel. \u201cBefore you were urging me to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any news of her death, but it\u2019s only a matter of time,\u201d Anya snapped. \u201cThe risk you took to get the female won\u2019t do us any good if Calso learns that she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>He reached beneath the counter to pull out two candles and a shallow bowl made of ivory. From a drawer, he pulled out a large ceremonial knife.</p><p>\u201cSome things can\u2019t be hurried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>A blessed silence filled the lab (yet another reason to prefer the dead over the living) as he sliced a razor-thin cut in his palm and allowed several drops of blood to fill the bottom of the bowl.</p><p>Then, wrapping a linen cloth around his hand to halt the bleeding, he lit the candles and softly chanted the familiar incantation.</p><p>Over and over, he repeated the chant, his hands passing over the pool of blood in the bowl.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the words or the candles that mattered.</p><p>They were merely the focus to call upon his latent talents.</p><p>Slowly, almost imperceptibly, a cold wind began to swirl through the lab, bringing with it the moist scent of earth and something else.</p><p>Something foreign.</p><p>He opened himself to the encroaching chill, allowing it to fill his body with a power greater than his own.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know when he\u2019d discovered the ability to go beyond glimpsing into the minds of the dead. He\u2019d been too young to be frightened when the power had risen to consume him and yet old enough to realize that he needed to keep it a secret.</p><p>Living on a remote estate in Russia, it had been a simple matter to practice his growing skills away from prying eyes. And if he\u2019d been caught once or twice by a serf, well they were easy enough to dispose of.</p><p>In time his powers had become more than a source of fascination.</p><p>He\u2019d used them to climb his way from a minor nobleman to a favorite among the czar\u2019s court, surrounded by the wealth and luxury his weak, feebleminded father could never have imagined.</p><p>Of course, he was no longer a man who would be satisfied by such shallow desires.</p><p>His blessings weren\u2019t given to him for pleasure.</p><p>They were given to him to rule.</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what he intended to do.</p><p>\u201cBring me the urn,\u201d he said, his body numb from the cold power thundering through him.</p><p>\u201cAs you command,\u201d the witch grumbled, moving to pull the ceramic urn from the nearest freezer.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to act like a child, you may leave.\u201d</p><p>She muttered beneath her breath, but she was wise enough to handle the urn with care as she set it on the counter next to him. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Zak ignored his petulant companion, reaching into the urn to pull out a frozen heart. He returned to his chanting as he set the delicate organ in the bowl and covered it with his hands.</p><p>He ignored the witch, who fidgeted with growing impatience, and even the heavy tread of Tony walking upstairs, no doubt heading to the kitchen to raid the fridge. The man ate on a continuous basis.</p><p>Nothing was allowed to distract him from the biting power. Not when it was hammering through him with a growingly painful force.</p><p>The ability to wrench a person from the jaws of death wasn\u2019t a gift for the weak. Not like those ridiculous diviners who hid behind the walls of Valhalla and barely scratched the surface of what was possible.</p><p>With every second he risked being consumed by the icy darkness that pulsed through him.</p><p>He battled with the grim reaper, never certain he would win.</p><p>At last the force that churned inside him burst through his hands and arrowed into the heart beneath his palms.</p><p>The heart shuddered, the ice abruptly melting as it was filled with a magic as old as time.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, Zak turned to make his way back to the gurney. He kept his steps steady despite the weariness seeping through his body.</p><p>He never revealed weakness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Especially not in front of Anya.</p><p>The witch might have pledged her loyalty, but she was a treacherous bitch who\u2019d turn on him in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Halting next to the gurney, Zak placed his hand on the female\u2019s forehead. \u201cLeah, wake,\u201d he commanded, watching as her lashes fluttered upward.</p> <p>The light brown eyes were devoid of emotion, but they held an awareness that was all he needed.</p><p>Duncan squeezed his eyes shut, desperately clinging to the copper post while trying not to scream like a wussy.</p><p>Had it only been a quarter of an hour ago that he\u2019d been in the rose-scented darkness with Callie in his arms?</p><p>He\u2019d been lost in the intoxicating pleasure of her kiss, trying to ignore the world around them, when Fane had made his untimely arrival.</p><p>From there things had only gone downhill.</p> <p>The tattooed pain-in-the-ass had arrived in silence, filling the air with a bristling antagonism that had Callie awkwardly pulling from Duncan\u2019s grasp, a stain of color on her cheeks.</p><p>For a crazed minute, Duncan had curled his hands into fists. As if he was going to slug the bastard.</p><p>It was only the knowledge that the Sentinel had devoted his entire life to protecting Callie, and that she might very well need his considerable powers before this was all said and done, that kept him from breaking his knuckles on Fane\u2019s arrogant jaw.</p><p>A choice he regretted as the Sentinel led them to the small chapel. Duncan was barely allowed to glance around his barren surroundings when Fane roughly grasped his hand to shove it against the post in the center of the room and the world melted to nothingness.</p><p>A punch wouldn\u2019t actually damage the bastard, and broken hand or not, it would have been satisfying to have landed a blow.</p><p>The sense of emptiness abruptly vanished as the world once again coalesced around him. Briefly disoriented, Duncan clutched the post, his head whirling.</p> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroubles, cop?\u201d</p><p>Duncan scowled at the Sentinel, who was watching his discomfort with a smug smile. \u201cNothing that couldn\u2019t be solved with a well-placed bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring their squabble, Callie walked across the stone floor to study the strange etchings on the wall.</p><p>\u201cThis is a different place.\u201d</p><p>Duncan moved to join her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t where Boggs was when I met him last time,\u201d she explained, glancing toward Fane. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGermany.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, the warrior turned to leave the cramped room, clearly expecting them to follow.</p><p>For once Duncan didn\u2019t mind the man\u2019s arrogance.</p><p>Not only was he still trying to find his balance, but his mind was reeling from the casual announcement he\u2019d just been zipped halfway around the world.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>The furthest he\u2019d ever been from KC was his honeymoon in Key West.</p><p>And that\u2019d taken him two days to drive.</p><p>In the process of wondering if Sentinels kept passports and foreign money stashed around the world, Duncan realized that Callie was moving.</p><p>With a shake of his head he was following her, stepping out of the circular chapel into the refectory.</p><p>The long room was what he\u2019d expected of an ancient abbey. Made of plain stone and lined with towering arches that opened to side passages, it had several tables shoved at the back, as if the monks gathered in the space to eat. Or maybe pray.</p><p>The ceiling was vaulted to give the impression of a vast space and painted with the same hieroglyphs that were tattooed on Fane.</p><p>Protection against magic.</p><p>And god only knew what else.</p><p>Callie came to a halt as they caught sight of Fane at the far end of the room, quietly speaking with a hooded monk. Clearly it was bad manners to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Duncan instead demanded.</p><p>\u201cI assume that we\u2019ll need transportation to travel to Boggs,\u201d she said, her arms wrapping around her body in an unconsciously defensive motion.</p><p>He stepped behind her, gently massaging the taut muscles of her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you,\u201d he swore.</p><p>She glanced back, her eyes catching and reflecting the lights of the candelabras. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard that the days of damsels in distress are over?\u201d</p><p>His breath caught. How could he be constantly caught off guard by her beauty? His hands skimmed up and down her arms, driven by a compulsive need to touch her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you can take care of yourself, Callie, but we all need someone to watch our backs,\u201d he said in a husky voice.</p><p>\u201cEven macho cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially macho cops.\u201d</p><p>Silence. The sort filled with potent fascination, licks of treacherous heat, and a mutual wariness of the bonds forming between them.</p><p>This hadn\u2019t been in the cards.</p><p>For either of them.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Fane intruded, his heightened temper heating the air as he glared at Duncan. \u201cWe have to hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Duncan snarled, promising himself that as soon as he was certain Callie was safe he was whisking her far away from her guard dog. Intrusive, pushy bastard.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care if he had to chain the warrior to the wall and throw away the keys.</p><p>As if sensing his dark promise, Fane sent him a last searing glare before leading them through one of the arches.</p><p>\u201cBoggs refuses to speak once the sun rises.\u201d</p><p>Falling into step, Duncan grimaced. \u201cHe\u2019s not a vampire, is he?\u201d</p><p>Fane shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Duncan glanced toward the silent Callie. \u201cI\u2019m not going to like this, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs the Mave said ... he\u2019s eccentric.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. There was no use speculating what might be waiting for him.</p><p>They walked through the narrow hallways of the abbey, the occasional flicker of candlelight the only thing to hold back the thick gloom.</p><p>Although for him it was seven or eight in the evening (he never wore a watch), the abbey was shrouded in sleep with only an occasional glimpse of robed figures who were unfortunate enough to have the night shift.</p><p>They passed through an empty workroom filled with wooden tables piled high with rolls of parchment and bottles filled with a dark liquid he assumed was ink. There were even feathered quills piled on a far bench.</p><p>Scribes? In this day and age?</p><p>That seemed ... redundant.</p><p>Fane kept his pace brisk as they left the abbey and crossed a paved courtyard to stand next to a large building that looked like it had once been the stables. Within minutes a black SUV with tinted windows appeared from around the corner of the building and Fane pulled open the back door to help Callie into the backseat.</p><p>Duncan was quick to slide in after her, sinking into the buttery leather seat so that the Sentinel was forced to climb into the front seat with the hooded monk.</p><p>Childish?</p><p>Hell, yeah.</p><p>But it was common knowledge that most men stopped maturing about the age of five.</p><p>Closing the door, he\u2019d barely managed to click his seat belt in place when the monk shoved his foot down on the accelerator and they were hurtling away from the abbey at a speed that had to be illegal.</p><p>Silence filled the interior of the expensive vehicle as Callie retreated inside her thoughts. Fane appeared to be in some Zen-like zone. The monk presumably had made some sort of vow of silence, or maybe he was just enjoying his pretense they were racing the Grand Prix.</p><p>And Duncan ... well, his jaws were clenched too tight to utter more than a squeak.</p><p>Duncan caught a glimpse of a wide river that he assumed was the Rhine following the narrow road that wound through a dense forest. They raced through a tiny village so fast he barely made out the quaint shops with their wooden signs and polished front windows that were filled with hand-carved cuckoo clocks, squishy teddy bears, and the inevitable beer steins.</p><p>His ma would be enchanted, he acknowledged, making a mental note to have his siblings chip in to send his parents on a well-deserved vacation. His da would insist on visiting Ireland, but would make sure his ma had a say in the plans.</p><p>They\u2019d been traveling less than a quarter of an hour when the SUV made a sharp turn onto an overgrown path. He instinctively reached to tuck Callie against him as they jolted over the uneven path, wondering who taught the damned monk how to drive.</p><p>Thankfully the bone-jarring journey at last came to an end at the top of a hill, and with a low groan, Duncan shoved open the door and climbed out of the vehicle. He turned to help Callie out, not surprised that she\u2019d barely stepped onto the path when Fane was smoothly taking his place at her side.</p><p>Duncan clenched his teeth and concentrated on his surroundings. Now wasn\u2019t the time to play caveman. The only thing that mattered was getting the answers they needed without putting Callie at risk.</p><p>It took a moment of peering through the gloom to realize that the mound that was rising from the trees wasn\u2019t another hill, but a stone structure that was being slowly consumed by the forest.</p><p>\u201cHe lives in a castle?\u201d he muttered in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he has an actual home,\u201d Fane said, pulling a clear crystal that was hung on a leather strap from his pocket. \u201cHe\u2019s more of a squatter.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grimaced, taking in the crumbling curtain wall that had once surrounded the grounds. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have squatted at the Ritz?\u201d</p><p>Fane spoke a soft word and the crystal began to glow. \u201cBe on guard, cop,\u201d he warned, urging Callie toward the bridge that crossed the long-forgotten moat.</p><p>Bringing up the rear, Duncan pulled his gun and searched the shadows for something to shoot. \u201cYou expect trouble?\u201d</p><p>Fane passed beneath the barbican and entered what must have been the lower bailey. Now it was just a rough patch of weeds and bramble. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Duncan felt a chill trickle over his skin, as if he was being watched by unseen eyes.</p><p>They crossed the open ground, Fane neatly leading them past the gaping hole where there\u2019d once been a drinking well and around the nearly hidden cannon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before them the inner keep loomed three stories high with empty windows and the appearance of a hollow shell. No doubt it was a treasure trove for the local historians, but it was making Duncan twitch.</p><p>He was a cop who\u2019d mastered the urban landscape.</p><p>He could spot a suspicious perp in the middle of a crowd. He could tail a car for days without being noticed. He could enter a room and instantly tell you the number of exits, the placement of obstructions if he needed to move in a hurry, and if anyone in the room was carrying a concealed weapon.</p><p>But suddenly surrounded by the untamed wildness of nature, he felt like a fish out of water.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the thick foliage that was a constant threat to trip him, or the clinging shadows that could hide anything. Or even the silence that made it impossible to sneak up without giving away his position.</p><p>It was the strange pulse of power that brushed the very edge of his awareness.</p><p>He\u2019d heard rumors of norms who could feel magic. As if it was a tangible force. He suspected they were recruited by the government to keep track of the high-bloods.</p><p>Until now, he\u2019d never thought it was a talent he possessed. He still didn\u2019t. No. If he had to guess he would say that everyone had some ability to sense when there was a disturbance in the air. It was simply the degree of sensitivity to that disturbance. And when it was as strong as it was in the lower bailey even the most oblivious person could feel it.</p><p>Fane led them up the steps of the keep, kicking open the heavy wooden door and continuing forward without missing a step.</p> <p>\u201cNo knocking?\u201d Duncan mocked, glancing up at the open-beamed ceiling that was swathed in cobwebs.</p><p>Fane held his crystal over his head, bathing the open space in a soft light.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to see.</p><p>Stone walls. Stone floor. Stone fireplace.</p><p>At one time the room was no doubt made homey by a blazing fire that danced light over the ornate tapestries that had been draped on the walls and the air had been filled with the scent of fresh straw spread over the floor.</p><p>Now it was just ... stone.</p> <p>And dust.</p><p>A damned tidal wave of dust.</p><p>\u201cIf he didn\u2019t want us to enter he would have put up wards,\u201d Fane was saying, his pace cautious as he walked toward the steps that led to the floor above. \u201cOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t create a few traps for the unwary. Hermits have an odd sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>Duncan rolled his eyes. Of course they did.</p><p>They climbed the stairs, finding yet another empty room that matched the one below. Except the floor was rotting wood, not stone.</p><p>Fane halted, his body coiled for attack. \u201cHe\u2019s above us.\u201d</p><p>Duncan clicked off the safety on his gun. \u201cYou can sense him?\u201d</p><p>The Sentinel flashed Duncan a mocking smile. \u201cI don\u2019t have the same talent as a hunter Sentinel, but I can sense a high-blood when they have Boggs\u2019s level of power.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan grimaced. Just fucking perfect. Another freak who obviously suspected that he wasn\u2019t entirely normal.</p><p>Not that this was the time to worry about his little secret.</p><p>\u201cDo you sense anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s alone.\u201d Fane stepped to the side, his gaze in constant movement. \u201cI\u2019ll keep guard here.\u201d</p><p>The dark gaze briefly rested on Duncan, silently warning him that the Sentinel was trusting him to keep Callie safe. And that if he failed there would be hell to pay.</p><p>Duncan resisted the urge to flip him off as he wrapped his arm around Callie and started up the next flight of stairs. He might logically appreciate Fane\u2019s fierce loyalty to Callie, but he didn\u2019t need the bastard telling him to keep this woman safe.</p><p>Reaching the top floor, he forgot the aggravating Sentinel and even the constant pulse of magic that was wearing on his nerves.</p><p>A lone candle was set in the center of the grimy floor, casting flickers of light over the piles of rubbish that consumed half the room.</p><p>And it was rubbish.</p><p>Broken chairs, tarnished silver teapots, a mound of clothing, ice skates, a framed mirror, ratty books, and hundreds of other items that he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>It was like Hoarders on steroids.</p><p>\u201cGood ... god,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhat is all this crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistory, Duncan O\u2019Conner.\u201d A hooded form stepped from behind the piles, his voice oddly melodic. \u201cAs well as a promise of the future.\u201d</p><p>Just for a second Duncan thought it was one of the monks who\u2019d followed them from the monastery. Then the candlelight caught in the folds of the robe and he realized it was black, not the brown of the monks.</p><p>He pointed his gun at the center of the deep hood. \u201cThat\u2019s close enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of harming the diviner,\u201d the stranger assured him. \u201cNo more than you would.\u201d</p><p>With a flamboyant motion, the man whipped off the robe and tossed it aside.</p><p>Even braced to expect the unexpected, Duncan nearly went to his knees in shock.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he breathed, struggling to comprehend the fact that he was looking at an exact replica of himself. No, not exact, his stunned mind accepted. The pale hair and lean face with a shadow of golden whiskers might be a mirror image. As well as his lean form dressed in jeans and casual shirt. But the eyes were all wrong. They were a pure, unnerving white. Not pale, not clear. Just ... white.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Callie lightly touched his arm, urging him to lower his gun. Smart female. His nerves were on a hair trigger.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want any accidents.</p><p>\u201cBoggs is a doppelganger.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>The ... creature smiled. \u201cI can take the appearance of those who are close to me.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>A cop to his bones, Duncan was instantly on high alert. A creature who could alter its appearance to look like anyone?</p><p>The possibilities for disaster were endless.</p><p>He could become a guard and rob a bank. He could go on a murder spree and create a new persona for each killing. Hell, he could turn into the president and start a war.</p><p>And worse, his aura flickered with a hint of darkness that revealed he had more than once dipped his toes in the evil pool.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t I ever heard of doppelgangers?\u201d</p><p>Boggs laughed with creepy delight, throwing his arms wide. \u201c\u2018There are more things in heaven and earth, Duncan O\u2019Conner, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Duncan commanded.</p><p>The white eyes were lit with a sudden inner glow. \u201cPerhaps you prefer this form?\u201d</p><p>In the blink of an eye the doppelganger had become Callie, with spiky crimson hair and a slender body displayed in spandex pants and stretchy top.</p><p>\u201cNo, I damned well ... wait.\u201d His furious words were bit off as he recalled Callie\u2019s words. \u201cI thought you said he was blind.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Callie shivered. Even knowing what was coming, she still found it impossible not to be flipped out.</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d she said, trying to keep the distaste out of her voice.</p><p>She was a high-blood. She understood exactly what it meant to be treated as if she were an outcast. Still ... Boggs took strange to a whole new level.</p><p>\u201cThen how does he know what we look like?\u201d Duncan rasped.</p><p>\u201cI sense your essence,\u201d Boggs admitted, releasing his magic to reveal his true form. Duncan hissed at the sight of the pale, hairless creature that looked disturbingly like a larva. His features were indistinct and his eyes glowed with power. The robe had returned, but it was open to reveal a body that was lacking genitalia. \u201cAnd before your policeman\u2019s imagination begins to run wild, let me assure you that I have to be standing within a few feet of those I duplicate and that I can only hold the image for a few minutes. I\u2019m no danger to society.\u201d</p><p>Callie felt Duncan stiffen, as if Boggs had managed to strike a nerve, but as usual the cop tilted his chin and held his ground.</p><p>Foolish courage.</p><p>It was going to get him killed.</p><p>\u201cCan you read minds?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be a psychic to know what you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m tediously familiar with the prejudices of men with badges. They instantly assume that freaks have no morals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mave sent us to ask you questions,\u201d Callie interrupted. Men. Did they always have to have a pissing match? \u201cAre you willing to answer them?\u201d</p><p>A cunning expression flickered over Boggs\u2019s alien features as he subtly shifted closer, closing the robe to hide his body. \u201cI suppose it depends on the questions.\u201d</p><p>Duncan moved to make sure he could step between her and Boggs if he sensed a threat, his gun still in his hand.</p><p>\u201cThere have been bodies found without their hearts.\u201d Duncan took the lead. Of course. He was such a cop. \u201cBut there are no wounds. It\u2019s as if the heart just disappeared from their bodies.\u201d</p><p>Boggs made a sound deep in his throat. Not shock. But ... resignation?</p><p>\u201cA bokor,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Duncan frowned. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the living dead.\u201d</p><p>Not surprising, the cop paled at the blunt explanation. \u201cLike a zombie?\u201d</p><p>Callie wasn\u2019t quite as stunned as Duncan. Since she\u2019d left the cradle she\u2019d heard stories of the walking dead and the necromancers who could raise them.</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d never believed them.</p><p>Not until now.</p><p>\u201cI thought they were a myth,\u201d she said.</p><p>Boggs stroked a too-thin finger down the line of his jaw. \u201cThere has been only one necromancer capable of controlling the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been known by many names.\u201d</p><p>Duncan snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know his current one?\u201d</p><p>Boggs shook his head. \u201cNo, but he was once Lord Zakhar.\u201d</p><p>Callie licked her dry lips. A true necromancer. It didn\u2019t seem possible. Like discovering Santa Claus was real.</p><p>Only scarier.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell us about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery little. He was a nobleman in the Russian court. From what I could learn he was growing in power when he was accused of being a sorcerer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot uncommon,\u201d Duncan surprisingly answered. \u201cRussian politics were always dangerous and social climbers often accused their rivals of foul deeds.\u201d</p><p>Boggs tapped the tip of his finger on his chin. \u201cTrue or not, he was burned at the stake three hundred years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Duncan growled. \u201cNecromancers can raise themselves from the dead?\u201d</p> <p>He took the words straight from Callie\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say he died,\u201d Boggs pointed out in sly tones.</p><p>Callie arched a brow. Many high-bloods had extended lives. Something not commonly known among norms. But not many could survive being burned at the stake.</p><p>\u201cThen what happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows.\u201d There was an edge in his voice that spoke of his annoyance at the lack of information. Boggs clearly understood that knowledge was power. \u201cThe locals assumed he died in the flames, but there were rumors a dark power swooped in to rescue him. Some say the devil rose up to claim him.\u201d</p> <p>Callie wrapped her arms around her waist, suddenly chilled to the bone.</p><p>Could it be him?</p><p>Was it possible that the man she\u2019d encountered in Leah\u2019s mind was a three-hundred-year-old necromancer with the ability to raise the dead?</p><p>\u201cDo you know what he looked like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stories claimed that he had eyes of diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Duncan muttered as he watched the color drain from her face.</p> <p>Boggs released his breath with a low hiss. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the flesh.\u201d Callie shuddered. \u201cHe was in the mind of a dead woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who\u2019s supposed to be answering the questions?\u201d Duncan snapped.</p><p>Boggs waved a thin hand. \u201cIt\u2019s an exchange of information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that the question is\u2014\u201d She was forced to halt and clear her throat. \u201cThe question is ... Who are you?\u201d</p><p>The white eyes widened. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>Callie frowned. It wasn\u2019t interesting. It was ominous. And threatening. And spooky as hell.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you see when you demanded that we meet the first time?\u201d she abruptly demanded.</p><p>The doppelganger froze, as if caught off guard by her question. Then, with a twitch of his robe, he was turning to head toward his pile of junk.</p><p>\u201cA minute,\u201d he murmured, delicately shifting through the strange collection. Duncan muttered something about lunatics, but she remained focused on Boggs as he made a sound of satisfaction. \u201cAh, here it is.\u201d</p><p>He returned to stand in front of her, holding up a tangled mound of pink yarn.</p><p>\u201cA baby blanket?\u201d she guessed.</p><p>Boggs held it to his face, his features becoming even more indistinct as he rubbed the material over his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt speaks of you.\u201d</p><p>Eek.</p><p>She ignored the way he seemed to savor the tactile feel of the cashmere against his skin. Or maybe it was the silent communication between him and the blanket.</p><p>\u201cWhy would a blanket speak of me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps it was once yours.\u201d</p><p>Highly doubtful, but she was willing to play along. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re walking through a graveyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead are stirring beneath your feet.\u201d</p><p>A far too vivid image of hands reaching from the grave to touch her seared through her mind. It was a dream she\u2019d been having all too frequently.</p><p>\u201cAre they trying to warn me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Callie Brown.\u201d</p><p>A cold ball of premonition formed in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to follow you.\u201d</p><p>The words hit Callie with the force of a tsunami, the stunned tidal wave of horror sweeping her under before she knew what was happening.</p><p>Falling forward, she was vaguely aware of Duncan racing to catch her in his arms before the darkness swallowed her whole.</p><p>Duncan muttered a string of curses, shifting Callie\u2019s limp body against his side, and pointed his gun at the bastard who was surging forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Duncan fired a warning shot close enough to the doppelganger\u2019s head to make him duck in fear. \u201cStay back,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cDuncan, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Callie murmured, managing to regain her balance although he kept a stubborn arm wrapped around her waist.</p><p>He turned to study her too-pale face with a scowl. \u201cPeople who are fine don\u2019t faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t faint,\u201d she ridiculously protested. \u201cI was just ... surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s one way of putting it.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward Boggs, her expression defiant despite the tiny tremors that Duncan could feel still racing through her body.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you saw, Boggs, but I can\u2019t raise the dead.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his thin hands in a pretense of innocence. \u201cI\u2019m just the messenger.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. Duncan\u2019s finger twitched as he tried to leash the urge to fire off another round. A bullet or two in Boggs\u2019s spongy flesh might teach him that not everyone enjoyed his mysterious mumbo jumbo.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything else?\u201d Callie asked, her voice unsteady.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to share?\u201d Duncan snapped.</p><p>Boggs gave another lift of his hands. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Callie shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe spoke to me,\u201d Fane said, his voice coming from directly behind them.</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t allow his attention to stray from the doppelganger as the Sentinel moved to stand beside a puzzled Callie.</p><p>\u201cFane?\u201d she muttered in disbelief.</p><p>Duncan made a sound of disgust. \u201cI presume there was a reason you didn\u2019t offer a full disclosure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter our first visit to Boggs I took Callie back to Valhalla before returning to the cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Boggs answered. \u201cHe threatened to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like men who give little girls nightmares,\u201d Fane growled, earning Duncan\u2019s complete approval.</p><p>Boggs, however, gave a click of his tongue. \u201cThe whispers were driving me nuts. Besides, I waited until she turned eighteen.\u201d</p><p>Duncan shot a brief glance toward Fane, but it was Callie who asked the burning question.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe warned me that a shadow was growing,\u201d the Sentinel said, his gaze trained on the doppelganger. \u201cAnd that if I failed in my duty to you, I would fail all high-bloods.\u201d</p><p>He heard Callie\u2019s breath catch at the reluctant confession. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>Fane shrugged. \u201cYou had enough to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder you\u2019ve been uberprotective,\u201d Callie muttered.</p><p>Duncan frowned. The warning might be vague, but unless the creature was a complete fraud then they were in some deep shit.</p><p>Corpses without hearts who disappeared from the morgue.</p><p>A crazy necro who could actually raise the dead.</p><p>And now some ominous shadow.</p><p>\u201cSo what is this shadow?\u201d he asked Boggs, not at all surprised when the thing shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. All I see is a darkness creeping over the high-bloods with Callie standing in the center.\u201d A genuine fear glowed in the white eyes. \u201cIf the darkness covers her then all is lost.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s fingers tightened on the gun. The thought that Callie was at the center of the brewing danger made him want to shoot something.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a master of melodrama with very few actual details that would help,\u201d he snapped, glaring at the doppelganger.</p><p>Boggs stiffened, clearly offended by Duncan\u2019s sharp accusation. \u201cI have offered all I have to give.\u201d</p><p>Callie sent him a chiding glance before stepping toward the creature. \u201cCan you tell us anything more about the necromancer?\u201d she asked, her voice pleading. \u201cHow do we find him?\u201d</p><p>A dense power filled the air as Boggs seemed to swell in size, his presence an overwhelming force.</p><p>\u201cSometimes to see into the future you must look into the past,\u201d he said in a voice that echoed through the room.</p><p>Duncan flinched. Oh man. He\u2019d been treating Boggs as if he were some harmless whack-job, not a magical high-blood that could quite possibly squash him like a bug.</p><p>It was a wonder he was still standing.</p><p>Then just to emphasize the point, Boggs spread his arms wide and with a shock wave of energy, he abruptly disappeared.</p><p>Poof.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Duncan rasped in shock.</p><p>Fane snorted. \u201cThat just about sums it up, cop.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Callie was exhausted by the time they reported their encounter with Boggs to the Mave. Even by a high-blood\u2019s standard it\u2019d been one hell of a day and all she wanted was to crawl into her bed and tumble into oblivion.</p><p>So why had she followed Duncan to his rooms instead of simply going to her apartment?</p><p>He was a big boy. She was fairly certain he could make the short distance without an escort. But even as she told herself to turn around and walk away, her feet were carrying her through his doorway and straight to the window that offered a view of the surrounding countryside bathed in moonlight.</p><p>\u201cDoppelganger,\u201d Duncan muttered as he shut the door. \u201cWhat other creatures don\u2019t I know about?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to turn; she could see his reflection in the window. The lean, hard body. The stark features that were shadowed with weariness. The hazel gaze that was checking out her ass.</p><p>He might be tired, but he was all male.</p><p>\u201cYou know I won\u2019t answer that question,\u201d she said.</p><p>He strolled to halt beside her. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I have a right to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to make those decisions.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re welcomed to return to the Mave and ask her if you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He snorted at her helpful suggestion. \u201cYeah, thanks but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>She turned to study him with a lift of her brows. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if they\u2019re dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have our own method of dealing with dangerous high-bloods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunters?\u201d</p><p>She nodded at the mention of the Sentinels who chased down renegades.

No one wants to piss him off,\u201d she said before giving a sudden shake of her head. \u201cWell, except the Mave.

The heat of his fingers seared her skin, sending jolts of sensual electricity darting through her body. \u201cDuncan,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>His hooded gaze sparked with gold in the dim overhead light. \u201cCan I hold you?\u201d</p><p>She licked her dry lips. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His fingers stroked up and down the back of her arm. \u201cWe\u2019re both tired and more than a little freaked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that another cheesy line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d His expression was oddly somber. \u201cI just want to feel you in my arms while I sleep.\u201d</p><p>Her heart missed a beat at the simple words. She\u2019d never had a man who just wanted to hold her. Actually, most men who were willing to have sex with her would have been horrified by the thought of sharing her bed.</p><p>She did, after all, peer into the minds of the dead.</p><p>The fact that Duncan genuinely seemed to want to hold her touched her in a deep, vulnerable place.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He wrinkled his nose. \u201cToo cheesy?\u201d</p><p>Cheesy? It was ... perilously perfect.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she husked.</p><p>His jaw tightened, as if preparing to be rejected. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>There was a tense pause as Callie silently weighed her options.</p><p>Logic warned that she should walk out the door and never look back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand what was happening between her and Duncan O\u2019Conner, though she did know that it was more than the usual lust for a prime stud-muffin.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to be logical.</p><p>Not tonight.</p><p>She might be accustomed to her lonely bed, she might even have convinced herself she preferred to be on her own, but as Duncan had pointed out, it had been a long, freaky day. No doubt the first of many.</p><p>Why shouldn\u2019t she enjoy a few hours wrapped in the arms of this gorgeous, drop-dead sexy cop?</p><p>A small smile curved her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t have my nightie.\u201d</p><p>An undefinable emotion flared through the hazel eyes as Duncan moved with a speed that would have rivaled a Sentinel to scoop her off her feet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he rasped, headed toward the bedroom. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>She allowed herself to relax against the hard muscles of his chest, her gaze caught by the golden stubble that shadowed the line of his jaw.</p><p>He was so ... male.</p><p>Uncompromisingly, ruthlessly male.</p><p>And yet, he held her with a gentle care that was oddly reassuring.</p><p>He might be aggressive and even violent when necessary, but he would never, ever harm her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you wear a nightie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome night soon I\u2019ll show you just what I do or don\u2019t wear,\u201d he promised with a wicked grin. \u201cTonight there are a couple robes hanging in the bathroon.\u201d Entering the comfortable, if impersonal bedroom done in shades of black and silver, he lowered her until her feet were touching the carpet. \u201cYou can use the bathroom first.\u201d</p><p>With a nod she hurried into the attached bathroom and closed the door.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she was shy. Or scared.</p><p>Or at least not exactly.</p><p>But on the day of her eighteenth birthday she\u2019d moved into her own apartment. She wasn\u2019t used to sharing a private space with anyone.</p><p>Stripping off her clothes, she stepped into the shower and turned it on hot enough to turn her skin rosy. Steam billowed around her as she soaped herself from head to toe before squeezing her favorite apple shampoo into her palm and quickly washing her hair.</p><p>She admired women like Serra who could keep their long hair perfectly coiffed (whatever the hell that meant). She, however, ended up looking like a porcupine by the end of the day. Besides, the unique color attracted the sort of attention she didn\u2019t want.</p><p>Hopping out of the shower, she quickly dried herself and pulled on one of the thick terry cloth robes. Then, leaving the bathroom, she returned to the bedroom, keeping her gaze locked on her bare toes.</p><p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>She felt him hesitate, as if he wanted to say something. Then she heard the steady tread of his footsteps as he headed into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Callie released the breath she\u2019d been unconsciously holding.</p><p>This was what she wanted.</p><p>It truly was.</p><p>But she felt as awkward as a teenager about to go on her first date.</p><p>No. This was worse. Her first date had been with a boy she\u2019d known for years. He\u2019d been warned by her foster mother, who happened to be a witch, that if he did anything more than hold her hand he would be turned into a slimy slug.</p><p>Certainly she hadn\u2019t been pacing the floor with the sensation of demented butterflies filling her belly.</p><p>And what was the deal with the temperature?</p><p>She was hot then cold then hot then ...</p><p>\u201cHey, relax, sweetheart,\u201d a male voice whispered in her ear, those strong arms again sweeping her off her feet to carry her to the nearby bed. \u201cI just want you close.\u201d</p><p>With care he settled her on the mattress and shucked off his robe to reveal his lean, surprisingly bronzed body covered by a pair of green boxers. She barely had the opportunity to appreciate the broad shoulders, the well-defined six-pack, and powerful thighs before he was sliding in the bed behind her, tugging the blanket over both of them.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She sucked in a deep breath, forcing her tense muscles to relax as the heat of his body seeped through her skin. He smelled of soap and toothpaste and an enticing scent that was uniquely Duncan O\u2019Conner. \u201cI\u2019ve never slept with anyone before ... I mean ... not for the whole night.\u201d</p><p>Cautiously he scooted closer, wrapping his arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cDo all high-bloods keep themselves so isolated?\u201d</p><p>She settled her head on the pillow, her gaze absently studying the oil painting depicting a field of daffodils that hung on the wall.</p><p>\u201cIt does seem to be a common trait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because you\u2019re afraid of trusting anyone?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to concentrate. She told herself her jitters were because she\u2019d never cuddled in bed with a man and tried to have a conversation. Her few sexual encounters had been brief with little in the way of actual chitchat.</p><p>It was bound to be awkward the first time, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Certainly it had nothing to do with the intrusive images of what would happen if she shimmied out of her robe and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cFor some.\u201d She was forced to clear her throat. She wasn\u2019t going to imagine rubbing herself against all that male hardness. Or her sensitive nipples being tickled by his golden chest hair as he nuzzled kisses down the curve of her neck. Nope. Not gonna do it. \u201cMost have special abilities that mean they have to maintain constant control when they\u2019re around others,\u201d she managed to continue. \u201cThey need time and space just to relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d His warm breath puffed against her nape, sending arrows of pleasure down her spine. \u201cCops don\u2019t have special powers, but after a day spent in the gutters they need some serious decompression. Not all spouses understand why we want to go to a bar and toss back a few shots or lay on the couch and try to pretend that we can forget the sight of a young woman found dead on her kitchen floor.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. For once they were completely alone with no danger of being overheard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not entirely true, is it?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you don\u2019t have special powers.\u201d</p><p>He tensed, remaining silent for a long minute. Callie bit her bottom lip, regretting her impulsive question. It was beyond intrusive to prod into a person\u2019s private gifts. Even the youngest high-blood knew that.</p><p>If Duncan wanted her to know about his powers he would have told her.</p><p>The apology was on the tip of her tongue when Duncan abruptly broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything for certain,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYou work very hard to keep them hidden.\u201d She hesitated, torn between curiosity and the manners that had been drilled into her from the cradle. Curiosity won. \u201cAre you ashamed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot ashamed,\u201d he clarified, his voice pensive but thankfully not angry. \u201cBut when I was very young my ma warned me never to speak about my ... gift.\u201d</p><p>A typical response. Mothers around the world did what they could to protect their children.</p><p>Well, except for hers. Her loving parents dropped her in the nearest trash can.</p> <p>\u201cDid she think it was a curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she was worried I might be taken from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She kept her gaze trained on the daffodil painting even as she was vividly aware of his lean body pressed against her back. It was somehow easier to share confidences without being face to face. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Another pause before he answered in a voice so low she barely heard him.</p><p>\u201cI see auras.\u201d</p> <p>She sucked in a startled breath. \u201cA soul-gazer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoul-gazer.\u201d Duncan allowed the words to rattle around his brain. He\u2019d never heard the term, but it seemed oddly right.</p><p>\u201cYou can see the souls of people, right?\u201d Callie asked, the very casualness of her tone easing the raw knot of discomfort in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>Revealing his darkest secret was like stripping in a crowd and allowing a bunch of strangers to measure his dick. The fact that she treated his \u201cbig-reveal\u201d like it was an everyday occurrence made him feel less ... exposed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rare gift,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re such a good cop.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned at her soft words. He\u2019d worked his ass off over the years to reach his position of sergeant.</p><p>\u201cHey, it takes more than a flash of color around a perp to make me a good cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched with a grudging humor. Okay. Maybe he\u2019d used his abilities to sense the guilt or innocence of a perp.</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d he agreed, his fingers absently toying with the belt of her robe.</p><p>When he\u2019d first climbed into bed with Callie he\u2019d barely been able to think beyond the fierce desire that had pounded through him. He wasn\u2019t an animal. Or at least most of the time he wasn\u2019t an animal. But being in bed with the female who\u2019d haunted his dreams for more nights than he wanted to admit was doing wicked things to his libido.</p><p>He wanted her with a compulsive need that was becoming downright painful.</p><p>Only the memory of her trembling unease when he\u2019d come out of the bathroom kept him from sliding his hands beneath the robe to explore the ivory silk of her skin.</p> <p>When he became her lover it would be when she was soft and melting in his arms.</p><p>Not skittish with nerves.</p><p>\u201cNo one but your mother knows?\u201d she asked, thankfully unaware of his struggles.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was struck by a sudden thought. \u201cAre you going to tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you want me to.\u201d</p><p>That sounded waaaay too easy.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t some sort of duty to report high-bloods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Now the catch.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>She hesitated, as if considering her words. \u201cI\u2019m sure Fane would have sensed your powers.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d suspected as much, but that didn\u2019t stop his stab of annoyance. The last thing he wanted was the pain-in-the-ass Sentinel to have something to hold over his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd he said nothing?\u201d he growled. \u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to you,\u201d she corrected, snuggling deeper into the mattress, the short strands of her damp hair glistening like licks of flame against the white pillow. \u201cBut he would have reported to the Master of Gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster of Gifts?\u201d He made a sound of disbelief. It sounded like a character from a video game. \u201cIs that a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Calder and his order search for high-bloods around the world.\u201d</p><p>Great. There was an entire order searching for high-bloods.</p><p>\u201cShould I expect to be hauled to his office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth?\u201d</p><p>He actually considered her question.</p><p>He\u2019d been going along just fine by pretending his abilities were nothing more than a quirk of nature. Like being double jointed or color blind.</p><p>Why rock the boat?</p><p>Then the realization that if Fane knew he had powers, the boat was not only rocked but in danger of capsizing. He heaved a sigh of resignation.</p><p>\u201cHit me with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would already have checked you out and determined you aren\u2019t a threat to yourself or others.\u201d</p><p>Oh. He wasn\u2019t dancing for freaking joy that he\u2019d been secretly checked out, but really was it that much different from Internal Affairs?</p><p>Besides, if it meant he was going to be left in peace, he\u2019d take it.</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re not going to try and keep me here?\u201d he asked, not about to take anything for granted.</p><p>You know, assumptions making asses out of gullible cops.</p><p>\u201cValhalla isn\u2019t a prison.\u201d She paused, clearly realizing she wasn\u2019t being completely honest. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not a prison unless you\u2019ve committed some sort of crime.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to dig into the justice system set up by the high-bloods. Cops who poked their noses where they didn\u2019t belong soon had them chopped off.</p><p>\u201cAnd they won\u2019t say anything? My chief\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour secret is safe, cop,\u201d she assured him, abruptly yawning as the stressful day caught up with her. \u201cNow can we go to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can,\u201d he murmured, pressing a kiss to the nape of her neck.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Duncan allowed himself to appreciate the simple joy of having Callie in his arms.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that he was hard and aching with a desire to consume her. Or that her robe rubbed roughly against his bare skin.</p><p>The creepy Boggs had warned that Callie was the center of a coming darkness, and whether the doppelganger was the real deal or just a nut-bar, Duncan sensed that this moment of peace was going to be a rare commodity in the future.</p><p>He intended to savor every second of holding her close.</p><p>Unfortunately, as much as he was enjoying the feel and scent of his beautiful companion, he couldn\u2019t shut off his mind as it shuffled and reshuffled through the implications of his secret no longer being so secret.</p><p>Assuming that Callie had fallen asleep, he was caught off guard when her hand lightly brushed over his fingers, still clutching the belt of her robe.</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut as a jolt of heat speared through him at her light touch.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d he managed from between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes popped open with surprise. How the hell had she known something was bothering him?</p><p>\u201cAre you psychic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFemale intuition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYow.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cNow that I\u2019m all too familiar with. My ma and sisters could sniff out a lie a mile away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know it\u2019s a waste of time to deny that something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wrong,\u201d he denied.</p><p>She squeezed his fingers. \u201cTalk to me, cop.\u201d</p><p>Wild horses couldn\u2019t have dragged the question from him if it had come from anyone but this woman.</p><p>But Callie was different.</p><p>She ... understood. In every way.</p><p>\u201cAre there other people like me?\u201d He asked the question that had been gnawing at him.</p><p>\u201cSoul-gazers?\u201d She seemed startled by his interest. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A short pause. \u201cDo you want to meet them?\u201d</p><p>Did he? There was no denying a tiny temptation to actually speak with someone who shared his talents. Perhaps even to discover how to hone it so it would be a more effective tool.</p><p>But was he truly prepared to come out of the closet?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, his voice tight. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to hurry,\u201d she assured him, her tone distracted, as if she were troubled by a sudden thought. \u201cIn fact, it might be better that your gift doesn\u2019t become common knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cIt\u2019s just a theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the necromancer we\u2019re searching for can truly raise the dead then we need to be able to spot them.\u201d</p><p>Yeesh. Walking dead? They belonged in B-rated movies. Not shuffling along the streets of Kansas City.</p><p>\u201cI would think walking corpses would be a little obvious in a crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if the magic gives them the appearance of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Duncan scowled. Like the thought of rotting zombies wasn\u2019t bad enough without the possibility that dead people could be waltzing around without anyone knowing. \u201cI suppose I can\u2019t just start shooting people to see if they\u2019re alive or dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer you didn\u2019t.\u201d Slowly she turned her head to glance over her shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s an easier way you could help.\u201d</p><p>He braced for her answer, already sensing he wasn\u2019t going to like it. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dead person has no soul.\u201d</p><p>He studied her pale face in confusion, wondering if she were teasing him.</p><p>Then he sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>Of course. He could see the auras that flickered around people.</p><p>Which meant if there was no aura, he was seeing a corpse.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to be a zombie-hunter,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWho better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Callie wasn\u2019t entirely shocked that she managed to sleep through the night. She\u2019d been on the verge of utter exhaustion, both mentally and physically.</p><p>And there was something to be said for having her own private heater to keep her toasty warm.</p><p>But she\u2019d been so tense when he\u2019d snuggled in behind her that it seemed difficult to imagine that she could actually relax enough to fall asleep.</p><p>Slowly coming awake, she managed to pry open her heavy eyes, surprised to discover the room still shrouded in shadows. Usually she had to set her alarm clock if she wanted to wake up before noon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So why was she awake at such an ungodly hour?</p><p>It took several minutes to realize what had pulled her out of her dreams. Probably because the feel of warm, male lips stroking over the sensitive skin of her neck was precisely what she\u2019d been dreaming about.</p><p>Clearly sensing she was awake, Duncan buried his face in the curve of her neck. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p> <p>She shivered, but it wasn\u2019t with nerves. After an entire night of erotic dreams, she was no longer tense at the thought of spending a few hours in the arms of this man.</p><p>Actually, she felt all melty as he spooned close enough for her to feel the hard length of his arousal pressing against her lower back.</p><p>\u201cYou woke me,\u201d she murmured, her voice husky.</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d His tongue traced up the back of her neck, pausing at the tiny dip just below her ear. \u201cYou smell like apples.\u201d</p><p>She trembled at the rasp of his morning beard, instinctively pressing her head deeper into the pillow as she invited him to continue his sensual exploration.</p> <p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly,\u201d he breathed in her ear, giving her lobe a sharp nip.</p><p>She jerked in pleasure, her heart picking up speed. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>He trailed his lips along her jaw, his touch seeming to sear her skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a morning person.\u201d</p><p>Of course he was. She wrinkled her nose.</p> <p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d His arms tightened around her, surrounding her in delicious heat. \u201c\u2018Ugh\u2019 isn\u2019t a word a man likes to hear from the woman waking in his arms.\u201d</p><p>Callie swallowed her moan as he pressed his cheek to hers, his breath brushing her lips with the promise of a kiss.</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have woken me up in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard that the early bird gets the worm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you go hunt your worms and I\u2019ll ...\u201d She forgot how to speak as his hand slid beneath her robe to cup one aching breast. \u201cDuncan.\u201d</p><p>With a skill that made her eyes slide shut in feminine bliss, he circled her nipple with the tip of his finger.</p><p>\u201cYou told me to go hunting,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou\u2019re the only prey I\u2019m interested in.\u201d</p> <p>Her hand clutched his arm as he tormented the sensitive bud with light, teasing strokes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I like being called prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d With a speed that caught her off guard, Duncan had her robe pulled open and was yanking it off her body. \u201cYou be the bird and I\u2019ll be the worm.\u201d He pressed his fully engorged cock against the bare skin of her ass. \u201cI have better equipment for the role.\u201d</p><p>She gave a husky chuckle as he pressed a line of kisses down her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d He growled low in his throat, one hand continuing to pleasure her breast while the other slid down the flat plane of her stomach. \u201cMy god, you feel so good in my arms.\u201d</p><p>She arched her back, shocked by her sizzling reaction to his every touch. It was as if she were perfectly tuned to his seduction.</p><p>Or maybe he was so practiced in pleasing a female he knew just how to elicit the response he wanted.</p><p>The thought was oddly troublesome.</p><p>\u201cDo you do this often?\u201d</p><p>His lips explored down her shoulder blade, his hand skimming along her hip and over her thigh to slip between her legs.</p><p>\u201cHold you in my arms?\u201d he teased. \u201cNot nearly often enough.\u201d</p><p>She pulled in a shaky breath, barely capable of thinking as he gently tugged her leg up and over his hip, leaving her exposed to the caress of his searching fingers.</p><p>\u201cWake up in strange beds,\u201d she managed in a strangled voice.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been with a woman since my divorce,\u201d he confessed, his lips settling at a tender point on her nape as his fingers drew absent patterns on her inner thigh.</p><p>She groaned, a damp heat forming between her legs as his fingers strayed ever higher.</p><p>Oh ... baby.</p><p>It was almost more than she could stand. The tingles of electric pleasure darted from the tips of his fingers straight to the aching void in the pit of her stomach. The gentle tug on her hardened nipple. And the brush of warm lips up and down her nape.</p><p>No man had taken such care to ensure she was so fully aroused.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His fingers traveled another inch higher. \u201cThere\u2019s the obvious reason.\u201d</p><p>She grasped his forearm. Not to stop him. Hell, she might strangle him if he tried to halt.</p><p>But it was becoming increasingly difficult to remain still beneath his bold caresses and she had to do something to keep from squirming right off the bed.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be in the same room with you without imagining you stripped naked and spread across the nearest bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ...\u201d She squeaked as his fingers at last found the tender cleft, his touch so feather-light it only added to her rising frustration.</p><p>\u201cDangerous,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cBut not as dangerous as the less obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>Oh lord, it was hard to follow his words.</p><p>Her nails dug into his arm, her hips angling forward in a silent plea for satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cShould I ask?\u201d</p><p>His fingers gave a tug on her nipple, sending a blast of heat through her taut body.</p><p>\u201cYou fascinate me.\u201d</p><p>Trembling beneath the onslaught of sensations, Callie lightly raked her nails up his hair-roughened arm, ridiculously pleased when he gave a low hiss of pleasure.</p><p>Hey, what was good for the gander was good for the goose.</p><p>Or something like that.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a freak?\u201d she asked, her heart missing a beat as one finger slid into the slick heat of her body.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re clever.\u201d He stroked deeper. \u201cAnd strong.\u201d Another mind-destroying stroke. \u201cAnd aggravatingly elusive.\u201d Stroke, stroke. She bit her bottom lip, straining to contain her building explosion. \u201cYour talents are just the icing on the cake.\u201d</p><p>How did he always know exactly what to say?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought of them as icing,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cCallie, you\u2019re sweet goodness from the top of your head to the tips of your toes.\u201d With a swift motion he had her turned flat on her back. Before she could even catch her breath, he was poised above her, offering her a wicked grin. \u201cLet me demonstrate.\u201d</p><p>An exquisite shudder shook her body. Oh lord, she was more than eager for a demonstration.</p><p>In this moment, she no longer cared that there was a powerful necromancer out there potentially raising an army of the walking dead. Or that Boggs had more or less implied she was supposed to stop them.</p><p>Or even that Duncan would soon be returning to his world of norms while she was destined to remain at Valhalla.</p><p>There were times when a woman had to grab at happiness, no matter how fleeting it might prove to be.</p><p>As if sensing her capitulation, Duncan growled low in his throat, his hands skimming restlessly over her bare skin as he lowered his head to scatter tiny kisses over her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted this for so long,\u201d he muttered, his tongue outlining her lips. \u201cToo long.\u201d</p><p>Callie gave a welcoming groan as one roaming hand returned between her thighs to stroke through her growing dampness.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s stopping you,\u201d she pointed out, breathless.</p><p>He crushed her lips in a searing kiss. \u201cI want to worship you,\u201d he husked as his finger slid into her tight flesh. \u201cSlowly.\u201d</p><p>Callie instinctively dug her heels into the mattress as she arched her hips upward.</p><p>\u201cSlow is fine. But, this is ... is ...\u201d Oh man, his finger was creating the most delicious sensations as he dipped it in and out of her. \u201cTorture.\u201d</p><p>His lips cruised over her cheek, then down the line of her jaw. \u201cNo, sweetheart, this is torture.\u201d He pressed a kiss to the pulse racing at the base of her throat. \u201cAnd this.\u201d His mouth trailed down until he could latch onto the tip of her breast. \u201cAnd this.\u201d He used his tongue to lash the delicate nipple until she was panting with need.</p><p>The aggravating man. He wasn\u2019t playing fair.</p><p>Lifting her hands, she shoved her fingers in his golden hair and wrapped her legs around his hips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for this, cop.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, he regarded her with a faint smile, the flecks of gold shimmering in the hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d</p><p>She deliberately rubbed herself against the granite-hard length of his erection.</p><p>\u201cOh, I promise.\u201d</p><p>He started to lower his head, only to pause as his gaze caught sight of the tiny tattoo hidden behind her ear. His finger brushed the delicate black hieroglyph.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA spell of protection against common diseases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by any human illness.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as a blush stained her cheeks. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt keeps me from becoming pregnant until I\u2019m ready to have children.\u201d She shifted beneath him. \u201cOf course I have to have sex before I need to worry about that possibility.\u201d</p><p>His breath caught. \u201cCallie.\u201d Bracing himself on his elbow, he shifted until the tip of his cock pressed against her entrance. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>She tugged his hair, meeting his oddly watchful gaze. \u201cI\u2019m a big girl. I know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want any regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan, if you don\u2019t get on with it, I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Not giving her time to complete her empty threat, Duncan tilted his hips forward, sliding into her with a slow, relentless thrust.</p><p>Hissing softly, Callie clutched at Duncan\u2019s shoulders, her nails digging into his skin. Yes, yes, yes. It felt ... perfect.</p><p>Achingly perfect.</p><p>Already prepared for his entry, her body readily accommodated his erection. Still, there was a delicious sense of fullness, and a startling connection, that she hadn\u2019t been expecting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In this moment she was joined to Duncan. Joined in a way that seemed far more poignant than two bodies simply having sex.</p><p>It was ...</p><p>Her mind instantly veered from examining the powerful feelings that sizzled through her. Dammit. This wasn\u2019t supposed to be more than a fleeting pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cCallie,\u201d he whispered close to her ear. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, just don\u2019t stop,\u201d she moaned, burying her face in the curve of his neck.</p><p>\u201cStop? Not even if there was a gun pointed to my head,\u201d he muttered, pulling from her body before pushing back in with an increasing urgency. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything so good.\u201d</p><p>Callie agreed as he was once again withdrawing and thrusting forward with a rhythm that stole her breath. Mmmm. This was what she\u2019d wanted from the minute she\u2019d laid eyes on Duncan O\u2019Conner.</p><p>Squeezing her eyes shut, Callie scored her nails down his back, pleased when he hissed in pleasure. She dug her nails deeper, rewarded as his lips found hers in a wild, demanding kiss.</p> <p>His hips rocked faster, his hands scooping beneath her hips to angle them upward to meet his deep, steady thrusts.</p><p>\u201cDuncan ... hurry,\u201d she muttered against his lips, her body clenched so tightly she felt as if she might shatter.</p><p>\u201cJust let it happen, sweetheart.\u201d Angling his head downward, he tormented her tender nipple, his hips pumping faster and faster as she arched off the bed to meet him.</p><p>Callie\u2019s breath rasped through the shadows, her concentration narrowing to the precise point where Duncan\u2019s body surged in and out of her.</p><p>She was racing toward a critical goal.</p><p>And she was close.</p> <p>So close.</p><p>And then ... it happened.</p><p>With one last surge he catapulted her over the finish line, sending her into a convulsion of exquisite bliss.</p><p>He muffled her scream of pleasure with a fierce kiss, continuing to pump into her shuddering body until he stiffened with his own release.</p><p>Dropping his head into the curve of her neck, Duncan struggled to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cMy god.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Dawn was barely creeping over the horizon when Zak entered the panic room built in the basement.</p> <p>The six-by-six cement room was built for protection, not comfort. There were no windows, the door was six-inch steel, and there was no furniture beyond a narrow bed.</p><p>Certain the door was locked and Anya standing guard outside, Zak settled on the bed and closed his eyes. Slowing his breath, then the beat of his heart, he delved into the place inside himself that contained his power.</p><p>It was dark and cold. A bottomless pit that had nearly swallowed him whole the first time he tapped it.</p><p>Now he grimly braced himself as he touched the icy depths, battling not to be sucked in even as he forced the darkness to pulse through his veins, the frigid power searing through him with a pain few others would be able to tolerate.</p><p>For him, it was a reminder of the cost of failure.</p><p>One slip and the darkness would destroy him.</p><p>Submerged in his power, Zak reached for the small bowl on the mattress next to him. Once it was settled in his lap, he placed his hands over Leah\u2019s heart, releasing the magic into the beating organ.</p><p>There was a brief, disorienting moment as he slid from his corporal body and winged his way south of town to a neighborhood even more exclusive than the one he\u2019d chosen.</p><p>He entered Leah\u2019s body, hissing as the darkness abruptly swelled up, trying to claim him.</p><p>No. He clenched his teeth, his muscles rigid with strain. He was the master. Death would bow to him.</p><p>Sweat beaded his brow, but with clenched jaw he leashed the power and carefully allowed it to trickle into Leah\u2019s corpse.</p><p>Slowly, slowly he filled her, lodging his consciousness in her mind.</p><p>Only when he was certain he had full control did he open the eyes of his vessel and glance around.</p><p>Not surprising, he was lying in the back of a parked car. Tony had once again been pressed into service, driving Leah\u2019s corpse to the chichi neighborhood, close enough to the house he wanted without being noticeable.</p><p>As Zak sat up in Leah\u2019s body, he caught sight of Tony slumped against the door, lazily surfing the net on his phone. Then, perhaps sensing he was being watched, he turned to cast a bored glance over his shoulder.</p><p>At the sight of Leah the vicious killer released a scream that would have rivaled a teenage girl, emptying his bladder all over his fine chino slacks.</p><p>Ignoring the servant, Zak awkwardly pushed open the door of the car and stepped onto the shadowed street.</p><p>He (or rather Leah) swayed as he struggled to keep his balance. For all his skill it always took a few minutes to gain command over the body. Glancing down, he vaguely noticed he was dressed in a new pair of stretchy workout pants and a sports bra. Anya had chosen the clothing, claiming that Leah liked to go to the gym in the mornings. He didn\u2019t care what was covering the body so long as it didn\u2019t attract unwanted attention.</p><p>His focus was on the amulet that was strung around his neck by a thin gold chain. A lethal spell was etched into the soft metal, just waiting to be released.</p><p>Assured he had his weapon, Zak gave a swift glance around the sleeping neighborhood before crossing the tree-lined street. His movements grew progressively more fluid as he followed the curved driveway leading to a three-storied home built of a pale red stone.</p><p>The roof was sharply slanted and shingled with dark tiles. The large windows were framed by white shutters and to one side was a four-car garage.</p><p>At the front was a wide veranda with stately columns and double doors that were an invitation for the enemy to enter.</p><p>A sneer curved Zak\u2019s lips, an odd sensation as he realized Leah had recently had them plumped with a noxious silicone. He\u2019d spent decades tracking down the relic demanded by Anya\u2019s gods. And years more, to discover who was hiding the object.</p><p>The last six months had been devoted to monitoring Calso\u2019s every movement.</p><p>He knew when the bastard woke up, when he went to work, when he went to bed, when he shit. He\u2019d also done an equally thorough investigation on the man\u2019s servants. He knew their routine better than they did.</p><p>Unfortunately, the constant surveillance on Calso hadn\u2019t revealed the location of the coin, and with no guarantee he could pluck the knowledge from his mind once he was dead, Zak had been forced to come up with a plan that would give him the opportunity to search the house without alerting his prey.</p><p>Which was how he\u2019d chosen Leah.</p><p>As Calso\u2019s lover she\u2019d been put into his security system. Which meant she was the only person besides Calso who could enter and leave without disturbing the security guard who patrolled the grounds.</p><p>And more importantly she remained human despite his magic that filled her corpse. The paranoid Calso had paid a fortune to have a powerful spell wrapped around his property to detect high-bloods. If he or Anya had gotten within a hundred feet of the house they would have set off a dozen alarms.</p><p>Halting in front of the door, Zak pressed his hand to the electronic reader. There was a low buzzing sound as the scanner read his fingerprints, then with a soft click the doors swung inward.</p><p>Zak didn\u2019t hesitate as he entered the marble foyer that towered two stories, with arched windows that gave ample light for the tangle of plants that grew along the edge of the black and white marble tiled floor.</p><p>He ignored the double staircase that swept in a graceful arch toward the second floor, walking directly between them to the sunken living room at the back of the house.</p><p>He was equally indifferent to the white sectional couch that was arranged around the glass cylinder aquarium that was built from floor to ceiling. And the beautifully carved white marble fireplace where two black vases offered a stark contrast to the acres of white.</p><p>His only interest was reaching the office that he\u2019d seen in Leah\u2019s memories.</p><p>From what he could determine before Callie had so rudely intruded into his search of the young female\u2019s mind, the office was the one place in the mansion that Calso refused to allow her to enter.</p><p>It seemed the feasible place to start his search.</p><p>Crossing the white carpet, he was just steps away from the closed door on the far side of the room when a faint sound had him spinning around.</p><p>He swallowed a curse at the sight of the short, nearly bald man with a round face and black, beady eyes. Around sixty years old, he was wearing nothing but a pair of boxers with his rotund belly sticking out like a hairy basketball.</p><p>Zak barely suppressed his sneer. It seemed impossible to believe that this pathetic norm could actually hold a piece of the gods.</p><p>\u201cLeah?\u201d Calso frowned, his expression wary even as his gaze slid a compulsive glance down Leah\u2019s slender body. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Zak clinically debated his option.</p><p>The easiest path would be to kill the fool and continue with his search.</p><p>On the downside, there were servants who would soon be waking. They were bound to eventually stumble over their dead employer.</p><p>Besides, he could use Calso\u2019s pathetic obsession with the young female to help narrow down the exact location of his prize.</p><p>Forcing his feet to take a step forward, he gave a toss of his head, feeling his hair brushing the bare skin of his arms. It might have been centuries since he\u2019d allowed himself to be led by his dick, but he remembered what had once excited him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>The dark gaze compulsively lowered to Leah\u2019s breasts, barely concealed by the sports bra, but his frown remained.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my phone.\u201d Zak shrugged. \u201cI thought I might have left it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you decided to search for it at this hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause as the man struggled between suspicion and his libido.</p><p>Not surprisingly his libido won.</p><p>\u201cA lucky coincidence,\u201d he growled, strolling forward.</p><p>Zak covertly turned his head away from the windows that were beginning to lighten with the coming dawn.</p><p>His motor skills were improving, but only the shadows hid Leah\u2019s lack of facial expression. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. What do you suppose we should do about it?\u201d</p> <p>The man trailed his fingers along the neckline of Leah\u2019s sports bra before slipping his fingers beneath the stretchy material and giving the breast a squeeze. Miles away, Zak grimaced, fiercely thankful he didn\u2019t have to feel the pudgy fingers groping him.</p><p>\u201cI have a few ideas,\u201d Calso purred.</p><p>\u201cI bet you do.\u201d</p><p>A flush stained the man\u2019s round face. \u201cUpstairs. Now.\u201d</p><p>Zak made what he hoped sounded like a giggle. \u201cI have a better idea.\u201d</p> <p>He arched a brow. \u201cGames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatch me.\u201d</p><p>Without giving the fool a chance to react, Zak turned and hurried the short distance to the end of the room.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Leah, what are you doing?\u201d the man growled, in instant pursuit.</p><p>\u201cPlaying.\u201d Zak opened the door and darted into the office, taking a quick inventory of the room.</p><p>A leather sofa and wing chairs surrounding a lacquer table. Several tall bookcases that were stuffed with aged leather books. A heavy walnut desk set by the marble fireplace with a wide mantel that held a number of bronze statues.</p> <p>At last he turned back to watch Calso storm into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like my game?\u201d Zak prodded, carefully monitoring Calso\u2019s gaze, which instinctively shifted toward the area of the desk.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re not allowed in here.\u201d</p><p>Zak backed toward the desk, his gaze never leaving Calso\u2019s revealing eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my private office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not business hours. Don\u2019t you want me naked on your desk?\u201d</p> <p>Zak reached the corner of the desk, lifting a hand to shove back his thick curtain of hair. How did females tolerate the itchy stuff?</p><p>Calso hesitated, the dark eyes narrowing in speculation. Was he debating the pleasure of banging her on the glossy surface?</p><p>Clearly, Zak hadn\u2019t found the sweet spot.</p><p>Before Calso could try and pin him to the desk, Zak was sliding to the side, heading directly for the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you would rather I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Calso snapped as he lurched forward. \u201cGet away from there.\u201d</p><p>Zak followed the man\u2019s worried gaze. Ah. How tediously predictable. A wall safe hidden behind the Picasso.</p><p>\u201cAs you command,\u201d he drawled, moving to stand directly in front of Calso.</p><p>The man started to relax until he caught sight of the amulet that was beginning to glow in the clinging darkness.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Zak managed to stretch the rigid lips into a smile. \u201cDeath.\u201d</p><p>Calso stumbled back, fear and confusion twisting the pudgy face. But it was far too late. He\u2019d barely taken a step backward when the amulet released its magic, slamming into him with a lethal force.</p><p>Zak watched Calso drop to his knees, the skin ripping like tissue paper as the magic inside him began to swell and expand.</p><p>Magic was never a pleasant way to die.</p><p>And this was a particularly nasty spell.</p><p>But effective, he had to concede, stepping back as the dead man fell face first onto the rare Persian carpet, swiftly turning into nothing but charred ashes.</p><p>Anya was nothing if not efficient.</p><p>Assured the man was dead, Zak turned away, crossing to the fireplace.</p><p>It took less than five minutes to find the trigger on the Picasso that allowed it to swing forward, revealing the safe set in the wall. Reaching up, he pressed his hand against the scanner, not at all surprised when he heard the lock click.</p><p>The arrogant bastard never considered his own lover might betray him.</p><p>Hubris.</p><p>The weakness of every wealthy man.</p><p>Reaching for the small handle on the safe, he tugged it open.</p><p>Anticipation hummed through him as he reached inside and shoved aside the papers to find the pale stone vessel that was shaped like a small vase with an odd winged creature etched on the front. With care he pried out the cotton that blocked the opening at the top of the vessel and turned it upside down to shake out the coin inside.</p><p>A mile to the north, his heart in his real body gave a sudden leap.</p><p>Soon...</p><p>Soon he would have the just rewards he so richly deserved.</p><p>Still struggling to catch his breath, Duncan shifted to lie on his side, studying Callie\u2019s delicate profile outlined by the rosy promise of dawn.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t been good sex.</p><p>It had been ... cataclysmic sex.</p><p>Shattering.</p><p>But why?</p><p>Holding her close, he tried on a few excuses.</p><p>He\u2019d been celibate for too long. A man wasn\u2019t meant to be without a woman in his bed, right?</p><p>He\u2019d been fantasizing about this woman for longer than he wanted to admit.</p><p>He was under a shitload of stress. Everyone knew that adrenaline made everything seem to be in Technicolor. Including sex.</p><p>Unfortunately he couldn\u2019t make any of the lame-ass excuses fit.</p><p>What had just happened between them defied explanation.</p><p>A fact that should have scared the hell out of him.</p><p>Instead, it just juiced him up with the need to have her again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>And again ...</p><p>Already hardening with anticipation, Duncan abruptly frowned as he realized that while he\u2019d been reveling in the image of round two, Callie was lost in thoughts that had nothing to do with him or hot, sweaty sex.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He brushed his finger down the thin blade of her nose. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, as if coming back from a long distance. Then slowly she turned her head to meet his narrowed gaze. \u201cI was just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it brought a frown to that lovely face?\u201d His finger moved to trace the furrow that marred her brow. \u201cYou promised you weren\u2019t going to regret what happened in this bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about\u201d\u2014a lovely blush stained her cheeks\u2014\u201cthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even worse,\u201d he chided, captivated by the sight of her gemstone eyes catching and reflecting the first strands of light. Man. Had there ever been anything more beautiful? \u201cI\u2019m already a distant memory.\u201d Using his free hand, he stroked down the curve of her back, pressing her against his stirring arousal. \u201cMaybe I should remind you the kind of fireworks we strike off each other.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m never going to forget.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her husky tone, his gaze lingering on her lips, which were still red and swollen from his kisses.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cArrogant.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded as he sensed her lingering distraction. As much as he longed to drown in the silken pleasure of her body, Duncan wanted her full and complete attention when he was seducing her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Callie,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI was just thinking about what Boggs said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore breakfast?\u201d He gave a dramatic shudder. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re not a morning person.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his teasing. \u201cHe said that \u2018to see into the future you must look into the past.\u201d\u2019</p><p>Duncan snorted. Boggs had unnerved him more than he wanted to admit, but he didn\u2019t want Callie taking risks just because some crazy doppelganger implied that he\u2019d seen her in some psychic vision.</p><p>\u201cHe said a lot of ridiculous things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She chewed her bottom lip. \u201cMaybe not.\u201d</p><p>His spidey-senses jangled. He knew that look. And it was never good.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you scheming?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even blink at his impressive ability to read her expression. Why would she? She\u2019d been raised among people who could peer into her every thought.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be some way we can discover more about Lord Zakhar.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, desperately battling against the primitive male urge to inform her that there was no way in hell she was going to put herself in danger. His sisters had taught him that the swiftest way to get a woman to do something was to tell her she couldn\u2019t. Sexist? Maybe. But the knowledge had come in handy on more than one occasion.</p><p>\u201cInternet?\u201d he instead suggested. \u201cI know a computer whiz at the station who could locate any information you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to find original journals if possible. They tend to be a little more reliable.\u201d</p><p>Of course she preferred the originals. It couldn\u2019t have been that simple.</p><p>\u201cWill you travel to Russia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Fane can take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cIt\u2019s his job.\u201d</p><p>It was. That didn\u2019t mean Duncan had to like it.</p><p>\u201cFine. Then I\u2019ll do my job and start a search for a strange Russian who has recently come to town.\u201d His mind was already shifting through his various contacts. \u201cIf there\u2019s word in the streets I\u2019ll hear it.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to touch the whiskers that shadowed his jaw. \u201cYou sound like a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to press his lips to the center of her palm. \u201cNo, I feel like a man who wants to lock away his lover to keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her hand away, her lips thinning in silent warning. \u201cDuncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart,\u201d he hastily assured her. \u201cI might occasionally act like a caveman, but I\u2019m well aware I can\u2019t drag you off to my cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you want to keep your family jewels.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. \u201cPoint made.\u201d He smoothed his fingers through the rumpled crimson silk of her hair. \u201cBesides, I understand better than anyone how important your gifts are to the world. It would be a sin against nature not to share them.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to mock me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that what you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d He shifted his hand to cup her cheek as she tried to turn away. \u201cCallie, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Grudgingly she turned back to meet his somber gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery time you take a murderer off the street you save lives.\u201d He brushed her bottom lip with his thumb. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine how many people owe you their future.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, clearly uncomfortable at being praised for her gifts. \u201cHopefully a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few?\u201d He made a sound of disbelief. \u201cSmithfield alone was on a pace to kill at least one child a week.

Although I\u2019m not opposed to further exploration.\u201d</p><p>She punched his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded. \u201cI know you, Callie Brown. At least what you\u2019re willing to share. Which isn\u2019t much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me you\u2019re forced to wade through the muck to accomplish your job.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means you never celebrate when a killer is arrested because you remember the death and destruction that you weren\u2019t able to prevent.\u201d His fingers lightly traced the stubborn line of her jaw. \u201cAm I right?\u201d</p><p>A hint of need softened her expression. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, like me, you keep others at a distance because you know they don\u2019t see the world with the same eyes.\u201d</p><p>She studied him for a long minute. Wary. Or maybe cautious. \u201cYou think we\u2019re the same?\u201d</p><p>He paused. It would be easy to make a flippant comment. A teasing remark that would deflect her attention without revealing his growing vulnerability.</p> <p>But meeting the sapphire gaze, he knew this was important.</p><p>\u201cI think we connect on a level that goes way beyond the physical, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary as hell?\u201d He filled in the blanks. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as his hand smoothed down the curve of her ass, urging her onto her side so they were face to face.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem particularly scared,\u201d she accused.</p><p>He lost a heartbeat as she pressed against the thrust of his erection.</p><p>He was so hard the mere brush of her hot skin was nearly enough to send him over the edge.</p><p>\u201cI have other things on my mind,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She wiggled against him, a small smile curving her lips. \u201cNot just on your mind.\u201d</p><p>His teeth clenched at her teasing. Oh ... hell. When did she become so bold?</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s kind of an all-over thing,\u201d he managed to rasp, his fingers digging into the softness of her backside as he tried to leash his hunger, which was swiftly spiraling out of control. \u201cSo if you want me to stop, tell me now.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, she pressed her hands to his chest, exploring his rigid muscles with a light, devastating touch.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no,\u201d he groaned, brushing his mouth over her parted lips. \u201cBut you\u2019re a temptation I can\u2019t resist, and if you don\u2019t say no then I\u2019m going to take everything you\u2019re willing to give.\u201d</p><p>She nipped his bottom lip, her hands skimming downward. Duncan hissed, his stomach muscles clenching in anticipation.</p><p>Oh ... hell.</p><p>Did she even know her soft touch was setting him on fire?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re many things, Duncan O\u2019Conner, but weak isn\u2019t one of them,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut, desperately wanting to roll her onto her back and unleash his most primal desires.</p><p>\u201cI am when it comes to you, Callie Brown,\u201d he admitted in thick tones.</p><p>He felt her lips plant butterfly kisses along the rough edge of his jaw before following the line of his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I find you irresistible?\u201d</p><p>She licked the pulse that pounded at the base of his neck. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like me in your power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. I want you begging for me.\u201d</p><p>His cock jerked, as if trying to prove to the tormenting female just how much he wanted her.</p><p>His hands slid up her back with an impatient caress. \u201cShit, Callie, you shouldn\u2019t say that when we\u2019re in bed.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, nibbling along the prominent line of his collarbone.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you prefer I say it?\u201d</p><p>He buried his nose in her apple-scented hair, struggling to suck air into his lungs, which felt oddly tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging on by a thread here, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go, cop,\u201d she whispered, wriggling downward to lick one flat nipple before softly blowing on it until it pebbled in arousal.</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d he gasped, his eyes wrenched open in shocked pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She found his other nipple, giving soft licks as he shuddered in helpless response.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>She tilted back her head to regard him with eyes that were far more rare and beautiful than any sapphires.</p><p>\u201cI promised revenge, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she said, smiling with wicked intent as she returned to her slow, intimate exploration.</p><p>He nearly leapt off the mattress as she kissed a path down his stomach, at last taking the tender tip of his cock into the silken heat of her mouth.</p><p>Oh ... hell yeah.</p><p>She could have all the revenge she wanted.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Morning had fully arrived by the time they at last crawled out of bed, and then spent another half hour in the shower.</p><p>Callie felt deliciously sated as she pulled on the terry cloth robe and dried her hair with a towel.</p><p>And something else.</p><p>Something thrilling and dangerous and completely unfamiliar.</p><p>Something she wasn\u2019t ready to examine.</p><p>Sensing Duncan pull on his jeans and tee behind her, Callie wandered into the living room, not sure what etiquette covered the \u201cmorning after wild monkey sex\u201d procedure.</p><p>Did she suggest they go to breakfast? They\u2019d used a lot of energy\u2014a massive amount of energy\u2014and Duncan had to be starving. But what if he didn\u2019t want to spend more time with her? Would he feel obligated?</p><p>Maybe she should just go back to her apartment and\u2014</p><p>The abrupt knock on the door interrupted her idiotic musings, making her stiffen in surprise.</p><p>\u201cCan I hope that\u2019s room service with our breakfast?\u201d Duncan drawled, moving to stand beside her.</p><p>She snuck a peek to the side, admiring the way the tee clung with loving perfection to the hard muscles of his chest, before lifting her head to meet his amused gaze. She wrinkled her nose at him. So smug.</p><p>\u201cYou can always hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound promising.\u201d</p><p>There was another pounding on the door. \u201cNeither does that.\u201d Accepting her time with Duncan was at an end regardless of what she wanted, she moved forward to pull open the door. She blinked in confusion at the sight of her guardian. Sentinels were never used as messengers. Which meant his arrival couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cFane. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>His tattooed face remained stoic, although the heat from his body warned he wasn\u2019t pleased by her presence in Duncan\u2019s rooms.</p><p>\u201cThe Mave wants you in her office.\u201d His dark gaze never strayed from her flushed face. \u201cBring the cop.\u201d</p><p>With his message delivered, Fane turned on his heel and swiftly disappeared.</p><p>Yeah. Not happy.</p><p>Not happy at all.</p><p>Swallowing a sigh, Callie briefly rued ever leaving Duncan\u2019s bed. Tucked against him, she\u2019d felt warm and secure and almost normal. Like any other woman who\u2019d spent the night in the arms of her lover.</p><p>Now reality had intruded. With a vengeance.</p><p>\u201cI need to go to my apartment and change,\u201d she murmured, still standing in the doorway gazing down the empty hallway. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the Mave\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>With surprising speed, Duncan snapped out his hand to grasp her upper arm. \u201cCallie.\u201d</p><p>She kept her gaze averted. \u201cWe should hurry.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something beneath his breath before slowly dropping his hand.</p><p>\u201cFine. But don\u2019t think for a minute that I\u2019m going to let you lock me out,\u201d he warned, his voice cop-hard. \u201cWe\u2019re way beyond those games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go.\u201d</p><p>Dashing away like a naughty child, Callie ignored the feel of his glare burning a hole in the back of her head.</p><p>I am a coward.</p><p>A genuine, Grade A coward.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t entirely her fault. She\u2019d made the decision to have sex with Duncan. She was a grown, unattached woman who was free to share the bed of an equally grown, unattached man.</p><p>And the sex had been magnificent. The stuff of fantasies.</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t quite the uncomplicated night of fun she\u2019d been hoping for.</p><p>Taking the elevator to the private quarters, she\u2019d actually managed to reach her door when she at last realized someone was calling her name.</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d</p><p>Glancing over her shoulder, she caught sight of the tall woman with long raven hair and light green eyes. As always Serra looked ravishing, with her lush curves shown to advantage in a pair of black satin pants and halter top. She was sex walking in Manolo Blahnik boots.</p><p>She was also intelligent, witty, loyal, and one of the most powerful psychics ever recorded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Callie didn\u2019t love her like a sister she would have been obligated to shove her off a high, high ledge.</p><p>\u201cOh, Serra.\u201d She offered an apologetic smile as she placed her thumb on the tiny screen that released the door lock. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I have to meet with the Mave. Maybe we can get together later.\u201d</p><p>Callie entered the small but tidy living room painted a soft cream with lavender accents. Her sofa and chairs were the same cream with glass coffee tables in the center of the floor and a plasma TV on the wall. The floors were a polished hardwood with hand-woven rugs tossed in a casual pattern.</p> <p>There was nothing fancy about it, but it was comfortable. More importantly, it was home.</p><p>She headed directly for the back bedroom, which was decorated in the same cream tones, but with peach accents, not at all surprised when Serra followed in her wake.</p><p>The two had been raised by the same foster parents. Which meant she knew that nothing was going to make Serra leave until she\u2019d dug out whatever information she wanted.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you won\u2019t be spending more quality time with your cop?\u201d</p><p>Ah. She\u2019d heard that she\u2019d spent the night with Duncan.</p> <p>Predictable.</p><p>Gossip traveled with hyperspeed through Valhalla.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not mine,\u201d she denied, trying to ignore the tiny pang at the truth of her words.</p><p>What would she do with him if he was hers?</p><p>Serra moved to sit on the edge of the bed, leaning back on her elbows as she studied Callie with a knowing gaze. \u201cBut you\u2019re not denying the quality time you spent with him?\u201d</p><p>Callie tugged off the robe, heat jolting through her body at the memory of Duncan\u2019s demanding touch.</p> <p>Her previous experiences had been with callow youths.</p><p>The cop had been all man.</p><p>\u201cIt was top-notch quality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go, girl.\u201d</p><p>In the process of pulling on a clean pair of panties and matching bra, Callie regarded her visitor in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>Serra\u2019s lips curled. \u201cI don\u2019t trust any man. They\u2019re all bastards.\u201d</p><p>Callie carefully considered her response. Despite their unbreakable bond, they had learned never to discuss Serra\u2019s fierce attraction toward Fane. It wasn\u2019t that Serra was jealous. But she was frustrated by the Sentinel\u2019s refusal to think of anything beyond his duty to Callie.</p> <p>\u201cNot all,\u201d Callie protested, pulling on a pair of faded jeans. \u201cWhat about Arel?\u201d</p><p>Arel was a hunter Sentinel who was sinfully beautiful with honey brown hair and eyes of pure gold. Serra had dated him the previous year.</p><p>\u201cCharming. Beautiful. And a thorough bastard.\u201d Serra paused, studying Callie with a searching gaze. \u201cStill, I haven\u2019t seen that pretty flush on your cheeks for a long time. And if he hurts you I can always kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>Callie chose a stretchy top in a bright yellow, pulling it over her head and tucking it into her jeans.</p><p>\u201cI can do my own ass-kicking, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could, but you\u2019re far too softhearted,\u201d Serra pointed out. The lovely psychic was three years older than Callie and had appointed herself Callie\u2019s ass-kicker from the day she\u2019d been brought as a baby to Valhalla. \u201cHow long is the cop going to be hanging around?\u201d</p><p>Callie moved to the attached bathroom to run a comb through the short strands of her hair, pretending she didn\u2019t notice the lingering glow that blushed her cheeks and shimmered in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>She returned to the bedroom, slipping on a pair of running shoes before turning to meet her friend\u2019s curious gaze.</p><p>\u201cHe scares me,\u201d she admitted with blunt honesty.</p><p>Without warning Serra was on her feet, her eyes narrowed to dangerous slits. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to chop off his dick.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. Callie dashed to block the dangerous psychic from leaving the room. \u201cNo, Serra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I meant was that he makes me feel things that scare me.\u201d</p><p>Serra blinked, startled. Callie was the sensible one. The one who never took risks. Who never tumbled in and out of lust with every cute guy who crossed her path. Who preferred an evening spent with a good book to hitting the nightclubs.</p><p>\u201cAre you falling in love with him?\u201d</p><p>Callie bit her lower lip. \u201cThat\u2019s what concerns me.\u201d</p><p>Seeming to wrap her brain around Callie\u2019s startling confession, Serra gave a slow shake of her head. \u201cWhy are you concerned?\u201d she asked. \u201cI was only with him for a few minutes, but I can promise that he\u2019s obsessed with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObsessed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re constantly on his mind.\u201d Serra\u2019s lips twisted in a self-derisive smile. \u201cSomething most women would envy.\u201d</p><p>Callie reached to lightly touch her friend\u2019s arm, offering an unspoken comfort.</p><p>\u201cWhether I\u2019m on his mind or not, we live in two different worlds.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not a clich\u00e9. We literally live in two different worlds.\u201d</p><p>Serra arched a brow. \u201cAre you so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do ...\u201d Callie made a sound of disapproval. Clearly her friend had used her powers to peek into Duncan\u2019s thoughts. It was the only way she could know that the cop wasn\u2019t entirely normal. \u201cSerra, you know you\u2019re not supposed to be rummaging through the minds of our guests.\u201d</p><p>Serra shrugged. \u201cI wanted to make sure he was no threat to you.\u201d</p><p>Callie gave her companion\u2019s arm a squeeze. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Serra shifted her feet, as always embarrassed by Callie\u2019s open display of affection. She was far more comfortable in her role as bad-ass.</p><p>\u201cSo he confessed his secret powers to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter a little prompting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you realize you\u2019re not from separate worlds. He\u2019s one of us.\u201d</p><p>Callie shook her head. Duncan had been painfully clear.</p><p>\u201cNot so long as he chooses to keep his gift secret,\u201d she said. \u201cFor now he prefers his life with the norms.\u201d</p><p>Serra snorted. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves his job as a cop, which he\u2019d never be allowed to keep if it was discovered he is a soul-gazer. Plus, he\u2019s very close to his family.\u201d She heaved a faint sigh. \u201cBoth potent reasons to keep the status quo.\u201d</p><p>Serra slowly smiled. \u201cThen I suppose you\u2019ll have to give him a more potent reason to switch teams.\u201d</p><p>Could she?</p><p>More importantly, did she want to?</p><p>She hastily shoved aside the question. She wasn\u2019t ready to open that particular can of worms.</p><p>Not until she had the time to deal with the consequences.</p><p>\u201cSomething to consider,\u201d she murmured vaguely. \u201cFirst, however, I have to survive whatever latest disaster is waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>Duncan wasn\u2019t overly fussy.</p><p>He had only a handful of items on his \u201cnever want to do\u201d list:</p><p>Wrestle a gator.</p><p>Eat a turnip.</p><p>See his wife banging the delivery man.</p><p>And share a private t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Fane the pain-in-his-ass Sentinel.</p><p>A damned shame that he\u2019d been forced to endure every single item on his list.</p><p>Pacing the hall, he did his best to ignore the tattooed bastard who leaned against the wall, standing so still he could have passed as a statue. Well, if a statue had obsidian eyes that held the promise of death and could pump enough heat into the air to make any man sweat.</p><p>\u201cYou seem nervous, cop,\u201d the Sentinel drawled, folding his arms across his bare, tattooed chest, which was broad enough to put an ox to shame.</p><p>Steroids? It\u2019d be nice to think so.</p><p>\u201cI doubt we were called here because of good news,\u201d Duncan growled. \u201cUnless you know something I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Fane snorted. \u201cWhat I know that you don\u2019t could fill libraries.\u201d</p><p>Duncan ignored the taunt, studying the man\u2019s face. It looked like it had been carved from stone, giving it an ageless quality.</p><p>\u201cJust how old are you?\u201d Duncan felt the temperature in the hall amp up another degree.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a question you ask a high-blood.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, like I give a shit. \u201cThere are rumors that the Sentinels are immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of rumors about Sentinels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least one of them is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all pricks.\u201d</p><p>The door to the office opened, revealing the impressive form of the Mave dressed in a white cashmere sweater that was scooped low enough to reveal the shimmering emerald of her witch mark and a black pencil skirt with black pumps. Her hair was pulled into a tidy bun at the nape of her neck to enhance the pale perfection of her face and the slender length of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou two done playing?\u201d she murmured with a lift of her brow.</p><p>Fane shoved away from the wall, his gaze never leaving Duncan. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cYou may come in.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. \u201cCallie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Callie announced, rounding the corner on cue.</p><p>Well, maybe not on cue. The Mave no doubt had seen her approach on a security monitor. Or perhaps she had witchy powers that warned who was in the vicinity.</p><p>Either way, Duncan was far more concerned about the pale strain he could easily detect on Callie\u2019s pretty face.</p><p>What the hell had happened? When she\u2019d left his rooms she\u2019d been flushed and sated and delightfully flustered.</p><p>Now she could barely meet his gaze.</p><p>He reached out, intending to halt her and demand an explanation of what had caused her sudden discomfort with him only to let his hand drop as the Mave sent him a curious glance and Fane gave a low growl, deep in his throat.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Any private chat was going to have to wait.</p><p>In silence they shuffled into the elegant office, Fane taking his familiar position in the corner so he could keep an eye on the door and window, his large body leaning against the wall even as his muscles remained coiled to attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did the man ever relax?</p><p>The Mave settled behind her desk, waving a hand to the two chairs opposite her. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>A command despite the polite tone. Duncan waited for Callie to perch on the nearest chair before taking his own seat, bracing himself for the latest disaster.</p> <p>\u201cHas something happened?\u201d he asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>The Mave wasn\u2019t the type to invite people into her office for chitchat.</p><p>\u201cI received a message from your chief this morning,\u201d the powerful witch said in tones that revealed nothing.</p><p>Duncan frowned. Why hadn\u2019t Molinari contacted him directly?</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you should view it for yourself.\u201d The Mave reached to pick up a remote lying on her desk and pressed a button.</p><p>Immediately the light dimmed and flickering images appeared on the far wall.</p><p>At first there was nothing to see but the dim shadows that filled an empty house.</p><p>No, not a house.</p><p>A mansion.</p><p>One of those cold, sprawling places that looked beautiful in photographs, but had to be as uncomfortable as hell to try and live in.</p> <p>So what was the deal? A big house with a lot of fancy artwork wasn\u2019t that uncommon, even in Kansas City.</p><p>About to demand an explanation, he was halted when the security system shifted to a camera displaying the front yard, obviously set on motion detectors.</p><p>Duncan sucked in a sharp breath as he watched a woman with long chestnut hair and a slender build boldly striding onto the porch.</p><p>She was no longer naked and she was standing upright instead of being sprawled on her kitchen floor, but there was no mistaking that it was Leah Meadows.</p><p>\u201cIs that . . .\u201d He shuddered, the name sticking in his throat. He\u2019d heard a hundred victims tell him that their blood ran cold. Until this minute he\u2019d never actually experienced it for himself. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d Callie breathed for him, her hands clutching the arms of her chair.</p><p>He resisted the urge to reach out and lay his hand over her clenched fingers. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d he instead demanded.</p><p>\u201cMission Hills.\u201d</p> <p>That explained the McMansion. The upscale neighborhood was south of the city and populated with the swankiest of the swanky.</p><p>Callie leaned forward, her eyes narrowing as she studied Leah placing her hand on a small screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisarming the security system,\u201d Duncan absently responded, almost missing the significance as she turned to push open the door and stepped inside the house. Through a fog of horror he watched as the young, beautiful girl walked around as if she didn\u2019t have a care in the world. Christ. Was it possible she was an empty shell being used as a puppet by some psycho necromancer? \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>The Mave sent him a small frown. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reason the ...\u201d He struggled for the right word. The bastard wasn\u2019t a diviner like Callie. He was the bogeyman the norms feared. \u201cNecromancer chose Leah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Callie gasped as she easily followed his logic. \u201cShe could pass through security.\u201d</p><p>The Mave nodded, her expression unreadable as they all turned back to the images flickering on the wall. The camera angle shifted to follow Leah as she moved through the house, her movements chillingly fluid considering she was a corpse. She was walking across a long living room when another form, this one a male, entered the room.</p><p>\u201cBusted.\u201d Duncan unconsciously leaned forward, taking a swift inventory of the newest player. An aging white male who moved toward Leah like a peacock. Puffed out chest, strutting walk. All he was missing was tail feathers to spread. Pompous dick. \u201cThis should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>They watched in silence as there was an exchange. There was no sound, but they didn\u2019t need to hear the conversation to know that the man wasn\u2019t happy. At least not at first. There was a short t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, then clearly reassured, the man was shoving his hand under Leah\u2019s stretchy little top.</p><p>\u201cA little too interesting,\u201d Callie said with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cKeep watching,\u201d the Mave coolly commanded.</p><p>The zombie-Leah flirted with a disturbing ease before she turned to dash into what looked like an office. There was more flirting. But, even as Duncan felt a burning fury at the thought the mysterious necromancer was going to allow the ultimate defamation of Leah\u2019s body, the young female was moving to stand directly in front of her lover, her necklace beginning to glow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>The words had barely left his mouth when the man jerked backward in shock, his skin ripping open like it was being torn from the inside.</p><p>\u201cAn amulet with a powerful spell,\u201d the Mave answered.</p><p>\u201cThis is . . .\u201d Duncan shoved his hand through his hair, his stomach threatening revolt as the man turned gray and began to flake away like a smoked cigar. \u201cFucking crazy,\u201d he breathed. \u201cMen don\u2019t turn into ash. And dead women aren\u2019t supposed to be walking around town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d the Mave said, her voice crystal hard with an anger she kept hidden behind her mask of smooth composure. \u201cWhich is why we\u2019re going to put a halt to whoever is responsible.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes he was.</p><p>Being a stubborn ass who refused to admit he was in over his head was actually a bonus in his job.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the decomposed corpse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Mr. Calso.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. The name was vaguely familiar.</p><p>\u201cA high-blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s left of him is being brought to our medical facility,\u201d the Mave said. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon know.\u201d</p><p>Duncan glanced toward the witch in surprise. \u201cThe chief signed off on you taking the remains?\u201d</p><p>The Mave shrugged. \u201cMr. Calso is a prominent figure in the norms\u2019 financial world. She didn\u2019t want to risk the PR disaster of having what\u2019s left of his body disappearing from her morgue.\u201d</p><p>Duncan snorted. \u201cYeah, not to mention the hysteria if a man who is supposed to be dead is seen at the country club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be walking anywhere, but yes, that was a concern,\u201d the woman smoothly agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she stealing?\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s abrupt question had Duncan returning his attention to watch as Leah turned a stone vessel upside down and allowed a small metal object to fall into her open palm. Copper? Bronze? Impossible to say at a distance.</p><p>\u201cA good question,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIt looks like a coin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was locked in a hidden safe so it must be rare,\u201d Callie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Duncan agreed. \u201cBut so is the Picasso hiding the safe and the Matisse statue on the mantel.\u201d He pointed toward the small bronzed statue of a woman, belatedly realizing that three sets of eyes were regarding him with varying degrees of astonishment. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not a complete barbarian. I like art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point, Sergeant O\u2019Conner?\u201d the Mave prodded.</p><p>\u201cThe robbery wasn\u2019t about money. Could the coin have powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny item can be a focus for magic,\u201d the Mave answered. \u201cBut if you desired true power it surely makes more sense to steal a witch.\u201d</p><p>Duncan blinked. \u201cCan a witch be stolen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan the dead walk?\u201d the Mave smoothly countered.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d Duncan\u2019s lips twitched. The Mave had a subtle sense of humor. Unexpected and no doubt lethal to the poor fool who ever thought he could claim this woman. \u201cAnd speaking of the dead, did anyone notice Leah after she left the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your territory,\u201d she informed him without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it is.\u201d He pulled out his phone to start making notes. What made him a good cop were his instincts and his hidden talent. What made him a great cop was his acceptance that ninety percent of his job was dull, old-fashioned legwork. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to canvas the neighborhood to see if anyone noticed how she arrived or left. We also need to find out more about Calso and his mysterious coin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour chief said to tell you she would meet you at Mr. Calso\u2019s house,\u201d the Mave said, pressing a button to allow the early morning sunlight to return to the room.</p><p>Duncan turned to glance toward Callie. \u201cAre you going to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She furrowed her brow, clearly debating how she could best use her talents to help. \u201cI think I should try to discover the identity of the necromancer.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted in denial only to snap shut as he met the glittering sapphire gaze.</p><p>She was clearly waiting for him to make a jackass out of himself and try to forbid her to put herself at risk. Maybe she even wanted him to annoy her so she\u2019d have a legitimate reason to keep him at a distance.</p><p>Thankfully, he hadn\u2019t been plagued by a gaggle of older sisters for nothing.</p><p>Swallowing his impulsive words, he managed a tight smile. \u201cWhere will you start your search?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRussia,\u201d Fane announced from the corner.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Zak had time to shower and return to the main part of the house when Tony returned with Leah\u2019s body and the coin.</p><p>Not surprising, the henchman was barely functioning, his human brain unable to process what he\u2019d witnessed. That, of course, didn\u2019t keep Zak from sending him off to dispose of Leah\u2019s body. What did it matter where he took the corpse, just so long as it was far enough that it couldn\u2019t be traced back to this house?</p><p>Now he sat in his office and studied the tiny object that he\u2019d waited three hundred years to hold in his hand.</p><p>It didn\u2019t look like it could offer him the power he\u2019d been promised. Less than two inches in diameter, it was paper thin and tarnished to a blue green. It might have been mistaken for a piece of trash if not for the odd, winged bird etched into the metal.</p><p>Rubbing his finger over the ancient artifact, Zak felt the gnawing sensation in the dark pit of his heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a familiar ache.</p><p>It had started when he was barely five and he\u2019d realized that his brothers were destined to become his father\u2019s heirs while he was doomed to a suffocating existence in the middle of fucking nowhere, surrounded by superstitious serfs who\u2019d taken one glance at his peculiar eyes and claimed his mother had slept with a demon.</p><p>Ignorant peasants.</p> <p>Boris and Viktor had been easy enough to get rid of. The two had been ruthless bullies to Zak, but they\u2019d also been as dumb as a box of rocks. And once Zak had started to come into his powers, it\u2019d only been a matter of time before he could put them in their graves.</p><p>Boris had been disposed of by the simple process of having his dead lover make an appearance in the woods. The fool had tumbled from his horse in shock and broke his own neck. Viktor had been a little more difficult, but eventually Zak had stumbled across the body of a recently shot poacher whom he used to pull Viktor from the stables and snap his neck.</p><p>It had never occurred to him that his father would refuse to make him his heir. He was, after all, the only remaining son.</p><p>But the bastard had coldly informed Zak that he\u2019d never allow a deformed brat to claim his title.</p><p>This time Zak had taken matters into his own hands, quite literally, strangling his father and hiding his body. Hours later he\u2019d used his powers to ensure his father appeared long enough to formally proclaim Zak as his heir before he allowed his father\u2019s dead body to tumble to the floor.</p> <p>From there he\u2019d traveled to Saint Petersburg, confident he\u2019d at last satisfy that sense of emptiness.</p><p>Instead he\u2019d been consumed with fury as the nobles had treated him with the same contempt as his father. He\u2019d managed to forge a place for himself at court with sheer cunning, but it hadn\u2019t been enough.</p><p>And then he\u2019d met Anya, who\u2019d revealed to him the power to make certain he\u2019d never again be treated as anything less than a king.</p><p>As if the thought of Anya had conjured the witch, she stepped into the office and crossed to where he sat behind his desk. \u201cYou have the coin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt last,\u201d he confirmed, his fingers continuing to stroke over the copper coin.</p><p>Anya leaned against the edge of the desk, her slender form barely covered by the microdress that was a brilliant shade of yellow.</p> <p>Why she bothered to play the role of sex kitten defied logic. He never wasted his time or energy on a project unless it promised reward.</p><p>And any reward he\u2019d gain by taking the witch to his bed had already been reaped.</p><p>\u201cThe female?\u201d she demanded, placing her hand flat on the desk and leaning sideways to study the artifact in his fingers.</p><p>Zak shrugged. \u201cTony\u2019s disposing the body.\u201d</p><p>Anya wrinkled her nose. \u201cThe servant has seen more than is good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still has his uses.\u201d</p><p>She reached a hand toward the coin. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>Zak smoothly rose to his feet and stepped away. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Her face flushed at his uncompromising rejection. \u201cYou can\u2019t be afraid that I might try to steal it?\u201d She gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cWe need one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly you need me.\u201d</p><p>She muttered something beneath her breath as she pushed away from the desk and headed for the door. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>She halted, glancing over her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s time for my pedicure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will have to wait.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to take me to the temple.\u201d</p><p>The witch froze, her expression wary. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d She shook her head, licking her dry lips. \u201cI haven\u2019t prepared the sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>He held up the coin. \u201cThen get prepared.\u201d</p><p>She slowly turned back to face him, her movements wary, as if she feared his response.</p><p>Smart witch.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you? Are you fully prepared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have convinced yourself that you\u2019re destined to succeed, but have you considered the consequences of failure?\u201d she muttered in defensive tones. \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure that using a surrogate will protect you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled with a cold arrogance. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, witch. Take me to the temple and I\u2019ll become nothing less than a god.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed with fear. \u201cYou should at least consider the danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be flattered if I truly thought you cared, Anya,\u201d he mocked. \u201cBut we both know your only concern is losing your luxurious lifestyle.\u201d He carefully plucked a bit of lint off the sleeve of his white satin shirt before lifting his gaze to stab her with a lethal glare. \u201cOr at least that had better be the only reason you hesitate.\u201d</p><p>Anya wrapped her arms around her waist. \u201cSometimes you frightened me.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cOnly sometimes?\u201d</p><p>After being returned to Kansas City by Fane and his magical portal, Duncan made a brief stop by his apartment for clean clothes before heading to the station house to speak with the techy who was dissecting Calso\u2019s security tapes. He forced the poor bastard to go frame by tedious frame until Duncan had the information he needed.</p><p>Only then did he head south of town to the mansion that was now a crime scene.</p><p>Parking a block away, Duncan blatantly trespassed through private yards to enter through the back terrace doors. A death in this neighborhood would bring out the vultures in hordes. He didn\u2019t want to have to shoot paparazzi. No matter how satisfying it might be.</p><p>Entering the kitchen, he was met by a rookie who looked impossibly young with his face flushed and his pale eyes shimmering with excitement.</p><p>Christ. Had he ever been that wide eyed and fresh faced?</p><p>Probably not. By the time he was four his special little talent had revealed just how often a face of an angel could disguise a soul as black as the pits of hell.</p><p>\u201cYou had the entire neighborhood canvassed?\u201d</p><p>The young man squared his shoulders, his uniform perfectly pressed and his shoes shining.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sergeant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing was seen except a silver Taurus parked a block south of here,\u201d a female voice answered as Molinari stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>A small woman in her early fifties, the chief of police didn\u2019t have the muscles or the bluster to intimidate others, but there wasn\u2019t a cop in the city who didn\u2019t quake beneath the dark gaze.</p><p>There was something in that glare that reminded him of the day he was busted by his ma for hiding a stash of Playboys beneath his mattress.</p><p>\u201cAny one jot down the plates?\u201d</p><p>Molinari shook her head, the dark hair that was dyed, sprayed, and pinned into a bun at her nape not moving an inch. Her tailored jacket and matching skirt were equally rigid as she stood in the doorway. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Duncan rolled his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t sneeze in my apartment without old lady Rogers asking if I\u2019m coming down with a cold. Where are the nosy neighbors when you need them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNosy neighbors aren\u2019t allowed in the communities where power brokers live,\u201d the chief said, her dark gaze flicking toward the backyard, which was as large as a football field. \u201cThey have too many secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what were Mr. Calso\u2019s secrets?\u201d</p><p>Molinari lifted a slender hand. \u201cFollow me, O\u2019Conner.\u201d She glanced toward the silent rookie. \u201cBlackwell.\u201d</p><p>The cop audibly swallowed the lump in his throat. \u201cChief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure we\u2019re not interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Duncan followed Molinari through the house to the office where Calso had died. He smiled as he caught a glimpse through the windows at the dozen cops who surrounded the house, keeping the gathering jackals at bay.</p><p>\u201cTrying to keep a lid on things?\u201d</p><p>The woman moved toward the desk, making a wide path around the spot where Calso had . . . disintegrated.</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t blame her. The memory of watching the body turn to ash was something that was going to haunt him for a long time.</p><p>\u201cWhen it gets out that one of the richest men in Kansas City was killed by magic all hell\u2019s going to break loose,\u201d Molinari muttered, reaching to pluck a manila file off the desk.</p><p>\u201cYou left out the fact that the person casting the spell was a zombie who escaped from our own morgue.\u201d</p><p>That dark glare swiveled in his direction. \u201cI\u2019ve already named my first ulcer Mayor Stanford. Do you want me to name the next one O\u2019Conner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis whole damned thing is a nightmare just waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>Just waiting to happen?</p><p>Duncan was fairly certain they were knee-deep in the nightmare.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep this from the press for long,\u201d he said, waving a hand toward the window that revealed the line of news vans already blocking the street. \u201cNot with such a high profile victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead of stating the obvious, why don\u2019t you make yourself useful and assure me the freaks know who\u2019s doing this.\u201d</p><p>Duncan moved, studying the open safe, effectively hiding his expression. He was loyal to his job and to his chief, but he\u2019d go to the grave protecting Callie and her connection to the case.</p><p>\u201cLike us, they\u2019re following leads,\u201d he said, absently noting the stack of crisp thousand-dollar bills just begging to be taken.</p><p>Whatever the reason for Calso\u2019s death, it had nothing to do with money.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Molinari prompted.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be keeping anything from me, would you, O\u2019Conner?\u201d</p><p>He turned to meet her suspicious frown. \u201cThe Mave has her people trying to track down info on a necromancer capable of truly raising the dead. I assume they\u2019ll contact us when they discover anything.\u201d</p><p>The suspicion remained. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about Calso.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The chief\u2019s lips parted to cross-examine him, then clearly deciding it wasn\u2019t worth the battle, she instead turned her attention to the file folder in her hand.

He\u2019d discovered over the years that clues rarely came attached with labels or blinking neon lights.

No one would be stupid enough to display such famous pieces if they were off the black market. Unless they were forgeries.</p><p>His hand reached to pick up the stone vase that was safely wrapped in an evidence bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the container?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a damned clue. It looks old.\u201d</p><p>It looked older than old. It looked ancient.</p><p>Holding it to the light, he studied the strange symbols etched into the stone.</p><p>\u201cCan I keep it?\u201d</p><p>Molinari frowned at the unexpected request. \u201cIt\u2019s evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to it.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence as the chief weighed the need for information against protocol.</p><p>At last the shouts from the growing crowd of gawkers across the street made her heave a sigh of resignation.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it couldn\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s already been dusted for prints,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie and her pet Sentinel are searching for the history of the necromancer in an effort to locate him. I want to start at the other end.\u201d He glanced toward the black mark on the carpet where Calso had died. \u201cThe present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head to meet his companion\u2019s puzzled gaze. \u201cIf we find out where Calso got the coin and what makes it worth killing for, we might be able to use the information to discover who else was interested in the coin,\u201d he explained, his mind already shifting through his various contacts. \u201cThere can\u2019t be that many numismatists willing to dabble in black markets. This vessel can hopefully lead me to a specific dealer.\u201d</p><p>Molinari gave a slow nod. \u201cClever, but we don\u2019t know for sure that the vessel and the coin are actually connected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a place to start.\u201d</p><p>The chief abruptly tossed the file back on the desk, her expression tight with frustration.</p><p>\u201cShit, I hate this.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grimaced. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hate what\u2019s coming even more.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The journey from Kansas City to Saint Petersburg might have been made in the blink of an eye, but it was as disconcerting as hell. It seemed no matter how great the power, you couldn\u2019t jerk a body halfway around the world and nine hours into the future without it making a girl feel dizzy.</p><p>Moving to lean against the wall that was covered in delicately painted hieroglyphs, Callie sucked in a deep breath, waiting for her head to stop spinning.</p><p>Across the small room Fane stood in silence, unaffected by the teleportation.</p><p>Not that he was entirely happy.</p><p>Callie grimaced as her gaze skimmed over his large tattooed body, which was covered by a pair of casual khakis, heavy black boots, and a tight muscle shirt. There was no missing the rigid tension of his shoulders and the tightness of his starkly male features.</p><p>For all his stoic calm, Fane was royally pissed.</p><p>At her.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you spit out what you have to say before your head explodes?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He turned to study her with a steady gaze. \u201cWould it do any good?\u201d</p><p>She briefly considered the pleasure she\u2019d found in Duncan\u2019s arms. Had it been a mistake? Maybe. Did she give a damn? No.</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d she admitted with a rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might make you less grumpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes as he turned on his heels and headed out of the portal room. Fane had never tried to interfere in her intimate affairs. Usually because she had no affairs, intimate or otherwise.</p><p>But they both understood that Duncan O\u2019Conner threatened to become more than a passing distraction.</p><p>They entered the main section of the monastery, and Callie forced herself to ignore Fane\u2019s foul mood as a heavily cloaked monk moved toward her.</p><p>Her guardian was like an older brother. No matter how much they might fuss and fight, nothing could break their bond of trust.</p><p>She would never, ever doubt he had her back.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to our humble abbey.\u201d The monk offered a bow before he straightened and pulled back his hood to reveal a long, deeply wrinkled face that was made beautiful by his kind blue eyes and sweet smile. \u201cI am Brandon.\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Fane returned the bow, his hand pressed over his heart in a gesture of respect.</p><p>\u201cWe are honored to be your guests. I\u2019m Fane and this is Callie Brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFane. Ms. Brown.\u201d He sent them both a piercing glance. \u201cA pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Another sweet smile before Brandon waved a hand toward a nearby archway. \u201cWe have prepared for your arrival. If you\u2019ll follow me.\u201d</p><p>They traveled through the reception room, which was built of stark gray stones with narrow slits that offered a mere glimpse of the fading sunlight. She didn\u2019t allow herself to think that it was still late morning at Valhalla. Her stomach was just settling from the journey.</p><p>There was a long, narrow hallway that ended in a heavy wooden door with an old-fashioned iron lock. Brandon pulled an equally old-fashioned key from the pocket of his robe and used it to tumble the lock. Then, with a strange air of ceremony he pushed open the door and stepped aside so Callie could enter first.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.</p><p>Although she\u2019d been surrounded by Sentinels all her life, not to mention traveled by portal with Fane from one monastery to another, she\u2019d never been beyond the public rooms that were always stark and uninviting. The monks were OCD when it came to the privacy of the students and their training.</p><p>Now she sucked in a startled breath as she glanced around the vast library.</p><p>The place was . . . stunning.</p><p>Unlike the sleek, high-tech library at Valhalla, this room spoke of Russia\u2019s past, with an onion-domed ceiling that was richly painted with Orthodox icons and edged with gilt. The floor was a white marble inset with pieces of jade and gold that shimmered in the light from the candelabras. The walls were lined with towering bookshelves that were ornately carved and separated by fluted columns. The rosewood furniture was clearly the work of master craftsmen and so highly polished it seemed to glow.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Callie twirled in a circle, absorbing the sheer beauty of the room. \u201cThis is exquisite.\u201d</p><p>The monk chuckled. \u201cI will share your appreciation with our students.\u201d</p><p>Callie widened her eyes. \u201cSentinels did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe train all our Sentinels with some craft.\u201d</p><p>Callie shot a glance toward the silent Fane. \u201cSo that\u2019s how you learned to carve such beautiful figurines.\u201d</p><p>Fane shrugged, but his features eased as he studied her dazzled expression. He would have his tongue cut out before he admitted he took pride in his small carvings that filled the nurseries at Valhalla.</p><p>Tiny ballerinas, trees with squirrels perched on leafy branches, intricate castles, and mind-twisting puzzles. Bewitching creations that the children adored.</p><p>\u201cIt teaches that anything worthy comes from patience and dedication to detail,\u201d Brandon explained.</p><p>Callie smiled. \u201cWe should all learn that particular lesson.\u201d</p><p>Brandon moved to a fireplace set behind a large desk, brushing his hand over a jade vase. Without warning a panel beside the fireplace slid open to reveal a hidden staircase.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d the monk urged, leading them down the dark stairs.</p><p>Callie followed behind him with Fane bringing up the rear.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked in confusion, skimming her hand down the cement wall as the darkness thickened to the point she was nearly blind. Her own skills didn\u2019t include seeing in the dark.</p><p>\u201cThis is where we keep items that are too fragile to be put on display,\u201d Brandon answered, opening the door at the bottom of the stairs to reveal a brilliantly lit room that was built in the shape of an octagon and lined with steel. Eight doors were set in the steel. \u201cThese vaults are specially designed to maintain the proper temperature and humidity.\u201d Brandon headed to the nearest door, pressing his thumb against a digital scanner. If the library upstairs had been a vision of old-world elegance, this was a glimpse into the future. \u201cAnd, of course, the scribes are trained to handle even the most ancient artifacts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Callie frowned, wondering if there had been a miscommunication. \u201cThe information we seek isn\u2019t particularly ancient.\u201d</p><p>Brandon nodded toward the door that silently slid open. \u201cThis particular vault contains various books and journals and even letters that refer to ...\u201d He paused to consider his words. \u201cLet us say sensitive issues dealing with our people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecret histories?\u201d Callie asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot secret.\u201d Brandon smiled his sweet, sweet smile. \u201cRegulated on a need-to-know basis.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Callie got it.</p><p>No need to creep out the norms with doppelgangers that could change shape or necromancers who could control the dead.</p><p>They entered a long room that was lined with glass cases. The ceiling was curved and crisscrossed with bright lights, the floor was grated metal that allowed a cool breeze to flow through the air.</p><p>Callie managed to catch a glimpse of books and rolled parchments and pretty feminine diaries that were wrapped with ribbons.</p> <p>There were also strange objects that she\u2019d never seen before and never wanted to see again. She grimaced at the sight of a large crystal ball with what looked like a human eye staring directly at her and the strange hammer that violently smashed into the glass as they passed by.</p><p>Yeesh.</p><p>At the end of the room was an open space with a large metal table that was cluttered with several leather-bound books, maps, as well as a pile of letters that were yellowed from age.</p><p>As they approached the table, a slender girl rose to her feet, brushing her hands down the long black robe she wore. \u201cBrandon,\u201d the girl murmured, giving a low bow before glancing toward Callie and Fane.</p><p>The overhead light revealed she wasn\u2019t as young as Callie had first thought. Maybe midtwenties instead of early teens, but there remained an air of fragility about her pale, perfect face that was dominated by a large pair of velvet brown eyes. Her hair was pulled into a long braid that fell to her waist, the silvery-blond color so pale it didn\u2019t look real.</p><p>She looked like a fairy princess.</p> <p>Until the brown gaze turned in Callie\u2019s direction. There was an age-old wisdom in those eyes. As if she\u2019d seen more in her twenty or so years of life than most people did in their entire existence.</p><p>\u201cThis is Myst,\u201d Brandon introduced the girl. Myst. It suited her. \u201cShe\u2019ll be here to assist you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Fane murmured, moving to stand guard at the door as the monk left.</p><p>Callie moved forward, joining the scribe at the table.</p><p>Myst pulled a pair of white, protective gloves from a box and held them toward Callie. \u201cI believe I have all the relative material gathered here.\u201d</p><p>Callie wrinkled her nose at the daunting stack of books, letters, and what looked to be official reports.</p><p>It would take her hours, if not days, to search through the pile. Always assuming she happened to read Russian, French, and what she could only guess was Latin.</p><p>Which she could not.</p> <p>\u201cHave you read them all?\u201d she asked the scribe.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you can give us the Cliffs Notes.\u201d</p><p>Myst blinked. \u201cCliffs Notes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA condensed version,\u201d Fane explained from the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. Very well.\u201d The girl gave a nod, her accent light, but definitely not Russian. Scandinavian? Perhaps. \u201cThe church records reveal that Lord Zakhar was born the youngest son of a minor nobleman in Kokorino. It was a small, remote village in what is now Siberia. He had two older brothers who both died before they reached the age of eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause?\u201d Fane demanded.</p><p>\u201cBoth were found in the woods with their necks broken.\u201d Myst absently put on the gloves in her hands, pulling one of the books toward her. \u201cIt was assumed that they were thrown from their horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the same time?\u201d Callie asked.</p><p>Myst checked her book. \u201cNo, five years apart.\u201d</p><p>Callie lifted her brows. Okay, there might not have been a CSI team back then, but they weren\u2019t stupid.</p><p>\u201cAnd no one was suspicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery suspicious, especially when there were claims of seeing the dead walking just before they took their falls.\u201d Myst shrugged. \u201cOf course, no one paid any attention to the gossip of mere serfs, not even the Shaman.\u201d</p><p>Callie shivered. Zakhar had been able to raise the dead when he\u2019d been so young?</p><p>She\u2019d somehow thought that it was a power he\u2019d honed over the centuries.</p><p>Which begged the question ... If he could raise the dead when he was a mere teenager, what could he do now?</p><p>The possibilities were terrifying.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the parents?\u201d she at last asked.</p><p>\u201cThe mother is never mentioned. The father, however, was found dead of what was called \u2018a failure of the heart\u2019 only minutes after he officially named Lord Zakhar his heir.\u201d</p><p>Fane snorted. \u201cConvenient.\u201d</p><p>Myst turned to another book. \u201cAfter a few months of mourning he traveled to Saint Petersburg to become a member of the royal court\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t married?\u201d Callie abruptly asked, struck by the sudden horror the necromancer had created offspring.</p><p>One necromancer raising the dead was bad enough, thank you very much.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Myst pointed toward the stack of papers. \u201cIn fact the letters I\u2019ve found mention several times he was loathed and feared by society.\u201d</p><p>Callie resisted the urge to touch the crumbling letters. \u201cDo they say why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis eyes, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were described as diamonds.\u201d</p><p>Callie shot a glance toward Fane, her heart missing a beat at the memory of those cold, ruthless eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He gave a slow nod. \u201cIt seems so, but I don\u2019t think we should jump to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>Not nearly as cautious as her guardian, Callie turned back toward the scribe. \u201cWere there any paintings or photos of him?\u201d</p><p>Myst shook her head. \u201cNot that I could find.\u201d</p><p>Callie sighed. Of course not.</p><p>Before revealing themselves to the norms the high-bloods had learned to avoid having their images captured.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gained power over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Myst ran her fingers lightly over the gold-edged page of the book in front of her, seeming to take comfort in the feel of the aged paper.</p><p>It had to be a scribe thing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not clear,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I would guess that he gathered information for the czar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA spy?\u201d Callie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Myst nodded. \u201cHe knew things that made people believe he could read their minds.\u201d</p><p>Callie blinked in confusion. \u201cA psychic?\u201d</p><p>Myst glanced down, suddenly looking uncomfortable. \u201cActually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Callie prodded.</p><p>\u201cOne powerful aristocrat swore that his valet had helped him dress for dinner only to learn when he arrived downstairs that the man had been found dead in the stables with a knife in his heart that afternoon\u201d</p><p>Fane gave a grunt of disgust. \u201cHe was using the dead to uncover secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Callie grimaced. The scribe\u2019s discomfort was a sharp warning of what would happen if it became common knowledge there was a necromancer who could raise the dead. Diviners were already feared. Even by other high-bloods. Dealing with the dead, no matter how respectfully done, tended to creep people out. If they thought that diviners were secretly abusing the corpses of their loved ones . . . it truly was going to be a nightmare. \u201cDid they realize that Lord Zakhar was responsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were rumors, but it wasn\u2019t until he formed an alliance with the czarina\u2019s mystic that the whispers became open accusations of sorcery,\u201d Myst said.</p><p>He had an accomplice?</p><p>Callie was somehow surprised.</p><p>Surely a crazy necromancer should work alone?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the mystic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery little.\u201d The scribe reached to flip open one of the leather-bound diaries. On one page was a charcoal etching of a narrow female face. It was too faded to make out more than a slender nose and high cheekbones with sensually lush lips, but Callie detected an arrogance in her faintly slanted eyes and tilted chin. \u201cThere\u2019s no record of her until she arrives in Saint Petersburg to act as an advisor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA high-blood?\u201d Fane asked.</p><p>Myst nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>So it was possible she was still alive.</p><p>Callie shifted her gaze back to the scribe. \u201cCan you tell what her talent was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no proof\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour best guess,\u201d Callie urged. Myst hesitated. No doubt she was trained to offer facts, not theories. Callie, however, trusted the young woman\u2019s instincts. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA witch,\u201d the young woman at last muttered.</p><p>Callie nodded. That would be her guess as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you say that because she claimed to be a mystic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and the fact that there are mentions of the strange jewelry she wore on a bracelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmulets,\u201d Fane said.</p><p>Witches used amulets to hold spells, curses, and charms. Unlike Sentinels, who occasionally used crystals to focus their magic.</p><p>\u201cThere were also rumors that she had the ability to heal,\u201d Myst added.</p><p>Callie frowned. Healers had abilities that had nothing to do with magic.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would foresee outbreaks of illness.\u201d</p><p>Fane again made a sound of disgust. \u201cIllness that she no doubt caused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and then she would cure the sick.\u201d Myst snapped the diary shut, something in her eyes speaking of wounds that hadn\u2019t yet healed. \u201cOr at least those who could afford her exorbitant prices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA clever racket,\u201d Fane muttered.</p><p>Callie studied her companion\u2019s pale face. She wondered what pain was keeping the young woman hidden down in these vaults, but it wasn\u2019t the time or place to pry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once she was back at Valhalla she would mention Myst to the Mave. The powerful witch had the ability to get answers far more discreetly than Callie could.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened to the mystic?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>As if sensing she\u2019d revealed more than she intended, Myst lowered her head and carefully opened yet another book. This one had neat columns of handwritten script, as if it were an official record book.</p> <p>\u201cShe, along with Lord Zakhar, was discovered in her private rooms with the missing child of a servant. His throat was slit and he was lying on a wooden altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman sacrifice?\u201d Fane\u2019s voice was edged with shock.</p><p>Murder of innocents was as rare among high-bloods as among norms.</p><p>Myst nodded. \u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Callie gave a puzzled shake of her head. \u201cWitches have no need for blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are forbidden spells that demand the blood of innocents,\u201d Myst revealed with a grimace.</p><p>There was a short silence as Callie and Fane shared a startled glance.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t bad enough that there was a necromancer out there who could raise the dead? Now they had to worry about a psycho witch who was willing to sacrifice children?</p><p>Callie shuddered in horror.</p><p>Fane glanced back at the scribe. \u201cWas Lord Zakhar condemned along with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they managed to escape from Saint Petersburg.\u201d Myst turned the page of the book, skimming her finger down to the bottom of the text. \u201cEventually they were tracked to his family estate. The records become fuzzy but it seems that Lord Zakhar was handed over to the villagers who were eager to burn their lord and master at the stake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe woman?\u201d Callie pressed. If the witch was still alive they had to stop her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no mention of her except in a footnote that claims she disappeared along with Lord Zakhar\u2019s charred body.\u201d</p><p>Fane abruptly moved forward, halting at the edge of the table as if sensing Myst wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable having him so close.</p><p>Of course, Fane tended to make a lot of people uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWas there any mention of a coin?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cCoin?\u201d Myst frowned at the unexpected question. \u201cWhat kind of coin?\u201d</p><p>Fane pulled out his phone, turning the screen to show the image of the coin that had been taken from Calso\u2019s security tape.</p><p>The IT wizards hadn\u2019t had time to clean up the grainy image, but astonishingly Myst widened her eyes in surprise.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d She was darting to the back of the room, pulling open a door that led to another vault. This one was lined with wide wooden drawers from floor to ceiling.</p><p>Callie and Fane stood near the door watching the scribe scanning the small plaques on the front of the drawers, her lips moving as she muttered beneath her breath.</p><p>\u201cEtruscan . . . no.\u201d She moved to another drawer. \u201cMinoan. Byzantine. Oh.\u201d She pulled open a drawer and removed a small stone tablet that was etched with faded hieroglyphs. \u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><p>She moved back to Callie and Fane, her finger brushing over the strange symbol of a bird that matched the one on the coin.</p><p>Callie lifted her brows, impressed by the young woman\u2019s ability to recall the symbol among all the endless information stored in the vaults.</p><p>Did she have an eidetic memory?</p><p>Or was it a high-blood power?</p><p>Fane leaned to study the tablet, his finger lightly tracing the bird that was carved in the upper left corner. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt comes from a secret sect of ancient Sumerians,\u201d Myst answered, her expression troubled.</p><p>Callie felt a chill inch down her spine. \u201cWhat was it intended to do?\u201d</p><p>Myst lifted her head, genuine fear shimmering in her eyes. \u201cIt opens a doorway to forbidden knowledge.\u201d</p><p>Fane frowned. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>While Duncan was growing up his da had a no-frills routine. During the week he worked his ass off driving a taxi to support his family. The weekends were spent mowing their small patch of grass or working in the attached garage on the latest POS car they were driving that month.</p><p>Duncan occasionally hung out in the garage. It was the one certain place to avoid the constant squabbling of his sisters. And while he\u2019d never developed his da\u2019s talent for tinkering with engines, he did learn that the best way to get a job done was by using the proper tool.</p><p>You want to catch a drug dealer? Hang out in a crack house.</p><p>You want to find a car thief? Set up a bait car in a high theft neighborhood.</p><p>You want to find a dealer in black-market art, you go to a pawnshop.</p><p>A very exclusive one.</p><p>Stepping out of his car, he studied the building, made entirely of glass and steel.</p><p>It didn\u2019t look like a pawnshop.</p><p>In fact, the main building was used as a perfectly legit art gallery that provided a much needed connection between local artists and the public.</p><p>The basement, however, was notorious for hosting \u201cprivate\u201d auctions to move artwork and antiques that didn\u2019t always have the paperwork necessary for a legal sale.</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t bother trying to shut down the auctions. What was the point? They would pack up and move to a new location before he could get a warrant.</p><p>Besides, having an inside informant who understood that Duncan could disrupt his very profitable business meant that he could get the facts he needed with the minimum of fuss.</p><p>Entering the building, he ignored the beautiful brunette who sashayed toward him in a silver dress that cost more than his car. Instead he weaved his way past the artwork hung from the open girders that passed as a ceiling, not bothering to glance at the bold spatters of paint on the canvases.</p><p>Unlike many, he appreciated modern art, but today he was focused on getting in and out.</p><p>The quicker the better.</p><p>Shoving open the small door at the back of the main showroom, Duncan stepped into the office and shut it behind him.</p><p>At his entrance Jacques Girard rose to his feet. A small, slender man, he was wearing a black designer suit and red silk tie, his black hair peppered with silver brushed away from his severely handsome face.</p><p>He flashed a smooth smile to reveal his perfectly capped teeth. \u201cSergeant O\u2019Conner, what a delightful surprise.\u201d The accent was French, but Duncan would bet his right nut the man had never stepped foot outside Kansas City. \u201cHave a seat, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.\u201d</p><p>Duncan waved aside the invitation, crossing the sparse office that was the same mixture of glass and steel as the gallery. Reaching the desk, he placed the stone vessel wrapped in plastic directly in front of the man.</p><p>\u201cI need your expertise.\u201d</p><p>Jacques leaned down, studying the object with sudden interest. He might be a fraud as a sophisticated Frenchman, but he knew his shit when it came to art.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your concern,\u201d Duncan said. Jacques was too smart not to eventually realize the vessel was a part of Calso\u2019s murder investigation, but Duncan wasn\u2019t about to share confidential police info. \u201cDo you recognize the symbol?\u201d</p><p>The dealer continued to study the vessel, his expression oddly tense. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on antiquities, but my guess would be Sumerian.\u201d</p><p>Sumerian?</p><p>That seemed . . . random.</p><p>\u201cWho deals with this sort of item?\u201d</p><p>The man straightened. \u201cNone locally.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t jerk me around, Girard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Jacques held up his hands. \u201cThis is museum quality. Very rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo give me a name.\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to do some digging.\u201d</p><p>Duncan tossed the picture he\u2019d grabbed at the station onto the desk. \u201cWhat about this?\u201d</p><p>Jacques picked up the twelve-by-twelve glossy picture of the coin that had been taken from the security tape. It had been blown up as large as possible without turning it into a fuzzy blob, but with a sharp motion, Jacques reached for a magnifying glass lying on his desk to study it in grim silence.</p><p>\u201cDid it come with the vessel?\u201d he at last demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Another long silence. \u201cNot currency. Maybe a symbol of authority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much would it be worth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for certain.\u201d</p><p>Jacques made a sound of shock as Duncan smoothly pulled his gun and aimed it at his head. \u201cMon Dieu. I truly don\u2019t know. Were they found together?\u201d</p><p>Duncan kept his gun pointed at his companion. He didn\u2019t intend to shoot the con man. But he sensed Jacques knew more about the coin than he was willing to admit. Obviously, he needed . . . inspiration to share his full range of knowledge.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know they were found together?\u201d</p><p>Jacques licked his lips, using the magnifying glass to point toward the vessel on his desk. \u201cThe symbols along the top of the vase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no expert, but I suspect that they describe the purpose of the coin.\u201d</p><p>Duncan furrowed his brow, considering his words. \u201cLike an instruction manual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. And here ...\u201d The magnifying glass lowered to point toward the odd bird sketched into the stone. \u201cIt matches the hieroglyph etched on the coin. It can\u2019t be a coincidence. Together the pair would be almost priceless.\u201d</p><p>Duncan stiffened, abruptly realizing what had been nagging at him since he\u2019d walked into Calso\u2019s office and caught sight of the ancient vessel.</p><p>\u201cA pair,\u201d he breathed softly.</p><p>Jacques shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what I just said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why would somebody take the coin and leave behind the vessel it came in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo collector would,\u201d Jacques instantly denied. \u201cApart they\u2019re extremely valuable. Together ...\u201d He set the picture next to the vase, emphasizing their matching symbols. \u201cAs I said. Priceless.\u201d</p><p>Duncan had already ruled out robbery as a reason for the murder. A thief didn\u2019t leave behind millions in artwork, let alone a stack of untraceable bills. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now he had to rule out an obsessed antiquities collector.</p><p>Which left . . .</p><p>More goddamn questions than answers.</p> <p>The realization had just struck when he felt the vibration of his phone in his pocket. Stepping back, he holstered his gun before pulling out the phone and pressing it to his ear.</p><p>It would be a pity to shoot one of his best informants just because he didn\u2019t like the latest news.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t doubt for a minute he wasn\u2019t going to like it.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Conner,\u201d he snapped, stiffening as he heard the dispatcher\u2019s unsteady voice telling him that Leah\u2019s body had been found. Again. \u201cWhere?\u201d He made a mental note of the directions. \u201cI\u2019ll be there. Contact Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>Replacing the phone in his pocket, Duncan reached to grasp the vessel and picture from the desk.</p> <p>Jacques had turned a peculiar shade of ash, his suave French facade shattered by a surge of genuine fear.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? You didn\u2019t tell me that this has something to do with the freaks.\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned and headed for the door. \u201cI need the names of dealers who could move these items and I need them fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved with high-bloods,\u201d the con man protested, his voice approaching a screech. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing but trouble.\u201d</p><p>Duncan spared a glance over his shoulder. \u201cNot nearly as much trouble as disappointing me.\u201d</p><p>Confident the man understood the cost of failure, Duncan headed across the showroom, his expression dark enough to keep the hovering assistant at a safe distance.</p> <p>Then, getting into his car, he raced out of town at a speed that would make his ma faint.</p><p>He had to do something to vent his simmering frustration.</p><p>Okay, maybe the morning hadn\u2019t been a complete waste. He\u2019d discovered the vessel and coin were unmistakably connected and that they had been crafted by the ancient Sumerians.</p><p>But the information didn\u2019t give him a direct path to Zakhar, which he needed if he was going to help Callie.</p><p>And now he was headed to collect the body of a young female who should have been protected by the police, if not while she was alive, then most certainly after she was dead.</p><p>Was it any wonder his foot was a little heavy on the accelerator?</p><p>Arriving at the remote location east of town, he parked his car on the bluff and made his way cautiously down to the muddy bank of the Missouri River.</p><p>He was immediately hit by the stench of brackish water and green slime that had collected in a small pool that was blocked from the river by a pile of rotting logs. His grimace, however, was for the young woman who was stretched on the mud. She\u2019d clearly been dumped in the river in the hopes her body would float far enough away that she wouldn\u2019t be connected to Kansas City.</p> <p>Instead she\u2019d gotten caught on the logs.</p><p>Another surge of frustration flared through him. Dammit. Leah should be shopping with her friends. Or attending college. Or hell, dancing at the Rabbit Hutch, making old men pop little blue pills in the hope they might get lucky.</p><p>Anything but lying in the mud with her eyes staring blindly at the cloudless sky.</p><p>Turning his attention from the body, Duncan frowned at the sight of Frank with a crowd of uniformed police standing several feet away. Why the hell wasn\u2019t the silver-haired coroner processing the body? Were they waiting on something? Or someone?</p><p>At his approach Frank stepped away from the other cops, his expression hard. \u201cO\u2019Conner. About damned time you got here.\u201d</p><p>Duncan sighed. Knowing the older man as well as he did, he had no doubt Frank took the theft and abuse of Leah\u2019s body personally.</p><p>\u201cWho found her?\u201d</p><p>Frank jerked a thumb toward the large man standing at the top of the bluff, his beefy face flushed with adrenaline.</p><p>\u201cA local farmer. He was searching for a missing cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been warned not to speak to anyone?\u201d Duncan demanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Frank rolled his eyes. \u201cFor all the good it will do.\u201d</p><p>Duncan shrugged. It wasn\u2019t like the farmer found a dead girl every day. Thank god. Who could blame him if he made the most of the rare event?</p><p>\u201cHave you been able to examine her?\u201d</p><p>Frank muttered a curse. \u201cI just started when I was told to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chief.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. \u201cDid she say why?\u201d</p><p>The coroner\u2019s expression went from hard to bleak. \u201cThe freaks are coming to collect her.\u201d</p><p>If Frank had said those words just yesterday, Duncan would have gone ballistic. This was his case and he\u2019d be damned if any freak was going to interfere.</p><p>Now, he squashed his territorial urges. Whatever was happening was way beyond his comfort zone. The more help the better. And speaking of help ...</p><p>\u201cDid you learn anything?\u201d he asked his companion.</p><p>Frank scowled. \u201cAre you deaf? I just said I was told not to touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not deaf and I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d Duncan drawled. \u201cThe day you do what you\u2019re told is the day I sprout wings and a halo.\u201d</p><p>A rueful smile replaced the scowl. \u201cFine,\u201d Frank muttered. \u201cHer heart is still missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo surprise. What else?\u201d</p><p>Frank stepped closer, pitching his voice so it wouldn\u2019t carry. Word would eventually leak through the police department that their missing corpse had been caught on video surveillance killing one of Kansas City\u2019s most powerful citizens. But the longer they could keep it quiet, the longer they could avoid outright panic.</p><p>\u201cHer body\u2019s not in bad shape considering she\u2019s been walking around the city,\u201d Frank admitted, his voice edged with a soul-deep anger.</p><p>Duncan glanced toward the slender female who lay like a broken flower in the mud. He understood his companion\u2019s fury.</p><p>It was wrong. Obscene.</p><p>\u201cNo obvious wounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything to indicate where she\u2019s been?\u201d</p><p>Frank hesitated before giving a small shrug. \u201cOne thing.\u201d</p><p>Hah. Duncan knew he could count on Frank. The man might be a norm, but nothing got past his eagle eye. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tags in her clothing.\u201d</p><p>Duncan glanced back to Leah, skimming a puzzled gaze over the stretchy pants and top.</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clothes we found in her house were all from the local mall.\u201d</p><p>Duncan whipped his gaze back to his companion. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Frank flashed a droll smile. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? I have three teenage daughters. There\u2019s not a store in that mall I haven\u2019t been dragged through a thousand times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that would do it,\u201d Duncan admitted, startled by the tiny pang of envy. He\u2019d always known he wanted children. It was imprinted into the O\u2019Conner DNA. So why was he suddenly feeling that he wanted those children now? Christ. Did men have biological clocks? Shaking his head at his moronic thoughts, he returned his attention to what Frank was trying to explain. \u201cIs there something different about the clothes she\u2019s wearing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Sung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Sung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Sung. A local designer,\u201d Frank said. \u201cVery high end.\u201d</p><p>Weird. Why would the necro go to the expense of designer clothes for a corpse he was going to toss in the river?</p><p>\u201cThanks, amigo,\u201d he said, making a mental note to check with the more exclusive salons.</p><p>Frank stiffened, his glance shooting over Duncan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe cavalry has arrived.\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned, prepared for the uniformed medics who were swiftly moving to wrap Leah in a protective bag that would hide her from prying eyes as well as preserve any evidence on her body.</p><p>What he wasn\u2019t prepared for was the sight of Callie and Fane, who followed closely behind the medics.</p><p>Had they already traveled to Russia and back? The thought would have boggled his mind if he hadn\u2019t been even more boggled by the lightning strike of awareness that sizzled through him.</p><p>Dressed in casual jeans with a white tee and her stunning eyes covered by sunglasses, she should have been easily overlooked. She was certainly tiny enough to be lost in the crowd.</p><p>But there wasn\u2019t a male gaze that didn\u2019t linger on the exotic crimson of her spiky hair and the grace of her movements as she halted several feet away while Fane moved to place himself directly between the medics and the gathered human police.</p><p>Like a rabid guard dog.</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem,\u201d he murmured to Frank in absent tones.</p><p>\u201cI heard you stayed at Valhalla.\u201d Frank cleared his throat. \u201cAnd not alone.\u201d</p><p>Duncan sent his companion a warning glare. \u201cYou have a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your panties in a twist.\u201d Frank lifted his hands. \u201cI was just wondering what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d</p><p>With a snort Duncan began walking toward Callie. \u201cTell you what, Frank. When I figure it out you\u2019ll be the first to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game, amigo,\u201d the coroner called behind him.</p><p>Callie stood, stiff and uncomfortable as Duncan casually strolled in her direction.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t pleased to see him.</p><p>She snorted softly. Not pleased? Why not just admit it?</p><p>She was tingling from head to toe.</p><p>Just catching sight of him with his golden hair shimmering in the sunlight and his lean body shown to advantage in the faded jeans and black tee made her heart leap and her mouth go as dry as the Sahara.</p><p>She wanted to cross the rough ground and wrap her arms around him. Not just because she remembered the pleasure of being pressed against those hard muscles; delving into the dark history of Lord Zakhar had left her feeling edgy. As if a shadow was looming over her. She could definitely use a hug.</p><p>Instead, she wrapped her arms around herself, acutely aware of the suspicious glances from Duncan\u2019s human friends. They\u2019d clearly heard rumors of Duncan staying at Valhalla and were keeping watch to make sure he hadn\u2019t been \u201ccontaminated\u201d by the freaks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And, besides, she hadn\u2019t yet decided if seeking comfort from this particular male was really a wise choice.</p><p>Had she?</p><p>The disturbing question whirled through her mind as Duncan halted in front of her, making her even more edgy.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Sergeant O\u2019Conner,\u201d she murmured in a tight voice.</p><p>\u201cSergeant O\u2019Conner?\u201d He blinked. \u201cIs that a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be here. We just returned to Valhalla when the Mave asked that we bring the medics to collect the body,\u201d she found herself babbling, taking a step backward. \u201cShe hopes that an autopsy of Leah might reveal the precise magic the necromancer used to animate her.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned as he studied her wary expression. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips at his impatient question. \u201cI just told you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told me why you\u2019re here,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me why you\u2019re acting like I didn\u2019t spend the morning kissing every satin inch of you.\u201d</p><p>Heat stained her cheeks. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question or I\u2019m going to get a hell of a lot louder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted people to realize that we\u2019d been together,\u201d she said, giving a startled grunt when he grasped her arm and tugged her toward a trail leading back up the bluff. Far enough away to make sure no one could overhear them, although they remained in full view of the gawking cops. \u201cDuncan. What are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to make sure I have this right.\u201d The hazel eyes sparked with gold, warning his temper was roused. \u201cAre you implying that you thought I might be ashamed of sleeping with you?\u201d</p><p>Put that way it sounded . . . bad.</p><p>She shot a glance toward the crowd, shifting her feet. She hated being the center of attention. Especially when she was surrounded by norms. \u201cCan we discuss this later?\u201d</p><p>His jaw hardened. He was well and truly pissed.</p><p>\u201cNo, we damned well can\u2019t discuss this later. We discuss this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are staring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d He leaned close enough to whisper directly in her ear, his scent teasing her nose and making her blood heat. Man. She loved the smell of him. Blood rushed to her cheeks as she realized her nipples had hardened and excitement was buzzing through her lower stomach. She wanted to shove her fingers into his hair and trail a line of kisses over his stubborn jaw. Or bury her face in the curve of his neck and savor his intoxicating scent. \u201cJust like I don\u2019t give a damn if they know I\u2019ve taken you as my lover,\u201d he continued, placing an intimate kiss just below her ear before he pulled back to study her with a brooding gaze. \u201cUnless that\u2019s not the problem?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, struggling to concentrate on his words.</p> <p>Dammit. She was the Queen of Composure. Nothing rattled her. Especially not a mere man.</p><p>But Duncan O\u2019Conner possessed an aggravating ability to slip beneath her defenses.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re ashamed that people might suspect that you\u2019ve lowered your standards to allow a barely civilized cop into your bed?\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of disbelief at the idiotic suggestion. There wasn\u2019t a woman alive who wouldn\u2019t be proud to claim this man as her lover.</p><p>\u201cIf that was the case then I would never have spent the night with you.\u201d She pointed out the obvious. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone in Valhalla who doesn\u2019t know we were together.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, his cop face on full display. \u201cThen why did you act like I was the enemy?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, shifting to hide her expression from the onlookers. The man might be gorgeous, sexy, and unexpectedly tender beneath his macho facade, but he was as stubborn as a Missouri mule.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult.\u201d</p><p>He hooked a finger beneath her chin, tilting back her head to regard her with open concern. \u201cTalk to me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Fine. Maybe it was better if he knew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been a couple,\u201d she grudgingly admitted.</p><p>He stilled, his eyes focusing on her with laser intensity. Like a hunter catching sight of unexpected prey.</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>She shivered. Not with fear. But . . . anticipation.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve only dated a few times and they were always casual.\u201d</p><p>His thumb brushed her lower lip, the light caress sending a jolt of sweet pleasure to the pit of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cSo I embarrassed you with my public display of affection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose, recalling her awkwardness this morning and then again when she\u2019d first seen Duncan this afternoon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more the fact I don\u2019t understand the rules of the game.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened, the wicked sensuality warming his hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cBetween us there are no rules. We\u2019ll work our way through this . . .\u201d He leaned down to brush her lips in a light kiss. \u201cTogether.\u201d</p><p>Another delectable shiver raced through her body and she lifted her hands to rest them against the hard contours of his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your friends are going to approve.\u201d</p><p>He nibbled the corner of her mouth. \u201cThen they\u2019re not my friends.\u201d</p><p>An unexpected warmth spread through her heart at his simple words. Strange. Was it really that important to her that he wasn\u2019t the least hesitant to claim her in public?</p><p>Obviously, it was.</p><p>\u201cAnd your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already promised I was taking you to Sunday dinner.\u201d</p><p>It was once again the perfect answer, so naturally Callie panicked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean . . . not this Sunday.\u201d</p><p>A wry smile tugged at his lips. \u201cWhy the cold feet?\u201d</p><p>It was a legitimate question. And one she had no answer for.</p><p>Everything had turned upside down in the past two days.</p><p>Her belief that there were rigid laws of physics that controlled the powers of high-bloods.</p><p>The assumption that she had her peaceful, if somewhat isolated, future all planned out.</p><p>The unspoken rule that norms and freaks didn\u2019t mix.</p><p>Was it any wonder she was torn between the intense desire to haul this man into the bushes and rip off his clothes and the urge to return to Valhalla and hide beneath her covers? Unfortunately, neither option was viable.</p><p>Not until they\u2019d tracked down Lord Zakhar and put a stop to his gruesome abuse of the dead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He dropped a light kiss on her nose before he pulled back and studied her with a resigned smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait until you don\u2019t hyperventilate at the mere mention of family.\u201d</p><p>Her missing sense of humor returned at his gentle teasing. \u201cSo generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when we\u2019re working the case I\u2019ll be professional,\u201d he promised, a sinful heat melting the gold in his eyes until they shimmered in the afternoon sunlight. \u201cEven if I\u2019m counting the seconds until I can get you naked and lick you from top to bottom.\u201d</p><p>Her heart slammed against her ribs in instant hunger. Suddenly the option of pushing him into the bushes and stripping off his clothes was much more viable.</p><p>Too viable.</p><p>\u201cYou are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Barely civilized.\u201d With a wicked grin he glanced over her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019d better go before Fane terrifies the entire KC police department into early retirement.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>With swift efficiency the medics had Leah\u2019s body wrapped in a protective bag while Callie gave Duncan a condensed version of what they\u2019d learned in Russia. With an equally condensed version, Duncan had shared his trip to the art expert, revealing the man had spoken of the coin being Sumerian in origin.</p><p>It was a step forward, but not nearly far enough or fast enough.</p><p>Deep inside her was a growing pulse of anxiety.</p><p>As if something was warning her that time was running out.</p><p>There was a faint stir from the cops still grouped together and, turning her head, Callie realized that Fane was coming to demand that they leave.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she crossed the short distance to speak with the Sentinel in private.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to like what she had to say, but for once she was determined. It was time to put on her big girl panties. She was done hiding behind her loyal guardian and the protective walls of Valhalla.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here and work on the investigation with Duncan,\u201d she said, barely waiting for Fane to come to a halt.</p><p>His face was devoid of expression, his dark eyes hard. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFane, listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the rules.\u201d</p><p>She did. A diviner was never to travel outside Valhalla without protection. There were far too many loonies who thought that the only good diviner was a dead one.</p><p>And that was before the news started to spread that there was a necromancer out there toying with young, female corpses.</p><p>She deliberately glanced toward Duncan, who watched them with a narrowed gaze. \u201cI won\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you deliberately trying to piss me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m trying to be logical.\u201d She ignored his muttered opinion of her logic. \u201cOnly you can return Leah and the medics to Valhalla. It makes sense for me to remain here and continue the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this investigation include?\u201d</p><p>She turned back, her gaze ricocheting off his granite-hard expression. \u201cDuncan mentioned that Leah was wearing clothing from an exclusive salon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants to see if he can find the specific store and interview the owner.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s searching for a lead on the coin\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI suggested we stop by the Rabbit Hutch to see if any of Leah\u2019s friends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Callie sighed at his immediate rejection of a perfectly sound proposal. As if that would stop her if she was truly determined to visit the strip joint.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the same answer I got from Duncan.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cMen.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a long, silent minute. Intimidation at its finest.</p> <p>\u201cYou could wait for my return so I could go with you.\u201d</p><p>It was her turn to nip the suggestion in the bud. She might be used to the Sentinel, but to most people he was a scary-ass MOFO.</p><p>\u201cFane, I love you, but you terrify the norms,\u201d she pointed out gently. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they would talk if they caught a glimpse of you.\u201d</p><p>A dangerous smile curled his lips. \u201cI could make them talk.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. Fane had made hardened warriors weep in fear. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that for a minute, but I think we should try it Duncan\u2019s way first,\u201d she said, reaching in to place her fingers against the side of his throat. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t work we\u2019ll call in the big guns.\u201d</p> <p>His dark eyes remained flat, unrelenting. \u201cHe can\u2019t protect you from the witch. Or any other high-blood.\u201d</p><p>Callie couldn\u2019t argue. Duncan might be a hell of a cop, but he wasn\u2019t a Sentinel.</p><p>Although, with his special powers he could always . . . She squashed the unexpected thought.</p><p>Duncan loved being a cop. Being human. And wishing for him to join her world was the sort of thing that could break a woman\u2019s heart.</p><p>Or maybe just break her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take any risks,\u201d she assured her companion. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p> <p>As if sensing her growing vulnerability, Fane narrowed his dark gaze. \u201cThis is bigger than you, Callie.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the unwelcomed reminder of Boggs\u2019s warning. \u201cWe don\u2019t know I\u2019m actually involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no longer a child,\u201d he chided. \u201cYou can\u2019t stick your head in the sand and pretend that you don\u2019t sense the growing danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she abruptly admitted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He gave an exaggerated blink. \u201cDo you have a fever?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, not about to admit the nightmares that plagued her or the looming sense of doom. She\u2019d be locked in her apartment before she could say \u201cJack Robinson.\u201d Whatever the hell that meant.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ignore the warnings,\u201d she said, keeping it vague. \u201cIf there\u2019s a darkness that threatens us then we have to stop it. The sooner, the better.\u201d She lowered her hand to poke Fane in the center of his steel-hard chest. \u201cWhich means accepting whatever assistance we can get.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t just about being alone with the cop?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated. She might not always fully confess to her guardian, but she never deliberately lied.</p><p>Their relationship was built on having complete faith in one another and she would never do anything to jeopardize it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a small part, but I won\u2019t be distracted. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, I trust.\u201d He sent a burning glare toward Duncan. \u201cHim\u2014never.\u201d</p><p>Only a few feet away Duncan stiffened, his hands curling at his sides as he met Fane glare for glare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you with any information we get,\u201d she said, giving him another poke to distract him from his silent stare-off with Duncan.</p><p>Christ. Testosterone was a pain in the ass.</p><p>Grudgingly Fane turned back to meet her annoyed gaze. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can find information on the coin.\u201d</p><p>His words caught Callie off guard. \u201cYou\u2019re going back to see Myst?\u201d she demanded, recalling the fragile beauty of the scribe.</p><p>Was it possible that the stoic Sentinel had been smitten?</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t begrudge him an opportunity for a bit of happiness. He\u2019d sacrificed far too much for her. But she couldn\u2019t deny a sense of disappointment for Serra.</p><p>The beautiful psychic would be devastated if Fane chose another.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He tapped her nose\u2014a silent warning to keep it out of his personal business. \u201cI know a monk who has studied the Sumerians.\u201d</p><p>Ah. She grinned in relief. \u201cHe isn\u2019t Sumerian, is he?\u201d she demanded. Monks were rumored to live as long as any high-blood.</p><p>Another tap. \u201cIt\u2019s not polite to ask\u201d</p><p>She stepped back, her smile fading. \u201cBe careful, Fane. You\u2019re not as invincible as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am\u201d He held her gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll come for you first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>He took off, moving with a fluid grace as he led the medics up the bluff and away from the humans who gaped at him like he was a wild animal who might very well ravage them if he slipped his leash.</p><p>They weren\u2019t wrong.</p><p>Zak was seated at his desk in his private library when the scent of blood had him lifting his head to watch as Anya stepped into the room.</p><p>For once she\u2019d put aside her designer clothing and was covered from neck to toe in a black satin robe with her hair pulled into a tight braid that fell down her back. Zak was similarly attired, although his robe was made of a silver silk that would be disposed of once they were done.</p><p>Blood and death were a messy business.</p><p>\u201cYou have prepared the spell?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThe blood has opened a pathway to our destination.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet, unconcerned by the knowledge she\u2019d had to sacrifice a young child to create the magic necessary to create a gateway.</p><p>It was, after all, the reason he\u2019d first been attracted to Anya.</p><p>There were any number of witches and mystics among the Russian court, some of them even real. But Anya was special. Long before high-bloods had become known by the norms, she\u2019d trained with a clandestine coven that had taught her magic that was long since banned. Including the ability to travel that was similar to a Sentinel, although she was drawn to objects with magical power instead of using well-established portals from monastery to monastery.</p><p>Which was how she first stumbled across the ancient ziggurat covered in hieroglyphics that was nearly buried in the deserts of Iran.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, grim satisfaction edging his voice. \u201cThen let\u2019s go before my destiny can be once again snatched away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnatched away?\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA traitor?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cDid I stutter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d Anya frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I should think it was obvious. Someone has betrayed me.\u201d A chill swirled through the air. \u201cSomeone very close to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly suspect me? It would be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend moral outrage, Anya,\u201d he warned in cold tones. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>The witch clenched her bloodstained hands. \u201cI have as much invested as you, Zak. Why would I devote my life to you only to become a traitor?\u201d</p><p>He was far from impressed by her fierce response. Only an idiot would trust a woman who would willingly sell her soul to the highest bidder.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you have invested?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>She sucked in an outraged breath. \u201cI saved your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I pulled you from the flames.\u201d Temper abruptly snapped in her emerald eyes. \u201cIt was my magic that kept your heart beating while your body healed.\u201d</p><p>His own expression remained glacial. \u201cYou also promised a dozen times we were about to get your hands on the coin, only to discover that it had once again slipped from our grasp.\u201d</p><p>She muttered a foul curse. \u201cIt was your bokors that failed, not my magic.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stroked over the coin hidden in the pocket of his robe. Over the years he\u2019d meticulously reviewed his failures to acquire the coin. He\u2019d wasted enormous resources and risked exposure each time he raised the dead. The fact that they\u2019d missed carrying out their mission by mere hours, sometimes minutes, had been enough to stir his suspicions.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Anya narrowed her gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe more simple explanation was that someone was warning the owners of the coin that I was on their trail.\u201d</p><p>She appeared genuinely outraged by his words. \u201cIf you suspected I was a traitor then why did you allow me to stay with you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in the theory that it\u2019s best to keep your enemies close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is insanity,\u201d she hissed. \u201cIf it was me, then why wouldn\u2019t I have warned Calso?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re actually innocent. Or perhaps this is a cleverly constructed trap.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cUntil I know which it is, I can assure you I will be on constant guard.\u201d He offered a cold smile. \u201cNow, are we traveling to the temple or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d With a swirl of satin robes, the witch was heading out the door. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>In silence they made their way to Anya\u2019s private rooms on the upper floor. The stench of blood became almost overwhelming as she pushed open the door to reveal her sitting room, which had been converted into a basic chapel.</p><p>With a grimace, Zak glanced over the scrolled chairs with pretty pastel cushions that were arranged in a semicircle around the rough wooden altar. The expensive artwork that had once hung on the ivory walls had been piled in one corner and replaced with shelves of murky bottles that held an assortment of nasty ingredients used by Anya when she was cooking up her potions or casting her spells.</p><p>The curtains had been pulled across the window, shrouding the room in shadows. The only light was a lone candle that sat on the altar next to the wooden bowl filled with blood.</p><p>The blood of an innocent.</p><p>Moving forward, Anya waved a hand toward the altar. \u201cStand beside me,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>Zak joined her, reaching to grasp her wrist in a grip tight enough to hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnya,\u201d he murmured in silken tones, \u201cmake very certain there are no mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Duncan was damned proud of himself.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t pulled his gun when Fane had stood protectively close to Callie, his expression hard as he clearly tried to convince the young diviner to return to Valhalla with him.</p> <p>Or when Callie had lifted her hand to touch the Sentinel with an intimacy that made him growl like a fucking dog.</p><p>Or even when Fane had sent Duncan a glare that warned all sorts of bad, bad repercussions if Callie was hurt on his watch.</p><p>Yeah, so kudos to him.</p><p>Still, he couldn\u2019t resist wrapping a possessive arm around her shoulders when she at last returned to his side and the hulking guardian jogged up the steep path, pausing at the top to send Duncan one last glare.</p><p>And if that made him a caveman ... then so be it.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look happy,\u201d he muttered, tugging her even closer to his side.</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t pounded his chest, right?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d She heaved a faint sigh before turning to study him with a determined expression. \u201cWhere do we go first?\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid over her pale, perfect features, barely resisting the urge to pluck off her reflective glasses so he could drown in the sapphire beauty of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know where I\u2019d like to go,\u201d he murmured softly.</p><p>She lifted a brow. \u201cShould I ask?\u201d</p> <p>His hands lightly skimmed up and down the back of her arms. \u201cMy apartment is only a few miles away.\u201d</p><p>He felt her revealing shiver of pleasure, but she shook her head in warning.</p><p>\u201cI thought you genuinely wanted me to help in your investigation.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI do, but I\u2019m a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>With a chuckle he stepped back, reaching in his front pocket to remove his cell phone.</p><p>As much as he preferred the idea of luring her to his apartment, he understood that their relationship had become physical at supersonic speed. Not that he was complaining. Hell, no. But the lack of traditional wooing meant Callie couldn\u2019t be certain that he valued her as much for her swift intelligence and quiet courage as he did for her beauty.</p><p>Something he intended to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m about to call the station so we can get on with the investigation,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She smirked at his overly innocent smile, but reached out to grab his arm. \u201cWhy do you have to call the station? I thought we were going to investigate the designer shops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are, but I\u2019m hoping to narrow down the search by finding out which salons carry a local designer.\u201d He struggled to remember what Frank had told him. \u201cSung something or other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d She pulled out her own phone and scrolled through her contacts.</p><p>\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerra.\u201d She lifted the phone to her ear. \u201cShe\u2019s intimately familiar with every store in a hundred-mile radius.\u201d</p><p>Duncan had a searing memory of Serra\u2019s skin-tight clothing and kick-ass boots. He didn\u2019t have his coroner\u2019s personal experience with female attire, but he did have a butt-load of sisters. He\u2019d learned to recognize a fashionista.</p><p>His da had nearly strangled his youngest sister when he discovered she\u2019d used his credit card to buy a six-hundred-dollar designer purse. He shuddered to think what the psychic had spent on her boots.</p><p>\u201cSomehow that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d</p><p>She pretended she didn\u2019t hear his muttered words as she spoke into the phone. \u201cSerra, do you know a designer named Sung? Great, where can you buy the label?\u201d She listened, nodding her head. \u201cThanks, you\u2019re a doll.\u201d She paused, a faint smile curling her lips. \u201cFane? Actually he\u2019s on his way back to Valhalla, although it\u2019s going to be a touch and go landing, so if you want to catch him you need to be prepared. Good pluck.\u201d</p><p>She returned her phone to her pocket, then sent him a curious smile as she felt his lingering gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked your guardian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would you leave him at the mercy of that man-eater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She punched him in the shoulder, the blow surprisingly strong despite her lack of bulk. Were all high-bloods more powerful than norms? It would explain why his bench press record at the police academy was still unbeaten. And deflate a small piece of his ego. \u201cSerra\u2019s my dearest friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he countered, giving an exaggerated shudder.</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t be terrifying?\u201d she asked, only partially teasing. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen me mad yet.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. His gaze briefly flicked to the crimson flames of her hair. He\u2019d already discovered the passionate nature beneath her facade of calm. He didn\u2019t doubt for a second that included a temper that could flay him alive.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t intend to,\u201d he warned, brushing his thumb over the lush curve of her lower lip. \u201cI am, after all, completely adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you are is full of shit,\u201d she corrected dryly.</p><p>His bark of laughter echoed around the secluded alcove. \u201cPossibly.\u201d Ignoring the gazes from his fellow cops, which ranged from disgust to blatant envy, he steered Callie toward the path leading up the bluff. \u201cDid she give you the name of a store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo. Victoria\u2019s Boutique at the Plaza and the Paris Gallery in Independence.\u201d</p><p>She easily jogged up the steep incline, the sway of her ass encased in the tight jeans sending a sizzling heat through Duncan\u2019s body. Oh, he wanted his hands on the rounded derriere, preferably as she was riding him to oblivion. Or maybe while she was on her hands and knees as he took her from behind.</p><p>\u201cDuncan? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s question intruded into his sinful fantasy, forcing him to realize that they\u2019d reached the top of the bluff.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t responded to a woman with this sort of mindless lust since . . .</p><p>Since never, he was forced to concede.</p><p>Not even during his crazed, hormonal teen years.</p><p>Clearing his throat, he tapped the name of the salons into his phone\u2019s GPS, feeling a heat crawl up the back of his neck. Thank god, Callie was a diviner and not a psychic.</p><p>She\u2019d push him back down the bluff.</p><p>Head first.</p><p>\u201cAll set,\u201d he muttered, lifting his gaze to meet her puzzled frown. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She followed in silence, allowing him to settle her in the front seat of his car and take off at a speed considerably less reckless than when he\u2019d arrived. She wasn\u2019t obeying his order, merely trying to figure out why he was blushing like an idiot.</p><p>Thankfully her lingering scrutiny was distracted as he turned onto Broadway and made his way to the Plaza.</p><p>Pressing her nose to the window, she appeared fascinated by the Spanish-inspired buildings and exquisite fountains that were a trademark of the area. At night the neighborhood was bathed in stunning lights and the air was filled with soft jazz, but during the day it was the domain of the upscale shoppers.</p><p>With a low laugh, Duncan pulled into an underground parking lot and turned off the motor.</p><p>Callie turned to meet his smile with a frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>He slid out of the car, not surprised that Callie was already standing near the hood by the time he\u2019d shut the door. She might be forced to travel with a guardian, but that didn\u2019t mean she meekly depended on a man.</p><p>If anything, she fought for every inch of independence she could claim.</p><p>\u201cYou look like my five-year-old niece, Tabby, when I take her to the carnival,\u201d he answered her question, placing a gentle hand on her elbow as he strolled toward the nearby stairs.</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll wide-eyed wonder.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile tugged at her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t often leave Valhalla and when I do it\u2019s rarely for pleasure.\u201d</p><p>A deep, aching regret clutched at his heart. Her words were simple, spoken without bitterness. But to a man who\u2019d grown up surrounded by loving family and a community who\u2019d easily accepted him, it made him want to hit something.</p><p>What kind of world forced a little girl to remain hidden behind protective walls or risk being attacked by small-minded vigilantes?</p><p>He had an easy answer.</p><p>It was the same world that would happily demand her help when her \u201ccurse\u201d could help solve a murder.</p><p>With an effort, he squashed his surge of anger. He couldn\u2019t change Callie\u2019s past. All he could do was try to show her that there were good and beautiful things to be discovered beyond Valhalla.</p><p>They stepped onto the sun-drenched street just a block from their destination.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been to the Plaza?\u201d he asked as they strolled along the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cNot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have time if you want to look around.\u201d He nodded toward an exclusive jewelry store across the road. \u201cMaybe do a little shopping.\u201d</p><p>The sun glinted off her reflective glasses as she turned in his direction. \u201cYou assume because I\u2019m a woman I must love to shop?\u201d</p><p>He leaned down to steal an all too brief kiss. \u201cAbsolutely, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Callie did her best to hide her smile as she planted her hands on her hips.</p><p>Deep inside she had to admit that she was enchanted by Duncan\u2019s teasing. She\u2019d never spent her days indulging in light flirtations like other young girls. Not because she didn\u2019t want to, but people treated diviners differently, even among high-bloods. It might not always be suspicion, but at the very least . . . wariness. And Callie was by nature more serious than many of her friends.</p><p>Now she couldn\u2019t deny a giddy enjoyment at being treated like a pretty woman who\u2019d caught the attention of a virile, drop-dead sexy man.</p><p>Of course, she might be naive, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. Duncan was a man who expected to have his way, either with charm or sheer arrogance. If she didn\u2019t keep him in line, he\u2019d trample all over her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think we should find the boutique before I punch you in the nose,\u201d she threatened.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up in mock surrender before turning to stroll down the street. Well, stroll wasn\u2019t exactly what he did. Like Fane, he was on constant guard, his eyes searching for potential enemies among the passing pedestrians and his body angled to make sure any approaching danger had to go through him first. A panther on the prowl. She smiled wryly. The Sentinel would be proud of her companion. Even if he\u2019d rather have his tongue cut out than admit it.</p> <p>And she wasn\u2019t the only one to notice the potent appeal of his dangerous appearance.</p><p>A dozen female gazes were laser-focused on the hard muscles beneath his tight tee and faded jeans, while another dozen were lingering on the chiseled perfection of his face, which was kept from being pretty by the golden stubble on his stubborn jaw and the lethal shimmer in his hazel eyes. Even with the pale, satin smooth hair tumbled onto his brow there was no mistaking he was all male.</p><p>Ruthless, unattainable.</p><p>Perhaps sensing her growing annoyance at the female ogling, Duncan flashed her a wicked smile. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shop, what do you like to do?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, forcing away her ridiculous stab of jealousy. Okay. Women liked to stare at Duncan O\u2019Conner. Who could blame them? It certainly wasn\u2019t worth ruining this rare opportunity to enjoy the city.</p> <p>And, despite her grim duty to locate the dangerous necromancer, she intended to appreciate her time away from Valhalla.</p><p>\u201cDifferent stuff,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>The hazel eyes studied her with open curiosity. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a hobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work too many hours, but if I did have the time I\u2019ve always wanted to coach Little League,\u201d he answered with an easy frankness that she envied.</p><p>She was too used to keeping her thoughts and feelings to herself.</p> <p>\u201cLittle League?\u201d She lifted a surprised brow. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love kids and I love baseball.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt seems the perfect choice.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she had an image of him surrounded by rambunctious boys, his expression stern while his eyes twinkled with indulgent merriment.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she abruptly admitted. \u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cAre you mocking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. I think you would make a great coach.\u201d</p><p>His expression remained wary, as if not sure whether she was insulting him or not. \u201cBecause I still act like I\u2019m five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that,\u201d she teased.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>A rare chuckle escaped her lips. He even sounded like a petulant five-year-old.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured, deciding to put him out of his misery. \u201cYou\u2019re also a natural leader without being overbearing. Your fellow cops obviously respect you. And you have a certain amount of charm when you aren\u2019t being an ass.\u201d She elbowed him in the side. \u201cThe kids would adore you.\u201d</p><p>He reached to brush his fingers through her short, spiky hair. A silent thank-you for her belief in him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Callie?\u201d he asked in a husky voice. \u201cWhat makes you happy?\u201d</p><p>She paused, truly considering his question. There were a lot of things she enjoyed. Being with her friends. Working in the garden. A quiet night in her apartment reading a good book.</p><p>\u201cSpending time in the nursery,\u201d she at last said, for the first time realizing just how much she depended on the pleasure she found surrounded by children.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He grinned in appreciation. \u201cA sucker for the babies, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just babies,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAt Valhalla all children under the age of five spend at least a few hours every day in the nursery.\u201d</p><p>He seemed fascinated by the glimpse into a world that was shrouded in mystery for most people. \u201cIs there a particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make sure they become accustomed to being with kids who aren\u2019t like them. In such a confined space we can\u2019t afford prejudices,\u201d she explained without hesitation. It wasn\u2019t a state secret. And besides, Duncan wasn\u2019t just another norm. \u201cIt also helps them to learn to control their powers when they\u2019re in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you meant when you said you had a lot of mothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Warmth flowed through her at the memory of being surrounded by love. After seeing the trauma of children brought into Valhalla who\u2019d been neglected and even abused, she understood what a gift her childhood had been. \u201cHigh-bloods aren\u2019t like most people.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers down the center of her back, the light caress making her toes curl in her shoes.</p><p>\u201cActually, I pretty much worked that out for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that ninety-nine percent of the time they aren\u2019t born to high-blood parents,\u201d she said, relieved when her voice was steady. No need feeding his outrageous ego with the fact he could make her melt with one careless touch. \u201cSo they\u2019re brought to us as abandoned babies or as children who can no longer live with their biological families. They need the reassurance they\u2019re wanted and valued by their new community.\u201d</p><p>He came to an abrupt halt, swinging her until they were face to face. \u201cMy ma is going to love you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart missed a beat at his unexpected words. \u201cBecause I enjoy children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she was forever taking in stray chicks despite our constant protests the house was about ready to bust at the seams.\u201d His gaze swept over her upturned face with a piercing intensity. \u201cShe\u2019ll be delighted to meet a fellow mother hen.\u201d</p><p>His mother . . . The woman who no doubt thought no one was good enough for her baby.</p><p>Certainly not a freak from Valhalla.</p><p>Aaaaand cue panic.</p><p>She pulled away, waving an unsteady hand toward the door on the corner that was shaded by an elegant ivory canopy. \u201cI think that\u2019s the place.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he reached down to brush her lips in a brief kiss.</p><p>\u201cSomeday,\u201d he murmured against her lips.</p><p>Duncan leashed his impatience. Baby steps, he silently told himself. If I rush her, I might lose her. And he wasn\u2019t prepared to risk that.</p><p>Instead he led her into the chichi store, surprised when she pulled away to wander through the racks of clothing that cost more than he made in a year.</p><p>Maybe she liked shopping more than she was willing to admit. With a shrug, he turned to watch the silver-haired woman wearing a discreet black dress cross the plush ivory carpet, her thin face pinched as if she\u2019d caught a foul odor.</p><p>Duncan hid a wry smile. He wasn\u2019t the sort of cop who got off on busting the balls of perps. He did what had to be done, no extracurricular activity included.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t deny a very human anticipation in pissing off this sour-faced female. There were few things that peeved him as much as someone thinking a few bucks in the bank made them better than others.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d she asked in tones that indicated he needed to return to the gutter he crawled out of ASAP.</p><p>Reaching into his back pocket, he pulled out his badge to flash it with a feral smile. \u201cKCPD. I\u2019m here to ask you a few questions.\u201d</p><p>The woman gave a small gasp, her hard blue eyes shooting around the empty store as if afraid someone might overhear them. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what questions you could have for me.\u201d</p><p>Duncan replaced the badge with his phone, flipping through the images until he found one of Leah he\u2019d pulled from the Rabbit Hutch\u2019s Web site.</p><p>\u201cI need you to tell me if you\u2019ve seen this woman in your shop.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the picture, her lip curling in disdain at Leah\u2019s flashy makeup and revealing outfit. \u201cCertainly not.\u201d</p><p>A cold anger sliced through him. The bitch. Whatever Leah\u2019s career choice, she\u2019d been a young woman who deserved a far better fate than she\u2019d been given.</p><p>\u201cHow many employees do you have?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI have two assistants, but I\u2019m Victoria, the owner of this boutique, and if the store is open, then I\u2019m here.\u201d Her lips thinned until they were nearly invisible. \u201cIf the woman was a customer I would recognize her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know every customer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>Duncan snorted, skimming his thumb over the screen of his phone to bring up Calso\u2019s image.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this man?\u201d</p><p>Her pencil thin brows arched in surprise. \u201cMr. Calso?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a customer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur paths have crossed at various charity functions,\u201d she said in haughty tones. Translated . . . this woman hung on the fringes of Kansas City society in the hopes of luring them into her shop. \u201cHe\u2019s a prominent businessman who has always been very generous in giving to those less fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet,\u201d he muttered. Nothing like tossing a few dollars at a charity to gain the goodwill of a city.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan.\u201d Callie\u2019s voice floated from the corner of the showroom. \u201cThis looks similar.\u201d</p><p>Turning his head, he watched as the diviner held up a pair of stretchy pants and tiny top that looked remarkably close to what Leah had been wearing.</p><p>\u201cSmart girl,\u201d he breathed in low tones before turning back to carefully monitor the older woman\u2019s expression. He didn\u2019t think she was involved, but he treated everyone as a suspect until they were proved innocent. He was a cop, not a judge. \u201cHow many of those have you sold?\u201d</p><p>Victoria gave an impatient wave of her hand, the diamonds that were crammed onto her knobby fingers nearly blinding as they caught the overhead light. \u201cI don\u2019t discuss my customers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can discuss your customers or I can get a warrant and start hauling them down to the station,\u201d he warned, his expression grim. \u201cYour call.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She paled, her spine so stiff it was a wonder it didn\u2019t snap beneath the strain. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to answer your question,\u201d Victoria at last managed to respond, her teeth clenched. \u201cEach Your Sung piece is individually designed. No two are alike.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, he pulled up yet another image on his phone. If she wanted to play rough, he would play rough. \u201cWhat about this one?\u201d he demanded, showing her the picture of Leah lying on the bank of the Missouri River.</p><p>For the first time the woman\u2019s icy composure cracked, her hand lifting to press against her lips.</p> <p>\u201cOh my god. Is she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d Duncan supplied.</p><p>\u201cI need a . . .\u201d She bit off her hasty words, looking with obvious longing toward the counter at the back of the store. No doubt she had a stash of prescription feel-good-pills hidden in her purse. \u201cWater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can pop your Prozac after you\u2019ve told me who bought this particular outfit, Victoria,\u201d he informed her, his flat tone revealing he didn\u2019t give a shit about her rattled nerves.</p><p>Her fingers fluttered to toy with the pearls hung around her neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>That was it. That was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cLady, I\u2019ve tried to be polite, but you\u2019ve pissed on my last nerve,\u201d he snarled. \u201cTell me what you know or I\u2019ll haul you out of here in handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She took a hasty step backward. \u201cI truly can\u2019t\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should just tell us what you know,\u201d Callie suggested in soothing tones, sending him a chiding glare as she moved to stand at his side.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d The woman licked her lips. \u201cShe started coming in six months ago. Maybe a little longer.\u201d</p><p>She.</p> <p>Duncan wasn\u2019t entirely shocked. It would have been too much to hope that the mysterious necromancer had waltzed into the shop and used his credit card to buy clothing for his macabre marionette.</p><p>And Callie had mentioned that she\u2019d discovered rumors of a witch who\u2019d been his accomplice.</p><p>Ignoring Callie\u2019s disapproval, he allowed her to take the role of the good cop. He always sucked at it anyway. Bad cop? That was easy.</p><p>\u201cHer name?\u201d he barked out.</p><p>\u201cShe never told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be on her credit card.\u201d</p><p>Victoria shook her head until the starched silver-hair threatened to move. \u201cShe always paid in cash.\u201d</p><p>Cash? Who carried around the sort of cash necessary for designer clothes?</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think that was strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of.\u201d The woman shrugged. \u201cThere are occasions when a woman needs to keep her liaison ... discreet.\u201d</p><p>Ah.</p><p>Callie looked confused. Duncan, however, instantly understood.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had friends who enjoyed the benefits of marriage while pursuing other women. The first rule of cheating was never, ever to leave a paper trail.</p><p>\u201cA mistress to a married man?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Victoria continued to tug at her pearls, discomfort etched into every line of her thin body. \u201cI don\u2019t ask uncomfortable questions.\u201d</p><p>Duncan believed her. A woman who peddled overpriced clothes to the lovers of the rich and powerful would learn to turn a blind eye to a lot of things.</p><p>\u201cDid she come in alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d The woman paused, and Duncan assumed she was frowning. Or would be if the Botox hadn\u2019t frozen her brow. \u201cOf course, she had a driver who waited for her outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake and model of the car?\u201d he pounced.</p><p>\u201cIt was silver, I think.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI really didn\u2019t pay attention.\u201d</p><p>Duncan glanced toward the ceiling. \u201cSurveillance tapes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t saved unless there\u2019s a reason to keep them.\u201d She doused Duncan\u2019s last hope. \u201cAs I said, this boutique promises discretion.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed his opinion about people who needed to hide their dirty laundry. He had a few secrets of his own.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the woman?\u201d he instead demanded. \u201cCan you describe her?\u201d</p><p>Another wave of her hand, another blinding flash of diamonds. \u201cShe was average height, a size four, with an autumn skin tone.\u201d</p><p>Duncan blinked. \u201cAutumn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPale skin. Green eyes.\u201d</p><p>Duncan made the notes on his phone. \u201cHer hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always wore it hidden beneath a hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she did.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cNot that it matters. Women change hair color more often than most men change their underwear.\u201d The older woman looked shocked while Callie rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cNo ...\u201d Victoria appeared to be struck by a sudden thought. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wore a strange bracelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDescribe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had a collection of small metal disks with strange symbols scratched on them.\u201d Victoria gave a curl of her lip. \u201cNot at all the sort of thing a true lady would wear.\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned his head to meet Callie\u2019s wide gaze. \u201cWitch,\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>\u201cAnya,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He squashed the urge to jump to conclusions. It, along with day old calamari, was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d He reached into his back pocket to pull out a small business card. \u201cThis has the numbers of the station as well as my cell phone. Call me if she returns.\u201d</p><p>From a distance the ziggurat was nothing more than a crumbling ruin that had been left to the ravages of the desert. Constructed of sunbaked bricks, it had once been a part of a temple complex for the Sumerians. Now, there was nothing left but a brittle shell of four receding tiers with two sharply angled stone staircases. Even the shrine that had once been a magnificent crown on top of the temple had been swept away by the relentless blast of sand.</p><p>It was a place of shattered dreams.</p><p>Not even a ghost remained to speak for those long departed.</p><p>Standing in the shifting landscape less than a mile from the temple, Zak sought to regain his balance. The witch\u2019s trip to the Middle East hadn\u2019t been nearly as pleasant as traveling with a Sentinel.</p><p>In truth, it had been more like being jerked inside out by a raging vortex than a smooth transition from one place to another.</p><p>Which was why he so rarely consented to enter a witch\u2019s spell. It was almost always more trouble than it was worth.</p><p>At last confident that he\u2019d regained his equilibrium, Zak smoothed his hands down his robe, covertly ensuring the coin, along with a small pistol, was still in his pocket.</p><p>In the other pocket was a tiny amulet that held a lethal spell.</p><p>If this was a trap, he wouldn\u2019t go down easily.</p><p>Glancing toward the witch at his side, he waved a hand toward the ruin. \u201cGet rid of the illusion, Anya.\u201d</p><p>Anya was on her knees, her pale face tight with exhaustion in the pool of moonlight. Unlike the Sentinels who used the established pathways that were held open by the monks, Anya was forced to use her own magic to travel. It left her on the brink of collapse.</p><p>\u201cI have to be closer,\u201d she panted.</p><p>Zak made a sound of impatience. He had no sympathy for his companion. Not when a thick layer of magic concealed the true temple, and anyone who might be hiding inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking a step closer until the illusion is gone,\u201d he warned, the chilled breeze tugging at his silver hair and stirring the sand beneath his feet.</p><p>Anya cursed, but lifting an unsteady hand, she spoke the words that would temporarily lower the illusion.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>There was a rippling shimmer, like a passing mirage, then the full splendor of the temple was revealed.</p><p>The tiers were no longer crumbling shells, but complete walls made of blue glazed bricks that once had been the pride of the surrounding city. The windows were covered with delicate bronze lattices and at the top was an oval shrine that had been reserved for the priests who\u2019d offered sacrifices to the gods.</p><p>\u201cRemain here,\u201d he commanded, his eyes searching the shadows as he began walking toward the nearest staircase.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave me?\u201d Anya protested.</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her demand for him to wait, Zak continued forward, the darkness that lived inside him pulsing with an intoxicating recognition.</p><p>He\u2019d been here once before. It had been shortly after Anya had appeared in Saint Petersburg and she\u2019d convinced him that she\u2019d seen his future etched on a wall in the middle of a desert.</p><p>Naturally he\u2019d demanded to see for himself.</p><p>A grim smile touched his lips as he climbed the stairs and entered the narrow door that led into the first chamber of the temple. He crossed directly to the wall bathed in moonlight, his fingers reaching to trace the hieroglyphs that spoke of a man with eyes of diamonds who whispered to the dead. There was even a carved figurine on a nearby pedestal that possessed an eerie resemblance to him.</p><p>He moved to the next wall, once again stroking his fingers over the hieroglyphics. These were centered on the same diamond-eyed man; this time he held a coin in his hand. The same coin that was now tucked in his pocket.</p><p>The odd symbols continued over the smooth stone, displaying the man placing the coin in a shallow notch that had been carved at the base of the wall. From there the meaning became less clear.</p><p>From his hours of studying the glyphs he\u2019d concluded that the coin opened a doorway. Maybe a physical doorway, maybe a metaphysical doorway.

They didn\u2019t have an address. No phone number. Not even a name.</p> <p>But she was convinced that the clothing that Leah had been wearing had been bought by Anya. Which meant that the witch was still with Lord Zakhar. And that they were in the Kansas City area.</p><p>It was a start.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s question jerked her out of her thoughts and she turned her head to study his chiseled profile.</p><p>Out of nowhere she was struck by a jolt of intense awareness.</p><p>God Almighty.</p><p>She struggled to breathe as she took in the stark beauty of his face. How many times over the past few years had she covertly snuck glances at the golden-haired cop with the grim expression? How many nights had her dreams been filled with ripping off his tight tee and faded jeans?</p><p>And now that she actually knew just how it felt to spend the night in his arms, his lips kissing paths of destruction down her throat as he slid deep into her body . . .</p> <p>It was enough to make even nice girls think about handcuffing a man to her bed and having her wicked way with him.</p><p>Obviously puzzled by her sudden silence, Duncan sent her a searching glance. \u201cCallie?\u201d</p><p>A blush stained her cheeks as she cleared her throat. \u201cActually, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Returning his attention to the growingly narrow streets, he weaved his way through the traffic with the ease of a native. \u201cI know a little joint that has BBQ to die for.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid down to the broad chest outlined in magnificent detail by the T-shirt. Was the temperature rising? Suddenly it felt way too hot in the car.</p><p>\u201cDo they deliver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He gave a lift of his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day. We can go to the park or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour apartment?\u201d</p><p>His knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel. \u201cThat\u2019s an option.\u201d</p><p>Callie lifted her brows at his carefully bland response. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought I was supposed to behave myself.\u201d</p><p>She gave a relieved laugh. For a second she\u2019d wondered if he\u2019d lost interest.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t behave yourself at your apartment?\u201d she teased.</p><p>The hazel eyes flashed in her direction, a searing desire turning the gold flecks into molten need. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry. \u201cYou\u2019re at least honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always, although my ma tried her best.\u201d His lopsided grin was strained. Callie felt her shirt stick to her damp skin. \u201cShe was convinced washing out my mouth with soap would cure me of my tendency to bend the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has my sympathy.\u201d Callie tried to match his casual tone even as they both shivered beneath the sensual tension pulsing in the air. \u201cMy guess is that you were a precocious brat growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I was usually the shy kid sitting in the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerra never talked you into breaking the rules?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. Serra had been a vivacious child and a natural leader who\u2019d taken huge pleasure in causing chaos. Of course, unlike Callie, she also had loving biological parents who often collected her from Valhalla when her teachers and foster family needed a break.</p><p>She never had to fear she might lose her only home.</p><p>\u201cMaybe once or twice,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>Without warning, Duncan pulled into an empty parking lot, turning to study her with a somber expression.</p><p>\u201cLook, sweetheart, we can go anywhere you want, and I promise to try and keep my hands to myself.\u201d His fingers brushed her cheek in a gentle caress. \u201cBut I want you in the worst way and I\u2019m not entirely sure it wouldn\u2019t be better to stay in public.\u201d</p><p>She stilled at the fierce edge in his voice and the tight knot of muscles that throbbed in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>His finger moved to stroke her lower lip. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you crave me?\u201d</p><p>Their gazes clashed at her deliberate choice of words. No doubt a more experienced woman would have kept the question to herself.</p><p>Most men didn\u2019t like to confess vulnerability. Not even with their lovers.</p><p>And she\u2019d all but demanded to know if he desired her more than he\u2019d desired his own wife.</p><p>Yeah, not too pushy. Yeesh.</p><p>But even as she was desperately trying to find a way to laugh off the question, he was surging forward to claim her lips in a kiss that was all raw male possession.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes,\u201d he admitted without hesitation.</p><p>Oh. Her heart melted.</p><p>Tangling her fingers in the short strands of his hair, she determinedly ignored the warmth that spread like honey through her body.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to ruin the moment with silly emotions.</p><p>\u201cI want to be alone with you,\u201d she murmured against his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, positively.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, studying her for a long minute. Then clearly satisfied she was as ready as he was, he flashed a smile filled with sinful anticipation.</p><p>\u201cHold on, baby.\u201d</p><p>Turning to face front, he shoved the car into gear, then with a flick of his finger he had the siren blaring.</p><p>Callie\u2019s lips parted, but before she could speak he was pulling out of the parking lot and hurtling across town with speed that made her grip the dashboard.</p><p>She had brief glimpses of redbrick factories that gave way to warehouses. Then small, family-owned stores that were situated between shabby houses and squat apartment buildings.</p><p>They squealed to a halt in a narrow parking lot. Duncan shut off the engine and the siren with a twist of the key, leaving them in a strangely thick silence.</p><p>Callie swallowed the sudden lump in her throat. \u201cAre you allowed to do that?\u201d</p><p>An astonishing hint of color lined his narrow cheekbones. Was he embarrassed? \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t mention this to Molinari.\u201d</p><p>She hid her burst of amusement. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.</p><p>Well, maybe not a kid, she conceded as a white-hot lick of excitement curled through the pit of her stomach.</p><p>More like a sexy beast who wasn\u2019t entirely tamed.</p><p>Clicking the lock to release her seat belt, Callie closed the small distance between them and pressed a kiss to the hollow just below his ear.</p><p>She\u2019d already learned it was a particularly sensitive spot. \u201cMy lips are sealed,\u201d she promised softly.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he groaned, fumbling with his own seat belt. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>Lingering just long enough to suck in the intoxicating scent of his warm, male skin, Callie scooted back across the seat and out the door.</p><p>She had time to glance at the faded brick structure that matched the connecting buildings to form a bland wall of depressing architecture before Duncan was scooping her off her feet and they were entering the nearest doorway.</p><p>He was forced to set her down so he could unlock his apartment, but he kept one arm wrapped around her, as if he thought she might bolt.</p><p>Poor sap. There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell he was getting rid of her.</p><p>Hustling her inside, he closed and locked the door. Then, still keeping a tight grip on her, he led her into the kitchen-slash-dining room, pausing to toss his keys on the square Formica table.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call for lunch now or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cLater is great,\u201d he admitted with a groan of relief, leaning down to kiss her with a frustrated hunger that had nothing to do with BBQ. \u201cMuch later would be fantastic.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward the table, obviously debating the pleasure of immediate satisfaction against the comfort of a bed and a soft mattress.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what tilted the balance, but one minute she was glancing at the pictures set on the china cabinet of various men and women who looked enough like Duncan to be family, and the next she was abruptly being tugged through a tidy living room with furniture that was worn but surprisingly homey, with more pictures on the wall.</p><p>A few steps later and she found herself in a bedroom that was decorated in shades of tan and chocolate. Her brows lifted as she studied the comforter that was neatly spread across the double bed and the lack of clothes on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He carefully removed his holstered gun as he nuzzled a trail of kisses down her neck, the feel of his whiskers against her sensitive skin making her shiver with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI warned you it\u2019s a shithole,\u201d he husked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant . . .\u201d She lost her train of thought as his hands skimmed beneath her top, his fingers moving like the brush of a butterfly wing over her ribs to rest just below the swell of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou meant?\u201d he prompted with a hint of amusement.</p><p>Not about to let him have complete control, she grabbed the hem of his tee and yanked it over his head, exposing a delectable expanse of bronzed skin stretched taut over chiseled muscles.</p><p>Oh . . . yum.</p><p>It was like a feast for her senses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cleaner than I expected,\u201d she explained, her hands lifting to explore the triangle of golden hair on his upper chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave a low growl, his hands cupping her breasts as his hot breath seared over her ear.</p><p>\u201cMy sisters love to do drop-by inspections,\u201d he said in a husky voice. \u201cIf the place isn\u2019t up to their code then I\u2019m stuck with them until they get it cleaned to their satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>His words sliced through her sensual haze. She was already terrified at the thought of meeting Duncan\u2019s family\u2014 the last thing she needed was to worry that the meeting might take place while she was naked in his bed.</p> <p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be stopping by today, will they?\u201d</p><p>His thumbs found the tight peaks of her breasts, sending darts of scorching excitement through her body.</p><p>\u201cNot unless they want to get shot,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She pulled back to stab him with a worried frown. \u201cDuncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know if I\u2019m home during the day I pulled an all-nighter and I\u2019m in bed.\u201d He leaned forward to kiss her with a slow, lingering thoroughness. \u201cWe won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201d</p> <p>Melting beneath the heat of his kiss, Callie forgot his sisters and the missing necromancer and all the reasons this was a terrible idea.</p><p>Stolen moments might very well be all she had with this man.</p><p>She intended to savor each and every one of them.</p><p>Perhaps sensing her urgency, Duncan pulled her shirt over her head and tossed it aside. Her bra followed.</p><p>She kicked off her shoes, enjoying the sheer male possession in his touch as he unsnapped her jeans and tugged them downward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good at this,\u201d she breathed.</p> <p>He dropped to his knees; his lips nuzzled across the clenched muscles of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThis chemistry has nothing to do with skill.\u201d His fingers trailed up the back of her thighs, sending a rash of goose bumps over her skin. \u201cAnd everything to do with fate.\u201d</p><p>Her pounding heart came to a perfect halt.</p><p>Fate.</p><p>Such a dangerous thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Duncan pulled down her panties, a slumberous sensuality darkening his eyes as he glanced up to meet her searching gaze.</p><p>\u201cThis is more than mere lust,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThis is an obsession that goes way beyond explanation. What else could it be but fate?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have a damn clue. It was another of those things to put on the worry-about-later list. For now her entire body was humming with an electric excitement.</p><p>\u201cWho am I to fight against fate?\u201d she sighed, her fingers threading through his hair in silent encouragement.</p><p>Something rippled over the starkly beautiful features before he leaned forward to place an openmouthed kiss on her inner thigh.</p><p>Callie shivered, her lashes fluttering downward as his hands skimmed up the naked curve of her butt and gripped her hips to hold her in place.</p><p>Not that she was going anywhere.</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>She gave a small gasp as he turned his head to find the liquid heat between her legs. His tongue parted her, teasing her pleasure point with a tender urgency that soon had her entire body pulsing with an aching need.</p><p>God Almighty. It was just as wondrous as she remembered. Just as mind blowing.</p><p>Duncan had called it obsession. And perhaps that\u2019s what it was. A hot, ruthless obsession that could easily consume her.</p><p>She sucked in a strangled breath, her knees feeling weak as he laved her most sensitive nub of flesh with a growing insistence. Oh, yes. Her fingers tightened in his hair, her breath rasping loudly in the silent room. That was the exact, perfect spot.</p><p>But Duncan was in the mood to tease.</p><p>Or maybe he just enjoyed torturing her.</p><p>Over and over, he brought her to the peak of fulfillment, only to pull away at the last second.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open as his mouth shifted to brand hot, restless kisses over the curve of her hip.</p><p>\u201cI intended to do this all afternoon,\u201d he rasped against her skin. \u201cBut, I need to be inside you. Deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>Hovering on the brink of her climax, she shifted her hands to grasp his shoulders and urge him upward.</p><p>\u201cThen do it,\u201d she commanded in a thick voice.</p><p>He chuckled as he straightened, lowering his head to stroke his tongue down the length of her neck. He nuzzled her pounding pulse before his head was dipping even lower and his lips covered the tip of her throbbing nipple.</p><p>Callie moaned at the dizzying sensations. Should she be worried that this man had the ability to make her melt with vulnerable longing?</p><p>Especially when they might soon be parted?</p><p>The brief moment of uncertainty was forgotten as he used his teeth to pleasure her nipple with a tender urgency that was tightening her muscles and making her legs weak. A low growl rumbled in his throat as his hands skated down her heated skin and grasped her hips. Then, without warning, he was turning her around and urging her toward the wall.</p><p>Caught off guard, she swiveled her head to regard him over her shoulder. \u201cDuncan?\u201d</p><p>The lean features were tight and bathed with a damp perspiration, as if he were struggling against a mighty force.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he husked as he wrenched off his jeans and underwear. Then, he pressed his body to her back and buried his face in the curve of her neck. \u201cI promise you\u2019ll like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>Her words came to a choked halt as his fingers slid down the gentle swell of her stomach and then through the dampness between her legs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent a hundred nights tossing and turning on that bed, imagining what I would do with you if I ever managed to lure you here.\u201d He gave a punishing nip on the curve of her shoulder while his finger slid inside her and began to stroke with a slow insistence. \u201cThis was number one.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back against his shoulder. A delicious pressure was beginning to build within her. Later she would tell him a few of her own fantasies.</p><p>But that would be later, she conceded as she felt his hard cock pressing between her legs. With gentle care he removed his finger and then with one slow thrust he was buried deep inside her.</p><p>Returning to Valhalla, Fane entered his apartment for a quick shower and a change of clothing. Not that anyone could tell the difference. His wardrobe consisted of cammos, khakis, T-shirts, and shit-kickers.</p><p>The hunter Sentinels liked to prance around in expensive clothes and drive cars that made a real man wonder if they were compensating for something. But guardians ... they knew what was important.</p><p>And it couldn\u2019t be bought in a store.</p><p>Making a brief stop by the morgue, he eventually made his way to the Mave\u2019s office to update her on the medics\u2019 examination of Leah\u2019s body. Then, stepping into the hall, he was debating whether to catch a quick lunch in the public dining room or to return to his apartment when a prickle of power raced over his skin.</p><p>Slowly turning, he already knew it was his Tagos approaching. Wolfe carried with him an electrical energy that was like a punch in the gut.</p><p>The tall man with a hawkish profile was dressed from head to toe in black. His dark hair was left free to flow down to his shoulders with the white streak next to his hard face shimmering in the sunlight that poured through the overhead skylight.</p><p>Wolfe halted a few feet away. They were both predators in their own way. Space was a necessity.</p><p>\u201cDid the medics find anything?\u201d the Tagos demanded.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe body was deteriorating at a normal rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe magic that animated her only offered the pretense of life.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe grimaced. \u201cTruly a walking corpse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d They exchanged a hard glance that spoke of their mutual resolve to put an end to the necromancer\u2019s gruesome magic. That\u2019s what Sentinels did. Solved problems. \u201cWhere are you off to next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in Florida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA monk who can hopefully give me information on ancient Sumerians.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe didn\u2019t probe. The connection between monks and guardians was a sacred trust that was never discussed outside the monastery.</p><p>\u201cI heard you returned without Callie.\u201d</p><p>Fane clenched his hands. It had gone against every protective instinct he possessed to leave her behind. But he wasn\u2019t a fool. Callie was a grown woman who was going to do what she wanted to do.</p><p>Trying to stop her would only have made her dig in her heels.</p><p>Women.</p><p>\u201cShe insisted on remaining with the cop,\u201d he admitted in sour tones.</p><p>\u201cInsisted?\u201d Wolfe arched a brow. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s infatuated with the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe studied him with a steady gaze that held curiosity without judgment. \u201cDoes that trouble you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I can\u2019t be sure her emotions aren\u2019t clouding her mind,\u201d he said. Callie would always hold a place in his heart. She was his to protect. But she wasn\u2019t the woman who stirred his passions to a raging fire. \u201cRight now I think she\u2019d risk any danger to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel your pain, comrade.\u201d The dark gaze briefly flicked toward the closed door of the Mave\u2019s office. An instinctive action that Fane doubted the Tagos was even aware of. \u201cFemales can be unreasonable under the best circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Fane shrugged. \u201cI have to trust O\u2019Conner will protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he capable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as capable as I am, but he has more skills than he realizes.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe was instantly intrigued. \u201cA potential Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>Fane smiled without humor. He\u2019d recognized Duncan O\u2019Conner\u2019s hidden talents the minute their paths had crossed. Not only his ability to read souls, but his superior strength. It was the only reason he\u2019d allowed Callie to remain in his care.</p><p>Otherwise he\u2019d have her locked in the dungeons so she couldn\u2019t sneak off the minute his back was turned.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t kill him first,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Wolfe smiled in understanding, then both men froze as the smell of expensive leather and dangerous woman wafted through the air. Seconds later Serra rounded the corner, her stunning beauty a perilous weapon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh\u201d Wolfe cleared his throat, careful to avert his gaze from Serra\u2019s lush body shown to perfection in the skintight leather pants and lacy bustier. \u201cShe looks like a woman on a mission. I think I\u2019ll leave the two of you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraitor,\u201d Fane muttered, composing his expression to hide the familiar sense of frustration and raw, aching desire.</p><p>This woman was his greatest temptation.</p> <p>And the promise of his doom.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Duncan eventually called for the BBQ. He even allowed Callie to get dressed so they could eat like a civilized couple in the dining room with real forks and plates.</p><p>See ... he wasn\u2019t a complete barbarian.</p><p>And astonishingly, he found amazing pleasure in sitting at the table arguing about music and movies and whether ice cream should be chocolate or vanilla while he fed her the finest brisket in the world.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t about heat and lust and fireworks.</p><p>Instead it was fun and peaceful and so damned . . . right . . . that a part of him knew he should be terrified.</p><p>Snatching the last square of corn bread, he was busy buttering it when the ring of his phone broke the easy atmosphere.</p><p>Automatically he reached to answer it, then his gaze was snared by the faceted sapphire blue of her eyes and he deliberately returned to buttering the corn bread.</p><p>The ringing stopped. For all of two seconds.</p><p>\u201cIgnore it,\u201d he muttered as it started again. And again.</p> <p>She reached to snatch the bread from his hand, a teasing grin tugging at her lips.</p><p>\u201cI can if you can.\u201d</p><p>His libido stirred as she took a bite, the butter shimmering on her lower lip. He should turn off the phone and haul her back to bed.</p><p>Or even sweep aside the dishes and indulge in his fantasy of eating dessert off that pale, satin skin.</p><p>The delectable image began to form in his mind.</p><p>Callie\u2019s naked body stretched across the table. Her crimson hair shimmering in the late afternoon sunlight. Her legs wrapped around his waist as he ...</p><p>His phone once again intruded.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d Huffing out a resigned sigh, he reached to pluck the phone off the table. He was a Grade A idiot. It was no wonder Susan dumped his ass. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Before he could answer, Callie reached to lightly touch his hand. \u201cDuncan.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, bracing for the familiar lecture. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever apologize for being good at your job.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That was the last thing he expected.</p><p>He studied her pale face, which revealed a calm acceptance that he was fairly certain he didn\u2019t deserve.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m apologizing for letting it consume me,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOr at least, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMy ex-wife, my mother, my sisters, the old lady next door\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up a hand. \u201cYeah, I get it. They\u2019re worried about you. But that doesn\u2019t make your love for your job wrong.\u201d</p><p>He reached to grasp her fingers, searching the depths of her stunning eyes for the truth.</p><p>Could she actually understand?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel as if I\u2019m putting you in second place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u201d She leaned across the table to brush a light kiss over his mouth. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a difference between being obsessed with your career and using it as a barrier to keep people at a distance.\u201d</p><p>She did understand.</p><p>All too well.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d he demanded, grudgingly recalling the dates he\u2019d broken because it was easier to stay at the station than spend a few empty hours trying to act interested. Or the Sunday family dinners he\u2019d skipped because he didn\u2019t want to be the target of his meddling sisters\u2019 attempts to set him up with their endless parade of friends.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve used my fear of being rejected to do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>He smiled with rueful amusement. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that we\u2019re a match made in heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we\u2019re both so screwed up no one else could stand us.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, pressing her fingers to his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll go with that.\u201d</p><p>On cue, the phone started its insistent ringing. Callie smiled, giving his arm a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cAnswer,\u201d she commanded softly. \u201cIt might be important.\u201d</p><p>He pressed the phone to his ear, knowing she was right. This wasn\u2019t about burrowing himself in work so he could ignore the barrenness of his life. There was a crazed necromancer out there who had to be stopped.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Conner,\u201d he growled, his brows lowering as he listened to the crisp voice of his chief. \u201cWhere? I\u2019ll be there in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>He ended the connection and met Callie\u2019s curious gaze.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe chief.\u201d He absently gathered the dirty plates and took them into the kitchen. \u201cShe said that a man appeared at the station claiming that he was the rightful owner of Calso\u2019s coin.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized Callie had followed him into the kitchen until she spoke directly behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you supposed to meet him?\u201d</p><p>He turned, frowning down at her expectant expression. \u201cCallie, it\u2019s too dangerous\u2014\u201d</p><p>She reached up to pinch his lips together, effectively halting his protest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there,\u201d she warned. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together.\u201d</p><p>He nipped the tips of her fingers before pulling them from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cStubborn.\u201d</p><p>The aggravating female smiled, knowing she\u2019d won. \u201cDetermined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d he muttered. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He led her out of the apartment and to his car, silently promising himself he\u2019d go hunting for a new apartment on his first day off. He had high hopes that he could convince Callie to spend more than one afternoon with him. She deserved better than this run-down complex that\u2019s only saving grace was that it happened to be close to the station.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d even look at a house, he decided, as he pulled out of the parking lot.</p><p>With a yard and dog and swing set . . .</p><p>He was just getting to the white picket fence when Callie thankfully yanked him from his ridiculous train of thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, feeling heat crawl up the back of his neck. Christ.</p><p>\u201cThe police station.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy did you say it might be dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny place can be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou were just trying to keep me from going with you.\u201d</p><p>It was true, but not for the reason she suspected.</p><p>The mere thought of the reception she was likely to receive at the police station was enough to make him grind his teeth.</p><p>Time for a distraction.</p><p>\u201cHey, the only time I got shot I was in a church.\u201d</p><p>His tone was teasing, but her sapphire eyes widened with a genuine horror. \u201cYou were shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA grazing wound from a teenager who was trying to steal the silver candlesticks from the altar.\u201d He hastily minimized the incident. His ma and sisters were still convinced he spent his days dodging bullets. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t startled him he would never have shot.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cOr he might have taken better aim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d she muttered, reaching into her purse to pull out her familiar reflective sunglasses. \u201cBut I suppose it\u2019s who you are.\u201d</p><p>Halting at a stoplight, he watched her slide on the glasses. The sight sent a tangle of emotion through him.</p><p>Fury that she had to hide who she was, combined with a sharp, aching need to return her to his apartment where he could protect her from the world.</p><p>\u201cI could call Molinari back and tell her to reschedule the interview for tomorrow,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>She tilted her head to the side, her glasses making it impossible to read her emotions.</p><p>\u201cTempting, but Fane will be returning in the morning,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to enjoy our rare time alone.\u201d</p><p>She paused, as if sifting through the various reasons for his sudden urgency to return to his apartment. Then, a slow, achingly sad smile curved her lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have tonight,\u201d she promised softly.</p><p>He gripped the wheel, ignoring the jackass behind him that was blaring his horn as the light turned green.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize I just volunteered to forget work?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a first for me.\u201d</p><p>With an obvious effort she managed a teasing expression, leaning across the seat to stroke her lips along the line of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath, allowing the warm, apple scent of her to ease his strange sense of foreboding.</p><p>\u201cHow proud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d she whispered in his ear before settling back in her seat. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>With a growl, he stomped his foot on the gas pedal.</p><p>Later couldn\u2019t get there fast enough.</p><p>Zak knew that his body was lying on the floor of the temple. In a distant part of his brain he could feel the hard pebbles that poked into his chest and the fine grains of dirt that drifted from the ceiling to land on his face.</p><p>He could even feel the blood that trickled from his wound to pool at the base of his skull.</p><p>His consciousness, however, was traveling through the darkness, heading deep beneath the ziggurat, as if lured by a siren\u2019s call.</p><p>At last he came to a halt, the shadows shifting to reveal that he hovered in front of an ornate sarcophagus.</p><p>He studied the elaborate symbols etched onto the gilded wood, knowing without a doubt that they had been created just for him.</p><p>He could sense it in his very soul.</p><p>Just as he could sense a presence that filled the barren tomb.</p><p>With no corporal body, he could only use his thoughts to try and communicate.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe are the beginning.\u201d</p><p>The words vibrated in the air, the sound of a thousand voices seeming to pierce straight through him.</p><p>Beginning?</p> <p>That told him nothing.</p><p>Was it supposed to be some sort of riddle, like those of the Sphinx?</p><p>He tried a new approach. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the mouth of the underworld.\u201d</p><p>Ah. That would explain why he\u2019d been drawn to this place. The dead had always spoken to him.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t explain why he was lying unconscious in the main temple with a gaping wound that was even now bleeding out.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you brought me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a story to be told.\u201d</p><p>The glyphs on the sarcophagus began to shimmer. \u201cYour story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur story.\u201d The scent of death swirled through the air. \u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>Even without his body, Zak felt a stab of wary fury as the glyphs began to pulse, as if they were coming alive.</p> <p>\u201cMagic,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cDo not interrupt.\u201d</p><p>There was an impression of pain. Zak couldn\u2019t be sure if he actually felt it or not, but he wasn\u2019t willing to risk that there was serious damage being done to his physical body.</p><p>Smothering his gut-deep hatred of being given commands, he focused on the glyphs that continued to pulse, the shimmering beneath them throwing strange shapes on the smooth walls of the tomb.</p><p>Zak watched the flickering shapes for a confused minute, at last realizing they were beginning to solidify to form a three-dimensional image of an ancient village.</p><p>He continued to watch the unfolding pictures, realizing that the village was built around this temple. There was no mistaking the vivid indigo glaze on the brick facade or the particular pattern to the window lattices.</p><p>\u201cWho are those people?\u201d he asked, frowning as he watched a group of robed figures descend the long staircase from the ziggurat to mingle among a gathered crowd.</p><p>\u201cYour ancestors,\u201d the multitude of voices answered.</p> <p>\u201cNecromancers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh-bloods.\u201d</p><p>He considered the unfolding drama in silence, intrigued by the strange images even as his clinical brain warned this all could be nothing more than a result of his head trauma.</p><p>Or more likely, a trick.</p><p>For now he was willing to play the game.</p><p>\u201cIs this where high-bloods came from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the voices confirmed. \u201cWe were blessed by the gods. Their powers gave us the right to rule this world.\u201d</p><p>The images shifted. Suddenly the crowd wasn\u2019t bowing in awe of the robed figures, but they were surrounding the temple, weapons held in their hands as they battled their way past the high-bloods trying to block the stairways.</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The air filled with an anger that would have crushed him if he\u2019d been in his physical form.</p><p>\u201cThe people grew jealous of our blessings.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. He didn\u2019t doubt that humans could be fickle and jealous and ready to destroy what they didn\u2019t understand. Even in these supposedly enlightened ages they remained petty little cowards.</p><p>But he was a master of manipulating the emotions of others. He easily recognized when he was being finessed.</p><p>Lies wrapped in truths.</p><p>\u201cThey attacked?\u201d</p><p>Flames engulfed the images, the distant sound of screams filling the tomb.</p><p>\u201cThe oracles were the first destroyed, burned in their own temple. Next were the witches.\u201d The flames lowered to reveal the inner temple where the robed figures were being led into underground tunnels by armed warriors. \u201cThe Sentinels realized we were on the brink of extinction so they collected as many of our people as they could save and scattered them around the world.\u201d The images began to shift, flickering from one isolated abbey to another. \u201cWe remained in hiding for centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey created the monasteries,\u201d Zak murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, as well as the pathways so our people could remain connected.\u201d</p><p>Ah. That made sense. No one spoke of the origins of the high-bloods, or the mysterious connection between the monks.</p><p>Not that he thought for a minute that he was getting the full story.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>The images abruptly returned to the earlier battle, this time revealing a robed figure standing at the top of the temple with a chalice held above his head, blood dripping down his arms from the deep wounds in his wrists.</p><p>The same image that was etched in the hieroglyphs in the upper temple, he recognized with a tiny jolt of shock.</p><p>Only he was the one holding the chalice.</p><p>\u201cSokar was our leader,\u201d the voices hissed.</p><p>Zak didn\u2019t need to ask if Sokar was the body in the sarcophagus.</p><p>He knew it beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p><p>\u201cA necromancer?\u201d he instead demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The image pulled back to reveal several robed figures standing behind him, their arms raised with the same wounds on their wrists.</p><p>\u201cHe, along with his trusted disciples, remained behind to ensure the rest could escape,\u201d the voices explained. \u201cHis sacrifice saved hundreds of high-bloods, but has left us trapped between the world of the living and the world of the dead.\u201d</p><p>The images abruptly ended, the room once again filled with shadows.</p><p>Zak contained his flare of frustration. He had a thousand questions. There was so much of the high-blood history that was hidden, or even lost in the mists of time.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t a fool. He\u2019d been allowed to see precisely what the strange voices wanted him to see and no more.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fully trust anything he might be shown in this place.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>The answer came without hesitation. \u201cThe imprisonment of Sokar has stolen the connection to the dead that was once the birthright of the necromancers. We have long waited for one to be born who could return what was lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe I am the one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall soon discover.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t precisely the assurance that Zak was hoping to hear, but he bit back his demands for a more definitive promise of ultimate glory.</p><p>\u201cYou will give me the power to raise the dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen the gates,\u201d the voices whispered. \u201cAnd the power will be yours.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Without Fane\u2019s intimidating presence to scatter the gawkers, Callie was prepared for the avid stares as Duncan led her through the police station.</p><p>Some curious. Some hostile. Most wary. As if convinced she was some dangerous demon who worshipped the devil beneath the full moon and raised zombies on the weekends.</p><p>Moving past the large room filled with desks, filing cabinets, the usual office equipment, as well as suspicious cops, Callie kept her chin held high.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to apologize for who she was.</p><p>Muttering his opinion of cops who had bigger guns than brains, Duncan put a possessive hand on the lower curve of her back as he urged her toward the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cIgnore the idiots,\u201d he said, loud enough for his words to be overheard.</p><p>Watching as one of the younger cops deliberately wrapped his fingers around the grip of his service revolver, she smiled wryly and murmured, \u201cEasier said than done.\u201d</p><p>Duncan glared at the cop until the younger man flushed and turned away.</p><p>\u201cI could shoot them if you want,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cThat seems a little extreme.\u201d</p><p>His glare swept around the silent room. \u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>A door was suddenly thrown open and a small, dark-haired woman appeared.</p><p>\u201cIf you all have time to stand around scratching your balls then there\u2019s a stack of cold case files in the basement I can start handing out,\u201d she announced, her hands planted on her hips as she watched the cops scurry to look busy. \u201cNo? Good.\u201d She turned her attention to Duncan and Callie. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Callie hid a smile as they were led out of the room and down a short hallway. This had to be the infamous Chief Molinari. Somehow she\u2019d thought the woman would be six feet tall with horns and a tail.</p><p>Not that her diminutive size made her any less intimidating.</p><p>In fact, she reminded Callie of the Mave. Stern, frighteningly competent, and ruthless when necessary.</p><p>Keeping his hand on her lower back, Duncan urged her closer to his side as they followed the chief down the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou said the man asked for me?\u201d Duncan demanded.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d the chief confirmed. \u201cHe wandered in off the street. He says his name is Hektor. No last name.\u201d</p><p>Odd.</p><p>\u201cAnd he claims to be the owner of the coin?\u201d</p><p>Molinari\u2019s heels clicked on the industrial tiled floor. \u201cHe said it belonged to his\u2014\u201d</p><p>Duncan and Callie exchanged a puzzled glance as her words trailed away.</p><p>\u201cHis what?\u201d Duncan at last prompted.</p><p>\u201cBrotherhood,\u201d the chief muttered.</p><p>\u201cBrotherhood?\u201d Duncan frowned. \u201cIs he a gangbanger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to see to believe.\u201d</p><p>The chief halted in front of a two-way mirror, nodding toward the interrogation room on the other side.</p><p>The room was deliberately barren, with white walls and a linoleum floor that were bathed in a harsh fluorescent light. In the center of the space was a long table with a half dozen wooden chairs.</p><p>But it was the lone man seated at the table who captured Callie\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cChrist, what now?\u201d Duncan muttered.</p><p>Callie was wondering the same thing as she took in the stranger. He was a thin man in his late forties with short black hair smoothed from a narrow, ratlike face. His skin was tinted a honey brown, as if burnished from long days in the Middle Eastern deserts. An image only emphasized by the long white tunic he wore over a pair of loose pants.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she studied the small wooden box that he\u2019d laid on the table in front of him. On the worn top was carved a strange symbol that resembled the bird that had been etched onto the vessel. The vessel that had held the coin stolen from Calso\u2019s safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Callie felt a sudden surge of hope.</p><p>This man clearly had some knowledge of the coin. Was it possible he could help them find the necromancer responsible for stealing it?</p><p>Duncan sent her an expressive glance that revealed he\u2019d noticed the symbol as well, then, with a nod toward the chief, he led Callie into the interrogation room.</p><p>\u201cHektor,\u201d he murmured, heading toward the long table. \u201cI\u2019m Sergeant O\u2019Conner and this\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHigh-blood,\u201d the man hissed, surging to his feet as he stared at Callie with open contempt.</p><p>Callie came to an abrupt halt, astonished by the man\u2019s reaction.</p><p>Not by his obvious hatred for high-bloods. That was all too common.</p><p>But his ability to instantly realize that she was more than human.</p><p>Most of the local cops had seen her at crime scenes. They would easily recognize her, even if they hadn\u2019t already known she was coming to the station with Duncan.</p> <p>But without Fane at her side, and her eyes hidden by her reflective glasses, it should be impossible for a stranger to know she was a high-blood.</p><p>Duncan, on the other hand, didn\u2019t seem remotely interested in how the man had known. He was stiff with a fury that made the air prickle with a sudden heat.</p><p>\u201cThis is Ms. Brown,\u201d he ground out between clenched teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s a partner in this police investigation\u201d</p><p>Hektor\u2019s dark eyes flashed with a matching fury. \u201cI won\u2019t speak in front of my enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Callie hastily interrupted, scenting violence in the air.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he growled. \u201cThe bastard can learn some manners or I can kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither she leaves, or I do,\u201d Hektor muttered, unwilling to back down an inch.</p><p>A true fanatic, Callie acknowledged with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait outside.\u201d</p><p>Duncan jutted his chin to a stubborn angle. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>She reached to lightly brush her hand down the rigid muscles of his forearm. She wouldn\u2019t allow Duncan to risk his job because of her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no use in wasting time,\u201d she said, turning toward the stranger with a cold smile. \u201cBesides, the stench of prejudice is making me queasy.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence as Duncan struggled to contain his urge to shove his fist into the man\u2019s face. At last, his cop training allowed him to resist his thirst for blood, although his expression warned he was just waiting for an excuse to snap.</p> <p>With a muttered curse, he walked with her back into the hall, his hands clenched at his side.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a private conference room next to the chief\u2019s office,\u201d he said, his voice rough. Callie understood. He\u2019d already been infuriated by his fellow cops\u2019 reactions to her. Now he had to allow a complete stranger to insult her. For a man who was devoted to protecting others, it had to be making him nuts. \u201cWait for me there.\u201d</p><p>She discreetly brushed her fingers against his tight fist, her smile teasing. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted, but before he could remind her that her welcome wouldn\u2019t be any warmer among his friends, she was turning to make her way down the hall.</p><p>The sooner Duncan could question the stranger, the sooner they could get out of here. And she really, really wanted out.</p><p>Stepping back into the main room, Callie kept her gaze trained on the open door on the back wall, her pace steady. She hoped to slip past unnoticed. Hey, cops might be trained to be observant, but shouldn\u2019t they be busy doing police things?</p><p>Eating donuts, playing poker, harassing high-bloods ...</p><p>As if to punish her for her snarky thoughts, she\u2019d just entered the empty conference room when someone stepped in behind her, firmly closing the door.</p><p>Spinning around, she came face to face with the gray-haired coroner she\u2019d seen at more than one crime scene.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with you, necro.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sank even as her chin tilted. She\u2019d known this was coming. Duncan\u2019s friends weren\u2019t going to be any more pleased with their relationship, no matter how brief it might be, than Fane and her friends.</p><p>Still, she\u2019d hoped it could be avoided until after they\u2019d captured the mysterious Lord Zakhar.</p><p>As unlikely as it might seem, there was the possibility that they would need the humans.</p><p>Resisting the urge to tell him to go to hell, she instead calmly met his dark scowl. She would try not to be a total bitch, but then again, she wasn\u2019t going to be a damned wimp.</p><p>\u201cI have a name,\u201d she pointed out in deliberately cool tones.</p><p>\u201cBrown, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d He shrugged, clearly not interested in becoming BFFs. \u201cI\u2019m Frank. I\u2019m a friend of O\u2019Conner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to have a little talk.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her expression bland. \u201cSo talk.\u201d</p><p>The cop frowned, almost as if caught off guard by her calm reaction. Maybe he assumed all freaks were raised by wolves and incapable of common manners?</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She had no sympathy for his sudden unease. \u201cSay what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated before he squared his shoulders. \u201cDid you know O\u2019Conner\u2019s ex-wife just got remarried?\u201d</p><p>Ah. So that was the direction this was going to take.</p><p>\u201cHe told me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe was gutted when his marriage ended,\u201d Frank informed her, the sincerity in his tone revealing he truly believed what he was saying. \u201cIt was even worse when he found out she was going to become another man\u2019s wife. Susan was his soul mate.\u201d</p><p>Callie might have been devastated by the stark claim if she didn\u2019t know the truth. Now she merely shrugged. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>His mouth thinned at her refusal to react as he expected. \u201cA man does crazy things when he\u2019s been hurt,\u201d he pressed. \u201cThings he later regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy crazy, I assume you mean spending time with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but if he was in his right mind, he would never be with a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreak?\u201d she helpfully supplied.</p><p>Heat crawled beneath his skin, his gaze shifting to the rows of chairs that faced the podium at the far end of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fanatic. I don\u2019t hate high-bloods,\u201d he said in gruff tones. \u201cI just know that you sort of people aren\u2019t meant to mix with humans.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of disgust. How many people over the centuries had been made to feel isolated by those precise words?</p><p>\u201cSeparate but equal?\u201d she said in a cold voice.</p><p>He hunched his shoulder. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted. Okay. Maybe not so equal.</p><p>Jerk.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your concern for your friend, but Duncan is a big boy,\u201d she said, hiding her disgust behind a mask of indifference. This man was Duncan\u2019s friend and colleague. If their relationship continued then she would have to at least pretend she didn\u2019t find him a total tool. \u201cDon\u2019t you think he should be allowed to make his own decisions?\u201d</p><p>Frank\u2019s expression hardened. Like most cops, he was used to people falling in line when he gave an order.</p><p>\u201cAround here we take care of each other; it\u2019s the only way to survive,\u201d he growled. \u201cIf you truly care for O\u2019Conner, you\u2019ll walk away and let him find a woman who fits into his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis life or yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d he warned before turning to leave the conference room, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>Callie rolled her eyes, wryly wondering why she hadn\u2019t returned to Valhalla where she so obviously belonged.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the real world, Callie Brown,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Duncan returned to the interrogation room in a mood that was on the wrong side of shitty.</p><p>Studying the smug little bastard, he wanted nothing more than to shove his foot up his ass. Or maybe he would shove a few of his too-white teeth down his throat . . .</p><p>Unable to do either, he folded his arms over his chest and met the dark gaze that was studying him with blatant suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you staring at?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>The dark eyes narrowed, his nose flaring as if he was sniffing the air. Or could he be sensing that Duncan wasn\u2019t entirely human?</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have until the count of five to tell me what you know about the coin before I throw your ass in jail for obstruction of justice,\u201d he abruptly interrupted.</p><p>As much as he wanted to beat the fool to a bloody pulp and leave him for the trash, he needed whatever information he might have about the coin. And he wasn\u2019t going to get anything out of the man if he feared Duncan was a high-blood.</p><p>Hektor bristled, but thankfully accepted that Duncan was human.</p><p>\u201cI came here for your assistance, not to be threatened,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit. Tell me about the coin\u201d</p><p>The man licked his thin lips. \u201cIt has a long history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSumerian?\u201d</p><p>Hektor hesitated, clearly not willing to give away more than he had to.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The coin was created by the Brotherhood in the earliest days of civilization.\u201d</p><p>Necromancers. Mysterious coins. Secret brotherhoods. It sounded like a cheesy plot from Indiana Jones.</p><p>Unfortunately, Duncan couldn\u2019t laugh off the possibility that the man was speaking the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the coin do?\u201d</p><p>Hektor grimaced. \u201cIt shields the chalice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChalice?\u201d Duncan rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat chalice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that opens a pathway to the underworld.\u201d</p><p>Duncan scowled. He hated mystic mumbo jumbo. \u201cDoes underworld mean hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this chalice . . . What?\u201d He gave a wave of his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a key to hell?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hektor nodded. \u201cIt allows the dead to walk.\u201d</p><p>The simple words made Duncan shudder with horror. Christ. Even having seen Leah walking around . . . Wait. He took a step forward, leaning down to place his palms flat on the table in front of Hektor.</p><p>\u201cWhat game are you playing? The necromancer was raising the dead before he got his hands on the coin.\u201d</p> <p>The stranger shook his head. \u201cThey were bokors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re merely animated corpses that are able to be controlled for a short period of time by a necromancer.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grimaced.

It was created to close the mouth of the underworld. It\u2019s the chalice that poses the true danger.\u201d</p><p>Duncan made a sound of impatience. \u201cWill they be alive or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking. The chalice allows the necromancer to fill the corpses with an evil that will give them the ability to walk among us as if they live.\u201d He leaned forward, clenching his hands on the table as his eyes filled with a hectic light. \u201cThey could infiltrate our society for days or weeks without us knowing. Or more likely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe necromancer will raise an army to destroy us all.\u201d</p><p>Duncan muttered a savage curse. Holy hell. This just got better and better.</p> <p>\u201cHow do we find this . . . chalice before the necromancer can get his hands on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can enter the inner temple without the coin,\u201d he grudgingly confessed.</p><p>Duncan abruptly straightened. Of course the bastard would be filled with dire predictions with no genuine plan to avoid the looming disaster.</p><p>Pacing across the narrow room, he struggled to think clearly.</p><p>He was a cop.</p><p>And this was a case.</p><p>Okay, it was filled with creepy necromancers and a weirdo brotherhood, but preventing a potential crime was what he did.</p><p>And for that, he needed to be able to locate the coin or the necromancer before he could unleash hell.</p> <p>Literally.</p><p>\u201cWas Calso a part of your Brotherhood?\u201d he abruptly demanded.</p><p>\u201cCertainly not.\u201d</p><p>He turned to study Hektor\u2019s outraged expression. \u201cThen why did he have the coin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor centuries we kept the coin protected, then we began to realize it was being hunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged. \u201cThe name is easily changed, but there was no doubt it was a necromancer. One who was dangerously powerful.\u201d</p><p>It would be easy to leap to the conclusion that it was Lord Zakhar. But he preferred to have real proof before he dismissed any other possibility.</p><p>\u201cHow could you be so certain it was a necromancer and not some crazy person who thought the coin was worth money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur brothers and sisters\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou allow females into your Brotherhood?\u201d Duncan asked in surprise. Usually fanatics liked to keep their bizarre cults exclusive.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re worthy,\u201d Hektor explained in a lofty voice. \u201cMany are called, but few are chosen.\u201d</p><p>Duncan rolled his eyes. Yeesh. He\u2019d walked right into that one.</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d he muttered. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>Hektor stiffened, as if insulted by Duncan\u2019s lack of respect at his grand achievement in being chosen for the Brotherhood.</p><p>Arrogant ass.</p><p>\u201cOur brothers and sisters were being slaughtered and then returned from the grave,\u201d he at last explained.</p><p>\u201cThey had the coin?\u201d</p><p>Hektor shook his head. \u201cNo, but they each knew the location of the coin. They were killed and their corpses used to try and slip past our defenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like Leah,\u201d Duncan growled, shuddering at the memory of the young female being jerked around Kansas City as if she was a gruesome marionette.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Duncan ignored the question. He wasn\u2019t about to discuss poor Leah or how she\u2019d been abused.</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage to recognize that they were . . . what\u2019s the word . . . bokors?\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged, trying too hard to look casual. \u201cWe are trained to spot the walking dead.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know what I\u2019m trained to do?\u201d Duncan leaned forward, his eyes narrowed. \u201cSmell bullshit a mile away.\u201d</p><p>Hektor muttered something beneath his breath, but he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to insult an armed cop to his face.</p><p>\u201cAll right. We received word from an anonymous source that the coin holder had been identified so we were able to move the coin before it could be stolen.\u201d</p><p>Duncan snorted. He\u2019d worked with anonymous sources for years. Ninety-nine percent of the info he got from them was worth jack-squat, the other one percent was usually little better than a random guess that accidentally turned out to be right.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t depend on an anonymous source to tell him the time of day, let alone to entrust the protection of the very reason for his existence.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know you could trust this source?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d always been right before. Unfortunately\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hektor bit off his words, a flush of embarrassment crawling beneath his skin.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately?\u201d Duncan prompted.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were warned that Calso\u2019s name had been discovered it was decided it was too risky to move the coin until we\u2019d found some place that couldn\u2019t be traced.\u201d The man\u2019s lips thinned with anger. \u201cWe put out word that the coin had been transferred to a new host, hoping the necromancer would be fooled long enough for us to find a more permanent solution.\u201d</p><p>A risky decision.</p><p>One that might destroy them all.</p><p>\u201cHow did Calso get the coin in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was decided that the necromancer hunting the coin had found a way to recognize members of the Brotherhood.\u201d Hektor absently lifted his hand to trace a small tattoo that looked like a stylized arrow on the side of his neck. \u201cIt was imperative we find someone who had no formal connection to our group to hide the coin\u201d</p><p>It made sense, but Duncan couldn\u2019t imagine how a group of self-righteous nut-bars had chosen a financial whiz who had a weakness for pretty strippers to harbor their most precious treasure.</p><p>\u201cWhy him?\u201d</p><p>Hektor thinned his lips, as if he hadn\u2019t been entirely pleased with the choice.</p><p>\u201cCalso was a trusted friend of our leader and since he was already a collector of art, it wouldn\u2019t be suspicious for him to invest in high-tech security measures.\u201d</p><p>Duncan resumed his pacing, making mental notes to check the various ways someone could have discovered Calso had the coin.</p><p>It could be done.</p><p>He didn\u2019t doubt that for a minute.</p><p>But tracking down leads took time.</p><p>Sometimes days, sometimes weeks.</p><p>Time he didn\u2019t have.</p><p>There had to be a faster way to find Lord Zakhar, or whoever the hell was using a dead woman as their personal puppet.</p><p>\u201cCan you\u2014\u201d He gave a vague wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cCan I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSense the coin?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The man scowled. \u201cI\u2019m a human, not a high-blood. I have no unholy magics running through my veins.\u201d</p><p>Duncan narrowed his eyes. \u201cAnd yet you seemed to know that Callie was a high-blood from the minute she entered the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ability to sniff out the enemy is a gift from my god,\u201d Hektor said with a sneer.</p><p>Duncan curled his lips. Hypocrite. Any powers he and his so-called Brotherhood had came from the same place as high-bloods, not from some mysterious god.</p><p>Now, however, wasn\u2019t the time for a philosophical debate.</p><p>Actually, as far as he was concerned, there was never a good time for a philosophical debate.</p><p>Instead he concentrated on the only thing that mattered.</p><p>\u201cFine. Can you use that god-given gift to track down the necromancer?\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes flashed at the edge of mockery that Duncan didn\u2019t try to hide.</p><p>\u201cIf we had that power then we would have eliminated him years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Duncan asked dryly. He would bet good money the Brotherhood was very good at hiding in the shadows and very bad at actually getting off their asses and taking care of business. \u201cDo you often eliminate people?\u201d</p><p>The man hastily glanced toward the camera in the ceiling. \u201cCertainly not.\u201d</p><p>Duncan was abruptly done.</p><p>He\u2019d hoped the man could offer a way to capture the necromancer.</p><p>Instead he\u2019d gotten fairy tales and vague threats.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know where the coin is or how we can find the necro who stole it,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhy the hell are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo warn you of the danger if the coin isn\u2019t immediately returned to our protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorthless,\u201d he muttered, heading toward the door. \u201cFeel free to show yourself out.\u201d</p><p>Anxious to track down Callie and make sure she wasn\u2019t being hassled by his supposed friends, he hissed in frustration when Hektor was demanding his attention.</p><p>\u201cSergeant?\u201d</p><p>He glared over his shoulder. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The man rose to his feet, his expression hard with warning.</p><p>\u201cHigh-bloods once tried to make themselves into gods,\u201d he said in fierce tones. \u201cDon\u2019t for a minute doubt that they won\u2019t try again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Zak opened his eyes, briefly confused by the realization he was lying face first on a stone floor with blood dripping down his neck.</p><p>Since being burned at the stake by his rabid serfs, he\u2019d learned to take excessive precautions not to put himself in a position where he might wake up in strange places with oozing wounds.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just paranoia.</p><p>Not when he knew he was surrounded by enemies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Both those who openly worked against him, and those who hid in the shadows ...</p><p>Ignoring the pain that pounded through his skull, Zak turned his head, a grim satisfaction replacing his momentary confusion.</p><p>Even in the shadows he could make out the unmistakable glint of gold.</p> <p>The chalice.</p><p>Grasping his trophy, Zak awkwardly forced himself to his feet.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been a dream. Or a trap.</p><p>He\u2019d spoken to the ghosts of his ancestors. And he\u2019d been found worthy.</p><p>More than worthy, he silently gloated, forcing his heavy feet to carry him out of the temple.</p> <p>Unlike the previous necromancer, he had no intention of jeopardizing his life to acquire the power necessary to raise an army. The martyr routine had never appealed to him. Not when he\u2019d been clever enough to prepare a proper sacrifice.</p><p>What was the point of power if you couldn\u2019t use it to rule the world?</p><p>Making his way down the long staircase, he paused at the bottom, gathering his strength before he walked the short distance to the waiting witch.</p><p>His head might be throbbing and his knees threatening to collapse, but he would never show weakness.</p><p>He was too close to his ultimate success to risk a knife in the back.</p><p>Halting in front of Anya, who was still on her knees, her head bent in weariness, he reached down to grasp her arm. Yanking her to her feet, he slipped the chalice into the deep pocket of his robe.</p> <p>\u201cIs the pathway still open?\u201d he growled.</p><p>Anya blinked, her eyes unfocused as if she\u2019d been asleep. \u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she demanded, glancing around the barren desert. \u201cDid the coin work?\u201d</p><p>He offered a tight-lipped smile. \u201cI have what I need.\u201d</p><p>She studied him in the fading moonlight, her brows drawn together. \u201cAre you bleeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very astute of you, Anya,\u201d he drawled, refusing to speak of what had happened in the temple. \u201cDo you intend to continue this inquest? Or perhaps we can finish it when we aren\u2019t standing knee deep in sand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her chin tilted as she held out her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>His hesitation lasted less than a heartbeat before he grasped her fingers and braced himself for the journey. He was weary, but not helpless.</p><p>And besides, being on constant guard meant that he was prepared for any trap.</p><p>Keeping the chalice hidden in his pocket, Zak clenched his teeth as the world dissolved and he was shrouded in a choking blackness.</p><p>He hated making himself vulnerable to Anya\u2019s magic, even when it was necessary.</p><p>There was a sickening lurch as they traveled through the strange fold in space, then the world abruptly reappeared and they were standing in his private study.</p><p>With a groan, Anya dropped to her knees, her brilliant curtain of hair tumbling over her shoulders to brush the Persian carpet.</p><p>Taking a step back, Zak regarded his companion with impatience.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed, Anya. You will be of no use until you\u2019ve regained your strength,\u201d he said with a brutal lack of sympathy for her fatigue.</p><p>With an obvious effort, the witch rose to her feet, her face pale with the strain to remain upright.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what happened in the temple.\u201d</p><p>Zak paused before giving a shrug. There was no point in hiding his success.</p><p>Not when he intended to begin the final stages of his plan within the next few days.</p><p>Perhaps even hours.</p><p>\u201cI was given what I need to take my place as the ruler of the high-bloods,\u201d he admitted, removing the chalice from his pocket and moving to place it on the desk.</p><p>Anya sucked in a sharp breath, no doubt sensing the magic that pulsed around the golden artifact.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it do?\u201d</p><p>He ran a loving finger along the rim of the chalice. \u201cWith this I can raise armies to fight my battles.\u201d</p><p>Anya swayed, her face more pale than usual as she grasped the back of a nearby chair.</p><p>\u201cZak, this is too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a frown. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time we tried\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no need to be reminded of my previous failures,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to take this slow.\u201d Anya licked her lips. \u201cYou may mock the Mave and Valhalla, but they aren\u2019t helpless.\u201d</p><p>His cold smile hid his stab of fury.</p><p>Over the centuries he\u2019d watched from the shadows as the high-bloods had started to ban together in small, secretive groups. He understood the philosophy that it was safer to surround yourself with people who were like you. Especially when the humans began to realize that the myths and legends they\u2019d always thought were nothing more than fairy tales were actually true.</p><p>There were monsters in the dark.</p><p>But he\u2019d seen the hieroglyphs on the temple wall and he understood what happened when high-bloods lived in communities, their powers revealed for the world to see.</p><p>He had no intention of becoming a visible enemy for the violent humans who were always eager to destroy what they feared.</p><p>Still, it had been a constant source of annoyance to watch the Maves come and go at Valhalla, each one commanding more power than the one before.</p><p>He was the destined leader of the high-bloods.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve grown complacent over the years.\u201d His lips curled into a sneer. \u201cI must strike before they can prepare for an attack.\u201d</p><p>Anya\u2019s grip on the chair tightened until her knuckles turned white.</p><p>Fear? Desperation? Some combination of the two?</p><p>\u201cYou have no guarantee that the chalice will even work.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI will soon discover one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should have a small test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZak\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to your room, Anya,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>Soon he would have to deal with the witch.</p><p>But not tonight.</p><p>Sensing the dismissal in his tone, Anya grudgingly crossed the floor and with a last wary glance, left him alone in the study.</p><p>Zak waited until he could hear her footsteps on the stairs before running his fingers beneath the edge of the desk. There was a faint click, then a secret panel on the side slid open. With a stab of satisfaction he reached to grab the chalice, tucking it into the empty compartment before sliding the secret panel shut.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the most secure hiding place, but the chalice pulsed with a magic that was unique to diviners. The magic of death.</p><p>No one but a powerful necromancer could use it.</p><p>To anyone else it was just a battered goblet.</p><p>With his prize tucked away for the night, Zak sank into the chair behind the desk and absently reached for the remote to turn on the plasma TV over the fireplace.</p><p>He always devoted an hour or so before bed to watch the news, both global and local. He might consider humans beneath him, but he never underestimated them as an enemy. It was imperative that he study their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Fast-forwarding through the tedious fascination with glamorous actors behaving badly and the unpredictable stock market, Zak abruptly rose to his feet as the image of a dead girl lying on the bank of a river was flashed on the screen.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the sight of Leah that captured his attention. He\u2019d known her body would eventually show up. After all, Tony had disposed of her. Which meant he\u2019d driven to the river and tossed her in at the nearest spot, not even bothering to consider she would get snagged on the bank just a few miles away if he didn\u2019t weight her down.</p><p>Idiot.</p><p>But instead, it was when the camera panned to the side to catch the image of a lean, hard-faced man who broke away from a group of cops to speak with a young woman. A woman with hair the color of fire and eyes covered by reflective glasses.</p><p>He surged to his feet, his mind racing with possibilities.</p><p>Callie Brown.</p><p>Just the woman he wanted.</p><p>Reaching down, he stabbed a button that connected him to the intercom system.</p><p>Within seconds the groggy voice of Tony floated through the air. \u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my study.\u201d</p><p>There was a momentary pause. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Zak hissed with impatience. \u201cYes, now.\u201d</p><p>Lifting the remote control, he replayed the news clip, his narrowed gaze missing nothing as he considered the various ways to take advantage of this unexpected stroke of fortune.</p><p>He was on his fourth time through the clip when Tony at last lumbered into the room, his girth covered by a too-short robe and his hair rumpled.</p><p>\u201cYou need something?\u201d he asked, his voice gruff.</p><p>Zak pointed toward the image on the television screen. He\u2019d paused it at the point where the blond-haired man was speaking with the female diviner.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize the man?\u201d</p><p>Tony grimaced. \u201cO\u2019Conner. Sergeant O\u2019Conner of the Kansas City Police Department,\u201d he said. \u201cHe busted me about six years ago. Bastard.\u201d Tony stepped toward the television, giving a low whistle. \u201cWho\u2019s the babe?\u201d</p><p>With a nonchalant motion, Zak backhanded his servant, sending him crashing against the far wall.</p><p>\u201cNever speak of her again, is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Tony climbed slowly to his feet, wiping the blood from his split lip. \u201cYeah, painfully clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Zak pressed Play, carefully watching the possessive manner O\u2019Conner behaved toward Callie. They were lovers. It was obvious in the way she leaned in to his intimate touch and his protective glares whenever anyone strayed too close to them.</p><p>They were emotionally entangled, which meant that they wouldn\u2019t be able to stay away from one another.</p><p>All he had to do was keep a careful watch on the cop. Eventually Callie would leave Valhalla to spend time with him. Hopefully without the constant protection of her Sentinel.</p><p>The trick would, of course, be taking them alive.</p><p>His specialty was death.</p><p>Rewinding the tape, he watched as O\u2019Conner spoke with his fellow police officers, taking note of the private conversation he shared with a gray-haired cop who stood apart from the others.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the man?\u201d he demanded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrank,\u201d Tony muttered, scratching at his unshaved cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged. \u201cHis wife is my second cousin on my mother\u2019s side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course she is,\u201d Zak said wryly. This was precisely the reason he\u2019d hired the bumbling idiot, and why he hadn\u2019t yet disposed of him. He was connected to every family in Kansas City. \u201cI need you to arrange a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Tony looked horrified. \u201cFrank hates my guts. Calls me a blight on the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Zak drawled, tossing the remote onto his desk so he could turn to frown at his companion. \u201cTell him that you have information regarding Leah. Information that you\u2019re willing to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that might work,\u201d Tony said slowly, reluctance etched on his pudgy face.</p><p>\u201cHave him meet you here tomorrow morning.\u201d Zak frowned, abruptly realizing that having a cop car on the property might not be the best idea. Didn\u2019t they have some sort of . . . GPS system? \u201cActually, it would be better if you pick him up.\u201d</p> <p>The reluctance became more pronounced as Tony began to sweat. \u201cYou want me to bring him here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what I just said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll be able to tell the cops where you live,\u201d Tony blurted out.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>Tony grimaced. \u201cI know Frank, and trust me, you can\u2019t bribe or intimidate the man. He\u2019s a real prick about the rules.\u201d</p><p>Zak shrugged. \u201cHe won\u2019t tell anyone, because he\u2019ll be dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . no.\u201d The henchman managed a sickly smile, backing toward the door. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll go to my rooms and give him a call first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Zak let him creep away like a mouse trying to evade a stalking cat. Tony might be a bully, but he was a coward at heart.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have the courage to try and escape.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he whispered softly, the power that swirled deep inside him vibrating with an awareness of the chalice that was hidden only a few inches away. \u201cIt begins.\u201d</p><p>Callie was exactly where she wanted to be ... snuggled on Duncan\u2019s bed with his arms wrapped around her and her head resting above the steady beat of his heart.</p><p>Unfortunately, while her body was sated from the passion that had exploded the minute they entered the apartment, her mind churned with a restless frustration.</p> <p>She felt tense. Jumpy.</p><p>As if she was hurtling toward a car crash she couldn\u2019t avoid.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d</p><p>She tilted back her head to meet Duncan\u2019s steady gaze, easily reading the concern that shimmered in the hazel depths.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d she admitted in low tones.</p><p>\u201cI promise, I don\u2019t snore,\u201d he teased, clearly hoping to distract her.</p><p>Her finger brushed an absent pattern on his chest, savoring the feel of his warm satin skin even as her thoughts remained dark.</p><p>\u201cIf the necromancer has the coin, we might already be too late.\u201d She spoke her fears aloud, hoping it might lessen the knot of dread lodged in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>Duncan brushed his lips over her furrowed brow. \u201cWe\u2019re not too late.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly at his confident tone. Somehow she\u2019d assumed that no one could match a Sentinel for arrogance.</p><p>Duncan was proving how wrong she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHektor said something about the coin being needed to unlock the door to the underworld where there\u2019s a mysterious chalice,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhatever the hell that means. Unless the door to the underworld is hidden in Kansas City . . . god forbid . . . the necromancer will have to travel to get to it.\u201d</p><p>Ah. So not just arrogance.</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath, trying to ease her seething anxiety. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose at the persistent sense of danger. \u201cFane made sure to warn the monks to keep an eye open for a diviner with diamond eyes. If he tries to travel with a Sentinel he\u2019ll be easily spotted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever Fane,\u201d her companion muttered.</p><p>Callie blinked at the unmistakable edge in Duncan\u2019s voice. \u201cWould you be happier if he was stupid?\u201d</p><p>With a swift move, he rolled on top of her, his expression hard with a jealousy he made no effort to hide. \u201cI would be happier if I was your guardian.\u201d</p><p>Her legs instinctively parted to allow him to settle against her. She swallowed a small sigh of satisfaction. It felt so right to have his heavy weight pressing against her, the scent of his maleness teasing at her nose and the feel of his warm skin branding her with pleasure.</p><p>Here, in this bed, she felt protected. Safe.</p><p>Loved . . .</p><p>Her heart slammed against her ribs as the perilous word whispered through her mind.</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>A part of her knew that this wasn\u2019t the time to add yet another layer of complication to their relationship. It was already a minefield of disaster that threatened to blow up in her face when she least expected it.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t her afternoon at the police station proved that?</p><p>But the L word wasn\u2019t as easy to dismiss.</p><p>Not when Duncan\u2019s hand was running an intimate path down the line of her collarbone and his hazel eyes were shimmering with flecks of molten gold.</p><p>\u201cOnly a Sentinel can be a guardian,\u201d she reminded him, not surprised when her voice came out a breathy whisper instead of the stern warning it should have been.</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Good question.</p><p>\u201cTradition,\u201d she at last suggested.</p><p>\u201cScrew tradition,\u201d he growled, lowering his head to stroke his lips down the line of her jaw. \u201cWe can make new ones.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, her hands reaching up to thread through the short strands of his hair.</p><p>\u201cI doubt the Sentinels would agree.\u201d</p><p>He slowly pulled back, studying her flushed face with an expression that was impossible to read.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you trust me to be your guardian?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. This was important.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need the sudden tension in Duncan\u2019s shoulders or the way he didn\u2019t quite meet her gaze to warn her just how much her answer meant.</p><p>But she also understood that she couldn\u2019t put any pressure on him to make a commitment he might end up regretting. Duncan O\u2019Conner was far too much like Fane. A man with his own moral code.</p><p>He would stand by his word, even if it put him through hell. Hadn\u2019t he stayed in a loveless marriage until he\u2019d caught his wife cheating on him?</p><p>The trick was to soothe his male pride without making any demands.</p><p>Yeah, no problem.</p><p>And next she would solve cold fusion.</p><p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d she murmured, forcing a teasing smile to her lips.</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to give his chin a small nip. \u201cYou have to apply for the position.\u201d</p><p>His tension eased as a wicked glow chased the shadows from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>She licked his bottom lip, forgetting this was supposed to be a distraction.</p><p>Hell, she was the one distracted.</p><p>In the best possible way.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>He groaned deep in his throat, his swelling cock pressing against her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cAnd how would I go about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s a very rigorous process,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI can be rigorous.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, remembering the sound of the headboard slamming against the wall less than an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly can,\u201d she agreed, a husky edge of lingering pleasure in her voice.</p><p>It had taken a while to convince the stubborn man that she was far stronger than most women he\u2019d known, and that she fully approved of his . . . rigorous . . . lovemaking.</p><p>He captured her lips in a deep, drugging kiss. \u201cOr I can be slow and thorough.\u201d</p><p>The shudder of anticipation started at the tip of her toes and rippled all the way through her.</p><p>\u201cThat works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut first.\u201d</p><p>Lost in the sensual spell he could cast all too easily, Callie was puzzled when Duncan pulled back to study her with a narrowed gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>Was this a game? If it was, she hoped it included more of those slow, thorough kisses.</p><p>\u201cThe truth about what?\u201d she asked, willing to play along.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet since we left the station. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Oh . . . crap.</p><p>She\u2019d convinced herself that she\u2019d managed to hide her distress at Frank\u2019s unwelcomed confrontation. The last thing she\u2019d wanted was to cause trouble with Duncan\u2019s friend.</p><p>But she should have known she hadn\u2019t fooled him for a second. Sergeant Duncan O\u2019Conner missed nothing.</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to overreact.\u201d</p><p>His jaw instantly clenched and Callie heaved a resigned sigh. What the hell was wrong with her?</p><p>Just warning him not to overreact was a sure way to make him overreact.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll overreact?\u201d he snarled on cue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re male.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her blunt accusation, then his lips twisted into a rueful smile. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he muttered, his fingers lightly stroking her cheek. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Despite his gentle touch, he was wearing his cop face.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let this go.</p><p>\u201cYour friend Frank was concerned that you weren\u2019t thinking clearly,\u201d she grudgingly confessed.</p><p>His fingers tightened on her cheek, but there was no surprise that Frank had been the one to approach her. The coroner had never been particularly discreet in his dislike for high-bloods.</p><p>\u201cAbout you?\u201d he asked between clenched teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn part.\u201d She ran her hands down the length of his rigid back, her touch soothing. \u201cHe believes you\u2019re devastated by the marriage of your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-wife.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to be pleased by his fierce correction.</p> <p>But hey, she was human.

I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Duncan, he\u2019s your friend,\u201d she said in urgent tones. This was exactly what she feared. \u201cOf course he\u2019s going to be worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His fingers cupped her chin as he held her gaze with a somber intensity. \u201cCallie, if this is going to work we have to be honest with each other.\u201d</p><p>He was right. The words that Frank had spoken were already festering deep inside her. Threatening to destroy the joy she felt when she was with Duncan.</p><p>The only way to deal with it was to get it out in the open.</p> <p>Like lancing an infected wound.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt me, but he did remind me of the cost you\u2019ll have to pay to be with me,\u201d she said, her voice so low he had to lower his head to catch her words. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . not going to be easy for you.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, as if surprised by her words. \u201cNot just me, Callie,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for both of us.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to touch his jaw. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for it?\u201d</p><p>He studied her concerned expression before he slowly dipped down to kiss her with a tenderness that brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cAlthough I can\u2019t guarantee that I won\u2019t get pissed off when I think you\u2019re being insulted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you losing your friends.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss. Slower . . . deeper.</p> <p>\u201cIf they\u2019re truly my friends then they\u2019ll understand when I tell them to fuck off.\u201d His tongue stroked a damp path along her lower lip. \u201cAnd if they want to be turd-heads, then they can get the hell out of my life.\u201d</p><p>She gave a reluctant chuckle. \u201cTurd-heads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, turd-heads.\u201d He trailed a line of kisses up her jaw before he lifted his head to regard her with a hint of question. \u201cAnd you? Are you ready for it?\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you I feel like I can face anything.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened, some undefinable emotion smoldering in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cEven jackass cops?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more afraid of your mother.\u201d</p><p>He smiled with a sinful intent, his hand sliding over her shoulder and down to cup the swell of her breast.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have a perfect way of taking your mind off my ma and interfering friends.\u201d His thumb rubbed the tip of her nipple into a tight peak. \u201cOh, and the potential end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Her nails scraped down his back, a honey-heat flowing through her body. \u201cThis had better be a damned good distraction,\u201d she teased, her foot stroking up the back of his calf.</p><p>He gave a soft moan, burying his face in the curve of her neck. \u201cOh, I think you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like it?\u201d</p><p>His lips found the pulse that thundered at the base of her throat.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m very lucky, you\u2019ll love it,\u201d he whispered, angling his hips and sliding deep into her body with one smooth stroke.</p><p>\u201cDuncan\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Dawn had barely crested when Zak left his private chambers and entered the small room at the back of the house. As always, a full breakfast was waiting for him, along with a stack of the morning papers.</p><p>He ignored the sizzling sense of anticipation that filled his veins like the finest champagne as he went through his morning routine with a careful precision. The lure of the chalice had haunted him the entire night, but now wasn\u2019t the time to be bewitched by the whispers of power.</p><p>No.</p><p>He needed an orderly mind.</p><p>An utter state of calm.</p><p>And the realization that the closer he came to achieving his destiny, the more careful he had to be.</p><p>Today he put his pawns in position and prepared the last of his strategy.</p><p>And of course, cleaned up his loose ends.</p><p>On cue, Tony entered the room, looking worse than many corpses Zak had raised.</p><p>The servant had clearly not slept. Or even bathed. His dark hair was sticking up in small clumps and his cheeks were unshaved. He\u2019d made an effort to dress in a clean pair of slacks and a white shirt, but he\u2019d forgotten his shoes and his belt hung unfastened around his thick waist.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Zak murmured softly. \u201cWhere\u2019s the cop?\u201d</p><p>The servant anxiously shifted his feet. \u201cHe\u2019s in the kitchen having a cup of coffee. I told him I had to check and make sure my employers weren\u2019t up yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Zak laid aside his napkin and rose to his feet. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t suspect he\u2019s being led to a trap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Tony did more shifting. \u201cHe knows I occasionally . . . barter information for cash.\u201d</p><p>Zak rounded the table, absently straightening the cuffs of his black Armani suit. Unlike Tony, he understood the importance of presenting an image of strength.</p><p>\u201cUse the tunnels to bring him into the basement.\u201d</p><p>The man scrubbed his fingers through his hair. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be armed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman weapons don\u2019t frighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do me,\u201d Tony muttered.</p><p>Zak shrugged. \u201cOnce the cop is in my private laboratory you may leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways supposing he doesn\u2019t shoot me in the back before we get there.\u201d</p><p>Zak smiled with a cold indifference. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance I\u2019m willing to take.\u201d</p><p>Tony lost what little color he had left. \u201cFantastic.\u201d</p><p>Indifferent to his servant\u2019s barely contained panic, Zak strolled out of the room and down the hall. It was still early, but he had tasks to finish before the cop arrived.</p><p>Reaching his office, his steps slowed as he caught the unmistakable scent of candle wax and blood.</p><p>Anya.</p><p>An icy smile touched his lips as he cautiously pressed open the door and scanned the room to make sure there were no unwelcome surprises.</p><p>Nothing was out of place. Not unless he counted the slender, redheaded woman who was covertly searching through the drawers of his desk.</p><p>Stepping into the room, he closed the door and silently glided across the carpet to stand directly behind the intruder.</p><p>\u201cI thought I might find you here, witch,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>With a gasp, Anya whirled around to face him, her eyes wide with fear.</p><p>\u201cZak.\u201d</p><p>Holding her wide gaze, Zak leaned to the side and released the hidden lever. With a click the panel slid open and he reached into the compartment to remove the chalice.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you were searching for?\u201d</p><p>She wisely shrank back as he straightened to hold the chalice between them.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She swallowed, then with an obvious effort, she forced a stiff smile to her lips. \u201cI was searching for an amulet that I dropped here yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Zak clicked his tongue, carefully setting the chalice on the desk.</p><p>\u201cYou really are a terrible liar,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I have no reason to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Such days are behind us.\u201d He reached to wrap his fingers lightly around her throat. Not hard enough to hurt. Not yet. \u201cTell me, Anya, why did you do it?\u201d</p><p>She went rigid, but she was smart enough not to try and break free.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cBetray me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . .\u201d She gave a choked cry as his fingers tightened. \u201cZak, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Anya.\u201d The words were edged with ice. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else who could have kept the coin out of my grasp for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Brotherhood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA band of idiots who would never have been capable of outwitting me if they hadn\u2019t had a spy to warn them when I was about to strike,\u201d he interrupted, his narrowed gaze watching the emotions dart over her face.</p><p>Fear . . . desperation ... cunning.</p><p>\u201cA spy?\u201d she finally tried to bluff.</p><p>His thumb pressed against the pulse that thundered just below her jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh was laced with a barely concealed hysteria. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m very, very serious,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d She struggled to recall the glib excuses she\u2019d used for years to divert his suspicions. \u201cIf it was me, then why wouldn\u2019t I have warned Calso?\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted down to the unsteady line of her lips. \u201cI admit I thought that it was a trap until I had my hands on the chalice. Now I can only assume that something went wrong.\u201d Her breath quickened, a certain sign that his guess had been a good one. \u201cSo what happened, my dear? Did they fail to heed your warning? Or did you realize I was becoming suspicious and decide it wasn\u2019t worth the risk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes no sense, Zak,\u201d Anya stubbornly insisted. She was nothing if not tenacious. It was the only reason she\u2019d survived over the centuries. \u201cMy fate is tied to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I thought.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, growing alarmed by his refusal to accept her innocence.</p><p>\u201cI rescued you from the flames,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI stood guard over your mutilated body for a century. I led you to the hidden temple. Why would I sacrifice so much only to betray you?\u201d</p><p>He arched his brows. Surely she wasn\u2019t hoping to stir a sense of gratitude? This woman better than anyone should know he didn\u2019t indulge in human emotions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re going to tell me,\u201d he assured her. \u201cSo start explaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He heaved a mock sigh of disappointment, his fingers slowly, ruthlessly tightening around her throat.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been together a very long time, Anya. I didn\u2019t want to have to hurt you.\u201d His fingers slowly, ruthlessly began to crush her throat. \u201cBut I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she managed to croak, tears streaming down her ashen cheeks.</p><p>\u201cTell me, witch.\u201d He leaned down until they were nose to nose, the chill of his power swirling through the air. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered in pain, her hands lifting to grasp his wrists.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d she hissed.</p> <p>\u201cLove?\u201d</p><p>His humorless laugh echoed through the study. This woman was capable of lust, greed, and a narcissistic ambition. But love?</p><p>A barracuda had more of a heart than she did.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she insisted, a sudden color returning to her cheeks. \u201cYou can\u2019t be surprised. Why would any woman devote her life to a man if not for love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou truly must believe me to be a fool,\u201d he sneered, his fingers easing just enough to allow her to suck in a shaky breath.</p><p>He wanted this to be slow.</p> <p>And painful.</p><p>Very, very painful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t claim to be an expert on human emotions, but I\u2019m fairly certain that love doesn\u2019t include treachery.\u201d He met her wary gaze, his expression cold, merciless. \u201cNot unless you happen to be a character from Shakespeare. And you know how much I detest Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t start off as treachery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The amulet around her neck glowed with a faint light. No doubt a last-ditch attempt to sway him into believing her imploring words. She\u2019d always had a talent for coercing others. Unfortunately for her, he\u2019d never been susceptible. \u201cWhen we first met I was attracted to your power. That was why I assisted you in gaining the attention of the czarina.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound of disgust. \u201cI didn\u2019t need your assistance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not, but you would never have known of your destiny unless I had revealed the temple to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been revealed eventually. My fate has been waiting for me since the dawn of civilization.\u201d Zak lifted his shoulder in a dismissive gesture. \u201cBesides, I promised to make you queen of the world. A fair trade for your information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all I desired. Even after I rescued you from the flames and protected you from your enemies. It wasn\u2019t until\u2014\u201d She deliberately allowed her words to trail away.</p><p>\u201cUntil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil we became lovers that my feelings deepened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovers?\u201d His lips twisted into a humorless smile. \u201cWe had sex to ensure my ultimate victory.\u201d</p><p>She swiftly disguised the fury that flared through her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCall it whatever you want,\u201d she said, lowering her voice to a seductive invitation. \u201cI spent night after night in your arms and it created a bond between us.\u201d</p><p>Ntght after night . . .</p><p>Zak snapped his teeth together, struck by her soft words.</p><p>Christ. He\u2019d just sworn he wasn\u2019t a fool, but it was obvious that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d been.</p><p>This . . . female . . . had used his lack of interest in the tedious details of procreation to hold him hostage.</p><p>And the most galling part of all, was that he hadn\u2019t even suspected he was being played.</p><p>\u201cYou clever little bitch.\u201d</p><p>With each frigid word his fingers tightened, his nails digging into her skin until blood dripped down her throat.</p><p>\u201cZak,\u201d Anya squawked, her eyes bulging. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou claimed that your dark magic made it almost impossible for you to conceive,\u201d he snarled, his lips curled with disgust. \u201cA lie, wasn\u2019t it, Anya?\u201d</p><p>It took several tries before she could speak past the pain. \u201cNot entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She helplessly gripped his wrists, trying to pry away his punishing hand. \u201cIt truly is more difficult.\u201d</p><p>He studied her pale face with an uncharacteristic loathing. Emotions were a waste of energy. Regrettably, there were times when they refused to be suppressed.</p><p>Like now.</p><p>\u201cBut you made certain it was impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she rasped. \u201cI knew once you had what you wanted you would no longer invite me to your bend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why\u2014\u201d He bit off his question, abruptly recalling the days before Anya\u2019s announcement she was at last pregnant. \u201cOf course. I said I was weary of your lack of production. I intended to find another woman to carry my seed.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze, artfully allowing her lips to quiver. Such a fine performance, he sourly acknowledged. A pity she didn\u2019t have an audience to appreciate her effort.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t allow you to take another lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was desperate,\u201d she said in tragic tones. \u201cIn the end, all I could do was give you the child you wanted and hope that you could see that we were so much more than mere partners.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound of disgust. \u201cYou were never my partner.\u201d</p><p>Her performance faltered as a surge of bitterness darkened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was merely a means to an end,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>True enough. His fingers tightened, making her shudder in agony.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you begin betraying me to the Brotherhood?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She clutched at his arms, a panic twisting her face as the bones began to pop in her neck.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t . . . breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think you can if you really try, my dear,\u201d he drawled. Witches didn\u2019t have the healing capabilities of a Sentinel, but they did have a higher tolerance to damage than mere humans. \u201cNow, one more time. When did you begin betraying me to the Brotherhood?\u201d</p><p>The amulet glowed, but this time it wasn\u2019t a futile effort to glamour him. No. Anya was frantically draining the stored magic to keep herself alive.</p><p>\u201cNot long after you realized you could sense their presence,\u201d she grated.</p><p>How many years had been wasted because of this bitch?</p><p>How long had he been denied his fate?</p><p>Anya would pay for each and every day she\u2019d cost him.</p><p>\u201cYou never intended for me to take my place as ruler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d she tried to plead. \u201cI hoped that once you were truly committed to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. You wanted a puppet you could lead around by the cock,\u201d he sliced through her words, understanding at last.</p><p>Clearly Anya\u2019s definition of love was beguiling a man until he was blinded by lust.</p><p>She dug her nails into his wrists as her legs began to sag. He was keeping her on the edge of death and her body was only minutes from a total collapse.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI prefer not to be the puppet of an overly ambitious bitch.\u201d</p><p>Any pretense of affection drained from the emerald eyes to reveal the bitter resentment that festered beneath the surface.</p><p>\u201cI meant that you\u2019re no better than me,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou had no intention of making me your queen.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was mocking. \u201cI promised you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn empty promise.\u201d Her head fell back, her skin becoming a pasty white as her magic faltered and the full impact of her injuries took their toll. \u201cYou\u2019re willing to sacrifice anyone, including your own family, to achieve your goals. I have never doubted for a second that I would be as easily destroyed once I was no longer any use to you.\u201d She gave an agonized laugh, blood dripping from the corner of her mouth. \u201cI could only hope to make myself indispensable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No one is indispensable, Anya,\u201d he taunted, his fingers tightening until her windpipe was crushed. \u201cA pity.\u201d</p><p>With the last of her strength, she reached up to rake her nails down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in hell,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Zak heard the sound of the door opening behind him, and the muttered curse as the intruder caught sight of him ruthlessly squeezing out the last of Anya\u2019s life. But his gaze never shifted from the emerald eyes, a smile touching his lips as he savored her slow death.</p><p>Yes. This was his finest talent.</p><p>And his greatest pleasure.</p><p>He heard the sound of metal scraping against leather as the man behind him drew a gun.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d he growled, his voice not quite steady.</p><p>\u201cPatience, cop,\u201d Zak commanded, the dark power stirring deep inside him. \u201cYou\u2019re next.\u201d</p><p>Duncan wasn\u2019t a sentimental kind of guy.</p><p>Or at least . . . he\u2019d never thought of himself as sentimental. Not until Callie Brown.</p><p>Lying on his side, he studied the tiny female who was tucked next to him. He\u2019d been awake for hours, enchanted by the sight of her sleeping in his arms.</p><p>The pale, delicate features. The fiery hair that reflected her indomitable spirit. The lush curve of her lips that hinted at her passion. And the slender body that held a strength that would have shocked most people.</p><p>He\u2019d cared for Susan. He truly had.</p><p>But this woman . . .</p><p>She fit against him with absolute perfection. Like two puzzle pieces that had finally been assembled.</p><p>There, see?</p><p>Sentimental.</p><p>And something else. Something fiercely possessive and dangerously protective.</p><p>He grimaced, his fingers lightly stroking over her bare shoulder. Despite his assurances to Callie that he was prepared to deal with the inevitable prejudices, he was still anxious to put his fist in Frank\u2019s face.</p><p>Friend or not, the man had no right to try and intimidate Callie. If he thought Duncan was making a mistake then he should have confronted him face to face. That he could respect. Not acting like a bully behind his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave a shake of his head, unwilling to mar the peace of this moment with such ugliness. There would be plenty of time later to worry about the rest of the world. For now it was just the two of them.</p><p>On the point of waking his sleeping beauty with a kiss, Duncan was caught off guard when she abruptly began to thrash against him, her tiny moans of distress piercing his heart.</p><p>\u201cCallie. Sweetheart.\u201d He sat up, pulling her tight against his chest.</p> <p>She struggled against him, her breath coming in panicked gasps. \u201cNo . . . no.\u201d</p><p>His hand pressed her head against his shoulder, his arms keeping her from tumbling off the bed.</p><p>\u201cCallie, wake up.\u201d</p><p>The low command in his voice seemed to do the trick. With a low moan she lifted her lashes, the brilliant clarity of her eyes clouded with a lingering horror.</p><p>\u201cDuncan?\u201d</p> <p>He cupped her chin, brushing a soft kiss over her trembling lips.</p><p>\u201cYou were having a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly, a shudder wracking her body. \u201cGod, it was horrible.\u201d</p><p>His lips moved to stroke her temple. \u201cDo you want to share?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr just forget about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was standing at the edge of Valhalla and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were everywhere,\u201d she said, bravely trying to swallow a choked sob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d His arms tightened around her at the feel of her trembling against him. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead.\u201d</p><p>His heart squeezed at her whispered words. Dammit. Couldn\u2019t they leave her alone even in her sleep?</p><p>His hand ran a soothing path up and down her back. \u201cCallie, it was just a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not just a dream.\u201d She tilted back her head to reveal her troubled expression, her cheeks damp with tears. \u201cIt was real. A premonition.\u201d</p> <p>He ignored the cold chill that inched down his spine. No. He wasn\u2019t going to start jumping at shadows.</p><p>They were both on edge. Wasn\u2019t it more likely her dreams were a reaction to her stress rather than some omen?</p><p>He used his thumbs to brush away her tears. \u201cIs seeing the future one of your skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but</p><p>\u201cThen it was just a dream,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>She sucked in a quivering breath. \u201cIt was my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my blood that called them from their grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh.\u201d He laid his cheek on top of her head, his hand reaching up to yank aside the curtain so the morning sunlight could spill over the bed. \u201cNothing is going to happen to you. Not as long as I have you in my arms.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Zak studied the small cut on his palm, fascinated as a drop of blood appeared only to vanish, reappearing in the chalice he\u2019d left on the counter of his lab.</p><p>Inside he could feel the dark power that flowed through him like a river of ice. It was the same pulsing avalanche that threatened to sear the flesh from his bones ... and yet, different.</p><p>With the chalice it was deeper, more profound.</p><p>His senses were heightened to a near unbearable acuteness, as if his every nerve had been exposed. The fluorescent lights were almost blindingly bright, the faint brush of central air made his skin prickle, and the sound of Tony\u2019s thundering heartbeat as he cowered near the door echoed through the air.</p><p>But above it all, he was aware of the shimmering strands of magic connecting him to the corpse standing in the middle of the floor.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the familiar slipping into the mind of the dead. He wasn\u2019t controlling an empty shell that was rapidly deteriorating.</p><p>No.</p><p>A part of Frank Sanchez remained despite his death. He was imbued with a magic that flowed from the chalice and into Zak before flowing to Frank. The cop could walk, talk, and think for himself. The magic even made him seem alive. He blinked, occasionally sucked in an unnecessary breath, and his face could show a few sluggish expressions.</p><p>The magic also disguised the gaping wound on the side of his head where Zak had crushed his skull. Almost as if it was Frank\u2019s own memory of himself that was being shrouded around his corpse.</p><p>But while he seemed alive, he was well and truly dead, and in the absolute control of Zak.</p><p>The perfect weapon.</p><p>A smile of satisfaction curled Zak\u2019s lips as he slowly circled his newest creation. \u201cYou can hear me?\u201d he asked softly, pleased when Frank\u2019s gaze settled on his face, awareness shimmering in the dark depths.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank Sanchez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Tony muttered from the doorway, his face a pasty white.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Zak snapped, his gaze never leaving Frank\u2019s face as it scrunched into a puzzled frown. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d the coroner demanded.</p><p>Ah. So he didn\u2019t remember the moments before his death.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your master,\u201d he said with a stern simplicity.</p><p>The frown deepened. \u201cBullshit\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zak allowed his power to flow through the bond, halting the angry words and enforcing his will on the man.</p><p>\u201cWho am I?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>The frown smoothed away and Frank gave a bow of his head. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Reaching into the pocket of his Armani pants, he pulled out his phone and held the screen toward Frank. \u201cDo you remember this man?\u201d</p><p>There was no hesitation. \u201cO\u2019Conner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Zak skimmed his finger across the screen to pull up another image. \u201cAnd what about this woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNecro.\u201d</p><p>Zak narrowed his eyes. As soon as he was in command of Valhalla things were going to change. Beginning with humans learning their proper place.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Callie Brown,\u201d he said in a soft, icy voice. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie Brown,\u201d Frank obediently parroted.</p><p>Satisfied, Zak returned the phone to his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI want her brought to me,\u201d he commanded. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>With a speed that took Zak by surprise, the cop was turning to head to the door.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he growled, grabbing the man\u2019s arm and spinning him back around. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where she is.\u201d</p><p>Some undefinable emotion briefly flared in the dark eyes. Or more likely it was just a memory of an emotion.</p><p>He doubted that the magic filling Frank could actually give him genuine feelings.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with O\u2019Conner.\u201d</p><p>Zak narrowed his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was at the station with him yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas her guardian with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot.\u201d</p><p>Zak turned away, pacing toward the stainless steel counter.</p><p>Was it possible?</p><p>He\u2019d waited so long, been denied so often.</p><p>Could destiny at last have taken a hand in ensuring his ultimate success?</p><p>Yes, a voice whispered in the back of his mind.</p><p>Fate had obviously chosen this moment for him to take his rightful place. Why wouldn\u2019t the stars align so that Callie would be precisely where he needed her to be?</p><p>Slowly turning back, he resisted the urge to rush from the house and attain the female who was the last key to his glory.</p><p>Destiny or not, he\u2019d be a fool to put himself at risk when he was so close to glory.</p><p>\u201cI want you to find O\u2019Conner. If Callie is still with him I want you to capture her and bring her straight here. If he\u2019s alone I want you to keep an eye on him until she shows up.\u201d He shifted his attention to the man who was trying to disappear into the shadows. \u201cTony will accompany you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no,\u201d the servant barked, his eyes bulging as he shoved away from the door.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Tony flinched at the lethal warning laced through Zak\u2019s tone.</p><p>\u201cOur deal never included being a sidekick to a zombie,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Zak smiled with frigid amusement. \u201cIs your objection to being a sidekick or working with the dead?\u201d</p><p>Unable to find the humor in the situation, Tony began backing out the door.</p><p>\u201cI quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>Zak\u2019s voice was soft, but filled with enough power to make the henchman halt in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony rasped, his belligerent attitude unable to disguise his fear.</p><p>\u201cYou will be assisting Frank,\u201d Zak informed him, his tone flat. Uncompromising. \u201cWhether you\u2019re alive or dead while you\u2019re assisting him makes no difference to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sleepyhead.\u201d</p><p>Callie woke for the second time, her earlier nightmare forgotten as she felt warm, male lips tenderly stroking over her cheek and caught a delectable scent filling the air.</p><p>Oh... yum.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t decide which was better. The arousing sensations of Duncan\u2019s light caresses or the aroma of cinnamon and butter and warm maple.</p><p>It was the growl of her stomach that decided.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she murmured, lifting her lids to discover Duncan seated at the edge of the bed with a tray filled with food perched beside him. \u201cDo I smell waffles?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI made them fresh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made them?\u201d Scooting up to lean against the headboard, her eyes narrowed as she caught sight of the fluffy waffles perfectly browned and dusted with cinnamon and powdered sugar with a dollop of whip cream on top of the stack. Beside the plate was a tiny jug of maple syrup and on the other side a bowl of ripe, red strawberries. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusted,\u201d he admitted with a boyish grin that tugged directly on her heart. \u201cI did order them. Does that count?\u201d</p><p>Callie swallowed a resigned sigh. He was unshaven, wearing a plain white tee with faded jeans, and his hair was tumbled onto his brow. He should have looked scruffy.</p><p>Instead, he was indecently, gloriously male and so beautiful she wanted to crawl into his lap and beg him to hold her for the next eternity or so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lost in the fantasy, it wasn\u2019t until a golden brow arched that she was jolted out of her lovesick daze.</p><p>She grimaced. Man, she had it bad, bad, bad.</p><p>\u201cOnly if there\u2019s coffee,\u201d she forced herself to tease.</p> <p>His grin widened. \u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d</p><p>He bent down to grab a cup of coffee he\u2019d set on the floor, waving it beneath her nose before pressing it into her outstretched hand.</p><p>Breathing deeply of the rich aroma, she took a sip, sending Duncan an appreciative glance. He\u2019d remembered she took three sugars with a dollop of cream.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she murmured, setting aside the coffee to break off a corner of the top waffle to dip it in the syrup before popping it into her mouth. \u201cIs there a reason I\u2019m being so shamelessly spoiled?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBecause I like to spoil you.\u201d</p> <p>She believed him. Duncan was a tough, macho cop, but he was also a generous lover who would always seek to please his partner.</p><p>\u201cAnd because you\u2019re worried about me?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed a strawberry and pressed it to his lips.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d He took a bite of the berry, his gaze never wavering from her face. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>They shared an intimate smile, both recalling the long night filled with enough passion to light the world on fire.</p><p>The gold shimmered in his hazel eyes, suggesting that Duncan would like to do more than just remember the pleasure they\u2019d shared.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will your watchdog be arriving?\u201d he asked, his voice a husky rasp.</p><p>Leaning to the side, she grabbed her cell phone off the nightstand to read the message she knew would be waiting for her.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cIn half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Duncan muttered, leashing his ready desire. \u201cWhere are you supposed to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the parking lot.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cWhat parking lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She watched his frown deepen. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does he know where I... wait.\u201d He held up a hand, rolling his eyes. \u201cStupid question.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. It had been a stupid question. \u201cFane is nothing if not thorough.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened, but he made a visible effort to keep his expression bland. \u201cWill you return to Valhalla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have to report to the Mave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shame.\u201d His gaze traveled down to where the blanket barely covered the curve of her breasts. \u201cI have a much better way to spend the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d His smile was wicked. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t rather spend the day with you.\u201d</p><p>Impulsively she leaned forward, pressing a lingering kiss to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d His hand cupped her nape as he parted her lips to stroke his tongue into her mouth, tasting her with blatant hunger before pulling back with a rueful sigh. \u201cEat your breakfast before I forget we don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She gave his lower lip a tiny nip. \u201cTime for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehave yourself, woman.\u201d</p><p>Firmly settling her back against the headboard, Duncan reached for a strawberry and held it to her mouth.</p><p>Callie obediently took a bite, savoring the tart juices that exploded in her mouth. Duncan was right, it was a shame. Hell, it was more than a shame.</p><p>She\u2019d much rather be feasting on his hard, male body, but time was slipping away too fast to indulge their need.</p><p>Neither wanted Fane coming to look for her.</p><p>With an indulgent smile, Duncan urged her to clean her plate, then while he whisked away the tray, Callie took a quick shower.</p><p>Returning to the bedroom she discovered her clothes had been freshly laundered and laid out on the bed and her heart melted a little more.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>This man understood women far too well.</p><p>Romance wasn\u2019t about flowers or remembered birthdays, or surprise trips to Paris.</p><p>Not that all of those things weren\u2019t great.</p><p>But it was the tiny, everyday thoughtful gestures that made a woman feel appreciated.</p><p>Loved.</p><p>Pulling on her clothes, she struggled against the aching disappointment at having to leave.</p><p>Someday she would put her foot down and insist she have the freedom to explore her relationship with Duncan.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>Until the danger was past, she had to be extra careful. Her nightmare had forced her to realize that she wasn\u2019t taking Boggs\u2019s warning as seriously as she should.</p><p>The vision of herself poised in front of Valhalla while a dark tide of death rushed past her was seared into her brain, chilling her to her very soul.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how or why her blood could call the dead, but if there was the slightest chance the rogue necromancer could use her in his sick plans then she had to stay out of his reach.</p><p>And if that meant cowering behind the protective walls of Valhalla, so be it.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she forced her feet to carry her out of the bedroom into the living room where Duncan was tucking his gun into his holster.</p><p>She choked back a groan.</p><p>His golden male looks might have been too pretty if it wasn\u2019t for the dangerous edge to his features and the hard, lean body that was built for violence.</p><p>Instead he looked... mouthwatering.</p><p>Barely resisting the urge to cross the short distance and press herself against the sexy invitation that was Duncan O\u2019Conner, she forced a smile to her lips.</p><p>No moping in front of the delectable cop. He was already worried enough about her.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the clean clothes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI had no idea you could not only order a breakfast that was to die for, but you can also do laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m multitalented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly are,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He stilled as their gazes entangled, sharing all the words they couldn\u2019t say. \u201cCallie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d she abruptly breathed, slipping on her reflective glasses. \u201cFane will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, but he moved to place an arm around her waist, leading her toward the door. He might hate the fact that Fane was her guardian, but he wouldn\u2019t jeopardize her safety.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait with you.\u201d</p><p>There was no point in arguing, even if she\u2019d wanted to.</p><p>Duncan wasn\u2019t going to let her out of his sight until he\u2019d handed her over to Fane.</p><p>Which might have been insulting if she hadn\u2019t accepted that her pride had to take a backseat until the necromancer was found. In her mind she might be a kick-ass Xena warrior, but in reality... yeah, not so much.</p><p>Leaving the apartment, Callie felt a strange chill brush over her skin. Almost as if she\u2019d been touched by death.</p><p>She shivered, hastily looking down the narrow hallway that ended at a heavy fire door. There wasn\u2019t much to see. A few plastic plants in dire need of dusting and a shallow alcove that led to the second apartment.</p><p>So why did she feel as if there was something lurking just out of sight?</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Duncan demanded, his hand on his gun.</p><p>She gave a last glance down the hall before giving a shake of her head. Obviously the nightmare had affected her even more than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>She was jumping at shadows.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing\u201d</p><p>Duncan nodded, continuing to lead her out of the building, but his hand remained on his gun.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the only jumpy one.</p><p>They stepped into the parking lot, briefly blinded by the late afternoon sunlight.</p><p>Callie blinked, scanning the lot for a sign of the heavy vehicle that Fane always preferred.</p><p>A Hummer, a truck, an armored tank.</p><p>When there was nothing beyond the expected minivans and midsize clunkers, she glanced at Duncan in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNot here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. Strange.\u201d She pulled her phone out, discovering she\u2019d missed Fane\u2019s text. \u201cOh. He had to wait for the monks to arrange a car. He should be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Without warning Duncan wrapped his arms around her and dropped a kiss on the tip of her nose. \u201cWe have time for a little PDA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPDA?\u201d She tilted back her head with a lift of her brows. \u201cDare I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPublic Display of Affection,\u201d he murmured, his sexy smile suddenly freezing as he glanced over her shoulders. \u201cThat guy looks familiar and not in a good way,\u201d he said, in full cop mode as he shoved a key into her hand. \u201cHere. Go back to the apartment and lock the door. I\u2019ll call when Fane gets here.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, catching sight of the barrel-chested man with dark hair slicked from his bluntly carved face. He was half hidden behind a Dumpster, peeking around the edge in a way that had been guaranteed to catch the attention of a wary cop.</p><p>Callie didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>It screamed TRAP.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Callie,\u201d Duncan muttered, his voice tense.</p><p>Knowing her companion wasn\u2019t going to back down until he was certain there was no danger to her, Callie heaved a resigned sigh.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She sent him a warning glare. \u201cBut if you let yourself get hurt, I\u2019m not going to be happy.\u201d</p><p>His answer was a gentle push toward the door and Callie heaved a resigned sigh as she reentered the building and headed the short distance to Duncan\u2019s apartment.</p><p>Halting in front of the door, she fumbled trying to fit the key into the lock. She was consumed with the knowledge that Duncan might very well be walking into danger.</p><p>He was a good cop. A great cop. But his obsessive determination to protect her made him vulnerable.</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt for a second he would put himself in danger if he thought it was necessary.</p><p>Barely capable of concentrating on the simple task of unlocking the door, Callie was oblivious to the shadow that slipped through the doorway at the far end of the hall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had no warning that the trap she\u2019d suspected was about to snap shut.</p><p>Not until a crippling pain exploded in the back of her head and the world went dark.</p><p>Waiting until Callie disappeared into the building, Duncan walked with a commanding purpose across the parking lot, his hand deliberately on his gun. If the lurker was a run-of-the-mill drug dealer he\u2019d take off. They always did when confronted by an authority figure. Duncan could call it in and get back to Callie.</p> <p>If it wasn\u2019t... well, he\u2019d dealt with scumbags before.</p><p>And the man hiding behind the Dumpster had all the earmarks of being a class A scumbag.</p><p>Halting with his back to a nearby car so no one could sneak up on him, he studied the blunt features that tugged at a distant memory.</p><p>This man had crossed his path before. Not uncommon. Duncan spent a lot of time on the streets, dealing with a lot of different people. It was rare that he didn\u2019t see someone he\u2019d encountered before. Either a criminal or a victim or just an eyewitness.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he demanded, not bothering to flash his badge. No need to make it official.</p> <p>Yet.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d the man muttered, a fine sheen of sweat on his brow.</p><p>Nerves? Guilt? Something worse? Only one way to find out.</p><p>\u201cYou have a reason for lurking in my parking lot, Tony?\u201d</p><p>Tony licked thick lips, glancing toward the apartment building. \u201cI wasn\u2019t lurking. I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWaiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cop, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have information for you.\u201d</p><p>Duncan remained wary. In his experience confidential informants didn\u2019t hide in parking lots waiting for a cop to appear.</p><p>And how the hell had he known where he lived?</p><p>Duncan covertly tightened his grip on his gun. \u201cWhat kind of information?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI heard you\u2019re looking for a necro.\u201d</p><p>Duncan sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>The man once again glanced toward the apartment building. As if looking for something.</p><p>Or someone.</p><p>\u201cWord gets around.\u201d</p><p>No. Word didn\u2019t get around. Not to low-level criminals.</p><p>Cold spikes of suspicion pierced his heart.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He angled his body so he could keep watch on the apartment building as he began to back away, his inner alarms screeching a belated warning. \u201cMeet me at the police station in half an hour and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d With an unexpected lunge, Tony grabbed Duncan\u2019s arm. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Duncan pulled his gun, pointing it between the bastard\u2019s eyes. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s dark eyes widened with fear, but he tenaciously held on. \u201cI have to tell you now.\u201d</p><p>There was a distracting flare of light as the sun reflected off the glass door of the apartment building. Turning his head, Duncan watched as it was shoved open and his heart came to a brutal halt.</p><p>Callie.</p><p>Stunned, his attention turned to the man who was carrying her limp body in the opposite direction.</p><p>Was that...</p><p>\u201cFrank,\u201d he muttered in confusion, the world moving in slow motion as he watched his longtime friend carrying Callie toward a car parked next to his own.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>Okay, Frank might have said some stupid things in a misguided need to protect Duncan, but he was a man of honor. He would never hurt an unarmed female just because he didn\u2019t like high-bloods.</p><p>Never.</p><p>So what the hell was going on?</p><p>His sluggish brain struggled for a reasonable explanation.</p><p>Had Frank found Callie collapsed and was hurrying her to the hospital?</p><p>Had he realized Callie was in danger and was trying to protect her?</p><p>Had he...</p><p>His eyes narrowed as Frank walked directly in front of a car entering the parking lot, his head never turning even when the driver gave a blast of his horn.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2014?\u201d Duncan breathed, a savage fear ripping through his heart. In that minute he realized there was more wrong with his friend than just his weird behavior. His aura was distorted.</p><p>As if the spark of life that danced around him in swirls of color had been sucked dry to leave behind an empty soul.</p><p>He was... a walking cadaver. There was no other explanation. \u201cShit.\u201d Yanking his arm free from Tony\u2019s grasp, he charged across the parking lot, bellowing at the top of his lungs. \u201cCallie.\u201d</p><p>Focused on reaching Frank before he could put Callie in the car and disappear, Duncan dismissed Tony from his thoughts. The thug had clearly been nothing more than a distraction. He would deal with him once Callie was safe.</p><p>But with a speed that was shocking for a man with his bulk, Tony bulldozed into Duncan from behind, knocking him to the ground.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Duncan growled, swinging his arm backward to hit Tony in the side of his head with the butt of his gun.</p><p>The man cursed, but grimly held on, his harsh grunts filling the air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d he panted. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Struggling to dislodge the man, Duncan managed to swivel around far enough to point the gun between his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet me go or I\u2019ll blow your brains out.\u201d</p><p>The man laughed.</p><p>Actually laughed.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. It will be a relief to the fate waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>There was nothing worse than a perp with a death wish.</p><p>Especially when that perp had information he might need.</p><p>Hissing with frustration, he resisted the desire to squeeze the trigger and instead pulled back to whack him again with the butt of the gun.</p><p>There was a dull crack as Tony\u2019s skull fractured and a gash appeared in the middle of his forehead, but insanely he continued to hold on.</p><p>Duncan growled in frustration. Enough. He was done screwing around.</p><p>Pressing his finger on the trigger, he was a breath from shooting Tony when his dark eyes crossed and the buffoon at last slumped to the side.</p><p>With a groan Duncan heaved the dead weight off him and surged to his feet.</p><p>His gaze desperately scanned the parking lot, terror gripping his heart as he caught sight of a silver car with Frank behind the wheel hurtling in his direction.</p><p>Callie...</p><p>She had to be in the car.</p><p>Raising his gun, he fired directly at the windshield, holding his ground even as the car picked up speed, clearly determined to run him over.</p><p>No. Christ, no.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>Emptying his gun, he cursed as he realized the bullets were worthless against Frank. It was as if his corpse simply absorbed the damage and reformed.</p><p>Tossing aside the weapon, Duncan braced himself. He would jump onto the hood of the car and crawl through the shattered windshield.</p><p>Almost as if sensing Duncan\u2019s intention, Frank swerved at the last minute, taking the car out of reach.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>With a superhuman effort, Duncan lunged toward the car, his fingertips grasping the handle of the back door. Desperately he tried to keep pace as he wrenched on the handle, his shoulder twisting out of joint when Frank whipped the car sharply to the left.</p><p>The momentum of the car yanked him off his feet and he lost his grip on the handle as he went flying backward. Still airborne, he clipped his temple on the back bumper, gouging a deep wound before he was flung to the pavement.</p><p>Roaring in pained fury, he forced himself to his knees, not even noticing the body of Tony lying just feet away. Not until a sluggish stream of blood ran down the pavement to pool directly in front of him.</p><p>Oh... hell.</p><p>Frank hadn\u2019t been swerving to avoid Duncan.</p><p>He\u2019d been running over the unconscious Tony.</p><p>Leave no accomplice behind ... That was obviously the motto of the unknown necro.</p><p>At least not one who could talk.</p><p>And this one most certainly wouldn\u2019t be talking.</p><p>With a shudder, Duncan studied the mutilated body. He didn\u2019t need a doctor to tell him that Tony was dead. Not only had the front tires crushed his chest, but the back tires had nearly decapitated him.</p><p>Any information they could have got about where Frank was taking Callie or even the plans of the necromancer was gone.</p><p>The inane thoughts whizzed through his head even as he stumbled to his feet, running toward the curb.</p><p>Too late, too late, too late ...</p><p>The damning words were playing through his mind as a heavy black truck screeched to a halt in front of him and Fane was shoving open the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Callie?\u201d he growled.</p><p>The world was spinning in a funny way, but Duncan grimly struggled to answer. \u201cThey have her,\u201d he managed to rasp, wondering why the side of his face felt damp.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t started to rain when he wasn\u2019t paying attention, had it?</p><p>Lifting his hand, he touched the warm stickiness, pulling his fingers back to reveal them coated in red.</p><p>Not rain. Blood.</p><p>Then it came to him.</p><p>Oh yeah.</p><p>Head vs. Bumper.</p><p>Head loses.</p><p>That was his last semicoherent thought before collapsing in Fane\u2019s arms.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Callie cautiously opened her eyes and glanced around.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what she expected.</p><p>A crypt? A dungeon? A spooky castle complete with Renfield?</p><p>Instead she discovered she was in a high-tech lab.</p><p>Somehow, the sight wasn\u2019t remotely reassuring.</p><p>With all the gleaming metal and clinical white it made her think of a morgue for a creepy modern day Frankenstein.</p><p>Climbing off the stainless steel gurney she\u2019d been lying on, Callie forced herself to take slow steady breaths as her gaze skimmed around the large room.</p><p>Steel cabinets. A long counter with a sink. White tiled floor and a high ceiling with fluorescent lights. Along the far wall were a line of walk-in coolers that she had no intention of investigating.</p><p>No windows.</p><p>One door that she swiftly discovered was locked.</p><p>Which severely limited her avenues of escape.</p><p>Accepting she was stuck for now, Callie turned her search to finding a weapon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t truly believe there would be something just lying around that could destroy a powerful necromancer. That only happened in B-rated movies.</p><p>But pulling open the cabinets and rifling through the drawers kept her from giving in to the panic that pounded through her.</p><p>What good did it do to agonize over whether Duncan had been hurt? Or worse?</p> <p>Or to dwell on her hideous fate if she didn\u2019t manage to escape?</p><p>She was rummaging through the last drawer when a faint scent of perfume had her whirling around to discover a woman standing in the middle of the room.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard a sound. Not the sound of a door opening or closing. Or the tap of four-inch heels on the tiled floor.</p><p>Had she just appeared from thin air?</p> <p>Unnerved, Callie studied the woman. She was beautiful with her long red hair and emerald green eyes. And expensive. The designer silver Dior gown and the Christian Louboutin shoes cost more than Callie\u2019s entire wardrobe and no doubt had been purchased at the chichi dress salon on the Plaza.</p><p>Then her gaze lifted back to the delicate face and her breath was wrenched from her lungs.</p><p>The sketch of the Russian mystic she\u2019d seen in the secret monastery vault had been faded, but there was no mistaking the resemblance to this woman.</p><p>Which meant she was Lord Zakhar\u2019s accomplice. The witch who was willing to sacrifice children for power.</p><p>The female stepped forward, her gaze trained on Callie with a strange fascination.</p><p>Not that her fascination was the only thing strange about the woman.</p> <p>There was something ... off.</p><p>Callie couldn\u2019t put her finger on it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t anything tangible.</p><p>Just a sensation that the woman was blurred around the edges, as if she were slightly out of focus.</p><p>It was weird as hell and only intensified Callie\u2019s terror.</p><p>\u201cHello, Callie,\u201d the female purred, her lips curving in a smile that didn\u2019t reach her eyes.</p><p>Callie grimaced. It skeeved her out that the woman knew her name.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p> <p>The woman lifted her brows, as if surprised by the question. \u201cDo you really have to ask?\u201d</p><p>Callie frowned, wrapping her arms around her shivering body. Why was it suddenly so cold?</p><p>\u201cHave we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong, long ago. I\u2019m Anya,\u201d the woman answered, her voice laced with a faint accent. \u201cYour mother.\u201d</p><p>Callie stumbled back, painfully smacking a shoulder on a steel cabinet as a shocked horror sliced through her heart.</p><p>It was stupid.</p><p>She was being held prisoner by a crazed necromancer, she didn\u2019t know if Duncan was alive or dead, and the future of the world might very well be going to hell.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>But in this moment, nothing was more disturbing than the thought that she might actually be the daughter of this... this woman.</p><p>A witch who would make humans ill just for profit. And sacrifice the innocent for power.</p><p>It made her stomach turn.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Callie shook her head in repudiation. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t blind, Callie. You have to see the resemblance,\u201d Anya ruthlessly pressed, taking a step toward Callie to grasp her chin. \u201cThe hair. The lips.\u201d There was a pause as the emerald eyes inspected Callie\u2019s features. \u201cThe cheekbones and eyes are your father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Callie nearly shrieked at the feel of icy fingers against her skin.</p><p>It felt so wrong.</p><p>Evil.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t touch me,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>Anya dropped her hand, but she remained standing way too close. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about you over the years. Wondering what you were like.\u201d</p><p>With a sense of idiotic relief, Callie pounced on the outrageous claim. \u201cIf you were truly my mother then you would know that I was abandoned in a Dumpster,\u201d she hissed. \u201cIf my mother thought about me at all over the years, it would have been with the belief I was dead.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled.</p><p>Well, her lips stretched into what Callie assumed was supposed to be a smile.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>\u201cYou think you were intended to die?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the usual reason you toss a baby in the trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted you dead, you would be dead,\u201d Anya stated, the sheer lack of apology undermining Callie\u2019s certainty that she couldn\u2019t possibly be her mother.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t the woman be pretending regret if she was trying to convince Callie she was telling the truth?</p><p>Oh... god.</p><p>Her stomach heaved.</p><p>\u201cThen why throw me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time you were born Valhalla had been created and the Mave had sent out word to locate all high-blood babies so they could be tested. The Master of Gifts had far too many spies spread around the world to risk drawing attention to ourselves.\u201d The woman shrugged. \u201cIt became obvious the most convenient place to hide you was at Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>Convenient?</p><p>She\u2019d been tossed into a Dumpster because it was more convenient?</p><p>Tears pricked in the back of her eyes.</p><p>There were a thousand more important questions that had to be asked. Vital information that might make the difference in halting the necromancer if she managed to escape.</p><p>But after a lifetime of claiming she didn\u2019t give a shit who her real parents might be, she was suddenly overwhelmed with the need to know more.</p><p>\u201cIf I was so much trouble wouldn\u2019t it have made more sense not to have a child at all?\u201d</p><p>Something darkened the emerald eyes. Not precisely an emotion. More of an echo of an emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou were necessary.\u201d</p><p>A bad, bad feeling settled in the pit of Callie\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s lips parted, but before she could speak, the door to the lab was thrust open and Callie was face to face with the necromancer.</p><p>Her heart stuttered, missing one beat and then two, before kicking back into gear so it could race out of control.</p><p>He was just as she remembered from Leah\u2019s mind.</p><p>Tall and slender with his silver hair pulled from his bronzed, astonishingly beautiful face and his diamond eyes shimmering with a frigid amusement.</p><p>This time, however he was wearing an immaculate black suit instead of the robe. And the power that had been crushing at a distance was off the charts when he was up-close and personal.</p><p>He strolled to stand beside Anya, his fingers lifting to stroke down the woman\u2019s unnaturally pale face.</p><p>\u201cAh. I see that you\u2019ve met your mother,\u201d he drawled, his gaze never straying from Callie. \u201cHow charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYes... me.\u201d He continued to stroke Anya\u2019s cheek despite the woman\u2019s lack of response. In fact, the minute he\u2019d entered the room Anya had shut down like someone had flicked a switch. She was there, but no one was home. \u201cI suppose I should introduce myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Callie shivered, her attention returning to the man who was looking her over with a cold detachment. \u201cYou\u2019re Lord Zakhar.\u201d She managed an edge of disdain. Yay, for her. \u201cRussian aristocrat and psychopath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd father.\u201d</p><p>Her brief spurt of defiance was demolished by the two simple words.</p><p>Father.</p><p>A hysterical laugh lodged in her throat, threatening to choke her.</p><p>Well, hell.</p><p>Of course he was her father.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t bad enough that she\u2019d been abandoned in a Dumpster when she was a baby? Or that Boggs had terrified her with vague threats of her future the day she graduated ? Or that her mother was a cold-blooded killer?</p><p>Now her father had to be a crazed necromancer who abused the dead and was no doubt plotting some nefarious scheme.</p><p>Realizing that she was on the edge of hysteria, Callie grimly tried to concentrate on more important matters. So her parents were raving, homicidal lunatics. She could indulge in a nervous breakdown if she managed to survive.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, she considered the best way to discover just what her father planned.</p><p>With his power, she couldn\u2019t force him.</p><p>But there was an unmistakable arrogance chiseled into his beautiful features that suggested he would be eager to brag about his cleverness.</p><p>\u201cSo why the belated family reunion?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt was time,\u201d he murmured, a cold smile touching his lips as he glanced toward the woman at his side. \u201cWasn\u2019t it, dear Anya?\u201d</p><p>The witch remained unmoving, her gaze locked on the far wall.</p><p>Callie grimaced. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>The diamond gaze shifted back to Callie. \u201cShe recently made the transition to another plane of existence.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s breath tangled in her throat. \u201cIs she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead? Yes,\u201d he purred. \u201cMagnificent, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Magnificent?</p><p>Callie\u2019s skin crawled as she took in the woman who claimed to be her mother. She looked pale, and still oddly blurred around the edges, but otherwise ... perfect.</p><p>There was no way to tell she was a corpse.</p><p>\u201cYou sick bastard,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Lord Zakhar thinned his lips, as if annoyed by Callie\u2019s response. \u201cYou, of all people, should appreciate what I have accomplished,\u201d he berated in chilly tones.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to fake her revulsion.</p><p>Everything about this was wrong.</p><p>Perverted.</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly is it you\u2019ve accomplished beyond killing my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve opened the gates to the underworld.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in genuine confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He ran a tender hand down Anya\u2019s long red hair. \u201cHer body is dead, but her soul remains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d Callie\u2019s gut twisted with horror. It was one thing to abuse an empty shell of a body, but to imprison a person\u2019s soul... it was monstrous. \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he smoothly claimed, a vast, all-consuming emptiness briefly flaring through the diamond eyes. \u201cA creator who will soon have an entire army of followers who are indestructible and utterly loyal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze jerked back to her father\u2019s arrogant face.</p><p>She tried to tell herself that he was just a blowhard.</p><p>A megalomaniac who was lost in his delusions of grandeur.</p> <p>But there was nothing delusional about the dead woman standing obediently next to him. Or the pulsing power that filled the air with a suffocating chill.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if he could raise an army, but it was obvious he could control the dead.</p><p>She had to find some way to stop him.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t noticed he\u2019d been hiding a hand behind his back until he held it out to reveal a battered golden goblet.</p> <p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cA cup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chalice,\u201d he corrected in chiding tones. \u201cIt was made from the magic of necromancers. True necromancers like us, not the pathetic diviners who cower behind their Sentinels.\u201d</p><p>On the point of informing him that she wasn\u2019t anything like him, Callie was distracted by the small cut on his inner wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPower demands a sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the source of my life force.\u201d He lifted his arm, revealing the bead of blood that appeared from the wound only to disappear. \u201cThe chalice opens the doorway, but it\u2019s the blood that controls my children.\u201d</p><p>Callie frowned.</p><p>Was the chalice absorbing his blood?</p><p>It seemed like the most logical explanation in a world that had gone insane.</p><p>\u201cEach... child takes a part of your life force?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He lowered his arm, his gaze trained on her pale face. \u201cWhich is why you were created, dear Callie.\u201d</p> <p>She flinched.</p><p>A part of her wanted to slap her hands over her ears. Yeah, it was childish, but there was only so much a poor girl could take. And she\u2019d had more than her share of shocks over the past half hour, thank you very much.</p><p>Unfortunately, a larger part understood there was no more running, no more hiding from her destiny.</p><p>This was what Boggs had warned of all those years ago. She knew it in the very depths of her soul.</p><p>All she could do was hope that she was strong enough to prevent her father from using her in his quest to ... Wait, she still didn\u2019t know what his actual quest was.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, why I was created?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo take my rightful place I must have an army, but unlike my predecessor, I have no intention of becoming a martyr.\u201d He glanced toward the small wound on his wrist before his eyes lifted to meet her wary gaze. \u201cIt will be your blood that is sacrificed.\u201d</p><p>It was exactly what she expected, but that didn\u2019t halt the black wave of dread that threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p>With an effort she forced back her despair, instinctively tucking her hands behind her back. As if that would stop the lunatic.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want to become your sacrifice?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>Her father smiled with cold indifference.</p><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t optional, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Duncan paced the inner garden of Valhalla, his seething impatience making it impossible for him to stand still.</p><p>He\u2019d awoken two hours ago with his head aching and his shoulder on fire, but ignoring the young healer who\u2019d insisted he remain in bed, he\u2019d gone in search of the Mave.</p><p>He had to get back to Kansas City.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t care who he had to piss off to get there.</p><p>Unfortunately the Mave had been impossible to track down and Fane had refused to allow him to leave, claiming they were doing everything possible to locate Callie.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Duncan doubted the Sentinel\u2019s word; Fane would lay down his life to rescue Callie. But being forced to pace the floor while Callie was in danger was nothing short of torture.</p><p>Trying to pass the time without doing something crazy that would get himself locked in the dungeons, Duncan had called his chief to explain to her why there was a dead body in the parking lot of his apartment building.</p><p>And, oh yeah, to warn her that her most trusted coroner was not only dead, but now under the control of Lord Zakhar.</p><p>His heart squeezed at the memory of Molinari\u2019s shocked grief, but he refused to give in to his own seething emotions. He would mourn Frank once Callie was safe.</p><p>Until then... he was the enemy.</p><p>Pausing long enough to slam his fist into a marble fountain, he abruptly stiffened, but not in pain.</p><p>Someone had entered the garden.</p><p>Spinning around, he watched as Fane stepped from behind a trimmed hedge, his tattooed face as hard as granite.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about damned time,\u201d Duncan growled, stomping his way through the flower beds to stand in front of the Sentinel. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Mave?\u201d</p><p>Folding his arms over his bare chest, Fane met Duncan\u2019s fierce scowl with a shuttered expression and said, \u201cShe\u2019s called together the witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hopes they can combine their powers to locate Callie.\u201d</p><p>Duncan narrowed his gaze. He knew jack-squat about witches and their powers. \u201cWhat are the odds they can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough.\u201d Fane gave a jerk of his head. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Duncan followed the man out of the garden and into a narrow hall. Then, halting in front of a seemingly blank wall, he placed his hand flat against a small scanner that was hidden in a potted plant.</p><p>The wall slid open with a soft hiss, revealing an elevator that was lined with steel and high-tech security alarms.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Duncan muttered. \u201cThe Batcave?\u201d</p><p>Fane shoved him into the elevator and pushed the one button on the control panel. \u201cTo meet with the Tagos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Duncan snapped, watching the door slide close in frustration. \u201cWe\u2019ve wasted enough time. We should be out searching for Callie.\u201d</p><p>Fane leaned against the smooth wall as they headed downward at heart-stopping speed. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Well, that was the question, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>If Duncan had so much as a fucking hint where the necromancer was keeping Callie, there wasn\u2019t a force in nature that could keep him at Valhalla. He muttered a curse.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have some sort of mystical bond with her?\u201d he challenged his companion.</p><p>Fane\u2019s stony expression never altered, but there was no mistaking the heat boiling from his massive body. The Sentinel was as close to the edge as Duncan.</p><p>\u201cI can sense she\u2019s still alive, but there\u2019s something cloaking our bond,\u201d he admitted in stark tones.</p><p>\u201cThe necromancer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The elevator came to a sudden halt, the door sliding silently open.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Duncan snarled as he stepped out of the small cubical. \u201cJust perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour frustration serves no purpose, cop,\u201d a deep male voice chided.</p><p>Belatedly realizing that he\u2019d stepped directly into a huge office, Duncan came to an abrupt halt.</p><p>Yow.</p><p>He was accustomed to the cramped police station with outdated equipment and shitty furniture.</p><p>This... this was a cop\u2019s wet dream.</p><p>A long, brightly lit room with a state of the art computer system and heavy wooden furniture that was spaced far enough apart to give a person privacy. On the far wall was a line of monitors that hinted at surveillance equipment that could rival the Pentagon.</p><p>Hell, he was fairly sure that some of those monitors were connected to government satellites. Maybe the high-bloods had their own satellites.</p><p>On another wall there were several doors that were closed and monitored with motion and heat sensors, making Duncan wonder what kind of secrets were lurking just out of sight.</p><p>Military grade weapons?</p><p>Super heroes?</p><p>Elvis?</p><p>Shaking his head, Duncan turned his attention to the man standing in the center of the room.</p><p>Wolfe, the leader of the Sentinels.</p><p>There could be no doubt.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have the tattoos or bulging muscles of Fane.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even wear a symbol of his authority.</p><p>But there was an unmistakable authority stamped onto the dark, exotic features that were framed by glossy dark hair that was touched with a startling streak of silver. And a predatory power in the lean body that was covered by a pair of black jeans and white tee stretched tight over a broad chest.</p><p>His feet were encased in a pair of heavy shit-kickers and spread wide, his hands planted on his hips as he regarded Duncan with a suspicious glare.</p><p>Or as Duncan\u2019s pa would say \u201cgiving him the stink-eye.\u201d</p><p>Any other time, Duncan might have been intimidated. Wolfe was the kind of guy who could daunt anyone. But right now he was consumed by his fear for Callie and in no mood for a pissing match.</p><p>\u201cYou think I should be satisfied to sit around here with my thumb stuck up my ass?\u201d he rasped, giving his own version of the stink-eye.</p><p>\u201cMind your manners, cop, or you\u2019ll have something besides your thumb stuck up your ass,\u201d a new voice growled.</p><p>Hissing in shock, Duncan turned his head to watch two men step out of the shadows. Christ. He would have sworn on his favorite Sig Sauer that they hadn\u2019t been there a second ago.</p><p>So did they use a hidden entrance?</p><p>Or could they cloak themselves?</p><p>Smiling at his shock, the speaker halted next to Wolfe, looking every inch as dangerous as his Tagos.</p><p>Oh, he made a pretense of being civilized. He had his dark hair that was threaded with hints of autumn fire cut short and his lean body was attired in a blue silk shirt and black chinos.</p><p>His lean face was perfectly constructed with a wide brow and narrow nose. And while he was too masculine to be traditionally handsome, he had the sort of \u201ctall, dark, and broody\u201d looks that made women swoon.</p><p>His partner, on the other hand, had the beauty of an angel.</p><p>His features were delicate with a mop of light brown hair with honey highlights. And his eyes... in the bright light they shimmered a perfect gold.</p><p>No doubt he liked being dismissed as a lightweight, but Duncan didn\u2019t miss the muscles honed to lean perfection beneath his casual T-shirt and faded jeans, and the ruthless willingness to kill that simmered deep in the gold eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunter Sentinels.</p><p>Duncan resisted the urge to grab his gun as the angel-looking Sentinel gave a snort.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d listen to him, cop,\u201d he warned. \u201cThat size sixteen boot does some damage.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan shifted until he could glance toward Fane, who\u2019d halted just behind him. \u201cFriends of yours?\u201d</p><p>Fane pointed toward the silk and chino man. \u201cNiko.\u201d His finger turned toward the angel. \u201cArel.\u201d He continued on to the dark-haired bad-ass. \u201cAnd Wolfe.\u201d The finger shifted toward Duncan. \u201cThis is O\u2019Conner.\u201d</p><p>Niko narrowed his gaze, his expression one of suspicion. \u201cI thought he was human.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe smiled without humor. \u201cHe\u2019s been fooling a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>Duncan made a sound of disgust. How the hell had he ever thought his ability to see auras was a secret? Every Sentinel in the damned world could tell he wasn\u2019t human.</p> <p>\u201cIs this meeting about Callie or just to bust my balls?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cThis meeting is for Sentinels,\u201d Wolfe answered, his words slow and deliberate. \u201cYou\u2019ve been allowed to sit in because Fane is convinced of your loyalty to Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if I\u2019ll do anything to rescue her, the answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Wolfe prodded.</p><p>Duncan scowled. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>The man studied him for a long minute, his gaze seeming to strip Duncan to his soul. And maybe he could. Sentinels were proving to have a surprising range of talents.</p> <p>\u201cYou can be a human cop or you can be a Sentinel,\u201d Wolfe finally said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be both.\u201d</p><p>Ah.</p><p>Duncan had known the choice was coming.</p><p>From the minute he\u2019d committed himself to a relationship with Callie it had been obvious that they couldn\u2019t exist in two different worlds.</p><p>Hell, he didn\u2019t want to exist in different worlds.</p><p>Now he didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m a Sentinel,\u201d he said, astonished at how right the words felt. As if a missing puzzle piece deep inside him had just fallen into place. Disturbed by the sensation, he gave a strained laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t have to get tattooed, do I?\u201d</p><p>Fane rolled his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t special enough to get tattooed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There\u2019ll be an initiation,\u201d Arel promised. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grimaced. The mind boggled at what these men might consider an initiation. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe glanced toward Fane. \u201cTell me what you learned in Florida.\u201d</p><p>Duncan abruptly recalled that Fane had spent the previous night searching for information on the coin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d the guardian admitted. \u201cThe monk warned me that we had to keep the necromancer from opening the pathway to the underworld.\u201d</p><p>Duncan recalled Hektor\u2019s warning. Hadn\u2019t he said something about a pathway to the underworld?</p><p>\u201cAnd if we\u2019re too late?\u201d Wolfe asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly an obscure ritual will close it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he happen to know the obscure ritual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe swore beneath his breath. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Fane didn\u2019t look any happier than his leader, but with a shrug he nodded toward the wall of monitors. \u201cWhat have you done here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have hunters trying to find Callie\u2019s scent and the techs are working on tracing her phone,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cI\u2019ve also contacted the monasteries and halted all travel.\u201d</p><p>Without warning Fane turned his attention to Duncan. \u201cCop?\u201d</p><p>Three pairs of eyes were trained on him, and Duncan sensed it was his first test.</p><p>Unconsciously he squared his shoulders, speaking directly to Wolfe. \u201cI spoke with the chief and she has an APB out on Frank,\u201d he said, not surprised when the big, tough Sentinels shuddered. No one wanted to think about how many corpses might be wandering the streets of Kansas City. \u201cThey\u2019re also tracing the GPS on his car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Wolfe asked.</p><p>Duncan shook his head. \u201cNot yet. His car was parked at his house, but he wasn\u2019t...\u201d Duncan forgot what he was going to say as he sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>Fane stepped directly in front of him, the heat of his body a tangible force. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank was driving a silver car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a silver car,\u201d Duncan muttered, rubbing the back of his neck as he shifted through the information he\u2019d managed to gather over the past few days. \u201cThe dress lady said the woman arrived in a silver car. And there was a silver car spotted on Calso\u2019s street just before his murder. It has to belong to the necro.\u201d</p><p>Fane scowled. \u201cIs that supposed to make sense?\u201d</p><p>Duncan glanced toward Wolfe, a near painful urgency pounding through his veins.</p><p>\u201cCan your techs tap into government databases?\u201d</p><p>The Tagos was on instant guard, his dark eyes narrowing in warning. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Duncan waved an impatient hand. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell anyone about any... supplementary methods you have to protect high-bloods.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe hesitated before giving a nod. \u201cFine. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to trace a license plate\u201d.</p><p>Fane made a sound of surprise. \u201cYou got the number?\u201d</p><p>Duncan unconsciously touched the bandage that covered his healing wound on his temple. \u201cJust the last three as I flew by,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cBut it might be enough to get a hit.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe was already spinning to head toward a distant door. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>It was the sort of mansion that made Duncan shake his head in disgust.</p><p>Who needed a faux castle with twelve bedrooms, gold-plated toilets, and a helicopter pad? Hell, all that was missing was the drawbridge.</p><p>Either a man with a bloated ego, or one who had the need to hide in plain sight.</p><p>It was amazing how many top drug lords lived behind the high fences of gated communities, mixing with the neighbors as if he was just another tax-paying citizen.</p><p>Tonight, however, Duncan didn\u2019t give a shit about the Olympic-sized pool or the outdoor bar that was bigger than his apartment. His only interest was standing poised at the narrow back gate as they waited for Niko to return from his scouting of the grounds.</p><p>\u201cCop\u2014\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned his head to glare at Wolfe, who stood with the silent Fane and Arel just a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even start,\u201d he warned in low, fierce tones. \u201cI\u2019m going in.\u201d</p><p>The Tagos arched a brow. \u201cYour chief isn\u2019t going to be happy if she finds out you did an illegal B and E.\u201d</p><p>Duncan snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of things that wouldn\u2019t make my chief happy if she knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere might be hope for him yet,\u201d Arel murmured with a cocky smile.</p><p>They all stiffened as there was a soft rush of air as Niko leaped over the high fence, landing with a silence that was terrifying.</p><p>Duncan had heard all the stories about Sentinels.</p><p>They were faster, stronger, with superior senses. And he\u2019d even known he possessed a few of the qualities, even if he\u2019d never wanted to admit it.</p><p>But to actually see them in action...</p><p>He grimaced. The humans would be far less complacent if they truly knew the sheer extent of the high-bloods\u2019 powers. Which was no doubt why the Sentinels had gone to such trouble to remain hidden in a shroud of mystery.</p><p>Straightening, Niko slid through the shadows to stand directly before them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a muting spell that makes it impossible to sense what\u2019s inside.\u201d</p><p>Fane was already moving. \u201cI\u2019ll do a sweep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Duncan announced, the biting urgency thundering through him making him twitchy as hell.</p><p>\u201cHold on, Rambo.\u201d Wolfe grabbed his arm. \u201cFane\u2019s the only one who can trigger the spells without killing us all.\u201d</p><p>Duncan was forced to watch as Fane smoothly vaulted over the fence and disappeared.</p><p>He wanted to argue. Hell, he wanted to pull his gun and start shooting things. Beginning with the man holding him in a ruthless grip.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t completely insane.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>He didn\u2019t possess Fane\u2019s protective tattoos or his magical ability to sense and destroy spells. He\u2019d only be a liability if he went charging in like a bull in a china cabinet.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered in frustration.</p><p>Wolfe released his arm, but his lean face remained hard with an undefinable emotion. \u201cCallie is special to all of us.\u201d</p><p>Duncan scowled at the Tagos. \u201cDo you have a point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust listen.\u201d</p><p>Duncan\u2019s scowl deepened. Arrogant bastard. Unfortunately, he was an arrogant bastard that Callie needed if they were going to rescue her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d he managed between gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhen Callie was brought to Valhalla she was just a tiny scrap of a thing with eyes like jewels and a smile that could melt the hardest heart,\u201d Wolfe said, a hint of affection softening the cruel curve of his mouth. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t one of us who didn\u2019t fall under her spell.\u201d</p><p>Duncan could easily picture Callie as a tiny baby, slaying the hearts of the most cynical warriors. Who wouldn\u2019t look into those magnificent eyes and fall in love?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you understand that we\u2019ll lay down our lives to keep her from being hurt.\u201d</p><p>A command, not a question.</p><p>Duncan narrowed his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re not discussing the necromancer, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accept your help in rescuing Callie. Hell, I\u2019d accept the help of Satan if I thought it was necessary,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cBut trust is earned when it comes to Callie\u2019s fragile heart.\u201d</p><p>Duncan took a step forward, his hands clenched at his side.</p><p>Since becoming a cop he\u2019d learned not to pick a fight he couldn\u2019t win. But this was too important to back down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Sentinels considered Callie theirs to protect. They weren\u2019t going to give him a place at her side.</p><p>He had to claim the right.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your concern, but Callie\u2019s trust is all that matters to me,\u201d he said, his expression warning he wasn\u2019t looking for a debate on the issue. \u201cI intend to devote my life to making her happy. With or without your approval.\u201d</p> <p>Arel snorted. \u201cEither he\u2019s a man with a death wish or a man in love.\u201d</p><p>Duncan never allowed his gaze to waver from Wolfe\u2019s lean face. You never took your eye off a predator.</p><p>Then the tension was shattered by a low whistle near the gate.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Fane,\u201d Wolfe said, rapidly taking charge as he moved to shove open the gate, gesturing for the auburn-haired hunter to go first.</p><p>Duncan tried to charge forward, only to be halted once again by Wolfe\u2019s hand grasping his upper arm.</p> <p>The Tagos ignored Duncan\u2019s string of curses as he watched his fellow Sentinel trot across the manicured yard, heading toward the front of the house, only to circle toward the back.</p><p>At last the man came to a halt, tilting back his head as if he was sniffing the air.</p><p>\u201cNiko?\u201d Wolfe prompted.</p><p>\u201cI have her trail,\u201d the man announced, heading toward the back terrace.</p><p>Wolfe released his grip and Duncan was in swift pursuit of Niko as he climbed the shallow steps and entered the house through a back door. Duncan didn\u2019t know if it had been locked or not, and he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t here as a cop. He was here as a man desperate to find the woman he loved.</p> <p>Hold on, Callie. Hold on... he silently urged.</p><p>They moved through a large kitchen, Niko in the lead followed by Duncan and then Wolfe. Fane and Arel brought up the rear, both turned to the side to make sure there were no surprises lurking in the dark.</p><p>Niko led them out of the kitchen and down a short hallway, halting when they came to a dead end.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Duncan frowned as Wolfe stepped past him, lifting his leg to smash his massive foot through the paneling.</p><p>Ah. A secret doorway.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Every wicked villain had one, didn\u2019t he?</p> <p>And now that Duncan took the time to think about it, he could actually sense the emptiness that marked the opening behind the paneling. Perhaps with training he could ...</p><p>He gave a shake of his head at his inane thoughts, ducking as the splintered wood flew through the air.</p><p>Four more kicks and Wolfe had the hole large enough for Niko to squeeze through. Wolfe was next, but as Duncan moved to follow, he heard Fane give a low growl.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Duncan turned back, pulling his gun and clicking off the safety.</p><p>\u201cThe necro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot.\u201d</p><p>A chill of warning inched down Duncan\u2019s spine as he walked to stand at Fane\u2019s side. For a minute he couldn\u2019t see a damned thing in the darkness. Then a shadow shifted forward, stepping into a small shaft of moonlight.</p><p>\u201cFrank,\u201d Duncan breathed, more resigned than shocked. \u201cI\u2019ll distract him. Keep looking for Callie.\u201d</p><p>Fane shifted to stand directly in front of him. \u201cCop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The tattooed face was stark with the brutal strain of knowing Callie was in danger.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your friend anymore.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grimaced, ignoring the ache in the center of his chest.</p><p>Frank was dead.</p><p>This... thing that was approaching was a creation of the same necromancer that had stolen the woman he loved.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t hesitate to send it to the grave. Always assuming he could figure out how.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He jerked his head toward the opening in the wall. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>Obviously reading the grim determination etched on his face, the Sentinel gave a sharp nod and slipped past Duncan.</p><p>Alone with his onetime friend, Duncan shifted to make sure he had plenty of room to fight.</p><p>And there was going to be a fight.</p><p>No doubt about that.</p><p>The only question was whether he was going to survive.</p><p>Halting a few feet from Duncan, the zombie regarded him with a blank expression, although there was nothing blank about the dark eyes.</p><p>They were filled with... awareness.</p><p>Duncan shuddered, his fingers tightening on the gun. It was pure instinct. He already knew it was a waste of bullets to shoot the bastard.</p><p>Besides, for now all he cared about was distracting Frank long enough for the Sentinels to find Callie and kill the necromancer.</p><p>\u201cHey, amigo,\u201d he said, a queasy sensation joining the stark fear in the pit of his stomach. Logically he understood this wasn\u2019t Frank. But shit... he looked like the man who\u2019d taken him under his wing when he left the academy. The one who\u2019d taught him to filet a catfish. And the one who\u2019d taken him to a strip joint to get blotto the night his divorce was finalized. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d</p><p>The creature smiled. \u201cO\u2019Conner.\u201d</p><p>Duncan flinched. Christ. Did the thing truly remember him?</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right\u201d He forced himself to keep talking. If he stopped to think, he would be overwhelmed by the sheer horror of the situation. \u201cI\u2019m looking for my friend Callie. Have you seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Duncan sucked in a sharp breath. Gone? Could it be true?</p><p>He had no idea if Frank was lucid enough to know what was going on around him.</p><p>\u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the master.\u201d</p><p>Duncan growled at the mention of the necromancer, but he kept his attention focused on Callie.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I got that she\u2019s with the... master.\u201d He forced the word past his lips. \u201cBut where did they go?\u201d</p><p>Frank hesitated, as if it took a minute to process the question.</p><p>Was he mentally connected with Lord Zakhar?</p><p>Not that it mattered.</p><p>The necromancer had to know he was being hunted by every Sentinel in Valhalla.</p><p>At last Frank spoke. \u201cTo raise an army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn army?\u201d Of zombies? Duncan shoved aside the horrifying thought. Nothing mattered but finding Callie. \u201cIn Kansas City?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere close by?\u201d</p><p>A ripple of emotion sluggishly flowed over Frank\u2019s face. Anger. Frustration. Regret?</p><p>\u201cYou will soon discover.\u201d</p><p>A vague answer that told Duncan nothing. Did he mean that he didn\u2019t know? Or had he been commanded not to say?</p><p>Fine. He was trained in interrogation. If you couldn\u2019t get the answer you wanted from a direct approach, you came at it from another angle.</p><p>\u201cHow can Callie raise an army?\u201d</p><p>Frank smiled and Duncan shuddered. It was creepy as hell.</p><p>\u201cShe is to be the sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Sacrifice?</p><p>Duncan snapped.</p><p>Launching forward, he grabbed the front of his onetime friend\u2019s polo shirt, shoving the barrel of his gun beneath his chin.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard. Tell me where she is,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Frank blinked, ignoring the gun.</p><p>Or maybe he just didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Dead was dead, after all.</p><p>Then, without warning, he tilted back his dark head to release a shrill burst of laughter.</p><p>Duncan made a sound of horror.</p><p>If the smile was creepy, his laughter was downright hair-raising.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you, O\u2019Conner,\u201d Frank explained.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill you.\u201d</p><p>His disturbing smile remained intact even as he shoved his hands against Duncan\u2019s chest and sent him flying against the wall with enough force to rattle his teeth.</p><p>Surging back to his feet, Duncan squeezed off two shots, hitting Frank directly between the eyes. The zombie never halted as he moved forward, the bullet holes closing with magical ease.</p><p>Holy... shit.</p><p>Duncan shoved his gun back in his holster. No sense in wasting bullets. Not when there might be other enemies lurking in the dark. Enemies that might actually die from a gunshot wound.</p><p>Besides, he was pissed-off, frustrated, and overwhelmed with terror for Callie.</p><p>A good old-fashioned beat down was just what he needed.</p><p>Waiting for Frank to take another step forward, Duncan swung his fist directly at the man\u2019s chin, connecting with a satisfying crunch of bone.</p><p>Frank stumbled back, but swiftly recovering his balance, he resumed his stoic march toward Duncan.</p><p>Reaching behind him, Duncan grabbed a vase off a nearby table, tossing it at the zombie at the same time he kicked out with his foot.</p><p>The vase shattered against Frank\u2019s face and his kick caught him in the middle of his stomach. But once again he barely recoiled before he took a last step to stand directly before Duncan.</p><p>And then the fun began.</p><p>Managing to dodge the first punch, Duncan couldn\u2019t avoid the uppercut that banged his head against the wall and knocked him loopy. Next came the kick to the knee that made him stumble to the side, just in time to move in the path of the right hook.</p><p>Thankfully Duncan had spent his childhood being tortured by his older siblings, which meant he could not only take a beating, but could still get in a few good punches.</p><p>They might not do any good, but dammit, if he was going down, he was going down swinging.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how long he played the punching bag for his old friend, but he was seeing double when he heard Fane\u2019s voice over the ringing in his ears.</p><p>\u201cCop.\u201d</p><p>A vicious blow to his stomach doubled him over, but jerking up, he managed to clip Frank on the chin with the top of his head.</p><p>Frank lost his footing and Duncan took the opportunity to glance over his shoulder at the tattooed warrior who shoved his head through the hole in the wall.</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d he demanded of the Sentinel.</p><p>Fane gave a bleak shake of his head. \u201cGone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit.\u201d</p><p>The word had barely left his lips when Frank was on his feet and moving back in for the kill.</p><p>The bastard was nothing if not persistent.</p><p>Duncan braced for another beating, too consumed with his rage at the knowledge they\u2019d wasted hours on a wild goose chase to give a shit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But just as Frank was close enough to continue the fight, three shadows appeared from behind him to drive him to the ground.</p><p>Duncan leaped out of the path of Wolfe as he went flying past, hitting the same wall that Duncan had smashed into earlier.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get him downstairs,\u201d the Tagos muttered, jumping to his feet as he absently wiped the blood from his bottom lip.</p> <p>Duncan frowned, watching in horror as Frank pinned Arel to the floor, impervious to Niko\u2019s vicious kicks to his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a panic room we can lock him in.\u201d</p><p>Duncan shuddered. \u201cDo you think it will hold him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d the Sentinel muttered. \u201cBut it will give us a few hours to come up with a better plan.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan grimaced.</p><p>A better plan ...</p><p>Yep, that about summed it up.</p><p>Callie had heard horror stories over the years of abandoned children who\u2019d gone in search of their birth parents.</p><p>She knew one witch who had approached her mother only to have the hysterical woman pull out a gun and shoot her in the leg. Another psychic learned he\u2019d been removed from the home by the police when it was discovered that his father was using him to read the minds of ATM customers to discover their PIN numbers.</p><p>Still, she was fairly certain that she took first prize in the Worse-Parents-Ever contest.</p> <p>Seated in the back of the silver car, she kept her gaze firmly on the passing scenery. It didn\u2019t matter she couldn\u2019t see a damn thing in the darkness. Anything was better than having to look at her psychopathic father seated next to her in the backseat of the car.</p><p>Or worse, catching sight of her dead mother, who was driving the car with unnerving skill.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how far they\u2019d driven. It seemed like they\u2019d been in the car for days, although she knew it couldn\u2019t have been more than a couple of hours.</p><p>There was a ripple in the chilled air as Lord Zakhar shifted on the seat. Callie grimaced. There was a temptation to stick her head in the sand and pretend they weren\u2019t speeding toward some gruesome destiny.</p><p>If she couldn\u2019t change the future, then why know the gory details before she had to?</p><p>But while cowardice seemed the preferable option, she couldn\u2019t ignore the stern voice in the back of her head that reminded her that she had a duty.</p><p>She might not know what had happened to Duncan or Fane or any of her friends, but she grimly held on to the belief that they were unharmed and searching for her.</p><p>If they managed to contact her, she needed to be able to warn them what her crazy relatives were plotting.</p> <p>And how they could be stopped.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d She forced the question past her stiff lips, her gaze remaining trained on the window.</p><p>\u201cAnd spoil the surprise?\u201d her father taunted.</p><p>Callie rolled her eyes. \u201cI thought evil geniuses liked to boast about their clever plots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true I am a genius, but I refute the claim that I\u2019m evil.\u201d</p><p>She jerked at the soft denial. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people admire ambition,\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u201cAmbition doesn\u2019t include killing your family or sacrificing your child,\u201d she said with blatant revulsion. \u201cAnd it certainly doesn\u2019t include defiling the dead to make them your personal slaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you inherited your mother\u2019s tendency for melodrama.\u201d His heavy sigh drifted through the air. \u201cUnfortunate.\u201d</p><p>Her dead mother who was currently playing chauffeur?</p><p>She squashed the hysterical urge to laugh.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>There was a tense pause before she heard the sound of his silk robe brushing the fabric of his seat, as if he were shrugging.</p><p>\u201cYou should be happy. I\u2019m taking you home.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her head around to meet his smug expression. \u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValhalla.\u201d</p><p>The breath was wrenched from her lungs. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He pretended to be surprised by her question. \u201cI would think that was obvious. To lead the world I\u2019ll need the power of the high-bloods.\u201d</p><p>Valhalla.</p><p>Dammit. He was right. She should have known this was their destination. A man with Lord Zakhar\u2019s bloated ego wouldn\u2019t be satisfied starting his coup anywhere but at the top.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t believe they\u2019ll go along with your crazy plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without a proper incentive.\u201d His long fingers stroked the golden chalice he held in his lap. \u201cWhich is where you come in, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Callie battled back the bile that threatened to choke her. The people she loved most were at Valhalla. To think for even a second that she could be a part in their destruction was sickening.</p><p>Still, she wasn\u2019t about to let her father see the level of her desperation.</p><p>It was a weakness he\u2019d use against her.</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to convince them?\u201d she managed to mock.</p><p>\u201cNot you.\u201d His diamond eyes glowed with an eerie light. \u201cThe army that will be called by your blood.\u201d</p><p>She forced a disdainful smile to her lips. \u201cOh yes. An army of the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He frowned, as if disturbed by her seeming lack of concern.</p><p>Good. Maybe if she could keep him off guard she could find a way to escape.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this dead army going to come from?\u201d she taunted. \u201cDo you have the corpses stashed in the trunk?\u201d</p><p>The diamond eyes glittered with a cold satisfaction. \u201cThe previous Mave was kind enough to insist that all high-bloods be buried in a communal crypt,\u201d he murmured. \u201cA dozen indestructible Sentinels should offer sufficient destruction to force Valhalla to surrender, don\u2019t you think, my dear?\u201d</p><p>Callie was shaken out of her momentary pretense of indifference.</p><p>By law all high-bloods were sent to Valhalla grounds to be buried. Not only to ensure that their bodies were given proper respect, but to prevent humans from sending the corpses to their scientists to be tested like lab rats.</p><p>And the Sentinels were given special burial crypts near the distant lake to honor them for their service. Which meant that they were outside the protective dome that covered Valhalla.</p><p>\u201cYou... bastard,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He waved aside her insult. \u201cYou\u2019re becoming repetitive.\u201d</p><p>Callie sucked in a deep, steadying breath. Anger was a waste of energy, she sternly reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t believe this will work,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Lord Zakhar regarded her with frigid arrogance. \u201cOf course it will.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He was so ... confident. It was damned unnerving.</p><p>\u201cThe high-bloods will never follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>Callie grimaced at his aloof dismissal. Like genocide was just an everyday occurrence.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I have taken my place as ruler,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>She snorted. Yeah, she really hit the lottery in the father sweepstakes.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what will happen to your army?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout your blood they\u2019ll no longer be under my control,\u201d he admitted, a hint of frustration rippling over his startlingly beautiful face before it was quickly banished. \u201cA pity, but fortunately I can produce as many children as necessary in the future if I need new armies. Highly doubtful, of course. Once the world has tasted my power they\u2019ll be eager to bow before me.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s heart missed a beat. A horde of magical, indestructible Sentinels out of control?</p><p>God Almighty.</p><p>\u201cWhen you say they\u2019ll be out of your control\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll destroy anything that crosses their path,\u201d he helpfully supplied.</p><p>Why the coldhearted, amoral son of a bitch.</p><p>She clenched her hands into fists of frustrated rage. \u201cYou\u2019ll be stopped.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow, his smile condescending. \u201cNo, my dear, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy destiny has been foreseen.\u201d His smile widened as Anya pulled the car onto the road that led to the lake. \u201cNothing can stop me now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Duncan was distantly aware of the muted bustle that filled the Sentinel office hidden in the bowels of Valhalla.</p><p>He was too much a cop not to notice the herd of techies who were tapping on their laptops in a frantic attempt to track Callie\u2019s cell phone. Or the warriors who lined the long table where Wolfe was sharing the latest information from his trackers who continued to scour the streets of Kansas City.</p><p>There were more Sentinels standing in front of the bank of monitors, occasionally punching in new coordinates to change the satellite angles or barking orders in their cell phones to direct the trackers.</p><p>But while he tactically approved of the grim, perfectly coordinated efforts to find Callie, he wasn\u2019t a cop tonight.</p><p>He was a man who had failed to protect the woman who had become the most important person in his world.</p><p>Pacing from one end of the room to the other, he absently rubbed his chest. At some point, Wolfe had halted him long enough to take away his gun. No doubt a wise decision considering Duncan was hovering on the edge of sanity. It wouldn\u2019t take much for him to snap.</p><p>Reaching the end of the room, he turned to continue his mindless stride when he discovered his path was being blocked by a tattooed behemoth.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit, cop,\u201d Fane informed him, his own face haggard with strain.</p><p>Duncan flipped him off. \u201cGo to hell\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready there.\u201d Fane shoved a glass into Duncan\u2019s hand. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>Duncan lifted the glass to cautiously sniff the amber liquid. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Fane commanded, folding his arms over his massive chest. \u201cIf I decide to kill you I\u2019ll rip out your heart, not ruin my finest aged whiskey with poison.\u201d</p><p>Duncan snorted. \u201cComforting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The warrior waited for Duncan to toss the fiery whiskey down his throat before taking the empty glass and setting it on a nearby desk.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all worried,\u201d he at last growled.</p><p>Duncan grimaced. \u201cShe\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel it\u201d He pressed a hand to his aching heart. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Fane stilled, his dark eyes flaring with fury.</p><p>Duncan had half expected the Sentinel to laugh. Or at least to tell him he was being a moron.</p><p>A man might be afraid for his lover. He could be worried that she was harmed. But he couldn\u2019t actually feel when she was hurting.</p> <p>Could he?</p><p>Judging by Fane\u2019s reaction, he could.</p><p>Without warning a bone-deep relief surged through him.</p><p>Long ago, he might have stubbornly denied the mystic connection to Callie. He was magnificently skilled in denying what he didn\u2019t want to accept.</p><p>Now he readily clung to that fragile connection. She was hurt, but she was alive.</p><p>That\u2019s all that mattered.</p> <p>Concentrating on the strange sensations that clenched at his heart, Duncan was caught off guard when the first alarm set off a shrill warning.</p><p>Instinctively reaching for his missing gun, he braced for an attack as overhead lights began to flash and the room exploded in a flurry of motion.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Fane muttered as he hurried toward the monitors along with the other Sentinels.</p><p>Duncan detoured to snatch his gun off the table before joining the huddle in front of the monitors.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>It was Wolfe who answered. \u201cThe outside perimeter just went down.\u201d</p><p>Duncan frowned. Valhalla\u2019s security system was the stuff of legends. There wasn\u2019t a norm in the entire world who didn\u2019t realize it was impossible to try and breach the magical barriers.</p><p>Even the cops understood that their jurisdiction ended at the edge of the high-bloods\u2019 property. Anyone suicidal enough to stray beyond that point... well, they were on their own.</p> <p>\u201cThe necro?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be,\u201d Fane seethed. \u201cNo one else would have the cojones.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe growled deep in his throat. \u201cWe should have suspected Valhalla was his ultimate goal. The arrogant bastard wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less.\u201d</p><p>True.</p><p>Not that Duncan gave a shit what brought him to Valhalla.</p><p>If he was here, then Callie couldn\u2019t be far.</p><p>\u201cCan you locate them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to find out.\u201dWolfe reached to press the edge of the monitor, switching it from camera to camera.</p><p>The images flickered so swiftly that Duncan couldn\u2019t make out more than dark shadows and a silver shimmer he assumed was the magical dome that surrounded Valhalla.</p><p>Could the Sentinels see through the darkness?</p><p>His silent question was answered when Fane gave a low growl.</p><p>\u201cWolfe.\u201d</p><p>Freezing the image, Wolfe frowned as Fane pointed to several large figures standing at the edge of the dome.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Duncan leaned forward, struggling to make out more than fuzzy outlines.</p><p>He could see that they were large. Maybe as large as Fane and Wolfe. And each of them carried a different weapon. Swords, bows and arrows, even clubs with long spikes that looked like something out of a Renaissance fair.</p><p>Beyond that was hard to say.</p><p>To his eyes they seemed to be shrouded in fabric from head to toe, disguising their faces and any clothing that might have given a hint to their identity. Although... he leaned closer, studying the hands that were only faintly visible.</p><p>Tattoos.</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath at the same time that Wolfe cursed.</p><p>\u201cSentinels?\u201d the Tagos snarled. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not impossible,\u201d Duncan muttered, desperately searching the monitors for any sign of Callie. \u201cWhy would they join with the necromancer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Wolfe said, his voice flat with denial. \u201cNot if they\u2019re any of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize any of them?\u201d Fane demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot without seeing their faces.\u201d Wolfe studied the monitor, his savage fury boiling through the air with enough heat to make Duncan sweat. \u201cWhat are they wearing?\u201d</p><p>A good question. They looked like shrouds to Duncan ...</p><p>He made a choked sound, struck by a sudden suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI need to see them.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe frowned. \u201cA different camera angle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI need to physically see them\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, Wolfe nodded.</p><p>There were no annoying questions. No demands for explanations.</p><p>Just acceptance that Duncan was a part of the team and that he needed information to help them defeat the enemy.</p><p>And this was why hardened soldiers offered their complete loyalty to the Tagos. Trust was a two-way street. A truth too many leaders never learned.</p><p>\u201cNiko, stay on coms,\u201d Wolfe commanded as he led the way to one of the back doors. \u201cArel, find the Mave.\u201d He pointed toward two guardian Sentinels who were nearly hidden beneath the layers of guns, swords, and... Holy shit, was that a rocket launcher? \u201cYou two, come with me.\u201d</p><p>They left the office and entered a cement tunnel that angled upward, Wolfe taking the lead with Duncan and Fane behind him with the arsenal twins bringing up the rear.</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t have to ask where they were going.</p><p>This was clearly an emergency exit. One that was not only equipped with steel doors every ten feet that could block off pursuers or protect against bomb blasts, but unlike the elevators it didn\u2019t depend on electricity.</p><p>They moved in silence, each of them on high-alert as they headed upward.</p><p>Who the hell knew what might be hiding ahead?</p><p>Crazed necromancers. Demented witches.</p><p>Flesh-eating zombies.</p><p>Duncan sensed when they reached the surface, but Wolfe opened a door that led to a steep flight of stairs. Puzzled, Duncan climbed behind the Tagos, sensing they were several feet in the air.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they stepped onto a narrow ledge that he realized they were standing on a watchtower that offered a perfect panorama of the perimeter. And more importantly, an unimpeded view of the ten\u2014no wait, twelve\u2014warriors who were chanting in low, rough voices as they laid their hands upon an invisible barrier.</p><p>\u201cWell, cop?\u201d Wolfe prompted in a low voice pitched to keep it from carrying on the light breeze. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>Duncan shifted to stand near the low stone wall that surrounded the ledge, thankful for the full moon that drenched the landscape in a silver light. Unlike his companions, he didn\u2019t have the ability to see in the dark.</p><p>\u201cAuras,\u201d he said.</p><p>Wolfe and Fane moved to stand at his side while the other two Sentinels paced to the other side of the narrow ledge. Nothing would be allowed to sneak up from behind.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Fane asked.</p><p>His lips twisted at the brutal pain that sliced through his heart, his gaze trained on the distant intruders.</p><p>\u201cIt was Callie who realized the dead wouldn\u2019t have auras.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Fane breathed softly.</p><p>Duncan pointed toward the inner perimeter, cold dread lying heavy in his stomach. \u201cThose men are like Frank.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe scowled. \u201cExplain\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dead body has no aura. No ... spark of life,\u201d he muttered, shuddering as he studied the men who moved with the same grace they must have possessed when they were alive. It was just wrong. On so many levels. \u201cBut these are surrounded by a darkness.\u201d</p><p>Fane made a tortured sound deep in his throat. \u201cHe\u2019s trapped their souls.\u201d</p><p>Duncan shuddered again. Poor Frank. Was he aware that he was being abused by the necromancer? It had to be torture to be trapped in his own body while it was being controlled by a psychotic megalomaniac.</p><p>\u201cThe son of a bitch,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Wolfe gripped the top of the wall, the granite crumbling beneath his fingers. \u201cA clever son of a bitch,\u201d he snarled, studying the warriors with a bleak expression.</p><p>Duncan glanced toward the Tagos. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBokors are empty shells; these\u201d\u2014Wolfe struggled for a suitable label\u2014\u201ccreatures have their former powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Fane swore. \u201cThat\u2019s why he chose guardian Sentinels.\u201d</p><p>Duncan wasn\u2019t as quick to follow. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Wolfe grimaced. \u201cThey\u2019re the only ones capable of destroying the layers of magic that protect Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>Oh... shit.</p><p>There was a faint prickle of power before the tall, dark-haired Mave stepped onto the ledge, standing proud and strong as she met Wolfe\u2019s fierce gaze.</p><p>A dangerous warrior in her own right, Duncan inanely realized.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need,\u201d she commanded, her pale face calm, although her dark hair was escaping from the once neat bun and there were shadows beneath her magnificent eyes.</p><p>In the moonlight her emerald birthmark seemed to shimmer even brighter than usual.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need the witches,\u201d he answered, his voice decisive. \u201cIf nothing else, they can slow down the warriors with new barriers.\u201d</p><p>The Mave nodded. \u201cWhat about the diviners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Wolfe scowled, clearly just realizing the potential disaster of the necromancer getting his hands on the diviners. They might not have the power of Callie, but they still had a connection to the dead. Who knew what he might be able to do with them. \u201cUntil we discover if they can be controlled by the necromancer we need to get them far away. Use the helicopters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe psychics?\u201d</p><p>Wolfe considered a minute before shaking his head. \u201cThey might as well leave through the tunnels along with any humans. The healers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t go,\u201d the Mave interrupted, her gaze straying toward the dead Sentinels who had managed to break through yet another layer of magic. \u201cNot if they think there will be injuries.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe didn\u2019t argue. Instead he unfastened the AK-47 he\u2019d strapped to his back on his way through the tunnel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you sort out the others,\u201d he said, no doubt referring to the numerous high-bloods who didn\u2019t fall into specific groups. Mutations didn\u2019t always follow a pattern. \u201cYou need to evacuate as many as possible.\u201d</p><p>There was a strange pause as the two powerful leaders exchanged a silent, emotion-charged glance that made Duncan glance away in embarrassment.</p><p>What the hell was going on between the two of them?</p> <p>He heard the Mave speak softly to her Tagos. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou as well,\u201d Wolfe answered, his voice thick.</p><p>Then, the tension snapped and with a brisk step the Mave was returning down the steep steps and Wolfe was barking into the com in his ear.</p><p>\u201cNiko, take ten of your best trackers and start patrolling the perimeter. Send the rest to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeapons?\u201d Niko\u2019s voice floated through the air.</p> <p>Wolfe cast a grim glance toward the approaching Sentinels.</p><p>\u201cEverything we have.\u201d</p><p>Callie knelt on the hard ground, her head lowered.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a gesture of respect to the man who towered over her, his bronzed features set in an expression of icy anticipation.</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>She\u2019d swallow broken glass before she\u2019d kneel before her psycho dad.</p> <p>But after arriving at the entrance to the underground crypts, the necromancer hadn\u2019t wasted any time in dragging her from the car and producing a dagger to slice long wounds the length of her inner forearms.</p><p>The cuts hadn\u2019t been that deep, but they\u2019d stung like a bitch. Then, before she could catch her breath, the bastard had called on some dark power that had slammed through Callie with the force of a freight train.</p><p>Black flecks had danced in front of her eyes as the frigid energy crashed through her, threatening to suck her down into some murky, endless hell. Desperately she\u2019d fought against the relentless waves, knowing that one slip and she\u2019d be consumed by the darkness.</p><p>She had no idea how long the battle lasted.</p><p>It could have been seconds or hours, but when her head cleared she\u2019d found herself on her knees with the golden goblet perched against her thigh.</p><p>Even worse, she could feel a strange tug deep inside her. As if she were connected to something\u2014or rather many things\u2014just beyond her sight.</p><p>The sensations only intensified as a dozen warriors slowly stepped from the crypts, still wrapped in their funeral shrouds with their weapons in hand.</p><p>Callie cried out in horror, but her strength was being drained with every drip of blood that slid down her arms and vanished into the goblet. There was nothing she could do as they silently moved past her, the once proud warriors now under the compulsion of Lord Zakhar.</p> <p>\u201cSo glorious,\u201d her father murmured, watching in pride as his monsters dismantled the layers of magic that protected her home.</p><p>\u201cThey were glorious when they were alive,\u201d she tried to snarl, startled when her voice came out in a shaky whisper. The warriors were sucking her life force at an alarming rate. \u201cThey should be respected and honored for their service to their people, not treated as disposable minions.\u201d</p><p>He flicked an indifferent glance in her direction. \u201cSo passionate, but my dear Callie, you are all disposable minions to me.\u201d</p><p>Nice.</p><p>She grimaced, squashing her flare of revulsion toward the man who\u2019d spawned her.</p><p>Hate wasn\u2019t a productive emotion.</p><p>She needed resolve. Purpose. Stubborn, pigheaded obstinacy.</p><p>She had the last three in spades.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, she turned her attention inward, concentrating on the mystical bond that ran from her father through her and onto the warriors. At the same time, she began to babble. She didn\u2019t know if the necromancer could sense her trying to destroy the bond, but it seemed smart to try and keep him distracted.</p><p>Just in case.</p><p>\u201cDo you imagine that even if you take Valhalla you\u2019ll be satisfied?\u201d she asked, her brow furrowed as she opened herself to the icy power that pulsed through her.</p><p>She grimaced. Christ. It was like an evil umbilical cord that connected them all together.</p><p>Her father arched a puzzled brow. \u201cOf course I will not be satisfied,\u201d he said, his chilling calm assuring her that he didn\u2019t yet sense her attempt to destroy his connection to the warriors. \u201cI intend to rule the world.\u201d</p><p>Well of course he did.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d she prompted, inwardly judging the amount of life she was losing against the progress of the warriors.</p><p>Even as she watched the second barrier went down.</p><p>God dammit.</p><p>Too fast.</p><p>There was only one more layer before they would have a direct shot at Valhalla.</p><p>And then ...</p><p>She shook her head. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought.</p><p>\u201cThen my destiny will be fulfilled,\u201d Lord Zakhar was saying, a smile on his lips as he contemplated his glorious future.</p><p>Arrogant ass.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll still be empty,\u201d she accused, turning her attention from the ruthless drain on her life to her connection to her father.</p><p>If she could snap her bond with the dead, then maybe she could cut off the power at its source.</p><p>\u201cEmpty of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, happiness ... contentment.\u201d</p><p>He turned to stab her with an annoyed glare.</p><p>Ah. Hit a nerve, did she?</p><p>\u201cI have no need for human emotions.\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze, finding it an anchor to help search along the cord that bound them together.</p><p>\u201cIf that were true you wouldn\u2019t have such a gaping hole inside you,\u201d she said, weirdly able to feel the howling abyss inside her father.</p><p>God. It was no wonder he was as cold and empty as Siberia. He\u2019d been stripped of everything but a raw, unrelenting hunger for power.</p><p>She shivered, crushing her instinctive pity.</p><p>There were few people on the face of the earth less deserving of sympathy than Lord Zakhar.</p><p>Instead she concentrated on the odd darkness at the very center of his soul.</p><p>There.</p><p>The doorway to the underworld.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how she knew it.</p><p>She just did.</p><p>\u201cThere is no hole,\u201d he mocked, his voice suspiciously bland. \u201cGaping or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are your hands clenched, Father? Are you afraid I might be right?\u201d Callie mocked in return, glancing down at his tight fists while she inwardly surveyed the doorway.</p><p>Crap. It was more a smooth portal than an actual doorway. Like a black hole. So how the hell was she supposed to close it?</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath, forcing his hands to relax. \u201cStupid, child. I fear nothing.\u201d</p><p>He did, of course.</p><p>He feared being weak.</p><p>Or failing in his grand quest.</p><p>So how did she use it to her advantage?</p><p>\u201cYet another worthless human emotion?\u201d she absently taunted.</p><p>He frowned, as if belatedly sensing she wasn\u2019t fully concentrating on their bickering.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell.</p><p>A distraction was needed. Pronto.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pathetic excuse for a man you are.\u201d She tossed out the first insult that came to mind, still anxiously probing for a weakness in the bond between them.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you hope to anger me?\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are deliberately provoking my temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you hope that I will become enraged enough to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Ah. That had certainly been her first thought.</p><p>Until he\u2019d ruined the plan by saying the dead warriors would plunder, pillage, and ravage their way across the country once she lost her control over them...</p><p>Her control over them.</p><p>Her heart slammed against her ribs as she realized she had the answer.</p><p>If she couldn\u2019t cut the connection, or close the doorway, she had no choice but to take command of the bond.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you hope for, Callie?\u201d her father impatiently snapped, forcing her to realize he was studying her with a growing suspicion.</p><p>She licked her lips, her mouth dry.</p><p>She had to keep him distracted a few more minutes.</p><p>Just long enough to call on her powers.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think I want to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople burdened with morals are always eager to become martyrs,\u201d he said in obvious disgust.</p><p>Clearly he had no hopes for earning a sainthood.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just truly believe you\u2019re pathetic,\u201d she pointed out with a humorless smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your energy, my dear.\u201d He tilted his chin, turning back toward Valhalla. \u201cI have waited too long for this moment to be goaded into a rash act of stupidity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my energy to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo longer. It\u2019s mine to control.\u201d He gave a sudden chuckle as a group of Sentinels appeared to stand in front of the dead warriors, Duncan\u2019s golden blond hair unmistakable in the moonlight. \u201cAh. Shall I demonstrate?\u201d</p><p>Callie forced herself to her feet, her hand pressed to her lips as she watched the man she loved charging straight at the nearest warrior.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she breathed, knowing there was no way he could survive for even a few minutes against an indestructible Sentinel. \u201cPlease\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Lord Zakhar sneered. \u201cEmotions make you weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d Knowing it was now or never, Callie opened herself to her powers, allowing them to flow through her. \u201cThey give me a strength you never dreamed possible.\u201d</p><p>Her father continued to watch the unfolding battle, a cold smile of anticipation touching his lips as one Sentinel fell beneath the onslaught, and then another.</p><p>Callie frantically closed her eyes, knowing she\u2019d never be able to concentrate if she knew Duncan was injured. The only way to protect him was to wrench away her father\u2019s command of the warriors.</p><p>Not bothering to try and control the natural power that flowed through her, Callie focused on the bond that spanned between herself and her father.</p><p>It is just like entering the mind of the dead, she assured herself.</p><p>Slip in, take command, and ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, she didn\u2019t know what happened after that, but she was about to find out.</p><p>Aiming directly at the bond, Callie slid into the darkness, losing her touch with her physical body.</p><p>It felt oddly familiar.</p> <p>Cool, peaceful.</p><p>The temptation of death.</p><p>Then, at last through the surface of the bond, she found the darkness separating.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she expected.</p><p>The faces of the warriors.

The breath rushed from her lungs as she touched the minds of the warriors.</p><p>There was a startled curse from Lord Zakhar as he belatedly sensed her intrusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he snarled, grasping her shoulders in a grip that threatened to crush her bones.</p><p>Callie smiled through the pain as she opened her eyes and whispered one word.</p> <p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Duncan didn\u2019t need to be a trained soldier to know the battle wasn\u2019t going well.</p><p>His first clue came when he\u2019d pumped his entire clip of bullets into the nearest intruder and the warrior barely flinched.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>Not good at all.</p><p>Traditional weapons were obviously worthless against zombies.</p><p>Time to think outside the box.</p><p>Ducking to avoid the arrow that whizzed past his face, he darted to the side to grab the heavy chain that was coiled in the back of the jeep they\u2019d taken to the edge of the large meadow.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t kill the zombies, but he might be able to slow one or two of them down long enough for Fane to track down the necromancer.</p><p>He grimaced at the memory of his short but violent argument with the guardian Sentinel.</p><p>Duncan had claimed it was his right to go in search of Callie and kill the bastard who\u2019d kidnapped her. Fane, however, had kindly pointed out that he was by far the superior tracker, not to mention he\u2019d been trained for over a century by the most fearsome warriors ever born.</p><p>And oh yeah, he was impervious to magic.</p><p>Duncan might have continued the argument\u2014he was nothing if not obstinate\u2014but Fane had simply melted into the darkness and disappeared.</p><p>Jackass.</p><p>Now Duncan was forced to hold back the encroaching zombies and pray that Fane was as good as he thought he was.</p><p>Another arrow flew past his face, and with an infuriated roar, Duncan whirled the chain like a lasso, watching it wrap around the nearest zombie\u2019s legs.</p><p>The creature fell to the ground and a slender female witch darted forward, chanting a spell that bound the creature in a shimmering dome of magic.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>But it did take one warrior out of the fight for a few minutes.</p><p>Duncan turned his attention to Wolfe, who was swinging a massive sword at a Sentinel who held a battle ax.</p><p>The Tagos was surprisingly skilled in wielding the heavy weapon, striking blow after blow before dancing away to avoid the swinging ax. But no matter how skilled he might be, there was no way to win against an opponent who couldn\u2019t be killed. With every passing second Wolfe was losing ground.</p><p>Further away the gathered Sentinels engaged in similar fights with the zombies, grimly struggling to keep the monsters at bay.</p><p>Pausing long enough to grab another chain from the jeep, Duncan sprinted forward. Behind him he could feel the witch following, clearly trained in battle tactics.</p><p>Good girl.</p><p>Halting a few feet from the zombie who fought against Wolfe, Duncan was preparing to throw the chain at the creature\u2019s legs when there was an odd sizzle in the air.</p><p>And then... the zombies abruptly froze.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>One minute they were silently slicing and dicing their way through the line of Sentinels, and the next they were standing like mannequins, their gazes blank, as if they\u2019d been switched off.</p><p>Cautiously lowering his sword, Wolfe circled the unmoving zombie who still held his ax midair.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d the Tagos muttered.</p><p>\u201cCallie,\u201d Duncan breathed, dropping the chain as he pressed a hand to his heart.</p><p>Wolfe scowled, a shallow cut marring his cheek and a deeper slice dripping blood down his neck.</p><p>\u201cShe did this?\u201d</p><p>Duncan gave a slow nod. He had no explanation, but he could catch Callie\u2019s scent mingled among the warriors. As if they were somehow connected to her.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be her,\u201d he muttered, hissing as he realized the sense of her deep in his heart was fading. \u201cDammit, we have to find her. Now.\u201d</p><p>On cue, there was a sharp whistle.</p><p>Fane.</p><p>Wolfe raised his hand, motioning to the Sentinels, who were staring at the frozen zombies in wary horror. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>They jogged across the grass, entering a small clump of trees that circled a gray stone building that was nearly hidden beneath a layer of ivy.</p><p>It had to be the opening to the lower crypts, Duncan inanely acknowledged, and where the now frozen warriors had come from.</p><p>The thought had barely flickered along the edge of his mind when he caught sight of Fane, who had his hands wrapped around the neck of the tall man with silver hair and diamond eyes.</p><p>The necromancer.</p><p>A red haze filled Duncan\u2019s mind.</p><p>It was the same haze that had risen when he\u2019d been fourteen and he\u2019d seen the high-school quarterback slap his sister when she wouldn\u2019t let him stick his hand down her shirt.</p><p>At the time Duncan had barely been over five-foot-five and weighed less than a buck thirty, but he\u2019d launched himself on the quarterback and managed to break the bastard\u2019s nose and knocked out three teeth before he was pulled off.</p><p>Now he was impervious to the biting chill in the air, or the fact that Fane was turning a dangerous shade of blue as the necromancer\u2019s eyes flared with a blinding light.</p><p>All he knew was that he at last had the chance to kill the man who\u2019d taken away the woman he loved.</p><p>Charging forward, he was mere steps away when his rage was shaken by a faint scent of blood.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Jerking to the side, he frantically searched the darkness. Callie was near.</p><p>And injured.</p><p>Any male need to personally get his hands on the necromancer was forgotten as he circled a tree to discover Callie curled on the ground, a golden chalice lying at her side.</p><p>Oh... Christ.</p><p>The entire world halted as he took in her pale, pale face and the blood dripping down her arms.</p><p>She looked like a broken, exotic flower that had been tossed aside by a careless hand.</p><p>Then, her lips parted on a soft sigh and Duncan\u2019s heart remembered how to beat.</p><p>\u201cCallie,\u201d he groaned, preparing to drop to his knees at her side.</p><p>It was only the shout of warning from Wolfe that allowed him to jump to the side in enough time to avoid the nasty bolt of magic that slammed into the tree with enough force to split it in two.</p><p>Whirling around, he spotted the crimson-haired woman who was stalking toward him with obvious intent.</p><p>The witch.</p><p>And not just a witch, he realized, seeing her aura was a black swirl of death.</p><p>But a zombie witch.</p><p>Just fucking perfect.</p><p>The female raised her hand again, preparing to launch yet another offensive spell, but even as Duncan braced himself for the attack, Wolfe was stepping behind her, shoving his large sword through her back and out through her chest.</p><p>Duncan grimaced.</p><p>He\u2019d seen some gory things in his time, but watching Wolfe lift the skewered witch off the ground made his stomach heave. It didn\u2019t help when the Sentinel walked forward and then, with a mighty thrust of his arm, had the woman pinned to a nearby tree.</p><p>The witch struggled, but for the moment she was effectively trapped.</p><p>Moving back to Callie, Duncan lowered himself to his knees, carefully slipping his arms beneath her limp body to pull her onto his lap.</p><p>He needed to feel her against him.</p><p>The beat of her heart against his chest, the brush of her breath against his cheek.</p><p>Then, wrapping his arms carefully around her fragile form, he lifted his head to watch Fane in action.</p><p>Oddly, he hadn\u2019t doubted for a second that the warrior would be able to kill the necromancer.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that Lord Zakhar had managed to live for centuries. Or that he had the skill to screw with the dead. Or even that his power was filling the air with a chill that would soon become unbearable.</p><p>Fane had prepared for this moment since he\u2019d become Callie\u2019s guardian. And nothing, not even the hordes from the underworld, were going to stop him.</p><p>\u201cCallie, stay with me, sweetheart,\u201d he murmured, stroking a hand down her back as he watched Fane slowly, ruthlessly squeeze the life from the necromancer. \u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>It was supposed to be over.</p><p>The bad guy was dead.</p><p>Not only dead, but hacked into itty bitty pieces and set on fire, just in case he tried to come back.</p><p>But after Fane spread the bastard\u2019s ashes, Callie didn\u2019t so much as stir in Duncan\u2019s arms.</p><p>Whatever was wrong with her hadn\u2019t been solved by the necromancer\u2019s death.</p><p>Instead she continued to grow weaker.</p><p>Rushing her back to Valhalla, they were now in the high-tech wing that served as a hospital for high-bloods with a dozen healers doing their frantic best to keep her alive.</p><p>Duncan sat on the edge of the bed where Callie was lying beneath a thin sheet, her arms heavily bandaged and an IV attached to the back of her arm, replacing the blood that she continued to lose.</p><p>Fane paced the floor, his skin still faintly blue and his hands marred by frostbite.</p><p>Wolfe had come and gone, telling them that the zombie warriors remained in their statuelike state and that the witch had been locked in the crypts to keep her contained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least for a few hours.</p><p>Duncan barely heard the reassurances.</p><p>Who the hell cared about zombie warriors?</p> <p>His entire focus was on the woman who clung to life by the thinnest thread.</p><p>Bowing his head, Duncan was busy praying to whatever god would listen when Fane came to an abrupt halt, his brows snapping together.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Duncan lifted his head. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>The answer came when the beautiful Serra pushed open the door and entered the room.</p> <p>Fane stepped forward, his face grim. \u201cI thought the psychics were told to leave,\u201d he growled.</p><p>The female didn\u2019t bother to glance in his direction as she headed for the bed, her gaze locked on Callie.</p><p>\u201cI make my own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Fane muttered, but his expression eased as Serra stepped into the muted light near the head of the bed.</p><p>As usual, she was wearing a pair of leather pants and thigh-high boots with a tiny halter top that could stop traffic, but her face was pale and damp with tears, and the green eyes shimmering with a gut-deep fear.</p><p>\u201cOh, Callie, you idiot,\u201d she whispered in shaky tones, her hand gently brushing her friend\u2019s cold cheek. \u201cWhat did the healers say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe continues to lose blood no matter what they do to close the wounds,\u201d Duncan said, his voice a harsh croak.</p><p>He\u2019d never understood the meaning of true torture until now.

Or that bullets wouldn\u2019t stop anything capable of breaking through the spells guarding the room.</p><p>Rational or not, it was going to be a long, long time before he went anywhere unarmed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cThe necromancer ... he was her father,\u201d she said with a shudder. \u201cAnd the witch was her mother.\u201d</p><p>The surge of disgusted shock was swiftly replaced by a startling sense of acceptance.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he muttered, sharing a glance with Fane. \u201cIt actually makes perfect sense.\u201d</p><p>Fane shrugged, clearly not interested. \u201cWhat did the necromancer do to her?\u201d</p><p>Serra closed her eyes, silently communicating with Callie.</p><p>\u201cHe used her blood to bind her to the magic of the chalice,\u201d she at last said.</p><p>Fane leaned forward. \u201cWhat magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt opens the pathway to the underworld.\u201d</p><p>Duncan squeezed Callie\u2019s fingers. She was connected to the underworld? Shit, shit, shit.</p><p>\u201cHow do we close it?\u201d</p><p>Serra opened her eyes to meet Duncan\u2019s worried gaze. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know, but she\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>Afraid? Afraid of what?</p><p>\u201cTell her that Lord Zakhar is dead.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s bothering her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she dies, the Sentinels that are bound to her will be released.\u201d</p><p>Duncan parted his lips\u2014about to snarl that there was no way Callie was going to die\u2014only to be interrupted by Fane.</p><p>\u201cBack to their graves?\u201d the Sentinel demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Serra\u2019s expression was troubled. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill anything in their path and nothing will be able to stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod dammit,\u201d Fane snarled.</p><p>Duncan made a sound of impatience. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want a crazed band of indestructible zombies rampaging through Valhalla\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fane glared at him. \u201cIt won\u2019t stop at Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Duncan snapped, refusing to consider the damage the zombie warriors could cause. \u201cBut right now all I care about is Callie.\u201d He glanced back at Serra. \u201cHow do we destroy the chalice?\u201d</p><p>She did her psychic thing, her face managing to lose even more color.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be destroyed,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Duncan was abruptly on his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t accept that.\u201d</p><p>Fane folded his arms over his bare chest, equally determined.</p><p>\u201cIf the chalice can\u2019t be destroyed then the doorway must be closed some other way,\u201d he announced, his flat tone shaking Duncan out of his brief flare of panic. \u201cThe monk mentioned a ritual. I\u2019ll return to Russia. There has to be some mention of the chalice in the texts.\u201d</p><p>Duncan forced himself to take a deep, calming breath. Becoming hysterical wasn\u2019t going to do Callie any good. He had to think clearly. Starting with how they could close the doorway.</p><p>Pacing toward the window that offered a view of the still dark countryside, he shuffled through his memories.</p><p>There had been something nagging at him since he\u2019d had his meeting with Hektor from the Brotherhood.</p><p>Something...</p><p>It hit him with enough force to make him gasp.</p><p>Fane sent him a searching glance. \u201cYou okay, cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can find someone who knows the ritual much closer,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Brotherhood.\u201d</p><p>Fane frowned. \u201cYou know how to contact them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m betting I know someone who does.\u201d Duncan turned his attention to Serra. \u201cCan you stay with Callie?\u201d</p><p>She settled on the edge of the bed, her chin jutted to a dangerous angle. Only a fool would try to pry her away from her friend.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave her side.\u201d</p><p>Moving back to the bed, Duncan leaned down to press a lingering kiss to Callie\u2019s forehead, breathing deeply of her apple scent.</p><p>\u201cHang on, baby,\u201d he whispered, willing her to stay strong. \u201cI\u2019m coming back with the cavalry.\u201d Straightening, he snatched the chalice off the table and met Fane\u2019s steady gaze. \u201cCan you take me to Kansas City?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They made their way through Valhalla and into the small chapel where they stood before the familiar copper post. Fane was never chatty. Tonight he was downright mute as he gathered his powers and sent them spinning through... well, whatever they spun through to get to Kansas City in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It was only as they left the monastery and climbed into the waiting Hummer that he at last spoke.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to contact the Brotherhood?\u201d he asked, driving out of the garage and onto the nearby path. \u201cAny personal info they gave will be bogus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Duncan snorted. He was a trained cop. He didn\u2019t need help smelling bullshit.</p><p>\u201cThen how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt bothered me that Hektor asked for me when he came to the station,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Duncan shrugged, pointing for Fane to turn onto the road that led to the nearest interstate.</p><p>\u201cNo one in the public should have known the coin was missing, let alone that I was looking for it\u201d</p><p>Fane arched a brow. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there was either a leak at Valhalla\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d the Sentinel snapped.</p><p>\u201cOr the police station.\u201d Duncan ignored the interruption. \u201cOr, more likely, from the one civilian I asked to identify the vessel that held the coin.\u201d</p><p>Fane hissed out a breath. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Duncan leaned forward to punch the directions into the GPS. \u201cDrive fast.\u201d</p><p>The words had barely left his lips when Fane had stomped on the gas pedal and they were hurtling along the road at a teeth-rattling speed.</p><p>Holy hell.</p> <p>Duncan hastily buckled his seat belt, tucking the chalice into the glove compartment so he could brace himself.</p><p>Inwardly he made a mental note never to tell a Sentinel to drive fast unless he was prepared to risk his life, and the lives of every citizen in Kansas City.</p><p>Thankfully the late hour meant there was little traffic and they managed to reach the south side of town without ramming cars off the road or taking out a hapless pedestrian.</p><p>Screeching to a halt in front of the steel and glass building, Fane had barely put the vehicle in park when Duncan was jumping out and heading to the back alley.</p><p>Girard lived in a small apartment at the rear of the art gallery.

It was four in the morning and they both knew he\u2019d started as a common street thug.</p><p>\u201cThis is private property, you know,\u201d he groused. \u201cUnless you have a warrant you can get your ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>Duncan jerked his thumb toward the silent Sentinel standing at his side. \u201cThis is my warrant.\u201d</p><p>Anger tightened Girard\u2019s narrow face, but he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to argue.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re here about the vessel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m here,\u201d Duncan interrupted. He wasn\u2019t going to play games. Not tonight. \u201cI need to contact the Brotherhood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrotherhood?\u201d Girard gave a faux frown, his hand lifting to covertly tug the edge of his robe higher on his neck. \u201cIs that some sort of code?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Duncan lunged forward, ripping aside the robe to reveal the arrow-shaped tattoo the man had been trying to hide. He\u2019d never spotted it before because Girard always wore a collared shirt and tie.</p><p>Fane frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHektor had that same tattoo on his neck,\u201d Duncan said.</p><p>Without warning the Sentinel had reached out, grabbed Girard by the throat and lifted him three inches off the ground.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to screw around, so let me make this simple,\u201d Fane growled, squeezing until the man\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cTell me how to contact the Brotherhood or I\u2019ll snap your neck.\u201d</p><p>Duncan had to give Girard credit. Despite the sweat dripping down his face, he tried to protect his brothers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Duncan grabbed his chin, hoping that honesty would loosen his tongue. They didn\u2019t have time for Fane to beat it out of him.</p><p>\u201cThe pathway to the underworld was opened.\u201d</p><p>Girard stopped struggling against Fane\u2019s iron grip, a genuine fear flashing through his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The man licked his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Duncan snapped. \u201cThe necromancer is dead and we have the chalice. We need the Brotherhood to perform the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Girard visibly weighed his options. If he revealed the location of the secret society and discovered Duncan had been lying, he would be toast.</p><p>But then again, if he didn\u2019t contact the Brotherhood and Duncan wasn\u2019t lying, he would be toast.</p><p>Duncan knew the second he\u2019d conceded defeat.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d he choked out, glaring when Fane continued to hold him off the ground. \u201cDo you want me to contact them or not?\u201d</p><p>Fane leaned forward, until they were nose to nose, holding Girard\u2019s weight with obnoxious ease.</p><p>The Sentinel could no doubt bench press the Hummer.</p><p>\u201cYou make one wrong twitch and you\u2019re dead,\u201d he promised in lethal tones, waiting for the man to give a jerky nod before he set him on his feet and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI hate high-bloods,\u201d Girard muttered, pulling a cell phone from his pocket.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Callie woke to discover Duncan lying on the narrow bed next to her, his arm gently tucked around her waist.</p><p>His hair was rumpled, his face was lined with weariness, and his golden beard was at least three days old, but he was still the most beautiful thing she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cHey, sleepyhead,\u201d he murmured, the hazel eyes filling with relief as he realized she was awake.</p><p>She frowned. She had a vague recollection of Duncan carrying her back to Valhalla. Then Serra had come and she was able to warn them of the goblet.</p><p>After that it all became fuzzy.</p><p>\u201cThe chalice?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cFane took it along with the Brotherhood to some temple in the Middle East. That\u2019s the only place they could close the doorway to the underworld.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Brotherhood? Temple? Middle East?</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI feel like it.\u201d With a choked groan, he pressed his face into the curve of her neck. \u201cGod, Callie, you scared the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her cheek over the top of his head, savoring the heat of his body, which drove away the last of her father\u2019s frigid power.</p><p>She was safe.</p><p>And in the arms of the man she loved.</p><p>\u201cI was scared too,\u201d she husked. Understatement of the year. She was going to have nightmares for decades.</p><p>He planted a kiss just below her ear. \u201cI know you were, sweetheart, but you saved us all.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. She was fairly certain she\u2019d shared the reason Lord Zakhar had chosen her as his sacrifice when Serra had been rummaging around in her brain, but she had to be sure he understood the blood that ran through her veins.</p><p>\u201cDuncan.\u201d</p><p>He concentrated on nuzzling a heated path down the line of her jaw.</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe necromancer ...\u201d She was forced to halt and clear her throat. \u201cHe was my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d He abruptly cut her words short, pulling back to send her a warning frown. \u201cAlong with the witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He pressed a swift, possessive kiss to her lips. \u201cThey\u2019re dead and the zombies have been returned to their graves. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Callie hesitated before heaving a sigh.</p><p>Someday they would discuss the gory details. Not only of her father\u2019s sick plot to rule the world and her desperate gamble to take control of the dead Sentinels, but what it meant to be the daughter of Lord Zakhar and his pet witch.</p><p>She also had a thousand questions about what had happened after she\u2019d been kidnapped by her psycho father.</p><p>But that could wait until the wounds had healed and her emotions weren\u2019t still raw.</p><p>\u201cReally and truly over?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cReally and truly over.\u201d Another lingering kiss. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank god.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be thanking me as well?\u201d</p><p>She snuggled against him, her heart skipping a beat as his lips found a sensitive pulse just below her jaw.</p><p>\u201cDid you want a medal?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He nibbled down the curve of her neck. \u201cI was thinking of a more personal thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that could be arranged,\u201d she husked, already picturing Duncan spread naked across her bed while her tongue traced his washboard abs.</p><p>The things she intended to do to that hard, male body...</p><p>Her delicious thoughts were abruptly interrupted by an unwelcomed realization.</p><p>Oh... hell.</p><p>As Duncan had just said, it was over.</p><p>Her father was dead, the chalice had been returned to wherever it came from, and she was no longer in danger.</p><p>With an uncanny intuition, Duncan pulled back, his eyes narrowed as he sensed her distress.</p><p>\u201cCallie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, giving her a warning glare as her lips parted to dismiss his concern. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare try to tell me it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cBossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of my charm. Tell me what\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>She might as well. He would nag her to death if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNow that the necromancer is dead, you\u2019ll be returning to your old life,\u201d she said, her voice deliberately stripped of emotion.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t pressure him into staying.</p><p>Or beg to be taken with him.</p><p>Only he could decide what he needed to make him happy.</p><p>Surprisingly, his expression eased, a tiny smile tugging at his lips. \u201cWill I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She plucked at the sheet that covered her, belatedly realizing she must look like hell with her hair sticking up like a porcupine and her body wrapped like a mummy in her hospital gown. Not that it would make Duncan stay even if she was dressed like a movie star. He wasn\u2019t that kind of guy. Still, she did have her pride. \u201cYou have your family. Your job\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve taken a new job,\u201d he smoothly interrupted.</p><p>She widened her eyes in shock. \u201cA new job? But ... you love being a cop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged. \u201cI love carrying a gun and telling people what to do.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, not about to be fooled by his light tone. This man had devoted his life to his career. He wouldn\u2019t just toss it aside as if it meant nothing.</p><p>\u201cDuncan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSsh.\u201d He pressed a finger to her lips, something that might have been contentment shimmering in his hazel eyes. \u201cWolfe has made me a Sentinel. Or at least I\u2019ll be one once I\u2019m done with my training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d he assured her. \u201cI still get to use my skills as a cop, and from now on I won\u2019t have to hide my ability to read auras. It\u2019s my best asset.\u201d He smiled with wicked promise. \u201cWell, one of my best assets,\u201d he corrected, his finger stroking the lush softness of her bottom lip. \u201cAnd more importantly, no one will be your guardian but me.\u201d</p><p>She studied his face for any hint of hesitation. As desperately as she longed to have him become a part of her world, she would never forgive herself if he came to regret his decision.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is what you want?\u201d she pressed. \u201cWhat you truly want?\u201d</p> <p>He framed her face in his hands, regarding her with a tender devotion that chased away any lingering doubts.</p><p>\u201cYou are what I want, Callie Brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Duncan,\u201d she sniffed, feeling as silly and emotional as one of those girly girls she\u2019d always mocked.</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cThere is one downside, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>His teasing tone kept her from freaking out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Mave mentioned something about me being a liaison between Valhalla and the civil authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a brilliant idea.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head with a grimace. \u201cLiaisons are supposed to be diplomatic. I have as much diplomacy as a rabid badger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She reached up to push a strand of golden hair off his forehead. Her touch sheer possession. This man was hers. Hers, all hers. Joy exploded in the center of her heart. \u201cI can give you lessons.\u201d</p><p>The wicked smile became downright sinful. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>The hazel gaze slowly meandered downward, lingering on the neckline of her oversized gown that revealed the top of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take the proper incentive.\u201d</p> <p>Breathe, Callie, breathe.</p><p>\u201cAnd what incentive would that be?\u201d</p><p>He brushed a gentle hand through her hair. \u201cFirst I\u2019m going to need a place to stay while we work on my lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have an apartment I would be willing to share,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he breathed, gold beginning to shimmer in his eyes. A sure sign of his arousal. As if the hard thrust of his erection pressing into her hip wasn\u2019t enough of a hint. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll need a private getaway,\u201d he continued. \u201cMaybe a small cabin in the woods where we can be completely alone.\u201d</p><p>Completely alone with this man? Yes, please.</p><p>\u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d She wiggled until she was lying on her side, her hand slipping beneath his T-shirt to stroke over the hard muscles of his stomach. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>He peered deep into her eyes. \u201cJust one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove me.\u201d</p><p>She melted into a puddle of goo, wondering how the hell she\u2019d ever survived without this man in her life.</p><p>\u201cWith all my heart,\u201d she vowed, tears glistening in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCallie. My beautiful Callie.\u201d</p><p>With a groan he kissed her with a stark hunger even as his hands stroked her with a gentle restraint, as if she were a fragile object that might shatter at his touch.</p><p>On the point of assuring him that she wasn\u2019t an invalid, she was halted when he gave a sudden chuckle, speaking against her lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, I almost forgot.\u201d</p><p>She plunged her fingers into his hair, not particularly interested in talking.</p><p>\u201cForgot what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having dinner with my family on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Her shriek could be heard throughout Valhalla.</p><p>\u201cDuncan!\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
