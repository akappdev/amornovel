If I had wished it, the Emperor\u2019s daughter would have spoken a word in her father\u2019s ear, and his Celestial Majesty would have provided me with a mighty escort. Indeed, the princess had begged me to let her do so, and I suspected there would be times that I wished I had consented. I was a young woman, a foreigner, travelling alone in a country halfway around the world from my home.</p> <p>Home.</p><p>It was a bittersweet word. I no longer knew what it meant to me. Once, home had been a snug cave in the Alban wilderness where I was Moirin, daughter of Fainche, child of the Maghuin Dhonn.</p><p>That was still true; in a sense it would always be true. The folk of the Maghuin Dhonn carry our diadh-anams inside us, the divine spark of the Great Bear Herself that gives us life and guides us. It is the part of our soul that connects us to Her. To lose it would be like dying, worse than dying.</p><p>I knew, because I had lost half of mine.</p><p>Not lost, exactly. In fairness, I had given it away, although I hadn\u2019t known what I was doing at the time.</p> <p>My mind shied away from the memory. The noble chestnut gelding I rode flattened his ears and tossed his head, sensing my unease. I stroked his neck, soothing him with my thoughts. \u201cPeace, brave heart,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>He settled. On the lead-line, the pack-horse plodded patiently behind us.</p><p>They were gifts from Emperor Zhu, both of them. I carried a good many gifts. My rich silk robes were embroidered with bronze and amber chrysanthemums. Jade bangles rattled on my wrists and around my neck, hung on a silk chord, was a jade medallion carved with the Emperor\u2019s chop on one side and the Imperial dragon on the other. It would grant me safe passage anywhere in the empire of Ch\u2019in.</p><p>Your jade-eyed witch soothes the dragon.</p><p>Memories.</p><p>The chestnut sidled and pranced beneath me. I soothed him once more, and forced myself to cycle through the Five Styles of Breathing.</p> <p>The Breath of Earth\u2019s Pulse, drawn into the pit of the belly and the depths of the groin, inhaled and exhaled through the mouth.</p><p>The Breath of Ocean\u2019s Rolling Waves, drawn in through the nostrils to the middle belly, out through the mouth.</p><p>The Breath of Trees Growing, circulating energy to the limbs, trading nourishment with the world.</p><p>The Breath of Embers Glowing, in and out through parted lips, quickening the heart and warming the blood.</p><p>The Breath of Wind\u2019s Sigh, pulled and expelled through the nostrils into the space between my eyes, making my head light.</p><p>I breathed the entire cycle as I rode, and while the discipline calmed and centered me, with every breath I drew, a memory assailed me. Stone and sea! There were so many of them.</p><p>Master Lo Feng.</p><p>He had taught me the Five Styles, taught me all that I knew of the Ch\u2019in manner of meditation and harmony he called the Way. It had served me well in the conflict I was leaving behind me. It had let me find the strength and courage to serve as a companion to Princess Snow Tiger and the dragon whose indomitable celestial spirit was housed within her mortal flesh. Were it not for Master Lo\u2019s teaching, I would never have been able to help free the princess and the dragon from the curse that bound them together in the midst of a bloody civil war.</p> <p>Nor could I have endured the aftermath, in which I put my small gift of magic in the service of Emperor Zhu, breathing in and swallowing the memories of hundreds upon hundreds of men who had conceived, built, and wielded the terrible weapons known as the Divine Thunder. I carried the ghosts of those memories within me yet, tasting of brass and sulfur, blood and smoke and horror.</p><p>I returned to the Breath of Wind\u2019s Sigh, willing it to carry away the lingering acrid tang.</p><p>My diadh-anam burned steadily within my breast, calling to its separated half somewhere to the northwest. Since there was no escaping the memory, I let myself think about Bao, the stubborn Ch\u2019in peasant-boy who had walked away with half my soul inside him.</p><p>Bao hadn\u2019t liked me much at first, nor had I cared for him. He was Master Lo\u2019s apprentice, guide, and companion\u2014his magpie, Master Lo called him. I remembered my first sight of him, a lean-muscled young man with dark eyes glinting with disdain under a shock of unkempt black hair, carrying a steaming pot of bone-marrow soup over his shoulder on a bamboo staff.</p><p>That had been in Terre d\u2019Ange, the land of my father\u2019s birth, the land toward which I first set out in pursuit of my destiny. A quest laid upon me by the Maghuin Dhonn Herself.</p><p>In my youth and folly, I thought I had found it straightaway in the form of Raphael de Mereliot, the healer with the charmed touch\u2014Raphael, who was able to merge his gift with mine, to channel my magic to heal others. Raphael, the Queen\u2019s favorite courtier and lover.</p><p>We had wrought miracles together.</p><p>And it had nearly killed me.</p><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for the Queen herself, it very well might have killed me. Jehanne de la Courcel. There, at least, was a memory that made me smile. Gods, I\u2019d gotten myself involved in an almighty tangle when I came between Jehanne and Raphael. And yet in the end, it was Jehanne who had rescued me from Raphael\u2019s ambition, and Jehanne whom I had come to love. My father was a priest of Naamah, the D\u2019Angeline goddess of desire, and his line was ancient in her service. Naamah\u2019s gifts ran strongly in my blood. I had found pleasure and pride in serving as Jehanne\u2019s companion.</p><p>It had hurt to leave her. It had been too soon. When my infernal destiny summoned me to accompany Master Lo Feng, Jehanne was carrying the King\u2019s child, and she was frightened. I wished I could have stayed until the child was born.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t regret leaving, though. Not after the purpose I had served in Ch\u2019in. I had seen the dragon, once restored, launch himself in glory from White Jade Mountain, his undulating silver coils gleaming against the blue sky. I had ridden in his claw; I\u2019d seen him summon the rain and drown the terrible weapons of the Divine Thunder, ending the war. I\u2019d seen my impossibly valiant princess Snow Tiger restored to honor.</p><p>And yet.....</p><p>Bao.</p><p>My diadh-anam flared as my thoughts circled back to him. When had I even begun to harbor a fondness for him? I couldn\u2019t say. Somewhere in the long hours we spent together in Terre d\u2019Ange while Master Lo Feng taught us the Five Styles. Mayhap it was the first time I\u2019d won an almost-smile from him.</p><p>It was on the long journey on the greatship to Ch\u2019in that matters had changed between us. Thrust into constant companionship, Bao and I had become friends, then lovers. I\u2019d caught a glimpse of the complicated knot of pride, stubbornness, and romantic yearning that lay behind his insouciant exterior. And Bao.....</p><p>I don\u2019t know what Bao felt for me, not really. Out of bed, we were always a little bit guarded with one another, neither of us certain how much our relationship owed to convenience, proximity, and Master Lo\u2019s unsubtle encouragement.</p><p>If things had fallen out otherwise, it might have been different.</p><p>But once we reached Shuntian, the imprisoned dragon\u2019s jealousy had come between us, forcing us to be circumspect in our behavior. Later, we had said to one another; later. Over and over, in stolen moments throughout our long quest, we said this to one another. When this is all over, if we live through it, we will talk. Later.</p><p>A lump rose to my throat, forcing me to swallow hard.</p><p>My hands trembled on the reins.</p><p>There had been no later, because Bao had died. It was a moment etched in my memory. The captured sorcerer Black Sleeve turning in a graceful, unrepentant arc, the deadly sleeve of his robe flaring wide. A spray of poisoned darts.</p><p>The dragon\u2019s helpless roar.</p><p>Bao whirling, his broken staff in two pieces in his hands, intercepting the barrage.</p><p>Bao, dying.</p><p>One dart, a single dart, had gotten past him, had pierced his throat beneath the chiseled angle of his jaw. It had been enough.</p><p>I breathed the Breath of Ocean\u2019s Rolling Waves, the most calming of all the Five Styles. I let the memories wash over me.</p><p>I should have known; of course, I should have known. Master Lo had as good as told me. Today, I realize I have lived too long, he said. Emperor Zhu had known what he meant. For the first and only time, Master Lo had asked me to share my gift with him, his dark eyes grave and anguished. Are you willing to give a part of yourself that my magpie might live?</p><p>I remembered my frantic reply.</p><p>Anything!</p><p>I should have known, but I didn\u2019t. When Master Lo Feng placed his hands on Bao\u2019s unmoving chest, I laid my hands over his and poured my energy into him, until I felt myself begin to fade and go away, until I saw the stone doorway that represents the portal into the afterlife for the folk of the Maghuin Dhonn. For a moment, I thought I would pass through it, and the thought was not unwelcome.</p><p>Then my diadh-anam blazed and doubled.....</p><p>..... waking inside Bao.</p><p>Bao came to life with a startled shout, thrust out of the realms of death. Master Lo passed from it peacefully, his chin sinking to his chest, his eyes closing forever.</p><p>What would I have done if I had known, if I had grasped what should have been obvious? I cannot say. And in truth, it does not matter.</p><p>What was done, is done.</p><p>On that day, my stubborn peasant-boy went away from me. He told me he did not blame me for our mentor\u2019s death. He told me that if he had been given the opportunity to choose, he would have chosen to spend his life with me.</p><p>But he died without being given that chance, and what Master Lo did in restoring his life, dividing the divine spark of my diadh-anam between us, bound us together in a way that only a second death could undo.</p><p>And Bao needed to find a way to choose this, to make it his own. To reconcile the hard choices and uncertainties that had yoked my destiny to his, to believe that I had chosen him out of genuine desire and love, that it wasn\u2019t merely Master Lo\u2019s art at work.</p><p>So I let him go.</p><p>And I waited for him to come back to me. All the while I travelled Ch\u2019in and served as the Emperor\u2019s swallower-of-memories, I waited for Bao. The Imperial entourage returned in triumph to Shuntian, where I waited for Bao. In the gardens of the Celestial City, I listened to poetry with the princess and waited for Bao.</p><p>He didn\u2019t come.</p><p>Instead, I sensed him moving farther away from me, carrying the twinned flame of my diadh-anam inside him. Moving away from me, toward the outskirts of the empire, toward the Great Wall that kept the Tatar horde at bay.</p><p>It was the princess\u2014Snow Tiger, my brave, lovely princess\u2014who reminded me that I, too, had a choice. She had given me the greatest gift of all, the fragile gift of trust. In the beginning, I had been nothing but an unwelcome burden to her; her necessary inconvenience, she had called me. Much had changed between us by the end, and I carried private, tender memories of her that warmed my heart.</p><p>But nothing, nothing could replace what I had lost. And yes, I had a choice. So I had set out to find my stubborn peasant-boy.</p><p>If Bao would not come to me, I would go to him.</p><p>At least, I hoped so.</p><p>TWO</p><p>I took a room at a travellers\u2019 inn that first night. There was a time when I would have eschewed man-made walls for the freedom of the outdoors, but I had grown more civilized since leaving my home in Alba. After a long day\u2019s ride, the notion of a hot meal and a roof over my head appealed to me.</p><p>The ostler at the stable gaped at the sight of me, revealing a few missing teeth. On the road, I\u2019d managed not to attract overmuch attention merely by dint of keeping my head lowered and my eyes averted. To be sure, a seemingly well-off young woman travelling alone drew curious glances, but at a quick, stealthy glance, with my coloring I could almost pass for Ch\u2019in. My straight, black hair, I\u2019d inherited from my mother. My skin was a warm golden hue, fairer than my mother\u2019s, but not nearly so fair as my D\u2019Angeline father\u2019s milk-white skin.</p><p>I had his eyes, though. Green as grass, green as the rushes grow. And I had a measure of the fearful, keen-edged symmetry of D\u2019Angeline beauty, coupled with the untamed spark of the Maghuin Dhonn. No one looking me full in the face could mistake me for aught but what I was: the Emperor\u2019s jade-eyed witch.</p><p>The ostler barked at a young stable-lad in an unfamiliar dialect. The boy went pelting toward the inn proper. I settled my battered canvas satchel over my shoulder and followed him. I hadn\u2019t gone ten steps before a solidly built middle-aged woman, clearly the proprietress of the establishment, came bustling down the path toward me. Her shrewd gaze raked me over, taking in my fine robes, my jade bangles, and the Emperor\u2019s medallion.</p><p>I bowed in the Ch\u2019in manner, hand over fist, and spoke in the Shuntian scholar\u2019s tongue, the only one I knew. \u201cGreetings, Honored Aunt. I seek lodging for the night.\u201d</p><p>A smile broke over her face. \u201cYou are the foreign witch, are you not? The one who freed the dragon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>She clutched my arm in a companionable manner, tugging me toward the inn. \u201cCome, come! We are honored to give you hospitality. No charge, no charge at all. You must call me Auntie Li.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very kind,\u201d I said politely. \u201cBut I can pay.\u201d</p><p>The proprietress snorted, squeezed my arm, and gave me a conspiratorial wink. \u201cI\u2019m nothing of the sort, child. I\u2019m a greedy old widow who knows that folk will pay to hear tales of the Emperor\u2019s witch\u2019s stay here. Indulge me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cAll right, Auntie Li.\u201d</p><p>She was right, of course. A silence fell over the common room of the inn when she ushered me inside. Men paused, teacups halfway to their mouths, staring.</p><p>But I was used to it.</p><p>I\u2019d been stared at a great deal in my short life. In Alba, I had been my mother\u2019s well-kept secret\u2014not due to any sense of shame, but simply my mother\u2019s own taciturn nature. Folk there had found it startling that a woman of the Maghuin Dhonn, a descendant of Alais the Wise, had borne a half-D\u2019Angeline child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In Terre d\u2019Ange, folk had found it just as startling that a full-blooded D\u2019Angeline man\u2014a Priest of Naamah, no less\u2014had chosen to couple with one of the infamous bear-witches of the Maghuin Dhonn, fathering a child on her.</p><p>And in Ch\u2019in.....</p><p>Vast as it was, the mighty empire of Ch\u2019in was insular, circumscribed by its Great Wall and its outer shores. No one in that inn knew or cared aught about my heritage. I was the foreign witch who had helped free the dragon. It was enough.</p> <p>\u201cSit.\u201d Auntie Li showed me to a low table, pressed on my shoulder.</p><p>I sat.</p><p>She clapped her hands together. Food came\u2014hot, steamed dumplings with spiced pork and a dipping sauce. Noodle soup with green onions floating atop the broth and chicken feet stewed until they were gelatinous and tender. Auntie Li hovered over me, pouring hot water into my teacup whenever it grew low, nodding approvingly as I shoveled noodles into my mouth and sucked chicken flesh from the bone, tilting the bowl to slurp the dregs of the broth.</p><p>\u201cYou eat like a proper Ch\u2019in woman,\u201d she observed.</p><p>I lowered the bowl. \u201cI\u2019ve had practice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Her shrewd gaze measured me. \u201cIs it true you seek the twice-born one?\u201d</p><p>I paused. \u201cTwice-born?\u201d</p><p>Auntie Li beckoned to one of her servers. He bowed and brought a small porcelain jar with two cups. She made an impatient gesture. \u201cDrink your tea, drink it down. Indulge me, child. I will read the leaves for you while we enjoy this wine.\u201d</p><p>I downed my tea, leaving the leaves strewn and stranded on the bottom and the sides of the thin porcelain cup. Auntie Li studied them, tilting the cup this way and that. She set it aside and poured a measure of rice-wine for both of us, motioning for me to drink.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I obeyed. \u201cWhat did you mean by the twice-born one, Auntie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn once into life, twice out of death, or so they are saying.\u201d Her brow furrowed. She drank her own rice-wine, then picked up the teacup again and bent her head over it, a straight white line delineating the part in her hair. \u201cHints of your fate are written here. Do you see? Here and here?\u201d</p> <p>I peered at the tea leaves. Despite Snow Tiger\u2019s best efforts, I was fairly illiterate when it came to reading Ch\u2019in characters. During that last week I had lingered in Shuntian, she had teased me about it, wielding her long, braided hair like a ticklish brush and drawing characters on my bare skin.</p><p>Surely you recognize that one, Moirin.</p><p>The memory made me smile. I saw the shape of that character echoed in the pattern of the tea leaves. \u201cDesire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesire, yes.\u201d Auntie Li nodded. Her forefinger moved, pointing. \u201cBut you see here, it lies in conflict with judgment. Does that mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>I thought about it before shaking my head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know. Whose judgment, Auntie? Mine?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI can only tell you what the leaves say. I cannot tell you what it means. Desire in conflict with judgment lies ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be sure, it lies behind me.\u201d Raphael de Mereliot\u2019s face surfaced in my thoughts, his grey eyes stormy with anger. Even though there were untold oceans between us, it made me shiver. I had been very young and very foolish. I\u2019d let Raphael use me to summon fallen spirits. If it hadn\u2019t been for Bao and Master Lo, a terrible force would have been loosed into the world. \u201cBut that is not a mistake I will make again.\u201d</p><p>Auntie Li smiled wryly, refilling our cups with rice-wine. \u201cThere are no end of mistakes to be made, dear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I making one now?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>Her face softened. \u201cAh, child! I cannot tell you that, either. Do you love the boy? Is that why you seek him?\u201d</p><p>A hundred memories of Bao cascaded through my mind: Bao staring insolently at me as I sought to master the Five Styles of Breathing, Bao shouting at me as he drove the demon spirit back, Bao helping Master Lo tenderly to his feet, Bao sporting his battle-grin as he sparred with Snow Tiger.</p><p>It should have been simple, only it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I did love him. I remembered the moment I had realized it. When I had first fled Shuntian with the dragon-possessed princess and a handful of loyal ruffians, Bao and Master Lo had gone ahead to lay a false trail. They had been late in returning, and I\u2019d begun to fear they weren\u2019t coming.</p><p>I would not let that happen, Moirin.</p><p>Those were the words Bao had spoken when they did arrive and I confessed my fear to him, the closest he\u2019d ever come to a declaration of love. My heart had leapt.</p><p>And yet.....</p><p>It wasn\u2019t why I was following him. I was following him because he had half of my diadh-anam and I couldn\u2019t do otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Auntie,\u201d I said truthfully at last. \u201cIt\u2019s a question I\u2019m hoping to answer, and I cannot do it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor child.\u201d Auntie Li patted my hand. The look of kindness in her shrewd eyes nearly undid me. \u201cDon\u2019t pay too much heed to an old lady\u2019s rambling. If the boy\u2019s got a lick of sense, he won\u2019t run far.\u201d</p><p>I smiled despite the sting of tears. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he does.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her rice-wine. \u201cThat probably makes two of you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p><p>So began the pattern of my days.</p><p>For the most part, it was a lonely time. I thought I was accustomed to solitude. I\u2019d grown up in the Alban wilderness with only my mother\u2019s companionship. But she had been a constant in my life; and later, there had been Cillian, my lost first love, killed in a foolish cattle-raid.</p><p>Here, I had no one.</p><p>Oh, there were folk I met along the way, though none who took so lively an interest in me as Auntie Li. But with each new day that dawned, I was forced to leave them behind and set out on my lonely road.</p><p>I was grateful for the company of my horses. I named the chestnut saddle-horse Ember, and the grey pack-horse I called Coal. As a child of the Maghuin Dhonn, I was able to sense their thoughts and moods in a way most folk couldn\u2019t. Betimes I would let my thoughts drift, touching theirs, enjoying the simplicity of their reactions to the world around them.</p><p>Betimes I immersed my own thoughts in the world around me, breathing the Breath of Trees Growing and listening to nature.</p><p>Winter was coming, sooner than I would have hoped. I heard it in the sleepy murmurings of the trees, the sap growing sluggish in their veins. I heard it in the anxious whispers of the winter wheat in the fields, straining to outrace the coming frost. I saw it in the worried faces of farmers along the way.</p><p>The days began to grow shorter.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t worried, not yet. So long as I was in the empire of Ch\u2019in, I was safe. I could always find a place to lodge, supplies to purchase. It grew harder to communicate as I rode, for the farther away from Shuntian I went, the fewer folk spoke the scholar\u2019s tongue. Still, I managed with friendly gestures and a few words of dialect picked up along the way; and the Emperor\u2019s seal spoke for itself.</p><p>But I was fairly certain Bao was no longer in Ch\u2019in.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t be sure beyond doubt. It was a vast country. Still, when Snow Tiger had bade me consult my diadh-anam in conjunction with a map, it had been clear that Bao was headed for Tatar territory.</p><p>And I had a suspicion of the reason why.</p><p>Master Lo\u2019s tranquil voice echoed in my memory. Through no fault of his own, Bao is a child of violence.</p><p>Violence.</p><p>Rape, he meant\u2014the crime D\u2019Angelines called heresy. Folk who know no better reckon D\u2019Angelines are a licentious lot. They are not entirely wrong\u2014in Terre d\u2019Ange, all manner of love and desire is freely celebrated\u2014but it is far from the whole truth. Blessed Elua, the earth-begotten son of Yeshua ben Yosef and Mary the Magdalene, the deity who Naamah and the other Companions chose to follow, turning their backs on the One God\u2019s Heaven, gave his people one simple precept: Love as thou wilt.</p><p>So they do, but it is within the bounds of the sacred tenet of consensuality. To violate it is to commit heresy.</p><p>Bao\u2019s mother had been raped during a Tatar raid, that much I knew. When it became evident that he was the result of that violence, and not the legitimate offspring of his parents\u2019 marriage, they had sold him into servitude to a travelling circus. He had been trained and raised as an acrobat, but fighting was in his blood. At the age of thirteen, he had begged the troupe\u2019s best stick-fighter to teach him. And Bao had been willing to pay any price to learn.</p><p>He say, you be my peach-bottom boy, I teach you.</p><p>Thinking on it, I shuddered.</p><p>In some ways, I think it troubled me more than it did Bao. I hadn\u2019t been raised to think of myself as a D\u2019Angeline\u2014indeed, I was ten years old before it occurred to me to wonder who my father was\u2014but I had always felt Naamah\u2019s presence in my life. The bright lady, I had called her. When the Maghuin Dhonn Herself at once accepted me as Her child and sent me forth to seek my destiny, I had no idea where to begin. So I set out to solve the only mystery I knew, and crossed the Straits to seek my father in Terre d\u2019Ange.</p><p>I had found him, too; and as it transpired, he was one of the loveliest, gentlest souls I had ever encountered. When I was in a mood to resent my infernal destiny, one of the things I resented the most was that it had taken me away from my father so soon, when I\u2019d scarce had a chance to know him.</p><p>The other, of course, was leaving Jehanne.</p><p>Well and so, it was done, and even on my darkest days, I could not deny there was a purpose in it. And I could not help but think that Bao travelled a similar path. He had died. His soul had travelled to the Ch\u2019in spirit world. Because he had died a hero\u2019s death, the merciful Maiden of Gentle Aspect had intervened to spare him the judgment of the Yama Kings. And then he found himself reborn into his body, with his soul inextricably yoked to mine and his mentor Master Lo Feng dead.</p><p>None of that was reason to seek out his marauding rapist of a father, of course. Not at all. On the surface of things, it made no sense. But I thought he would do the same thing I had done when confronted with an unwanted destiny, and set out to solve the only mystery he knew. With Master Lo dead, Bao had nowhere else to go.</p><p>Besides, I could sense him somewhere beyond me, moving farther and farther away.</p><p>If I could have followed him as the crow flies, I could have closed the distance between us more swiftly, but I was constrained by the terrain to follow the roads. Still, Bao would have faced the same constraints. In village after village I asked after him as best I could, usually with mixed results.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have the luxury of keeping a low profile in face-to-face encounters. Bao did. A young Ch\u2019in man travelling on his own, carrying little more than a satchel and a battered bamboo staff across his back, was not a remarkable sight. And I didn\u2019t even know for a surety under what name he went. I knew him as Bao, but I had learned that that wasn\u2019t a proper name, but the baby-name his mother had called him. Treasure, it meant; at least when spoken with the right intonation.</p><p>It was a name Bao had reclaimed when he cast his lot in with Master Lo Feng, abandoning the stick-fighters and thugs in Shuntian he had once led, leaving everything behind to become Master Lo\u2019s magpie, a journey that had taken him all the way to Terre d\u2019Ange. For a long time, I\u2019d wondered why he\u2019d made such a choice.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a pretty tale.</p><p>Bao had told me on the greatship. A young boy had come to him and begged him to teach him to fight. Bao had agreed..... for the same price that the man who taught him had charged.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I would have responded to Bao\u2019s tale had he gone through with the bargain. I might not have been raised with Blessed Elua\u2019s precept and the sacred tenet of consensuality, but I was Naamah\u2019s child as surely as the Maghuin Dhonn Herself\u2019s, and I had taken those beliefs deep to heart.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t gone through with it. Confronted with the naked, shivering, stripling boy, Bao had walked away from his bargain, walked away from his life. He had taken Master Lo\u2019s offer, an offer he had jeered at only days before, and reinvented himself.</p><p>Everything I have done in my life, good and bad, I have chosen. But this, I did not choose.</p><p>That was what Bao said the day he left me.</p><p>\u201cStupid boy,\u201d I muttered to myself as I rode, not really meaning it. I tried not to dwell on it, tried not to wonder if he would be angry at me for following him. He had to know I was on his trail. He could feel my presence as surely as I could sense his.</p><p>And I tried not to worry about the distance that yet lay between us, the shortening days, the trees growing increasingly barren of leaves, the chill in the air.</p><p>Here and there, I found folk who remembered Bao\u2019s passage. He might not have stood out as unmistakably as I did, but he was memorable in his own way. Even from the beginning, there had been an air of coiled intensity to him, a feral glitter to his dark eyes that put me in mind of my own people. It was not unthinkable; although the Maghuin Dhonn have dwelled in Alba for time out of mind, there are tales among us of an older time, when the world was covered in ice and we followed the Great Bear Herself out of a frozen wasteland to warmer climes.</p><p>That was when there were still great magicians among us, shape-changers capable of taking the form of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself. We lost that gift generations ago when the magician Berlik broke an oath he swore by stone and sea and all that they encompass, on his very diadh-anam. Now, only small gifts remain to us; or so I had thought. My mother taught me to summon the twilight when I was but a child, a gift meant for hiding and concealment.</p><p>But as I\u2019d grown to adulthood, I\u2019d found it has other uses. To summon the twilight is to take half a step into the spirit world. It could also serve to make a gateway that allows the energy of the spirit world to spill into ours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I discovered first that I had a knack for coaxing plants to grow. It seemed a simple and benign gift, mayhap a legacy of my father. Although he is a child of Naamah through and through, the lineage of Anael, the Good Steward, also runs in his veins.</p><p>It was Raphael de Mereliot who discovered that my gift could be used for other purposes. In a twisted way, I supposed I owed him a debt of gratitude. Had he not done so, had he not used my magic to work miracles of healing, my lovely father would have died of an infection of the lungs. Had Raphael not persuaded me to help him summon fallen spirits, I would not possess the gift one of them gave me on a whim, a charm to reveal hidden things. Were it not for that charm, Snow Tiger would have drowned in the lake below White Jade Mountain with the pearl that lodged the dragon\u2019s soul hidden in her mortal flesh.</p><p>Gods, the links that bind one person\u2019s ambition and desire to another\u2019s fate are complicated things! One could go mad thinking on it. But I knew for a surety that if Raphael had not used my gift thusly, Bao would still be dead. Master Lo Feng would never have known to use my gift to exchange his life for Bao\u2019s.</p> <p>Being touched by death had changed Bao. Its touch clung to him, lent him a faint aura of shimmering darkness. Bao had died, and yet lived. He alone in the world was twice-born. So it did not surprise me to find folk who remembered him along the way.</p><p>And having guessed at his purpose, it should not have surprised me to come across the village of his birth as I followed in his tracks.</p><p>Yet somehow, it did.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>The village was called Tonghe. There was nothing to distinguish it from the dozens of others through which I had passed along the way, and I would not have chosen to stay there if my inquiries in the market had not proved fruitful. When I described Bao using a combination of dialect and gestures, an elderly woman selling squashes nodded vigorously and pointed across the square toward a handful of men huddled over a set of dominoes.</p> <p>Even though my diadh-anam assured me that Bao was many, many leagues away, my heart soared, and I had to look twice to assure myself he wasn\u2019t among them. The squash seller tugged my arm and spoke volubly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grandmother.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at me, then gave a penetrating shout. A boy of some ten years came at a pelting run, listening and nodding as she spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Noble Barbarian Lady!\u201d Despite his rough-spun attire, he addressed me in the scholar\u2019s tongue, speaking with careful precision. He bowed three times in rapid succession and then straightened, his wide eyes taking in my horses, my robes, and the Emperor\u2019s medallion around my neck. \u201cI am Hui. Grandmother Fang says I am to translate for you. You seek the stick-fighter from Shuntian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cWas he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d Hui pointed at the men playing dominoes. \u201cThat is his father.\u201d His grandmother cuffed him and muttered. He lowered his voice. \u201cOr at least, that is the husband of his mother.\u201d</p> <p>I tried to guess which of the men he was indicating. None of them looked like Bao\u2014but then, none of them would. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Grandmother Fang offered helpful commentary. The boy listened, then translated. \u201cOnce he was a farmer. Now he does nothing but drink rice-wine and gamble at dominoes all day. Do you want to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cIs the stick-fighter\u2019s mother here, too?\u201d</p><p>Hui nodded and relayed the question to his grandmother. \u201cYes, but she works in a sewing shop, she and her daughter. They must make a living since Ang Shen has become a drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to meet all of them.\u201d I clasped my hand over my fist and bowed from the saddle. \u201cMy thanks to you and your honored grandmother. Is there an inn where I might lodge?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, then turned to his grandmother. After another exchange, he said, \u201cGrandmother Fang says you must stay with us as an honored guest. Your horses can stay in the pen with the goat.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head, touching the purse that hung from my belt. \u201cOf course, she will allow me a small gesture of thanks.\u201d</p><p>That at least needed no translation. Grandmother Fang grinned and gave an effusive nod.</p> <p>I let Hui lead me to the home he shared with his mother, father, two younger sisters, and his grandmother on the outskirts of town, collecting my thoughts while he chattered excitedly, telling me that he was the prodigy of the family and he meant to sit for the scholar\u2019s examination that would allow him to become a civil servant when he came of age. In the doorway of their humble house, his mother greeted us with gracious amazement, a round-faced toddler peering out from behind her skirts.</p><p>\u201cCome around back!\u201d Hui reached up to tug on Ember\u2019s reins. \u201cI will show you the goat pen.\u201d</p><p>In the rear of the house, there was a sizable garden with well-tended crops of squash and soybean\u2014and indeed, a small pen with a wise-eyed goat. With Hui\u2019s assistance, I unsaddled Ember and unloaded Coal\u2019s packs, stowing the gear beneath a weathered lean-to. He fetched a fresh bucket of water and watched with avid curiosity as I checked both horses\u2019 hooves for cracks or stones.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you not have servants, Noble Barbarian Lady?\u201d Hui asked.</p><p>I worked at prying a pebble loose from the frog of Ember\u2019s right front hoof. The chestnut bent his neck and lipped my hair with idle affection. \u201cBecause I do not think the man I am following would like it if I came after him with an army of servants. And you may call me by my name, which is Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d He pronounced it with the awkward Ch\u2019in lilt I found charming. \u201cIs it true what he said, then? The stick-fighter from Shuntian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I released Ember\u2019s foreleg and stroked his neck. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Hui glanced around. \u201cIt is rumored that he claimed to be one of those who guarded Princess Snow Tiger on her quest to free the dragon and end the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI was there.\u201d</p><p>Hui\u2019s dark gaze travelled from the medallion around my neck to my face. \u201cYou\u2019re her. The Emperor\u2019s jade-eyed witch.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cSome say so. I say I am my own, and no one else\u2019s. But aye, the tales are true, and I was there. So was Bao.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The boy whispered the word, then swallowed visibly. \u201cAng Shen did not believe the stories. He told the stick-fighter to go away.\u201d</p><p>My heart ached for Bao. \u201cMayhap Ang Shen will believe it when I tell him.\u201d</p><p>Hui looked dubious. \u201cMayhap he will.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>In the early hours of the afternoon, I returned to the village square to meet with Bao\u2019s father\u2014or at least, the husband of his mother. Hui came with me to translate, his pride in the task offset by a certain degree of anxiety. There were four men yet huddled over the dominoes, sharing a jar of rice-wine.</p><p>\u201cAng Shen?\u201d I bowed politely to the man Hui pointed out to me, a Ch\u2019in fellow with a prematurely lined face, his black hair peppered with silver, clad in well-mended clothes. Since he did not rise, I knelt to offer him the respect due an elder in Ch\u2019in society, sitting on my heels in the D\u2019Angeline courtesan\u2019s manner that Jehanne had shown me. \u201cI would speak to you of your son, Bao.\u201d</p><p>Hui translated.</p><p>The other three domino players left off their game and stared at me with open fascination. Villagers drifted near to eavesdrop. Ang Shen grunted, fingered the tiles, and refused to meet my eyes. \u201cI have no son,\u201d he said in a rough variant of the scholar\u2019s tongue.</p><p>\u201cYour wife\u2019s son, then,\u201d I said.</p><p>His shoulders tensed. \u201cMy wife bore no sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I said softly. \u201cShe did. And it seems he sought you out. \u2019Tis no business of mine to tell you how to respond to such circumstances. But one thing I will tell you. Whatever Bao told you was true, and I doubt he told you the half of it. He is a hero. I know, for I was there. He saved the princess\u2019 life and mine at the cost of his own. He died, and was born again.\u201d</p><p>Ang Shen shuddered and lifted his head, his expression fierce. \u201cWould I have sold such a son away?\u201d he demanded of me. Startled, I rocked back on my heels. \u201cNo!\u201d His eyes blazed. \u201cNo, no, no! I would not have done such a thing, so this man claiming to be such a person must lie. Else, what am I? What monster, what waste of flesh? It cannot be true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is!\u201d I insisted.</p><p>Both of us surged to our feet.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t expected violence. If I had, I would have kept my distance from him. I would have brought my bow and quiver, the sturdy yew-wood bow my uncle Mabon had made for me. My fingers twitched, longing for the string as Ang Shen breathed hard in my face, leaning forward, his breath smelling of stale rice-wine, his expression adamant and anguished. \u201cI have no son.\u201d</p><p>I bowed. \u201cMy mistake, sir. If you did, and if he had come seeking your acceptance, you would have been proud of him.\u201d</p><p>I left.</p><p>Hui trotted after me. \u201cThat didn\u2019t go so well, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I spied the slender figure of a girl hiking her robes to her knees and beating a hasty retreat across the square, the soles of her straw sandals slapping against her heels. Her fleet, agile grace struck a familiar chord. \u201cIt is obvious that Ang Shen is a proud man who feels grief and guilt. Hui, would that be his daughter?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cUh-huh. That\u2019s Ang Song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s follow her.\u201d</p><p>Hui beamed. \u201cYes, Moirin!\u201d</p><p>We followed Song to a modest sewing shop, arriving in time to see her being scolded by the proprietress, who had the girl\u2019s earlobe pinched in a firm grip as she harangued her. Song protested and squirmed, more with dismay than discomfort.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, madame,\u201d I said politely. \u201cI would like to speak to this girl.\u201d</p><p>Hui translated.</p><p>The proprietress turned on me with irritation, then gaped with comical surprise. She let go of Song\u2019s earlobe and stroked the girl\u2019s braided hair with an absentminded affection that belied her scolding, then questioned Hui in the local dialect. He grinned and replied. The proprietress bowed and spoke rapidly, gesturing at the door.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Ai says you are most welcome here, Moirin,\u201d Hui said helpfully. \u201cOf course, you may come in and speak to Song and her mother. If you would like to purchase some very fine embroidery work, that would also be good.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cMy thanks.\u201d</p><p>Auntie Ai led us through the crowded front room with squares of embroidered fabric stacked in piles. Although most of the material was plain cotton, the quality of the embroidery was indeed quite fine. The girl Song stole glances at me, her face alight with eager curiosity. She was a pretty girl, and I saw traces of Bao in the shape of her ears, the angle of her jaw, and her full lips. She couldn\u2019t have been more than twelve or thirteen, hovering on the brink of womanhood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her?\u201d she asked me shyly, speaking the scholar\u2019s tongue with more skill than her father.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>She clapped her hands together with unbridled delight. Auntie Ai shook her head, but she smiled, too.</p><p>I knew Bao\u2019s mother at a glance. She rose to her feet in amazement as we entered the sewing chamber, a tangle of fabric and silk thread spilling from her lap. One hand touched her lips, her eyes brightening with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady,\u201d I said gently.</p><p>A joyful laugh spilled from her. \u201cI knew he would not lie! Oh, tell me! Tell me everything!\u201d</p><p>So I did, once Auntie Ai had bustled around and served cups of hot, fragrant tea and sweet bean-cakes. I told the whole long story of how I had met Bao and Master Lo Feng in Terre d\u2019Ange, how Master Lo had taken me on as a student. How I had accompanied them across many seas in a greatship when the Emperor\u2019s men came to fetch Master Lo to tend to the afflicted princess.</p><p>\u201cIs it true that Princess Snow Tiger killed her husband on their wedding night?\u201d Song asked in a hushed whisper.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d I nodded. \u201cIt was a very awful thing. Everyone thought it was a demon that possessed her. But it was the dragon, waking in terror and panicking at finding himself trapped in her flesh.\u201d</p><p>It was worse than they knew. The dragon had awoken while Snow Tiger and her bridegroom were engaged in the act of love. In his panic, the celestial creature had struck out in blind terror, and with dragon-infused strength, the princess had torn her bridegroom from limb to limb. I knew, I had seen her memories. After she had come to trust me, I had held her in the small hours of darkness when the nightmares came.</p><p>\u201cBut you saw the dragon inside her!\u201d Song said triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI did. And with the magic that is the gift of my mother\u2019s people, I was able to let the princess see the dragon in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>Bao\u2019s mother, whose name was Yingtai, shook her head in wonder.</p><p>I told the rest of the story, from our escape from Shuntian and our journey in disguise across Ch\u2019in to our victory at White Jade Mountain. Hui translated in a low tone for Auntie Ai. They knew it, of course. Everyone in Ch\u2019in knew it. Bao had told it to them himself. But it was the sort of story that bore hearing over and over, the sort of story for retelling during long winter nights around the fire.</p><p>When I had finished, Yingtai sighed with profound pleasure. \u201cI knew he was not lying,\u201d she said in a soft, wistful voice.</p><p>\u201cYour husband did not believe him,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her brow furrowed. \u201cAng Shen is a good man at heart. After the Tatar raid, after it was clear that Bao was not his son..... the shame of it broke him.\u201d She glanced at her daughter. \u201cThen, for many years, I did not get pregnant again. He..... perhaps we did not try often enough. In ten years of trying, Song is our only child. When my Bao returned claiming a hero\u2019s status, it broke him all over again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Song fidgeted. \u201cFather is disappointed that I am a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he might think on the pride that Emperor Zhu takes in his daughter,\u201d I suggested. \u201cA pride the entire Empire shares.\u201d</p><p>That made her smile. \u201cIs Princess Snow Tiger as beautiful and brave as they say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery bit and more,\u201d I assured her. \u201cNow, tell me about Bao. How long did he stay? How long has he been gone? Did he say where he was bound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was troubled.\u201d Bao\u2019s mother\u2019s gaze rested on me, careworn and concerned. \u201cI did not understand..... he died? And you brought him back to life?\u201d</p><p>I had skipped that part of the tale, reckoning it was not something a mother wanted to hear. \u201cHe died, yes, struck by one of Black Sleeve\u2019s poisoned darts. It was Master Lo Feng who used my magic to trade his life for Bao\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Yingtai looked away. \u201cI could see that there was a shadow over him. He was at odds with himself. He asked me..... he asked me about the Tatar who fathered him. If there was aught I could tell him.\u201d</p><p>The sewing room was very quiet.</p> <p>\u201cWas there?\u201d I asked at length.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked back at me. \u201cHe had a scar, here.\u201d She drew a line from brow to cheek over her right eye. \u201cI have not forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Yingtai gave a stoic shrug. \u201cMen can be cruel. I begged Bao not to seek him out. Even if he succeeds, I can see no reason for it.\u201d She folded her hands in her lap, studying me. \u201cAlthough he did not declare his feelings, his face changes when he speaks of you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAt last, I asked him. Why, when his feelings for you were written so clearly on his face, was he going in the opposite direction? He could not explain it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he knows,\u201d I said. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe is searching for an answer for which no question exists.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled ruefully. \u201cThat sounds about right.\u201d Feeling the weight of strong emotion in the cloistered room, I changed the subject. \u201cHow did you learn the scholar\u2019s tongue? You speak it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom my grandfather.\u201d Yingtai stroked her daughter\u2019s hair. \u201cA long time ago. I taught Song as much as I remember.\u201d</p><p>Song cast a sharp glance toward Hui, who was surreptitiously stuffing the second to last of the sweet bean-cakes into his mouth. \u201cIf I were a boy, I would sit for the examination one day!\u201d</p><p>He sputtered a defiant, unintelligible reply. Auntie Ai cuffed his head absently and snatched the plate away, offering it insistently to me. I took the last sweet out of politeness, the jade bangles around my wrist tinkling as I reached for it.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Song touched one of the bangles. \u201cSo beautiful! May I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I extended both arms. Her slender fingers danced over the polished stone bracelets. \u201cThat one is the exact color of the reflecting pool beneath White Jade Mountain, where the dragon gazes at himself,\u201d I said when she paused over my favorite, a vivid translucent green bangle. \u201cThe very place where we freed him. Princess Snow Tiger chose it herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d She pointed at the bangle next to it, a deeper, more intense shade of green.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called Imperial jade.\u201d I touched another, a pale milky-white bangle with cloudy patches. \u201cThis is leopard jade. And this, this red one is said to bring luck. Which is your favorite?\u201d</p> <p>Song contemplated the six bangles I wore with great seriousness. \u201cThis one,\u201d she said at length, touching a clear, pale green piece with honey-colored highlights. \u201cIt looks like a river in sunlight with fish swimming in it.\u201d</p><p>I worked it free. \u201cThen it is my gift to you.\u201d</p><p>Auntie Ai\u2019s eyes bulged, and she hissed in urgent dialect.</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Bao\u2019s mother said in protest. \u201cIt is too much!\u201d</p><p>I ignored her. \u201cPick one for your mother,\u201d I whispered conspiratorially to Song. \u201cWhich one do you think she would like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d Hui tugged at my sleeve, glancing over his shoulder. \u201cAh..... Auntie Ai does not think you know how much those are worth.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him, too. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>One by one, Song walked her fingers over the remaining five bangles that hung from my wrists, slow and deliberative. \u201cI think Mother would like this one that looks like the dragon\u2019s pool,\u201d she said somberly. \u201cBut it would be wrong to take it from you. So I choose this one.\u201d She touched the bangle of Imperial green jade, glancing up at me. \u201cThe one that is the color of your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and began to work it loose. \u201cA very good choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I pressed the jade bangle into Yingtai\u2019s resistant hands. \u201cBao came to you penniless, didn\u2019t he? If he had stayed, if he had not fled, the Emperor would have rewarded him generously for his service. Please.\u201d I folded her hands over the bracelet. \u201cAccept this small token.\u201d</p><p>Bao\u2019s mother shook her head. \u201cAng Shen will insist\u2014\u201d</p><p>Song flinched.</p><p>\u201cI will speak to him,\u201d I said. \u201cI will tell him that if he sells these bracelets to drink and gamble, it will bring such a curse down upon him that he will reckon his life has been paradise before now.\u201d</p><p>Hui stared at me, his eyes stretched wide. \u201cCan you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I lied. \u201cI am the Emperor\u2019s witch, am I not?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Yingtai\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou cannot understand what this means.\u201d She turned the bangle in her hands. \u201cA jade piece of such quality, a gift from his Celestial Majesty\u2019s own hands..... Moirin, it is enough to provide Song with a dowry to marry well, better than I ever dared to hope for her.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her. \u201cThen I have done a better thing than I reckoned,\u201d I said.</p><p>We spoke for a while longer. They told me about Bao\u2019s visit, and that he had departed several weeks ago, bound to cross the Great Wall through the gateway a dozen li to the north and enter Tatar territory.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to follow him?\u201d Yingtai asked me. \u201cEven there?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI do. What Master Lo did to restore Bao to life..... it bound us together. I have waited long enough. If he will not come to me, I will go to him.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cI will pray for you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come back?\u201d Song asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cI cannot promise it. No matter what happens with Bao, I have a home of my own, or at least family of my own, far, far away. I miss them. Especially my mother. I would like to see her again very much. But I do promise that I will never, ever forget you.\u201d</p><p>Song smiled at me with shy pleasure, toying with the bangle around her slim wrist. \u201cI understand. I will pray for you, too, Lady Moirin.\u201d</p><p>With their assistance, I chose two embroidered squares to purchase from Auntie Ai\u2014one of Song\u2019s worked with a pattern of flowering bamboo, and one with a stark black-and-white pattern of magpies that Yingtai had just completed.</p><p>\u201cI thought of my Bao as I sewed this piece,\u201d his mother murmured. \u201cHe told me that the Venerable Master Lo Feng called him his magpie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he did.\u201d A wave of sorrow came over me. \u201cI hope it will remind Bao of many glad memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>Outside the sewing shop, we said our farewells. A small crowd had gathered to watch, trying without the slightest bit of success to appear nonchalant. At Auntie Ai\u2019s urging, Hui made a point of displaying the fabric squares I had purchased ostentatiously over his arm. I didn\u2019t begrudge her, for it was obvious she had shown much kindness to Bao\u2019s mother and sister. Let the tale spread that the Emperor\u2019s witch had found her wares worthy.</p><p>Yingtai bowed formally to me, her eyes bright with fresh tears. \u201cI bless the gods for sending you to us, Lady Moirin. I pray they guard your path.\u201d</p><p>I returned her bow. \u201cAnd yours, my lady.\u201d</p><p>In a public display of emotion uncustomary to the Ch\u2019in, Song flung her arms around my neck and hugged me hard. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d she said fervently aloud, then whispered in my ear, \u201cI hope my brother chooses to be with you. He would be very, very stupid not to, I think.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and kissed the top of her head. \u201cI think so, too. Be well, little sister.\u201d</p><p>Hui and I retraced our steps to the village square, our indiscreet entourage of onlookers trailing behind us.</p><p>Ang Shen and his companions were still there, squatting beside a jar of rice-wine and lingering over their dominoes in the slanting, late-afternoon sunlight. His head tilted at our approach, although he didn\u2019t deign to look up.</p><p>\u201cAng Shen?\u201d I called. \u201cI have given your wife and your daughter gifts of jade today. I am told it is sufficient to provide Song with a good dowry. And I am telling you that these gifts carry a blessing and a curse. Do you leave them be, it will be a blessing on your household.\u201d Thinking of my mother and how imposing she could be, I made my voice stern. \u201cBut do you think to take and sell them, my curse will be upon you, and I swear to you by stone and sea and all that it encompasses, you shall wish you had never been born.\u201d</p><p>Lest my words be mistaken, Hui translated them in a high, clear voice.</p><p>The village onlookers murmured.</p><p>Without looking at me, Bao\u2019s mother\u2019s husband gave a subtle nod of acknowledgment. I nodded in an unseen reply and turned to go.</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d</p><p>I turned back.</p><p>Ang Shen had risen. He wavered a bit on his feet, but his gaze was steady. \u201cThat is your name, is it not?\u201d I nodded. He executed a precise bow. \u201cMoirin, I thank you for this gift you have given my family.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, my heart ached for him.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I worked loose the last bangle on my right wrist, the red jade bangle, and held it out to him. \u201cTake this. If it does not bring you the luck it promises, you may sell it and do what you will with the profit. It is yours, and yours alone.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I thought he would refuse my gift; but then he took it, clutching it in gnarled, work-worn fingers, a world of wariness in his dark eyes. \u201cDo you seek to force hope upon me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said.</p><p>He bowed a second time. \u201cI accept it.\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>On the morrow, I departed Tonghe.</p><p>I left in the early morning. As much as it had delighted me to meet Bao\u2019s mother and sister, the increasing chill in the autumn air made me eager to be on my way. My young companion Hui\u2019s father, a gentle, sensible fellow, advised me to make haste.</p><p>\u201cWinter\u2019s coming sooner rather than later, Lady Moirin,\u201d he said with concern, his son translating for him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be caught out on the steppes without shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up in the wilderness,\u201d I said with an assurance I didn\u2019t entirely feel. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou will not have experienced a cold such as this one. Perhaps it would be better to turn back. You could winter in Shuntian.\u201d</p><p>I had suggested that very thing to Snow Tiger. Gently but firmly, she had sent me on my way, telling me it was time to go.</p><p>My diadh-anam agreed. And I was too close to crossing a threshold to turn back now.</p><p>So I set out, armed with Hui\u2019s father\u2019s advice regarding items to purchase at the Blue Sky Gate market. Hui followed me, shouting and waving, until I lost him in the distance.</p><p>It took no more than an hour to reach the Great Wall, the Blue Sky Gate, and the market that sprawled within the shadow of the wall. For those who have not seen it, the wall that the Ch\u2019in built to keep the Tatars at bay is an awe-inspiring sight. It is high and unthinkably vast, sprawling for countless leagues in both directions. It is constantly being built and repaired, and an untold number of laborers have died in the process.</p><p>This northern section was one of the oldest in its original incarnation, which had been little more than fortified earthworks that had crumbled over the centuries, allowing the Tatar raids that had begotten Bao. Since that time, it had been replaced with new construction, solid and imposing, with an outpost of Imperial soldiers manning the gate towers and a market sprung up to serve them.</p><p>I wandered the marketplace astride Ember, my pack-horse, Coal, trailing behind us, listening to the shouts of the hawkers falter as they paused to stare at me, a buzz circulating in my wake. It wasn\u2019t long before one of the Imperial soldiers hurried over to approach me on foot, a handsome young fellow with a merry face beneath his conical helmet.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Noble Lady,\u201d he said with a bow, speaking a dialect close enough to the scholar\u2019s tongue that I understood him. \u201cI am Chen Peng. And I think you must be\u2014\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s jade-eyed witch, aye.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSwallower-of-memories, I was going to say. Is it true that you seek the twice-born one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d It occurred to me that for a country as vast as Ch\u2019in, it had a powerful and extensive rumor network.</p><p>Chen Peng read my expression. \u201cI fought at White Jade Mountain,\u201d he said in a more somber tone. \u201cWhen the dragon descended onto the battlefield, I was there. So please tell me, how may I assist you?\u201d</p><p>I stroked Ember\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m in the market for attire fit to endure a Tatar winter. And such supplies as I will need to survive, at least until I find my stubborn peasant-boy.\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cI will see to it.\u201d</p><p>He was as good as his word, marshalling other soldiers to the task. Within an hour\u2019s time, I had acquired a variety of supplies, including a long coat of padded cotton, worn sashed over thick trousers tucked into leather boots lined with layers of felt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A fur-trimmed hat of felted wool that smelled of lanolin topped the ensemble. I wrinkled my nose at it. \u201cIs this necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you are bound, yes.\u201d Peng adjusted it over my ears, tugging it in place. His fingertips brushed the skin of my temples, and he flushed at the unintended intimacy, taking a quick step backward. \u201cIt is a dangerous journey. Are you quite certain you must go?\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAnd quite certain that you must go without an escort?\u201d</p><p>Desire.</p> <p>I saw it in his flush, in the sudden heat of his eyes. There was a part of me that responded to it, my blood quickening. He was handsome and pleasant, and I was lonely. I did not know how many days or weeks or months it would take before I found Bao. When all was said and done, I was Naamah\u2019s child, and I responded to desire. It was the path I trod and the element in which I swam.</p><p>My diadh-anam flared in rebellion.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Chen Peng bowed. \u201cWill you permit me one indulgence? I would beg you to ascend the wall and behold the scope of your task.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>He escorted me to the right-hand gate tower. We climbed a winding stair and emerged atop the wall. The sky overhead was impossibly vast, a fathomless vault of vivid blue. I stood silent beneath it, gazing out at the endless expanse of grassy plain that stretched into the horizon as far as the eye could see. There were no farms, no villages. Nothing but grass and sky, and a few dots in the distance that might have been animals grazing.</p><p>\u201cThere is not even a road, you see,\u201d Peng said quietly, watching me. \u201cIn the summer during peace-times, the Tatars drive their livestock here to trade.\u201d</p><p>I felt Bao\u2019s presence far away, the twinned spark of his diadh-anam calling to mine over the leagues. \u201cI do not require a road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are a war-like folk.\u201d The soldier nodded at the Emperor\u2019s medallion. \u201cAnd that will mean nothing to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut Ch\u2019in is at peace with them now, is it not?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPeace is never certain with the Tatars. I beg you one last time, Noble Lady. Allow me to assemble an escort.\u201d</p> <p>The wind was cold on my cheeks. Standing atop the wall, I consulted my own diadh-anam one last time, trying to tune out the insistent call of Bao\u2019s to discern the will of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself.</p><p>The open space of the gate yawned beneath the stone ramparts of the Great Wall. A powerful memory came to me unbidden. I had passed through another stone doorway long ago in Alba. It was a rite of passage among my people. Alone, I went through the stone doorway in the valley beyond the hollow hills into a world of dazzling night and shadowy day, a world of piercing beauty deeper and more profound than my soft, familiar twilight, a world where darkness and light were one and the same.</p><p>There, I had waited and waited, until the Great Bear Herself came to me, the Brown Bear of the Maghuin Dhonn.</p><p>At first, She came as a presence so immense She blotted out the stars. The earth had trembled beneath Her tread. With each slow, mighty pace, She had dwindled and shaped Herself to a mortal scale.</p><p>Her eyes had been so kind, so wise, so filled with compassion and sorrow.</p><p>She had breathed upon me, claiming me as Her own; and I had rejoiced, happy to bask in Her presence. And then She had shown me a vision of sparkling oceans filling the stone doorway behind me, and I had understood that I had a destiny to fulfill.</p><p>I still did.</p><p>And I would not find it until I found Bao, and somehow managed to reunite my divided diadh-anam.</p> <p>I sighed.</p><p>Dangerous or no, foolish or no, this was my quest; and I was bound to undertake it alone. That was the meaning of my memory\u2019s vision, confirming the truth of my reluctant heart. I breathed the Breath of Wind\u2019s Sigh, feeling the space behind my eyes expand to encompass the enormous ocean of grass I beheld.</p><p>My kind soldier Peng waited patiently, hopeful.</p><p>Standing atop the wall, I turned back to face the Empire of Ch\u2019in itself, breathing the Breath of Earth\u2019s Pulse to ground myself. The land that had once seemed strange to me had become a familiar place, filled with folk I could easily love.</p><p>Somewhere behind me, Auntie Li was reading tea leaves and regaling customers with tales of the Emperor\u2019s jade-eyed witch, who had seen fit to patronize her inn. Closer, Auntie Ai was fondly scolding Bao\u2019s mother and sister, bent over their embroidery, jade bangles on their wrists, exchanging glances and smiling.</p><p>No doubt young Hui was already boasting of our acquaintance to anyone who would listen.</p><p>Snow Tiger..... what was my valiant princess doing? Sparring, mayhap, her slender sword darting and flashing steel-bright in her hands. Taking counsel with her father, the Emperor. Shooting at targets, reading the poetry she loved in the gardens of the Celestial City. Mayhap she was listening to music. Whatever she was doing, her faithful, hopelessly enamored guardsman Ten Tigers Dai would be hovering in the background, his bamboo staff at the ready. I hoped that when she thought of her erstwhile necessary inconvenience, she thought of me with the same poignant affection I held for her. I thought she did. My princess had sent me away with a smile as tender as a kiss.</p><p>The dragon.....</p><p>The dragon would be drowsing atop the peaks of White Jade Mountain\u2014sleeping or near to it. His opalescent eyes would be half-lidded, gazing at his reflection in the translucent waters of the pond below him, his coils and possessive claws sunk into stone and indistinguishable from the mountain, guarding the secret treasure that might grow upon its inaccessible slopes, the Camaeline snowdrops I had planted there at the dragon\u2019s bidding.</p><p>Master Lo Feng.</p><p>I bowed and breathed the Breath of Trees Growing, drawing strength from it. \u201cForgive me, Master,\u201d I whispered, turning away from my past. \u201cI will do my best to be worthy of the sacrifice you made.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the vast blue sky, the distant horizon beckoned me.</p><p>\u201cYou are going alone,\u201d Chen Peng said with regret.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d I had nearly forgotten his presence. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>SIX</p><p>Grass.</p><p>Grass, and grass, and grass.</p><p>Once the Great Wall was no longer visible behind me, that was all I saw. Grass and sky. Grazing animals here and there, mostly sheep and cattle. Those, I avoided, knowing it meant there were herders nearby. Betimes, herds of wild gazelles.</p><p>It was lonely and peaceful.</p><p>I gave a wide berth to the Tatar encampments I saw, the distinctive domes of white felt dotting the plain. If Bao was living among the Tatars, sooner or later I would have to come into contact with them and discover if they were as fearsome as their reputation, but I was content to let it be later. There was no need to go begging for trouble, and I had no need to ask if anyone had seen Bao. Always, always, I could sense him ahead of me.</p><p>Hoping to catch up with him before the temperature dropped further, I travelled as fast as I dared; but even in the vast, empty plains, there were constraints. Travelling alone as I was, I couldn\u2019t carry much fodder for my mounts. Chen Peng had assured me that the horses would find sufficient grazing to sustain them, but that meant a good portion of each day was devoted to allowing them to graze.</p><p>Then there was the matter of water. Again, I had waterskins that allowed me to carry enough for myself to live on for days, but not enough for the horses, too. I didn\u2019t dare go more than a day or two without being in sight of water. When I found rivers winding in Bao\u2019s general direction, I followed them.</p><p>Bit by bit, I made progress.</p><p>The nights were the hardest. During the day, I had the sun to warm me and lift my spirits.</p><p>At night it was different. It was cold\u2014gods, so cold! It frightened me to think how much colder it could get. I slept in my clothing beneath a fur blanket in the small tent of felted wool that was the bulk of the burden my pack-horse, Coal, carried. Inside the tent, the warmth my body generated was enough to sustain me for now, but every night seemed a little colder than the night before.</p><p>The Tatars may have lived behind felt walls, but their walls were thicker and they had one gift I lacked: fire.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t for lack of skill. I carried a good flint striking kit. And I\u2019d helped my mother tend our hearth since I was four or five years old..... but, of course, I\u2019d grown up in a forest.</p><p>There were no trees on the empty plain.</p><p>From time to time, I passed through an abandoned pasture where I could collect dried dung. Not often, for the Tatars scoured the plains and left little behind when they moved to new pastures. On those occasions when I was able to collect enough to build a campfire, it seemed like a profound luxury. I would fill the little iron pot I carried with water, dried noodles, and bean curd and nestle it amid the burning dung-coals. The resulting soup was chewy and flavorless, but it was wonderfully warm in my belly.</p><p>Alone save for the horses, I would huddle over my tiny, smoldering fire, watching the immense sky change colors as the sun sank below the horizon.</p><p>Most days, I made do with tough strips of dried yak-meat, gnawing as I rode, chewing and softening it until my jaws ached.</p><p>Most nights, I crawled into my narrow tent without the comfort of a fire, tying the flaps tight against the bitter cold and burrowing under my blanket.</p><p>It was harder than I had reckoned. Anywhere else in the world, I would have been well equipped to survive. I\u2019d grown up in the wilderness. If there had been edible plants to forage, I would have found them.</p><p>There weren\u2019t.</p><p>I was skilled with a bow. If there had been game to shoot, I could have shot it. But mostly, there wasn\u2019t. Such birds as I saw were poor eating\u2014buzzards and raptors. The small game mammals of the plains were already hibernating.</p><p>There were the occasional wild gazelles, growing shaggy with the increasing cold. If I\u2019d had fodder for a proper fire, it might have been worthwhile.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>It is a thing we take much for granted, fire. When all is said and done, it is the first, most primordial thing that separates humans from animals. Being children of the Great Bear Herself, the folk of the Maghuin Dhonn are closer than most to the animal realm; and yet, deprived of fire, I craved its reassurance.</p><p>I found myself scheming ways to attain it. I eyed the fresh, steaming turds of dung Ember and Coal deposited on the plains, wondering if there were some significance to the fire-names I had given them, wondering if I might rig some manner of woven rack that would allow their dung to dry as it was transported.</p><p>Of course, if I had had the materials to build such a rack, I would have had materials to build a fire.</p><p>I didn\u2019t.</p><p>So I gnawed on my strips of dried yak-meat while we plodded westward, ever westward. I did my best to meditate on the lessons Master Lo had taught me. I cycled through the Five Styles of Breathing. I measured the dwindling distance between my diadh-anam and the spark of Bao\u2019s.</p><p>I let my thoughts wander as far away as Terre d\u2019Ange.....</p><p>Jehanne.</p><p>It was at night that I thought of her most, when the immense canopy of stars flung itself across the night sky. As fair as she was, with silver-gilt hair and skin so pale it was nearly translucent, blue-grey eyes that held an impossibly charming sparkle, I\u2019d always thought of Jehanne in terms of starlight and moonlight.</p><p>She would have been appalled to find me here.</p><p>But she would have understood it.</p><p>I pictured her, her fair brows frowning. This peasant-boy, do you love him?</p><p>I think so.</p><p>Jehanne would have shrugged, her slender shoulders rising and falling. Well, then, mayhap you do. She would have smiled and beckoned to me anyway, her eyes sparkling. But you are still mine for now, my lovely savage.</p><p>And I would have gone to her. Once, on the greatship, I had asked Bao why he was jealous of Raphael but not of Jehanne. Might as well be jealous of the moon for shining as that one, he had said in a philosophical tone. There was no one in the world Jehanne couldn\u2019t charm when she chose.</p><p>Thoughts of opulent Terre d\u2019Ange were an incongruous thing on the Tatar plain, riding with dung beneath my fingernails, but they helped sustain me. It was good to remember that there had been a time when my world had consisted of more than endless grass plains, frigid, shivering nights, and dried yak-meat. There had been feasts with all manner of delicacies, bottomless pitchers of wine. There had been balls with music and dancing, splendid garments, a thousand shimmering lanterns. I\u2019d had my own quarters at the Palace, the enchanted bower that Jehanne had caused to be made for me, warmed with braziers and filled with every kind of green, growing plant imaginable. Fragrant orange and lemon trees, dwarf firs in pots, tall fronds of ferns casting green shadows over my bed.</p><p>Here, there was grass, grass, and more grass.</p><p>I missed trees.</p><p>One day, I came across an unfamiliar structure. From a distance, it looked like a mound of sticks tied about with blue rags. Wary of human presence, I hesitated to approach it, but I sensed no one, and the prospect of wood drew me.</p><p>At closer range, I saw it was true. It was a conical cairn built of weathered branches\u2014wood, firewood, enough for half a dozen merry campfires. I dismounted in haste, already calculating how best to bundle and load it, and how much additional weight Coal could carry, my cold fingers reaching eagerly to dismantle the structure.</p><p>And then my diadh-anam stirred in warning, and I hesitated.</p><p>Scarves of vibrant blue silk hung from the branches. There were little bowls nestled around the base of the cairn, tucked into niches. Some held a dried residue that might have been milk. Others held what looked to be the petrified remains of some kind of dumpling, pale and smooth as river-stones.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cThis is a sacred place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said aloud, gazing at the immense blue vault of the sky. A breeze sprang up as if in answer, setting the blue scarves fluttering.</p><p>So be it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have milk or dumplings to offer, but I worked a strip of dried yak-meat free from the pouch that hung from my sash. Although I was worried about my stores growing low, I had learned in my travels that it was always wise to offer respect to foreign gods. I bowed and placed the meat in a bowl, hoping that it would not offend the original donor, hoping that whatever gods the Tatars worshipped would not think me stingy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then I heaved myself back astride Ember, and we continued on our plodding way across the endless plains, Coal trailing behind us.</p><p>It was two or three days afterward that I saw the herders. I saw the cattle first, scores of them ambling from the northwest on a course to intersect mine. I heard the shouts of the boys before I saw them. It was another cold, clear day, and their young voices carried across the plain.</p><p>I glanced around, but there was nowhere to hide on the flat, empty expanse of grassland. For the first time in longer than I could recall, I summoned the twilight.</p> <p>Despite my lack of practice, it came easier than I had reckoned. I had seen dusk fall over the plain many, many times since I had passed through the gate, and the discipline that Master Lo taught me had focused my gift. I breathed the living memory of Tatar dusk deep into my lungs, feeling my diadh-anam flicker and glow. I breathed out the twilight, letting it settle over the horses and me.</p><p>The sunlit world turned shadowy and dim, the grass silvered, and the sky filled with deep purple and indigo hues.</p><p>With a silent thought, I asked the horses to remain still and quiet. They obeyed willingly, pricking their ears and watching with curiosity as the stream of cattle and the two young Tatar herdsmen passed before us. The boys looked to be thirteen or fourteen, and they rode in the saddle as though born to it, prodding the cattle with long poles, chattering back and forth to one another with cheerful urgency, all unwitting of our presence. A keen-eyed dog trotted alongside one of them.</p><p>I smiled quietly.</p><p>When they were no more than specks on the horizon, I released the twilight. The bright daylit world returned in a rush of color. Green grass was green once more; the arching sky overhead was blue. Ember tossed his head a few times and blew through his nostrils as though to comment on the phenomenon.</p> <p>\u201cCome, brave heart.\u201d I patted his withers. \u201cWe\u2019ve a league or two to go before we make camp for the night.\u201d</p><p>Had I been wiser in the ways of winter in Tatar territory, I might have thought to wonder where the young herdsmen were bound, and why they went about their task with a certain sense of urgency.</p><p>I found out soon enough.</p><p>Within an hour\u2019s time, the temperature began to drop precipitously. The wind sharpened. It cut through my thick coat of padded cotton, it found its way up my sleeves, it froze my cheeks until my entire face felt stiff. The air began to smell like snow. Toward the west, the sky took on a dark, ominous hue, a tall stack of clouds growing on the horizon.</p><p>There was a storm coming.</p><p>A very, very big storm.</p> <p>And ah, gods! It was so sudden. I don\u2019t know what early warning signs I missed, what signs the Tatars were able to read. It was unfamiliar terrain, an unfamiliar climate, unlike any I had known.</p><p>I broke to make camp as soon as I saw the clouds massing. It was my custom to tend to the horses first, unsaddling Ember, unloading all of Coal\u2019s packs, checking their hooves, and turning them loose to graze. This time, my heart beating hard in my chest, I begged their forgiveness and set about erecting my sheltering tent, fearful for my vulnerable human flesh.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>It was a task that had grown more difficult every day. Bit by bit, the farther I rode, the colder it got, the more the turf had hardened.</p><p>Today, it had hardened further. My wooden mallet skidded futilely off the frayed heads of the wooden tent-stakes. The points of the stakes splintered against the frozen ground, unable to penetrate the sod. I swung and pounded until my arm ached, my chest heaving and my breath rising in frosty puffs, all to no avail.</p><p>My eyes stung with frustrated tears. I dragged my padded sleeve over them. \u201cGods bedamned, Bao! Stupid, stubborn boy! Could you not stay put for one minute? Did you have to put me through this?\u201d</p><p>The only thing to answer was the storm.</p><p>It descended on us with an unearthly howl, fierce as a dragon\u2019s fury, the wind filled with pellets of ice. It snatched the dense felt of my tent away from me, plucking the fabric and lines and stakes from my helpless fingers, sending it careening across the grassy plains under a glowering sky.</p> <p>Flee.</p><p>The word resounded in my head. I did not know who or what spoke it\u2014whether it was the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, the D\u2019Angeline gods Naamah or Anael, the unknown gods of the Tatars, or merely my own panic speaking.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>I fled. I ran toward Ember, hurling myself across his saddle. It struck me hard in the chest. I hauled myself astride, flinging my leg over him. I found the reins, and gave him his head.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d I shouted. \u201cGo, go, go!\u201d</p><p>My valiant chestnut arched his neck and thundered southward; poor Coal, half-unladen, laboring in his wake. All around us, the storm howled, pursuing us.</p><p>Flee.</p><p>Snow and bits of ice pelted us. I could not tell if it was day or night. All the world was chaos. We rode and rode and rode, trying to outpace the storm. I was a frozen creature, clinging to another frozen creature. The whipping wind howled. Frost gathered on my eyelashes. Ember lost his footing and staggered hard beneath me, pitching me onto his neck. He caught himself from falling, but came up lame, lurching every time he put weight on his left foreleg.</p><p>I slipped from the saddle and leant my face against his ice-crusted neck in despair. With an effort, I pushed myself away and set about trying to unbuckle the straps that lashed Coal\u2019s load to his back.</p><p>It was impossible. The straps were stiff and frozen, and my fingers were so numb I couldn\u2019t get any purchase.</p><p>So I did the only thing I could think to do. I took up Ember\u2019s reins and began trudging on foot, the horses trailing behind me.</p><p>How long I walked, I could not say. It felt like an eternity. The storm was like a mighty hand shoving me from behind. I concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other, convinced that if I stopped moving, I would die.</p><p>I don\u2019t doubt that it was true. Allowing my gift to be used in an unwise manner, I\u2019d come close to dying before, but I never felt anything that sapped my will to live the way that bitter, cold wind did. Would that I could say it was hope that kept me going, but no such thing existed in that raging darkness. It was the irrational spark of anger I harbored toward Bao, the sense that this was all his fault, that gave me the will to keep taking one step, then another, long after my legs had begun to feel leaden.</p><p>Head down, I trudged blindly\u2014trudged, and trudged, and trudged. Until I bumped into something large.</p><p>I went still.</p><p>The large thing bumped me back\u2014several large things. A choked sound of fear died in my throat. There were large figures looming in the darkness, and yet I sensed a benign intent. I rubbed the frost from my eyelashes and squinted.</p><p>Cattle.</p><p>I was surrounded by cattle\u2014big, shaggy cattle with short, curved horns and lambent eyes rimed with frost. They bumped, jostled, and nudged me and my horses, herding us forward, a dim sense of concern in their thoughts. And then, ah, gods!</p><p>There was a wall, a stone wall that blocked the worst of the blizzard\u2019s knifing wind. I\u2019d never been so glad to see a man-made wall in my life.</p><p>If there was a wall, doubtless there were humans nearby, but I couldn\u2019t make out any of the Tatars\u2019 felt domiciles in the storm; and the cattle were insistent, nudging me into the lee of the wall. I let go of Ember\u2019s reins and slid down the wall in relief, resting my back against the rough stone and huddling into my coat.</p><p>With low groans, two of the cattle sank down on either side of me, pressing flanks and haunches against me. Their concerned thoughts gave way to complacent, bovine ones. Within minutes, I could feel the warmth of their shaggy hides penetrating my clothing.</p><p>I laughed, and wept tears that froze on my cheeks. \u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered\u2014to the cattle, to the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, to the D\u2019Angeline pantheon, to the Tatar gods, and to stone and sea and sky and all that they encompassed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Impossible as it may seem, I fell asleep amid the cattle.</p><p>I was tired beyond exhaustion, as tired in spirit as though I\u2019d been drained almost to death, and as tired in body as though I\u2019d climbed White Jade Mountain all over again. The presence of the cattle was warm and soothing, and the stone wall blocked the worst of the storm. There was nothing I could do for my horses until the storm passed.</p><p>And so I closed my weary eyes, thinking only to rest them a moment, and fell into a black pit of unconsciousness.</p><p>I awoke to a startled shout.</p><p>I opened my eyes to find calm morning light, and one of the young Tatar herdsmen staring at me. He loosed another shout when I opened my eyes, gripping his herder\u2019s staff with both hands. The dog beside him planted its haunches on the frozen ground and wagged its tail, bright-eyed, its tongue lolling.</p><p>I shouted too, scrambling to my feet. The cattle on either side of me heaved themselves upright in their ungainly, rear-end-first way.</p><p>The boy yelled questions at me, his voice high and fierce. More cattle milled between us. I shook my head and spread my hands helplessly, eyeing Ember amid the herd and wondering if I could get to the bow and quiver strapped to the saddle.</p><p>The boy hesitated, then turned and raced toward the felt dwellings now visible some thirty yards away, shouting all the while.</p><p>I hesitated, too.</p><p>I was alive, and so were my mounts. It looked as though most of the supplies loaded on Coal were intact.</p><p>But I had no tent, and it was ungodly cold. Snow dusted the frozen sod, not as much as I would have expected, but I supposed the fierce wind prevented it from accumulating. I sidled through the cattle and reached Ember\u2019s side, unlashing my bow. My fingers had thawed just enough that I was able to string it.</p><p>More folk spilled out of the felt huts\u2014men, women, and children of all ages. I held the bow loosely in my left hand and plucked one arrow from the quiver without nocking it, trying to look calm. I didn\u2019t want to present myself as an enemy, but I didn\u2019t intend to appear an easy victim, either.</p><p>The Tatars fanned out as they approached, pointing and exclaiming to one another. I stood my ground uncertainly. A man of middle years whose coat and hat bore finer embroidery than the others beckoned to a young girl and spoke to her. She dashed back to the nearest hut, returning with a thick woolen blanket.</p><p>The man took it from her and began to push his way through the cattle toward me, holding out the blanket, uttering a sound such as one might make to soothe a fractious horse. \u201cHa, ha, ha!\u201d</p><p>I eyed him, bow in hand, unable to determine whether he meant to offer the blanket to me or capture me in it.</p><p>He clucked his tongue, shaking the blanket at me in a way that could have been inviting or menacing. \u201cHa, ha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d I said aloud in the scholar\u2019s tongue. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p><p>One of the women said somewhat in a sharp tone. The adult Tatars argued amongst themselves. Wide-eyed children with round faces stared at me. I tried smiling at one, and he burst into tears.</p><p>Another woman emerged from the felt huts, walking slowly and carefully\u2014in part because her pregnant belly strained against her long coat, and in part because she carried a small bowl of steaming liquid. She paused to dip her fingers in it, scattering droplets on the frozen earth.</p><p>All the Tatars murmured in approval.</p><p>The pregnant woman and the man with the blanket exchanged glances. He shrugged and stepped backward to let her pass him. She came toward me with those delicate little steps, smiling at me with weary sweetness. This time, the cattle moved out of the way of their own accord.</p><p>A few paces away from me, she raised the bowl to her lips and mimed drinking from it, then held it out to me. I paused, then slung my bow over my shoulder and returned the arrow I had drawn from my quiver. The pregnant woman nodded encouragingly. She cradled the bowl in one hand, pointed at it, then pointed at the ground, raising her eyebrows in question.</p><p>I felt foolish.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I murmured, cupping my hands together in a gesture of gratitude. \u201cI recognize an offer of hospitality. You do not need to treat me like a wild creature.\u201d</p><p>She beamed, holding out the bowl with both hands.</p><p>I bowed in the Ch\u2019in manner and came forward to accept it, taking it in both hands and lifting it to drink.</p><p>It was tea, hot and salty, rich with milk-fat. Another time and place, I might have found the taste repugnant. Here, it tasted like heaven. I meant to sip it politely. Instead, I downed the entire bowl.</p><p>The Tatars I had been so assiduously avoiding all made sounds of welcome and approval. Still beaming, the pregnant woman turned to her husband\u2014as I later learned he was\u2014and extended her hand for the woolen blanket. He gave it to her with an affectionate, rueful smile. She raised her brows at me once more, offering the blanket to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said a second time, accepting it with another bow and wrapping it around my shoulders.</p><p>She touched my sleeve, then touched my face, her fingertips gentle and inquisitive. I held still and let her. Her dark, angular eyes searched mine. At length, satisfied, she nodded, turned and said somewhat to the others. Her husband nodded and said somewhat more, making a firm gesture of dismissal.</p><p>With obvious reluctance, the others began to disperse, returning to their felt huts or setting about various chores.</p><p>The couple turned their attention back to me. The woman asked me a question, speaking as slowly and carefully as though to a very young child. I shook my head helplessly. After another exchange with her husband, she pointed toward the felt huts. She mimed eating and sleeping, first raising an imaginary spoon to her lips, then pressing her cheek against folded hands.</p><p>Given my fears, I was embarrassed by their kindness. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said for the third time. \u201cBut I must tend to my mounts first.\u201d I pointed to myself and then at Ember and Coal, still saddled and loaded amid the meandering cattle, then mimed awkwardly to indicate what I needed to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man\u2019s face cleared with understanding. He nodded in approval and called over the boy who had first discovered me. The boy went to work straightaway at unloading Coal\u2019s packs, blowing on the frozen buckles to thaw them. With an elaborate series of gestures, the man indicated that the boy would unload the horses and carry my gear and supplies to the hut, then turn the horses loose to graze on the frozen plain. He finished by echoing his wife\u2019s gesture with the imaginary spoon.</p><p>His wife didn\u2019t wait for my reply. Grasping the fur-trimmed cuff of my sleeve, she tugged me firmly toward the encampment. Wrapped in a warm blanket and their generosity, I went willingly.</p><p>There were some two dozen of the felt huts, which I later learned to call gers, in the camp. At close range, they were much larger and more substantial than I had reckoned, and infinitely more sophisticated than the simple tent that the storm had snatched away from me, thick felt layered on dome-shaped lattices. All the gers faced south, with brightly painted wooden doors. Smoke drifted from a hole at the top of each dome.</p> <p>My hostess led me to the ger with the most elaborately painted doorway, ushering me inside.</p><p>Warmth struck me\u2014warmth, and the smell of the rich, salty tea she had brought me. There were thick woolen carpets woven with intricate designs covering the floor of the ger, keeping the cold of the frozen ground at bay. Overhead, the poles of the lattice framework radiated like the spokes of a great wagon-wheel. Beneath the smoke-hole, two pots simmered atop an iron stove. I inhaled deeply, letting the blanket slide from my shoulders. My hostess smiled and took the empty bowl from my hand, then said somewhat in a formal tone.</p><p>I bowed in response. Even if she couldn\u2019t understand my words, it seemed important to speak them aloud. \u201cMay all the gods bless you for your hospitality and generosity, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d On the far side of the ger, a seated figure lifted a wizened face, cupping one ear. Her bright eyes squinted in a parchment map of wrinkled skin. With an effort, the oldest woman I\u2019d ever seen in my life, older than Old Nemed of the Maghuin Dhonn, dragged herself to her feet and hobbled across the carpets.</p><p>My hostess offered her what sounded like a bemused explanation.</p> <p>The old woman nodded absently, peering at me. She had to crane her neck since a hump atop her spine wouldn\u2019t allow her to stand entirely straight. Licking her weathered lips, she essayed a question, starting and stopping several times, pausing to search her memory. At last she got it out, each syllable rusted and creaky. \u201cDid I hear you speak the scholar\u2019s tongue of Shuntian?\u201d</p><p>I blinked in surprise. \u201cYes, Grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought so.\u201d She poked me in the breast-bone with one gnarled finger, her eyes sharp and inquisitive. \u201cWho are you? What are you? And why in the world are you here?\u201d</p><p>My hostess glanced back and forth between us, perplexity on her kind face. A boy toddler wobbled over to clutch at her coat; another child, a young girl, sidled up behind her, peeking out at me.</p><p>\u201cI am Moirin,\u201d I said politely. \u201cMoirin mac Fainche of the Maghuin Dhonn. And as to what that means and why I am here, I fear it is a very long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d The old woman doubled over and coughed deep in her chest, then straightened to the best of her abilities, dark eyes glinting at me in her wrinkled face. She yawned widely, covering her mouth to hide it. \u201cAnd after I\u2019ve finished my morning nap, you can tell it to me.\u201d She turned to hobble away, offering one last comment over her shoulder. \u201cAnd take your time about it, because it\u2019s going to be a long winter.\u201d</p> <p>EIGHT</p><p>So it came to pass that I wintered amongst a Tatar tribe.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t my intention to stay with them, but from the beginning, it was obvious that the weather gave me little choice. Once winter arrived in earnest, even the hardy, nomadic Tatars with all their knowledge of surviving on the plains settled in for the duration.</p><p>On that first morning, I sat cross-legged on the carpeted floor of the ger, feeling awkward at my unintentional imposition, trying to stay out of the way while I waited for the old woman to finish her nap. My pregnant hostess brought me a bowl of hot, stewed meat to eat. I accepted it gratefully. When I had finished, the little girl\u2014her daughter, I guessed\u2014approached me shyly at her mother\u2019s urging. With gestures, she showed me I was meant to wipe the bowl clean with my fingers, gathering the last of the juices. She bobbed her head in cautious approval when I obeyed.</p><p>The boy tending to my horses entered the ger along with a blast of cold air, staggering under the weight of my packs and gear. He darted back out before I could even thank him.</p><p>My hostess bustled around, scouring dishes and stirring pots. When I offered with gestures to assist her, she smiled and shook her head. She pointed across the ger to the pallet where the old woman was now snoring deeply, made a circling gesture with one finger that indicated time passing, then mimed two mouths talking with both hands.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will speak when she awakes. I only wanted to help in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>She pointed firmly at the carpeted floor and said something in a stern tone. Although she couldn\u2019t have been more than ten or twelve years older than me, it sounded for all the world like a mother\u2019s reprimand.</p> <p>I sat, chastened.</p><p>My hostess smiled and went about her business.</p><p>Lulled by the warmth of the ger and the hot stew in my belly, I felt the weight of my exhaustion settle over me. Although I\u2019d no intention of falling asleep amongst these strangers, hospitable though they seemed, my head grew heavy, my chin sinking to my chest. I fell into a light doze.</p><p>I awoke to find the family gathering around a low table for a mid-day meal of more stewed meat.</p><p>The old woman glanced over and gave a creaking laugh. \u201cAha! The slumbering forest spirit is awake.\u201d She beckoned to me. \u201cCome, come, eat,\u201d she said, adding something in the Tatar tongue.</p><p>My hostess rose with ungainly grace to fill another bowl for me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I accepted it with a bow, then took a seat at the table at her insistent gesture. \u201cYou\u2019re very kind. Grandmother, will you thank her for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows.\u201d The old woman\u2019s mouth worked as she chewed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been bobbing up and down like a courtier since you came through the door. So! Begin your story, will you?\u201d</p><p>I paused, the spoon halfway to my mouth.</p><p>My hostess spoke gently to the old woman, who sighed. \u201cOh, fine! My granddaughter says eat first, talk later.\u201d</p><p>They waited patiently for me to finish. There were six of them present: my hostess and her husband; the young herdsman, who I guessed to be around thirteen and their eldest son. The little girl\u2019s age I put at six or seven, and the toddler at two or three; and of course, there was the old woman, whose age I couldn\u2019t begin to guess. All of them gazed at me with polite curiosity while I ate.</p><p>After I had finished and wiped my bowl with my fingers in the prescribed manner, my host addressed me in a formal tone.</p><p>\u201cMy grandson Batu welcomes you into his dwelling,\u201d the old woman translated. \u201cHe hopes you find it a place of peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBatu.\u201d I echoed his name. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The old woman took a noisy slurp of tea, fixing me with her sharp gaze. \u201cNow tell me who in the name of the ancestors you might be, and what in the name of all the gods and the great blue sky you\u2019re doing here.\u201d</p><p>I did my best.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy. There was far, far too much to explain, and I didn\u2019t know how much of my tale might give offense. The Tatars and the Ch\u2019in existed in an uneasy truce in the best of times, and I did not care to reveal myself as an Imperial favorite. So I simply told her that I had come from faraway Terre d\u2019Ange, travelling to Ch\u2019in to continue studying with my mentor, the venerable sage Master Lo Feng. That I had fallen in love with a fellow student, who had fled after our mentor\u2019s death, venturing into Tatar territory to seek his father; and that I had set out in pursuit of him, driven by love.</p><p>She listened, drinking salty tea and pausing from time to time to translate for the benefit of the others.</p><p>Batu interjected a comment.</p><p>The old woman\u2019s wispy brows rose. \u201cHuh! Was this young man carrying a powerful medicine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo..... wait. Aye, mayhap.\u201d I remembered the Camaeline snowdrop bulbs that Master Lo had transported all the way from Terre d\u2019Ange. Only three of them had survived, and I had planted them atop White Jade Mountain, where the dragon had promised to guard and cherish them. The rest had been sacrificed, left to dry in the lodgings we had rented in Shuntian. When I had gone there to ask after Bao, the new tenants told me he had returned to retrieve the bulbs, which were capable of being rendered into a powerful aphrodisiac. \u201cWhat manner of medicine, Grandmother?\u201d</p><p>The old woman cackled. \u201cThe kind of tonic to stiffen a man\u2019s spear!\u201d</p><p>I flushed. \u201cAh..... yes. That would likely be Bao. Although he might have been calling himself Shangun. I do not know.\u201d</p><p>She eyed me. \u201cLightning Stick?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt is a name he took for himself when he was young and foolish.\u201d</p><p>The old woman conversed with Batu. Aided by her daughter, my hostess began to clear and scour our dishes. I waited.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the old woman said at length. \u201cMy grandson has heard of your young man Bao. With his strong tonic, he bribed his way into General Arslan\u2019s favor before the winter winds blew. It seems that General Arslan has claimed him as a son. Come spring, you ought to be able to find him.\u201d</p><p>I stood, so quickly it dizzied me. \u201cSpring! I can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d</p><p>My hostess hurried over to me, urging me to sit with gentle hands. She and her husband exchanged worried words.</p><p>\u201cStrange girl, you are not going anywhere for a very long time!\u201d the old woman announced in an acerbic tone. \u201cNo one travels in winter. You barely survived a single storm. You would only die.\u201d</p><p>My diadh-anam flared within me. \u201cI need to go!\u201d</p><p>The old woman sighed. \u201cOh, child! It only feels that way. Such is the nature of young love. It will pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Her wrinkled mouth pursed. \u201cSo they all say. I was young once, too. Young and beautiful. It fades, child. All beauty and passion does. Stay the winter here, and in the spring, the tribes will gather in the northwest. You will be reunited with your young man, and see how well his passion has endured. Perhaps you will be fortunate. If so, I say well done. If not, it is not worth dying for now.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated.</p><p>Small hands tugged at the sash around my waist. I glanced down to see Batu\u2019s daughter yanking at me. Her eyes were wary, but her face was set and determined. She said something fierce in the Tatar tongue.</p><p>Her mother echoed it, and her father nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey do not want your blood on their hands,\u201d the old woman translated. \u201cThey beg you to stay.\u201d</p><p>I knew myself defeated. I sank to the floor, bowing my head. The little girl climbed into my lap and nestled against me, no longer fearful. Absentmindedly, I stroked her black hair. \u201cI do not wish to be a burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen work for your keep,\u201d the old woman said forcefully. \u201cMy soft-hearted granddaughter-in-law Checheg will show you how. Live, endure, and learn.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my hostess. \u201cChecheg? Is that your name?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, hands pressed against her swollen belly.</p><p>I touched my breast. \u201cMoirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d It was Batu who said my name in a strong voice, rising to his feet. He placed his hands on my shoulders as though to claim me, but there was only kindness in his grip. He smiled down at me, gave me a little shake, then turned me loose, ruffling his daughter\u2019s hair. \u201cMoirin.\u201d</p><p>I was grateful for his kindness. \u201cYour people are not what I was led to expect, Grandmother.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cDo I look like a Tatar, child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.....\u201d I peered at her. With her shriveled-apple face, I couldn\u2019t tell. The little girl on my lap plucked at the silk cord around my neck. \u201cAre you from Shuntian, Grandmother? Is that how you come to speak the scholar\u2019s tongue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am an Imperial princess descended from his Celestial Majesty Zhu Daoyu,\u201d the old woman said with steely dignity. \u201cI was given in marriage to the tribal khan Oyugun as part of a peace treaty.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>She gave a dismissive wave. \u201cOh, it was a very long time ago. No one remembers. But you may call me Grandmother Yue, and yes, that is why I speak the scholar\u2019s tongue.\u201d She pointed at my chest, her eyes keen. \u201cIt is also how I know that is an Imperial seal you wear around your neck, which leads me to suspect part of your tale is either missing or a lie.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down in alarm to see that Batu and Checheg\u2019s daughter had pulled the Imperial jade medallion from beneath my coat and was toying with it, tracing the carved curves of the dragon\u2019s coils with her small fingers. I felt the blood drain from my face.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Grandmother Yue asked in a sharp voice. \u201cWhich is it, child? An omission or a lie?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cMissing, Grandmother. Perhaps you heard, there was a civil war in Ch\u2019in. I played a role in it and won the Emperor\u2019s favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Her lips worked. \u201cNow, that\u2019s more like it. Yes, yes, we have heard rumors and gossip. A warrior princess possessed by a demon, great sorcerers doing battle in the south with dreadful weapons.\u201d She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a tale fit for a long winter. You\u2019ll tell it in full, of course, with no details omitted.\u201d</p><p>I looked around the ger. It was a scene of domestic tranquillity, filled with folk who had shown me nothing but generosity. \u201cThey will not take it amiss?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grandmother Yue took a noisy sip of tea. \u201cThe world is a complicated place, child. I have lived most of my life among the Tatars, and they are no better or worse than any other folk. Today, they are content to be peaceable. If the Emperor had lost the Mandate of Heaven and Ch\u2019in lay in chaos, perhaps the khans would be plotting an invasion. They have conquered and ruled Ch\u2019in before, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hadn\u2019t known.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt would not matter anyway. Hospitality is sacred to them, and my grandson Batu has offered you the protection of his roof. No tale you tell will cause him to violate that trust.\u201d She sipped her tea. \u201cSo tell your tale from the beginning. The very beginning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you will, Grandmother.\u201d I took a deep breath and began. \u201cI was born to the Maghuin Dhonn. We are the folk of the Brown Bear, and the oldest magic in Alba runs in our veins\u2014\u201d</p><p>The old woman smiled, her bright eyes disappearing in a nest of wrinkles. \u201cYes, that\u2019s definitely more like it!\u201d</p><p>NINE</p><p>Over the long winter months, I spun out my story\u2014my true story, the one I had told to Bao\u2019s mother and sister, with a wealth of detail added to it. And Grandmother Yue was right, no one took it amiss. There was little else to do, and Batu\u2019s family was glad of the distraction.</p><p>I was glad, too. It gave me a sense of purpose during those early days when I was more hindrance than help in the camp. Bit by bit, as Checheg showed me how to prepare salty tea and cook in the Tatar manner, I felt myself become more useful. During Grandmother Yue\u2019s prodigious naps, we communicated with gestures and the few words of Tatar I began to acquire. As Checheg\u2019s belly grew ever larger, I sensed she was increasingly grateful for my aid.</p> <p>After meals, I told my story, eking it out slowly while Grandmother Yue translated.</p><p>Unlike most folk I had encountered, the Tatars did not find it strange that the Maghuin Dhonn worship the Great Bear Herself. They simply nodded, accepting it as a matter of course; and I found myself grateful for that simple acceptance.</p><p>Like folk everywhere, they marveled at the opulence and licentiousness of the D\u2019Angeline lifestyle. Although I couched the details in discreet terms for the benefit of the children, Batu and Checheg were shocked to learn that the King of Terre d\u2019Ange not only wed a courtesan, but allowed her to take lovers.</p><p>\u201cHeh!\u201d Grandmother Yue cackled with delight. \u201cI say good for her!\u201d</p><p>Some details, I chose to withhold. Reckoning they would find it too unlike their customs to understand, I didn\u2019t tell them that Jehanne had seduced me quite thoroughly, only that she had rescued me from Raphael\u2019s deadly ambition.</p><p>Everyone agreed that Raphael was a right scoundrel, but they reveled in the tales of the fallen spirits we summoned and how they tricked Raphael and his companions. Checheg and Batu\u2019s daughter, Sarangerel, especially loved to hear about the spirit Caim, who had eyes like an owl and antlers with a bird\u2019s nest caught in them. According to lore, Caim could bestow the gift of communicating with all living creatures. He tricked Raphael and the others by teaching them the language of ants, which was composed wholly of scent. They gave up before the spirit Caim moved on to crickets.</p> <p>It was a time of peace, but it was also a time of prolonged yearning, that endless Tatar winter. The warmth and kindness everyone extended to me made me miss my home. Gods, I missed having a home. I missed my taciturn, oh-so-familiar mother in Alba, and the lovely, gracious father I had discovered in Terre d\u2019Ange. I missed my sparkling lady Jehanne, with whom I would always be a little bit in love. I missed Snow Tiger, whom I had come to cherish in a very different way.</p><p>I missed the dragon, my splendid friend.</p><p>And always, always, always, I ached for Bao\u2019s presence. I could sense his diadh-anam burning like a beacon, near enough that I could have ridden there in ten days were it not for the deadly cold. I ached to be reunited with the missing half of my diadh-anam. That was a constant. And it frustrated me, not only because I could not go to him, but because I could not sort out in my confused heart what was real and what was the result of the binding Master Lo Feng had laid upon us.</p><p>I knew where my feelings began and ended. They began with a sneaking fondness for Master Lo\u2019s magpie, the proud, stubborn peasant-boy with whom I had bickered and quarreled for so long, before we fell into bed with one another and began a thorny love affair. They ended with Bao walking away from me, leaving me alone and bereft, the spark of my sundered diadh-anam burning steadily inside him.</p><p>It was the missing parts in between that confused me.</p><p>There were good days and bad days. On good days, I thought mayhap it was for the best that I had this time to reflect. As harsh as they were, the frozen Tatar grasslands had a sweeping majesty to them. Although I felt guilty whenever I wasn\u2019t aiding Checheg in the ger, I liked being outdoors, liked the impossibly vast blue sky arching above me.</p><p>I liked doing simple tasks like fetching water from the nearby river, or even gathering cow-dung to dry. I liked to practice the Five Styles of Breathing in the achingly cold air. While I still missed trees, I liked the elemental rhythm of Tatar life.</p><p>On the bad days.....</p> <p>On the bad days, I questioned myself. If I had not tarried in the Celestial City in Shuntian an extra week, dallying with the princess, mayhap I would have beaten the weather and gained Bao\u2019s side before winter\u2019s onset, so we might use these long nights to resolve matters between us.</p><p>That had been my doing, all my doing.</p><p>Snow Tiger had asked me to invoke Naamah\u2019s blessing on her behalf, and I had done it gladly. She had not asked me to tarry. I was the one who had badgered her to let me stay, at least for a week\u2019s time. She had agreed to it without much persuasion needed. And I did not want to regret it, for it had been a time of profound grace.</p><p>I would have stayed longer had she let me. I would have spent the winter in Shuntian with her.</p><p>The Emperor\u2019s daughter\u2019s face swam in my memory, her dark eyes grave. It is too easy to accept the comfort you offer, Moirin. I have duties that lie elsewhere. You have a destiny to follow.</p><p>She was right, of course. But it didn\u2019t stop me from resenting my everlasting destiny on the bad days. It seemed unfair that it constantly drove me away from people for whom I cared deeply, and doubly unfair that the one person to whom my destiny was inextricably linked was bound and determined to evade me.</p><p>I wondered what Bao was feeling.</p><p>Bit by bit, I learned more about his circumstances. I learned that General Arslan was high in the Great Khan\u2019s favor. Batu confirmed that he would have been the one to lead a raid on Tonghe village twenty-some years ago.</p><p>\u201cVery good warrior,\u201d he said slowly to me. \u201cStrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy fight and kill?\u201d</p><p>Batu frowned and shook his head, deciding it was too complicated a matter to explain to me with my limited Tatar language. He beckoned Grandmother Yue over and spoke to her at length.</p><p>\u201cAh, child!\u201d she said when he finished. \u201cIt\u2019s the way of the world, that\u2019s all. The Ch\u2019in raided Tatar camps, too. When the men were away, they kidnapped women and children and enslaved them, put them to work building the wall.\u201d</p><p>I took a sharp breath. \u201cPut them to work building the very wall meant to keep them out? That\u2019s a piece of bitter irony.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI told you, it\u2019s the way of the world. Arslan lost his young wife. He was only taking vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy raping an innocent woman?\u201d I asked in outrage.</p><p>\u201cI did not say I agreed with it,\u201d Grandmother Yue said in a gentle tone. \u201cI said it was the way of the world, Moirin. It is in the nature of mankind.\u201d</p><p>I thought about her words when I breathed the Five Styles and meditated, doing my best to be mindful of Master Lo\u2019s teaching and let one thought give rise to another. It was hard, and I thought mayhap there were things in the world I didn\u2019t want to understand. In my travels, I had learned that the followers of the Path of Dharma believed that to live was to suffer. I was not willing to accept their wisdom as truth, but I could understand why many did.</p><p>Master Lo had allowed the possibility that mayhap I had my own path of enlightenment to follow, the Path of Desire.</p><p>These days, it seemed a very distant possibility.</p><p>Oh, I could have taken a lover if I had wished it. After the initial shock of my appearance, almost everyone at Batu\u2019s camp treated me with genuine warmth. I had a way with animals, and that endeared me to their keepers. The Tatars lived closer to nature than any folk I\u2019d encountered save my own. I continued to be surprised and pleased by their acceptance. Although I understood there was some lingering debate as to whether or not I was a forest spirit from the distant mountains, it was generally agreed that it was a good thing if it were true. From time to time, I caught sidelong glances from some of the bolder young men in the camp, suggesting a tryst would be welcome.</p><p>But my diadh-anam disapproved, and the bright lady was silent. It seemed Naamah\u2019s gift had gone dormant for the winter.</p><p>Life held other pleasures. Living in the ger, I came to value Batu\u2019s quiet strength, his obvious love for his wife and children. I treasured Checheg\u2019s steady kindness and guidance. Their eldest son, Temur, spent a good deal of time blushing in my presence, but that was to be expected at his age, and he was a good-hearted lad.</p><p>Their daughter, Sarangerel, was a delight, bright and lively. Having adopted me on that first day, my small friend staked a relentless claim on me. Under her mother\u2019s indulgent gaze, Sarangerel followed me around the ger, tugging at the hem of my coat, her little brother, Mongke, toddling in her wake, babbling nonsense words. Among other things, she insisted on teaching me a complicated Tatar game in which both players made a fist with their right hands, then shot out several fingers and uttered competing rhymes based on the total number showing.</p><p>\u201cNine!\u201d she would say in triumph, waiting for me to respond.</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d I would hazard.</p><p>Sarangerel would shake her head in mock disappointment, and rattle off a string of better rhymes. I never won a single game, but it improved my skills with the Tatar language considerably. And she was unstinting with her affection, always eager to climb into my lap and rub her cheek against mine, while her little brother pulled jealously on my sleeve until I made room for both of them.</p><p>It soothed that part of me that yearned for human contact in a way I had never known before, filled with tender innocence. Growing up in isolation, I\u2019d had precious little contact with children.</p><p>I liked it.</p><p>I liked the simplicity and purity of it. In a strange way, it was a relief to develop a complex set of relationships in which carnal desire played no part. It occurred to me that this had happened seldom in my life since I came of age, and there was probably a lesson to be learned there.</p><p>And then a month into my stay, Checheg went into labor.</p><p>I had been expecting it; we all had. Day by day, we had waited and wondered. How could we not, her belly as swollen as it was? Still, it came as a shock.</p><p>For one thing, the men abandoned us.</p><p>For another, I was left in charge.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said in dismay. \u201cBatu, I do not know what to do!\u201d</p><p>Batu jiggled young Mongke in his arms, not meeting my eyes. His eldest son, Temur, lurked behind him, peering at me. \u201cYou are a woman, are you not? This is women\u2019s business. Grandmother will help you. After all, she has done it many times before; and so has Checheg, three times. Men do not belong here.\u201d He gave me a furtive glance. \u201cWe will return after the child is born,\u201d he said firmly, exiting the ger and closing the brightly painted door behind him.</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d The old woman rose from her pallet and tottered in my direction, cupping one ear. \u201cReady to pop, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d I blew out my breath, trying to remember what Raphael had taught me. I had assisted him with a difficult birth once, although I\u2019d come in at the end of the process. \u201cSarangerel, you will bring a bucket of water, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Moirin!\u201d She dashed away.</p><p>One thing about the Tatars, they were not much for bathing, at least not in the dead of winter. I had not seen anything resembling soap in the ger; but I had a dwindling ball of soap in my battered canvas satchel. As soon as the water was warming on the stove, I scrubbed my hands and arms thoroughly, raising a goodly amount of lather. \u201cGood,\u201d I said. \u201cWe need blankets and cloth. Clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t fuss so,\u201d Grandmother Yue said irritably, taking Checheg\u2019s arm and helping her walk around the ger. \u201cNature will take its course.\u201d</p><p>Checheg grunted in assent, rubbing the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cI am trying to do a good thing!\u201d I said in frustration. \u201cClean is better. Not to make sick.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a glance and shrugged.</p><p>It was a long process.</p><p>When the contractions began to come hard and steady, Checheg lay down, propped against pillows, her knees spread apart. She did not protest when I eased the cleanest of the felt blankets beneath her. Gently, I removed her thick, felt-lined boots and woolen trousers. Half undressed, she seemed much smaller to me.</p><p>Ah, gods! Mortal flesh is a fragile and vulnerable thing. I knelt between her wide-spread thighs and placed my hand on her immense belly, feeling it harden and tighten, then ease, over and over. Checheg groaned with pain, eyes squeezed tight.</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d I murmured to her. \u201cPush, yes, but not hard.\u201d</p><p>Eyes closed, she nodded.</p><p>I bowed my head and centered myself, breathing the Breath of Earth\u2019s Pulse. I breathed the Breath of Ocean\u2019s Rolling Waves, slow and deep. It eased Checheg, and she breathed with me\u2014until the pace of her breathing quickened again, one breath coming hard and fast after another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Delicate flesh tore and parted.</p><p>\u201cGods!\u201d I whispered in awe, seeing the infant\u2019s head crown. I put my hand beneath it to support it as it emerged, first the head, then the narrow shoulders following. \u201cStone and sea!\u201d</p><p>Checheg hissed between her teeth.</p> <p>All in a rush, the infant slithered loose from her body, tethered by a pulsing cord. I caught it in my hands, gasping with wonder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to turn it upside down so it can breathe,\u201d Grandmother Yue counseled, hovering over my shoulder.</p><p>Carefully, so carefully, I tilted the tiny, slippery creature so its head was lower than its miniscule feet. It drew a choked, soggy breath, and made a bubbling sound. Mucus and fluids sputtered and drooled from its mouth and nostrils. It drew another breath, and squalled. It was a healthy sound.</p><p>I laughed out loud.</p><p>Checheg opened her eyes and smiled wearily. With cloth boiled in the water Sarangerel had brought, I wiped the babe clean of blood and birth fluids, then wrapped it in the cleanest dry woolens I\u2019d been able to find.</p> <p>\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d Checheg whispered, reaching out feebly with both arms.</p><p>\u201cGirl.\u201d Gauging the length of the birthing cord, I set the swaddled babe on her belly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Sarangerel announced, seeming not in the least unnerved by the entire process. \u201cI wanted a sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s done, all but the messy afterward bit.\u201d Grandmother Yue gave a mighty yawn. \u201cI\u2019m off for a nap. Keep them warm. Wait for the rest to come out before you tie and cut the cord, you hear?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, Grandmother. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>While I waited for the messy afterward bit, I draped more warm blankets over Checheg, checking beneath them when she grimaced in the throes of a secondary contraction. For the most part, she reclined against the pillows looking tired and peaceful, her thick coat unbuttoned beneath the blankets as she coaxed the babe to nurse. Sarangerel cuddled against her mother\u2019s side, peering at her new baby sister with fascination.</p> <p>I gazed at them, filled with complex emotions.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look sad, Moirin?\u201d Checheg asked me, her voice soft with concern and exhaustion. \u201cYou did well. I have never known a birth so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.....\u201d I smiled, knowing there was a shadow of sorrow in it I could not hide. \u201cYes, today is a day for joy,\u201d I said, choosing my words with care. \u201cOnly I am thinking of my Queen very far away. She was with child. She was afraid of this day when her time came. She did not want me to leave. I wanted to be there for her.\u201d</p><p>Checheg understood. \u201cAnd instead you are here for me.\u201d She cradled the back of her babe\u2019s head with one hand, summoning a sweet, tired smile. \u201cBut now you see there was nothing to fear. I am sure it was so for your Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Although I had underestimated her before, I could not imagine Jehanne facing the ordeal of childbirth with the same calm, steady courage.</p><p>\u201cYou will see.\u201d Checheg closed her eyes. \u201cI will be sorry when you leave. All of us will.\u201d Her voice took on a dreamy tone. \u201cBut you will find your legendary peasant-boy, and together you will return to faraway Terre d\u2019Ange with its white walls and great palaces, and forests growing beneath glass pavilions, and there you will find that all is well with this Queen of whom you are so very fond.\u201d</p><p>I had not spoken of my role as Jehanne\u2019s companion, since it was foreign to Tatar customs. Now I flushed, suspecting I was not as good at concealing my feelings as I thought.</p><p>\u201cBy then her baby will be as big as my little brother Mongke,\u201d Sarangerel added. \u201cAlready making trouble!\u201d</p> <p>It was a charming thought.</p><p>I wondered if Jehanne\u2019s child, boy or girl, had inherited its mother\u2019s mercurial temper or its father\u2019s sense of grave resolve. Secretly, I hoped it was the former. And I gazed at the babe in Checheg\u2019s arms, hoping she inherited a measure of her mother\u2019s innate kindness; hoping she would come of age in a time of peace, and need not believe that to live was to suffer.</p><p>Like as not, I would never know. But I could pray for it.</p><p>The babe stirred in its mother\u2019s arms.</p><p>I reached out to stroke her tender cheek with one finger. \u201cWelcome to the world, little one.\u201d</p><p>TEN</p><p>They named the baby girl Bayar, which meant joy.</p><p>\u201cIt was your idea, Moirin,\u201d Checheg said to me, eyes dancing. \u201cRemember? When she was born, you said it was a day for joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I said, touched.</p><p>Grandmother Yue chewed her lips. \u201cToo bad it wasn\u2019t a boy.\u201d</p><p>Batu smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling. \u201cI do not mind. I like daughters, too.\u201d</p><p>Life settled into a new rhythm in the ger. Having been trained by Checheg during my first month among the Tatars, I took on her duties, letting her rest, recover her strength, and nurse the babe while I saw to the daily preparation of tea and food, ladling it out at meal-times in the correct order of precedence.</p><p>Days passed, one by one.</p><p>Betimes, I grew restless and stifled, the felt walls and dried-dung smoke of the ger closing in on me until it was hard to breathe. When it happened, Checheg was sensitive to it. She would rise from her pallet, Bayar cradled in one arm, and tilt her head toward the door in an implicit command.</p><p>I went.</p><p>Outdoors, I could breathe. I sucked the achingly cold air deep into my lungs, breathing out plumes of frost.</p><p>I took part in surreptitious horse-races arranged by the young men of the tribe, marveling at how their sure-footed shaggy ponies were able to outpace my proud gelding Ember, an Emperor\u2019s gift. Since the strained foreleg Ember had sustained on our journey had healed entirely, I had no excuse. The Tatars were incredible horsemen.</p><p>I helped herd the cattle, who listened to me; and the sheep, who did not.</p><p>I took part in archery challenges, shooting at tiny, distant targets.</p><p>There, I more than held my own, to which the young men responded with a surprised and begrudging respect.</p><p>\u201cNo one shoots as well as us,\u201d Temur said to me, his cheeks ruddy with the cold and his habitual embarrassment. \u201cMaybe you are part Tatar, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d I agreed. \u201cMy people remember coming from very far away long ago when the world was covered with ice. But we followed the Great Bear Herself, and there are no bears here.\u201d</p><p>The young men conferred.</p><p>\u201cNot here, no,\u201d Temur said. \u201cBut there are bears elsewhere in Tatar lands.\u201d He nodded to himself. \u201cIt must be so. Otherwise, you would not be so skilled with a bow.\u201d</p><p>I lost track of the days, each much like the next. When I had been some months among the Tatars, there was a ceremony to celebrate the New Year. With unwonted shyness, Checheg presented me with a vibrant blue silk scarf.</p><p>\u201cI have seen these.\u201d I remembered seeing similar scarves fluttering from the wooden cairn. \u201cIt is special?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt is the symbol of the sky. Today, it means you are kin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am honored,\u201d I said sincerely. \u201cBut I have no gift to give in turn.\u201d</p><p>Checheg shook her head. \u201cIt is not required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Remembering the dwindling store of Imperial generosity I carried, I rummaged in my packs and found a beautiful sash of celadon silk embroidered with birds and vivid pink peonies. \u201cMaybe it is not tradition, but I would like you to have it.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cIt is too nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d I pressed it into her hands. \u201cPlease, take it.\u201d</p><p>For three days, we celebrated the New Year with feasting and well-wishes. On the night of the third day, a great bonfire was built outdoors and a table set forth with incense and ritual offering bowls of food and water.</p><p>Bundled in layers of felt and wool, I watched the fire burn, sending sparks into the night sky. Overhead, the stars shone brightly.</p><p>Somewhere in the not-too-distant west, the other half of my diadh-anam shone, too. I wondered if Bao stood beneath these same stars, watching a similar bonfire. I wondered, as I often did, what in the name of all that was sacred was going through his mind.</p><p>The festival marked the first new moon after the point of midwinter, and I felt my blood begin to quicken as the days grew longer.</p><p>I struggled for patience, which had never been my strong suit. Oh, in some ways I had the knack of it. I could be patient with animals and children. I could be patient in enduring the foibles of people for whom I cared. It had served me well with Jehanne\u2019s temper and Snow Tiger\u2019s proud reserve, and it had served me badly with Raphael\u2019s ambition.</p><p>But in matters of desire, I had always been impulsive; and with the slow, inevitable coming of spring, desire was rising in me.</p><p>It made me more restless than usual, until Checheg began dismissing me from the ger more often than not.</p><p>\u201cYou are like a wild thing caged,\u201d she scolded me. \u201cGo, go!\u201d</p><p>When there were no chores with which I could assist outdoors, I would saddle Ember or Coal and ride as far as I dared, always ranging westward, always feeling the incessant pull of my diadh-anam.</p><p>Alone, I would summon the twilight. It was one of the only things that soothed me. In the dusky, shimmering half-light, time\u2019s slow passage did not seem so onerous, and distance did not seem to matter so much.</p><p>I thought of the dragon, content to regard his own silvery coils reflected endlessly in a mirror, in a river, in my own dark pupils.</p><p>The dragon had counseled patience.</p><p>You are very young, he had said to me. Live. Learn. Love.</p><p>I was trying.</p><p>To be sure, I was grateful for what I learned of love, kindness, and hospitality amidst Batu\u2019s family. They were lessons I took to heart. Were I to start a family of my own one day, I would remember them. I regretted nothing of my own upbringing, but I did not have my mother\u2019s taste for solitude. I yearned for connection.</p><p>Day by day, I endured.</p><p>At last, spring came. It came slowly and tentatively, but it came. The frozen ground began to thaw. Murmuring grass shook itself awake, sending out tender new shoots. Cattle, sheep, and horses grazed gratefully, nibbling it to the sod\u2019s quick.</p><p>One day, I awoke to the knowledge that Bao was on the move. I could sense his presence moving away from me.</p><p>\u201cBatu!\u201d I said in distress. \u201cGeneral Arslan..... his camp, I think they must be moving. Is it not time we went, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d Batu gripped my elbows, hard. His gentle eyes gazed into mine with unwonted intensity. \u201cThey go to their spring pastures. Here, it is not time yet. Soon. Wait. Do not wish ill upon my herds with your haste. The gathering of the tribes will come.\u201d</p><p>I bowed my head. \u201cI wish your herds to prosper.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I waited and waited\u2014and gods! Waited. At last, it was time to move the camp to our spring pastures, a week\u2019s ride away. The felt gers, which had come to seem such substantial man-made structures to me, were dismantled and taken down easily, packed for transport in a matter of hours.</p><p>We moved.</p><p>Save for the fact that the grasslands were not overgrazed, there was little to distinguish the new campsite from the old. We followed the twisting, shallow river that was our source of water.</p><p>We established a new camp.</p><p>It went up as swiftly as it had been taken down. But my impatience continued unabated, for Bao had moved, too, and I was no closer to him than I had been before.</p><p>I very nearly struck out on my own. Only Sarangerel\u2019s tears persuaded me to wait for the gathering of the tribes.</p><p>For as much as I thought I might strangle on my own ever-growing impatience, I survived. And when the day came that Batu and a handful of others made ready to set out for the gathering, I found myself in tears, too. Checheg, Grandmother Yue, Sarangerel, little Mongke, and the baby Bayar\u2014all would be staying behind. Blushing Temur, too\u2014left in charge as the eldest male. I embraced them all, suddenly reluctant to say farewell to them.</p><p>I gave away two of my last three jade bangles, keeping only the translucent green bracelet the hue of the dragon\u2019s pool. The pale, spotted bangle of leopard jade, I gave to Sarangerel, knowing it was her favorite. I gave a bangle of lavender jade to Checheg in keeping for Bayar, whom I had helped deliver.</p><p>\u201cMoirin, you cannot keep giving valuable things away!\u201d Checheg protested. \u201cYou are a long way from home, and you may need them.\u201d</p><p>I touched the blue silk scarf draped around my neck. \u201cYou have given me more valuable gifts, Checheg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did but honor the laws of hospitality,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p><p>I smiled through my tears. \u201cNo. You offered me kinship. That is a great deal more.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and gave me a hard, fierce hug. \u201cYou are a very strange girl.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou are not the first person to tell me this.\u201d</p><p>When there were no more good-byes to be said, Batu gave the command to mount and ride.</p><p>Once again, I was leaving behind people I had come to care for. As grateful as I was to answer the relentless call of my diadh-anam, it hurt, too. Mayhap Checheg was right and I would come to regret it, but for now, I was glad I had given away such gifts as I had. They left behind a trail of mementos among the lives that had touched mine. Whether they knew it or not, Bao\u2019s sister Song\u2019s story was linked to my young friend Sarangerel\u2019s.</p><p>It pleased me to think on it. And I had kept the tokens that were the most important to me.</p><p>I had my dragon-pool bangle\u2014and another gift from Snow Tiger, a dagger with an ivory hilt carved in the shape of a dragon. I had the Imperial jade medallion. I had the squares of cloth that Bao\u2019s mother and sister had embroidered.</p><p>I had the blue silk scarf Checheg had given me.</p><p>Somewhere in the depths of my battered canvas satchel, I had a crystal bottle of perfume that had been Jehanne\u2019s parting gift. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had a signet ring my mother had given me so very long ago, etched with twin crests\u2014the boar of the Cullach Gorrym in Alba and the swan of House Courcel in Terre d\u2019Ange, signifying my dual inheritance.</p><p>And I had the yew-wood bow my uncle Mabon had made for me, still resilient and sturdy.</p><p>It was enough.</p> <p>ELEVEN</p><p>Twenty-one of us rode to the gathering of the tribes\u2014twenty Tatars, plus me. Among the Tatars, there were sixteen men and four women.</p><p>It seemed I fell somewhere in between.</p><p>I had not come to know any of the women outside Batu\u2019s ger well, and nothing changed on our journey. When we made camp at night, the women demurred politely, refusing my assistance. We travelled lightly, subsisting on dried meat and chunks of hardened cheese aged to the point that it took forever to soften in the mouth\u2014at least when there was nothing better.</p><p>During the day, the younger men invited me to hunt with them as we rode, shooting at the thick-furred groundhogs that had emerged from hibernation. These were cooked by virtue of slitting their bellies, removing their entrails and inserting heated stones inside the carcasses.</p> <p>It was not very tasty.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>We rode beneath the blue sky, and slept beneath the stars. And with every league that passed, my diadh-anam sang inside me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even care when I sensed Bao on the move once more. Wherever he was, he was travelling slowly and in the same direction.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Batu agreed when I remarked on it. \u201cIf he is with General Arslan, he is going to the gathering of tribes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens there?\u201d I asked, curious.</p> <p>He stroked his chin. \u201cThere will be feasting and games. There will be delegates from other nations. Strategy is discussed. The Great Khan will make his wishes known to us.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Batu\u2019s shoulders moved in a faint shrug. \u201cDo not be concerned. I do not expect there to be talk of war, Moirin. The Emperor of Ch\u2019in\u2019s hand has been strengthened in this last year, in part thanks to you. Of that, I will not speak at the gathering. But we have agreements with others regarding securing the overland trade routes. Vralians, perhaps even northern Bhodistani. Some will be present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said a second time, frowning. I knew the names. Bhodistan\u2014that was the birthplace of Sakyamuni, the Enlightened One, whose followers travelled the Path of Dharma.</p><p>Vralia.....</p><p>I knew that name, too.</p><p>Berlik had fled there\u2014Berlik the Oath-Breaker, the last great magician of the Maghuin Dhonn.</p><p>The last shape-changer.</p> <p>He had met his death in the northern wilds of Vralia, hunted down by the relentless D\u2019Angeline prince he had betrayed. In the end, Berlik had sought out his death, seeking to make atonement. He had knelt in the falling snow and bowed his head to the sword. Prince Imriel had slain him and wept at the deed. When I was ten years of age, my mother had taken me to visit the green mound in Clunderry where Berlik\u2019s severed head was buried, a reminder of my people\u2019s folly.</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>\u201cDo not be afraid, Moirin,\u201d Batu said, mistaking my unease. He leaned over in the saddle and patted my shoulder awkwardly. \u201cI promise you, no one speaks of war this year, only treaties and strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am glad,\u201d I said sincerely.</p><p>He lowered his voice. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Eight days into our journey, Bao stopped moving and stayed in one place.</p><p>Bao knew I was coming; he had to know. The spark that burned in me, burned in him. And at least he was not fleeing it.</p><p>That was something.</p><p>Much of the entry into the campsite is a blur in my memory. There were gers and tents erected, that I remember. There were Tatars, more than I could count\u2014and other folk, too. Vralians in thick, woolen clothing trimmed with a great deal of fur. After so long among the Ch\u2019in and Tatars, it came as a shock to me to see Western features, and fair skin and light eyes and hair on many of them. There were others I thought must be Bhodistani, with warm brown skin, clad in many layers of bright attire.</p><p>Bao.</p><p>I felt his presence like a drumbeat in my heart\u2014in my heart, and on my skin. So close; ah, gods! I barely took stock of the camp, wandering like a blind woman, driven by my diadh-anam\u2019s insistent pulse.</p><p>Batu understood. \u201cGo,\u201d he said gently to me. \u201cGo, and find him.\u201d</p><p>I went, following the call of my soul.</p><p>There were folk milling everywhere\u2014folk, cattle, horses, and dogs. Astride Ember, I picked my way through them. Even here, people paused to stare. The Vralians in particular whispered and murmured amongst themselves. I wasn\u2019t sure why, since it didn\u2019t seem green eyes would be unusual for their kind. I supposed it was because I was dressed as a Tatar, despite my green eyes and half-D\u2019Angeline features.</p><p>It seemed the games had already begun. Outside the perimeter of the vast campsite, I caught glimpses of boys racing on horseback. Within the camp, I passed men wrestling, stripped to the waist and grappling with one another.</p><p>I heard the sound of staves clattering.</p><p>My diadh-anam flared inside me.</p><p>Even at a distance, I picked Bao out of the fighters. Although his back was turned to me, there was no mistaking his acrobat\u2019s agility, his quickness and grace, coupled with the sense of unbridled glee with which he fought, toying with his opponents. The air felt thick and dense around me, and I struggled to draw breath. Forcing myself to breathe the Breath of Wind\u2019s Sigh, I approached slowly. Some yards from the makeshift fighting ring, I drew rein to watch.</p><p>Bao froze, his head tilted.</p><p>He knew I was there. Although he did not turn around, he knew it. I saw it in the tension of his strong, lean shoulders, the taut cords at the back of his neck.</p><p>The two husky Tatars he was fighting shouted and converged on him, staves whistling through the air.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Bao went from utter stillness into blurred motion, spinning and vaulting. No longer toying, he dispatched his opponents with ruthless efficiency. One went down with a hard blow to the back of his skull, sprawling to measure his length on the trampled grass. The other, Bao tripped and laid flat in a move too quick for the eye to see. Seeing the butt of a staff poised to crush his throat, the man called out an urgent surrender.</p><p>Bao took a step backward, whipping his bamboo staff upright. He planted it in the dirt, standing with his head bowed.</p><p>I swallowed hard and dismounted, my heart thundering in my breast.</p><p>With his head lowered, his unruly black hair hung over his brow, obscuring his eyes. Absurdly, I thought how much it had grown since I had seen him last. I\u2019d shaved it myself when Bao and Master Lo Feng and the others had taken on the guise of travelling monks sworn to the Path of Dharma.</p><p>He was clad in felted trousers and thick Tatar boots, bare-chested save for a woolen vest with ornate embroidery. His chest rose and fell swiftly, and sweat glistened on his sleek brown skin.</p><p>His knuckles were pale where they gripped his bamboo staff. I knew that staff well, bound with metal, carved with characters. It had been broken in two during the battle for White Jade Mountain.</p><p>I had made it whole.</p><p>I did not know how to do the same for us.</p><p>There were onlookers idly cheering Bao\u2019s victory. Sensing the rising tension in the air, their cheers faltered and fell silent. Without looking at me, Bao gestured to his second opponent. Nodding, the man helped his fallen fellow to his feet, slinging one arm over his brawny shoulders. Together they limped away. Everyone else kept a safe distance.</p><p>Bao lifted his head and for the first time, met my eyes. \u201cMoirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>His dark eyes glittered\u2014whether with anger or something else, I could not say. I could not read his expression. His body was still and rigid, but I thought mayhap there was a reluctant tenderness lurking in the corners of his lips. His throat worked as he searched for words, his eyes searching mine. \u201cYou could not wait for me to choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I took a sharp breath. \u201cNo! Gods bedamned, Bao! You speak as though you were the only one to have a choice in this matter. Well, you\u2019re not. You asked me to wait, and I did. I got tired of it. I chose to wait no longer.\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Frustration rose in me. \u201cCan you not at least face me, you infernally stubborn peasant-boy? Gods! If you weren\u2019t willing to do that much at least, you should have run away. You had to know I was coming!\u201d</p><p>Bao\u2019s hand slid down his staff. \u201cI knew,\u201d he murmured, his head averted. \u201cI chose to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d To my chagrin, I was crying. If his diadh-anam was burning half as brightly as mine, yearning to close the distance between us, I couldn\u2019t imagine how he was resisting its call. It was taking every ounce of pride I possessed not to go to him, but I was damned if I would take those last few steps. \u201cWhy did you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is your Imperial entourage, Moirin?\u201d Bao asked, not answering my question. He frowned toward the horizon. \u201cYou took me by surprise. I knew you were close, but I thought you would enter with fanfare. Did Ten Tigers Dai come with you? I would be pleased to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no entourage,\u201d I muttered, wiping at my tears. \u201cNo Imperial entourage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bao stared at me as though my words made no sense.</p><p>\u201cThere is no Imperial entourage,\u201d I repeated with irritation. \u201cForgive me, I did not know you were missing Ten Tigers Dai so badly. I came on my own. Well, that is not entirely true,\u201d I added. \u201cI came with representatives of Batu\u2019s tribe, who gave me hospitality during the long winter. They have been very kind to me. But it is not exactly an entourage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.....\u201d The blood drained from Bao\u2019s face, leaving him ashen. He continued to stare at me in horrified disbelief. \u201cAre you saying you set out in pursuit of me alone? Across the Tatar steppe? In winter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bao,\u201d I said with precision. \u201cThat is exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>The blood rushed back into his face, flushing his high, wide cheekbones. He began shouting at me. \u201cOh, you stupid, stupid girl, in the name of all that is holy\u2014\u201d</p><p>I overrode him, my voice rising as I shouted in reply. \u201cWhat else was I to do, Bao? You needed me to find a way to prove myself to you. How else was I to do it? Was I to wait forever in Shuntian like some poor besotted fool jilted by her suitor, praying for his return? You said yourself you didn\u2019t know if you would come back! This was the only thing I could think to do! And if you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he crossed the distance between us.</p><p>I felt his arms come around me, and I clung to him, shameless, my tirade forgotten. The twinned flames of our diadh-anams surged, and I thought the blaze must be visible to onlookers. I could feel people staring, could hear shocked whispers, but I didn\u2019t care; and it appeared that Bao didn\u2019t, either. Both of us were silent for a time. It seemed a moment too vast for words. At last, Bao pressed his cheek against my hair and spoke in a low voice. \u201cMoirin, do you not understand that what I feel for you is so strong it terrifies me? It\u2019s unnatural. I needed time to try and make sense of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered against his bare shoulder. He smelled of clean sweat and his own underlying scent, like heated metal. \u201cBelieve me, I know. I feel it, too. But hiding from it will not make it go away.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNo. I know.\u201d</p><p>I stole a glance at him. That was definitely tenderness lurking in the corners of his mouth, the hint of a reluctant smile. I lifted one hand to stroke the hard, chiseled line of his jaw. \u201cStupid boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid girl.\u201d Bao lowered his head and kissed me.</p><p>Higher and higher, the blaze within me climbed. Ah, gods! It was terrible and glorious all at once.</p><p>I sank both hands into his hair, returning his kiss with ardor. The desire that had begun to rise with the coming of spring burst its last shackle. Naamah\u2019s gift unfurled within me like an endless ribbon of gold, infusing every part of me. When Bao broke the kiss, I was dizzy and breathless with a need beyond longing.</p><p>\u201cIs there someplace\u2014\u201d I began to ask.</p><p>Bao nodded, his eyes glittering. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and I followed in his wake, half stumbling with the insistency of desire. I was vaguely aware of him ordering some fellow to secure my horse Ember, vaguely aware that the man obeyed with deference.</p><p>With only a brief hesitation, Bao led me to a small ger. Unable to pay heed to aught but my own need, I didn\u2019t hear what he said to its inhabitants, but whatever it was, they departed with alacrity, leaving us alone.</p><p>Bao undressed me with fierce urgency, his hands and mouth staking claim to every inch of skin he uncovered; and I did the same to him. We grappled with one another, waging love like war. He bit and sucked at my throat, his callused hands caressing my breasts, pulling at my aching nipples. I licked the fresh, salty sweat from his bare chest, sinking lower to take his firm, throbbing phallus in my mouth until he groaned and tugged me upward, rolling me over effortlessly and pinning me to the carpeted floor of the ger.</p><p>It was not a gentle coupling, at least not at first.</p><p>The need was too great; the need of our long-separated diadh-anams yearning to be fully joined, driving the need of our willing bodies. What Master Lo Feng had done to us had erased the division between flesh and spirit.</p><p>And when Bao entered me.....</p><p>I have no words to describe it. If our diadh-anams had shone like beacons before, now, reunited, they erupted like wildfire, blazing toward heaven. I felt as though my heart might burst the confines of my breast.</p><p>\u201cBao,\u201d I whispered, tears in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered in reply, wonder in his. \u201cMoirin, I know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a long moment, we lay locked together without moving, marveling at the intensity of our joining.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, it faded.</p><p>In its place, Naamah\u2019s gift reasserted its presence. Desire\u2014this time simple and carnal\u2014nothing more. I surrendered to it gratefully, kissing Bao\u2019s throat, wrapping my ankles around his buttocks. He propped himself on his elbows above me, his eyes dark and distant with desire, thrusting slowly in and out of me.</p> <p>Stone and sea, it felt good! Again and again, I came beneath him, each shivering climax a physical echo of what I had felt when our spirits merged. Intangible brightness blossomed behind my eyes like a thousand flowers blooming at once, like stars falling from the night sky, tracing incandescent arcs across the glittering darkness. The bright lady smiled, placing a shining kiss filled with love upon my brow. It had been too long, far too long, since I had felt Naamah\u2019s approval.</p><p>Bao\u2019s pace quickened.</p><p>I urged him onward, my hips rising to meet him, willing him to spend himself inside me. At last he did, his entire body shuddering.</p><p>I sighed, content.</p><p>Bao rolled off me. \u201cI ran away from this?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d He raised one hand to his lips, kissing my fingertips. \u201cLet us be serious, now. Truly, do you know what of this is real, and what is the result of Master Lo\u2019s art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted, stroking his chest. I felt at peace for the first time since he had left me. \u201cBut, Bao..... we\u2019ll never sort it out apart. Can we not figure it out together? At least the endless clamor of my soul has gone silent. Is it not the same for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Bao agreed. \u201cThat part\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again. \u201cWell, mayhap in the silence, we\u2019ll be able to listen to our hearts again.\u201d</p><p>The wooden door of the ger banged open. I squinted against the sudden stream of ordinary sunlight. A small, sturdy figure stormed into the ger, haranguing Bao at the top of her lungs. He rose to his feet, clutching a blanket around him, and replied in an aggrieved tone, both of them speaking too quickly for me to follow. Having said her piece, the young woman stormed out in a huff, slamming the door behind her.</p> <p>\u201cBao?\u201d I asked. \u201cWho was that, and why is she furious at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh.....\u201d He ran one hand over his rumpled hair and gave me a sheepish look. \u201cThat was my wife.\u201d</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>I stared at Bao. \u201cYour wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long, cold winter!\u201d he said in a defensive tone, yanking on his felted trousers. \u201cWill you tell me you of all people slept in an empty bed, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI..... yes!\u201d Even as the words left my mouth, I remembered that I would have been happy to spend the winter in Shuntian with Snow Tiger if she had permitted it, and my denial emerged with rather less conviction than I intended. Bao raised one eyebrow at me. \u201cIn fact, I did,\u201d I said indignantly. \u201cAsk Batu, or any of his people.\u201d</p><p>Bao tugged on his boots. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. But it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cOh, gods bedamned! Fine. I\u2019m the last person to deny you the right to take pleasure and comfort where you find it. But, Bao..... a wife?\u201d A pang squeezed my heart. \u201cDo you love her? Is that it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d he repeated, shrugging into his woolen vest. \u201cYou see, she\u2019s the Great Khan\u2019s youngest daughter.\u201d</p><p>At a loss for words, I continued to stare at him. Now, belatedly, I remembered how folk in the campsite had deferred to Bao, how everyone in the ger had departed swiftly at his command. Insofar as I\u2019d noticed, I\u2019d assumed it was because General Arslan had acknowledged him, or even just because of his prowess as a fighter. Never in a thousand years had I thought it was because he was the Great Khan\u2019s son-in-law.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go to her.\u201d Bao stooped before me, crouching on his heels. \u201cTerbish is the name of the fellow I asked to see to your horse. He\u2019ll escort you to your tribe\u2019s camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an escort!\u201d I shouted at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love her,\u201d he said abruptly. The words lay between us in an uncomfortable silence. \u201cBut Erdene is the Great Khan\u2019s daughter, and I suspect you are not one of her favorite people right now. Accept the escort.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll accept the escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bao straightened, waiting until I relented and looked at him. \u201cI am sorry, Moirin. I didn\u2019t do this to hurt you. I never wanted to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d I said dully.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll come find you later. We have a lot to talk about.\u201d He tried a faint smile on me. \u201cSomehow, I thought there would be time for talking first. I should have known better, huh?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>As soon as Bao left the ger, I dressed in a hurry. My body was still singing with the aftermath of long-denied pleasure and my diadh-anam was quiet within me, but there was a maelstrom of confusion and betrayal in my heart.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t entirely fair, of course. But..... a wife?</p><p>True to Bao\u2019s word, the man Terbish was waiting for me, holding Ember\u2019s reins. I nodded my thanks to him. He walked beside me as I rode slowly back to Batu\u2019s camp. Now folk were definitely staring, and I heard a murmuring susurrus of gossip that was all too familiar. I gritted my teeth, refusing to feel embarrassed. It wasn\u2019t my fault that I\u2019d just engaged in a very public display of affection, and what was doubtless an obvious bout of intensive lovemaking, with the Great Khan\u2019s son-in-law.</p><p>Back at the tribe\u2019s camp, a pair of Vralians with ornate chains around their necks were talking with Batu through an interpreter. Seeing me return, Batu dismissed them and hurried over to me, his kind eyes soft with concern. I could tell that the news had travelled fast.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. Although it was customary in Tatar culture to deny any troubles on first inquiry, I didn\u2019t have the heart for it. \u201cBatu, I didn\u2019t know, I swear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this to be true,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI have given you the hospitality of my roof. You are a truthful person.\u201d</p><p>It made me feel better. I gazed after the departing Vralians. \u201cWhat did those fellows want?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThem? They always want to talk about their gods. But they were asking about you, too.\u201d A glint came into his eyes. \u201cI told them you were a mighty sorceress who brought the Great Khan\u2019s son-in-law back from death, and that there is a powerful bond between you. Do not worry, I did not speak of Ch\u2019in. It will not cause trouble. It will teach them to respect and fear you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very fearsome.\u201d</p><p>Batu patted my arm. \u201cYou did nothing wrong. Blame the young man. He has been untruthful.\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cThey did not even know he was twice-born!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBao has been hiding from many things,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>I tried to make myself useful around the camp, but most of the work of setting up had already been done, and I was restless once more. If Checheg had been there, she would have shooed me away. So instead, I shooed myself away, saddling the uncomplaining Ember once more.</p><p>No doubt Bao would have scolded me for riding out without an escort, but I didn\u2019t intend to make myself an easy target for any vengeful Tatar princess. I rode through the campsite with my bow held loosely in one hand, guiding Ember with my knees, gazing fixedly forward with my mother\u2019s best glare.</p><p>Many people stared, but no one troubled me.</p><p>On the outskirts of camp, I passed a group of men slaughtering a sheep in the Tatar manner. I\u2019d seen it done only once before, for the festival of the New Year. Two men held the sheep down on its back. A third man made a small incision in the sheep\u2019s abdomen, then plunged his hand into the slit, reaching for the sheep\u2019s heart within the cavity of its body and squeezing it until it ceased to beat. It was done so swiftly, the sheep scarcely had time to struggle.</p><p>I felt as though Bao had done much the same to me.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019d passed the sheep-slaughterers, I summoned the twilight, breathing it in deeply and flinging it around my horse and myself. The world softened and dimmed in the silvery-violet dusk, easing my troubled spirits. A few seconds later, I heard a soft gasp behind me, and the murmur of voices. My passage and my subsequent, abrupt disappearance had been noted.</p><p>Well and so, let them take heed. Batu had a point; it was better to be feared and respected than despised. I smiled grimly to myself and nudged Ember with my heels, setting out at a trot.</p><p>The campsite was situated alongside a wide, meandering river. I followed its course aimlessly toward the north, riding over the twilit grasslands until the tents and gers behind me looked as small as toys. I rode until I found a flat, windswept place where I could sit and watch the river.</p><p>There, I dismounted and turned Ember loose to graze.</p><p>I sat cross-legged and tried to meditate, but my thoughts were a jumble. I could not let one thought rise from another. So instead, I concentrated on breathing, cycling through the Five Styles, willing my mind to be empty.</p><p>In perhaps an hour\u2019s time, I sensed Bao\u2019s presence growing closer. In the twilight, I could see the silver spark of his diadh-anam coming toward me over the plains even before I could make out his form.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see me, of course; but he didn\u2019t need to. Bao knew where I was as surely as I did him.</p><p>He turned his shaggy pony loose to graze with Ember and sat cross-legged opposite me without speaking, laying his staff across his lap and settling into a breathing rhythm that matched mine. We might have been Master Lo\u2019s magpie and his least likely pupil once more. Except that in the twilight, Bao looked different than he had before.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that the spark of the divine spirit of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself shone within him. The faint shimmer of darkness that surrounded him since his rebirth was deeper here, impossible to ignore, impossible to dismiss as a trick of the light. It flickered all around him\u2014darkness made bright, a penumbra like an eclipsed moon. Gazing at it, I remembered that there was more at issue here than the fact that Bao had left me and ridden away to find his blood-father and wed some Tatar princess in the bargain.</p><p>He had died, and been restored to life. He was twice-born, and he was learning how to live with it. And although I was angry, mayhap I owed him the chance to explain.</p><p>With a sigh, I released the twilight, letting the daylight world return.</p><p>Bao\u2019s lips parted at my sudden appearance, but having known I was there all along, he showed no other sign of surprise. I tilted my head to indicate I was listening. He nodded in acknowledgment and cleared his throat. \u201cFirst of all, it would have been a grave discourtesy to refuse such an honor from the Great Khan. Second, I did not seek it out, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cYou remember Master Lo\u2019s snowdrop bulbs?\u201d he asked me. \u201cWell, I took them. I made a tonic like Master Lo prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I wasn\u2019t very good at holding my tongue. \u201cI heard. That\u2019s how you bribed your way into General Arslan\u2019s favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s favor, yes.\u201d Bao fidgeted with his staff, frowning a little. \u201cIt\u2019s true, you know. Although the truth isn\u2019t exactly what I expected it to be. I thought..... I thought that mayhap that once I gained his trust, I would avenge my family\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s complicated,\u201d I said in a neutral tone.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He straightened his back. \u201cFor now, it is enough to say that my father claimed me with pride, and I allowed it. When the Great Khan Naram visited his most loyal general, he was intrigued. He wished to see the fighting prowess of which my father boasted. He wished to sample my famed tonic. I obliged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Great Khan was pleased,\u201d I noted.</p><p>\u201cVery pleased,\u201d Bao agreed. \u201cSo pleased that he insisted on giving me his youngest daughter in marriage.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at him. \u201cBao, you are the stubbornest person I\u2019ve ever met, and now that Master Lo is gone, I do not think there is anyone under the sun who could make you do a thing if you did not wish it. You\u2019re a clever and skilled liar. Don\u2019t tell me you could not have talked your way out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>I waited.</p><p>Bao sighed. \u201cMoirin, you possess a gift the likes of which no one outside your strange bear-folk has ever seen. You possess a strange beauty the likes of which no one has ever seen. You are descended from three different royal lineages. And I\u2019m nothing but a simple Ch\u2019in peasant-boy\u2014or at least I was. Do you think I don\u2019t know it matters?\u201d</p><p>I looked blankly at him. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who insisted on referring to yourself thusly! What did I ever say or do to make you think it mattered to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to say anything!\u201d His voice rose. \u201cGods, Moirin! Do you know how much gossip I had to endure in Terre d\u2019Ange? I know your history as well as my own. Better, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there was that lord\u2019s son in Alba, the one who died.\u201d He began to recite a litany of my lovers, ticking them off on his fingers. \u201cAnd I am sorry, because I know you cared for him, but he was a lord\u2019s son. High-and-mighty Lion Mane, that Raphael de Mereliot, what was he? Some kind of nobleman. His sister ruled a city, anyway. When you quarreled with him, you bedded the Crown Prince, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Bao raised his brows at me. \u201cThat\u2019s what they all said. And when you quarreled with both of them, the White Queen herself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I flushed. \u201cAye, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut me off, lowering his voice to a fierce, hushed whisper as though someone might overhear us. \u201cAnd I am not sure how to count the fact that a dragon decided you were a worthy mate for the heir to the throne of the Celestial Empire, but I am quite sure it does count, even if the Noble Princess was not particularly pleased with his choice. There is no place for peasants in your history, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as clever as you think,\u201d I muttered. \u201cYou missed one.\u201d</p> <p>It was Bao\u2019s turn to look blank. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one important.\u201d I drew up my knees beneath my Tatar coat, wrapping my arms around them. \u201cHis name was Theo, I think. He drove the coach that brought me to the City of Elua. By the way, I have not kept count of the bored wives you claim to have bedded, although I am grateful for all they taught you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d Bao eyed me. \u201cA coach-driver?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, resting my chin on my knees. \u201cIn the stables along our route, yes. It was after Cillian\u2019s death. I took comfort in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you spurned him in the end,\u201d he said uncertainly. \u201cRight?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cNot I, no. It was his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe spurned you?\u201d Bao shot me an incredulous look. \u201cWhat an idiot!\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a fine one to talk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.....\u201d Bao leaned forward to take my hands in his, gazing intently at me. \u201cAll right, perhaps I was wrong about certain things. But this I know to be true. Before what happened, happened..... it is as I told you, I was ready to ask Master Lo to release me from his service. I was ready to give up my life as his magpie for you. After his death.....\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI could not bear to be herded into accepting my fate like some stupid, mindless sheep. I needed to find a way to make this choice my own. To make it meaningful, to make it a choice that counted for something larger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy finding something worthy of sacrificing?\u201d I asked. I did not fully understand the way his fierce sense of pride goaded him, but I\u2019d come to recognize its workings.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI did not think of it so, but..... perhaps.\u201d</p> <p>I bowed my head over our joined hands, rubbing my thumbs over his callused palms. \u201cSo everything comes around full circle,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThe peasant-boy has become a prince. What do you want, Bao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>The certainty in his dark, steady gaze undid me. I wanted to believe in it. I glanced at him, then away. \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>He smiled wryly. \u201cWhen I first sensed you coming after me, I\u2019ll admit, I was angry. Angry that you could not bring yourself to trust me long enough to wait. Angry that you would use all the resources at your disposal to hunt me down like a runaway dog.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNever, ever did I imagine you were not travelling with an Imperial entourage. The Noble Princess would have granted you whatever you had asked,\u201d he added. \u201cI know she is a very private person who does not show her feelings easily, but despite the way things began, I think she came to be fond of you, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>A memory from those last few days in Shuntian arose unbidden: Snow Tiger, kneeling over me in a bed strewn with the cushions I had asked for. I\u2019d never grown accustomed to the hard wooden or porcelain stands that passed for pillows among the Ch\u2019in. Are you quite sure this is enough cushions, my barbarian? she had teased me, her eyes bright with affection, her hair hanging loose and unbound to curtain both our faces with black, shining silk. When she shook her head, it tickled. Are you quite sure you are comfortable?</p><p>It was a memory I did not intend to share with anyone, even Bao. That had been a time of grace, and it was Naamah\u2019s business.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cAh..... yes, I know. And yes, she begged me to accept an entourage. But, Bao, your anger proves it would have had exactly the result I feared\u2014not to mention the possibility of provoking outrage among the Tatars. And unlike you, the princess respected me enough to believe me when I said I could take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Bao gave me a skeptical look. \u201cThat is because you were always strong for her. You showed her every kindness and gave her a shoulder to lean on when she did not know she needed one.\u201d</p> <p>That was true, and I did not argue.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, it does not matter.\u201d His hands tightened on mine. \u201cToday, when I learned you came after me alone, I felt as though the earth had dropped away beneath me. Even though you were standing safe and whole before me, the thought of what could have happened to you terrified me. I do not ever want to feel it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d In a firm, steady tone, Bao said the words he had never before spoken to me, the words he had died without speaking. \u201cThere is a great deal we have to figure out together, but of that, I am sure. And if you will have me, it is my choice to be with you. Will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My diadh-anam blazed and my heart sang within me, not squeezed lifeless in my chest after all. I took a deep breath, willing myself not to cry. \u201cYes, my Tatar prince, I will have you.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders relaxed. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my hands from his, wiping my eyes. \u201cWhat do we do now? What about this girl, Erlene? You said you did not love her; does she love you? If so, you\u2019ve used her unkindly.\u201d</p><p>Bao hesitated. \u201cErdene. She thinks she does. She is very young, and jealous. You are right, I\u2019ve wronged her. I will ask her forgiveness, but I do not think she will be quick to grant it. And..... I do not know how one goes about setting aside the Great Khan\u2019s daughter. I do not think it will be easy.\u201d</p><p>Suspicion flared within me. \u201cYou\u2019re not suggesting taking me as a second wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He raised his hands in denial. \u201cNo, Moirin.\u201d His mouth quirked. \u201cAmong other things, I do not think I would trust you with anyone\u2019s wife, my own included. You have too many strange desires.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>Bao took my hand again, my right hand. With his left, he tapped his chest. \u201cListen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my heart?\u201d I asked uncertainly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI think we are in agreement for now. No. The other thing, the shining thing that binds us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy diadh-anam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He repeated the word carefully. \u201cOur diadh-anam.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and listened. Opposite me, Bao began breathing the Breath of Earth\u2019s Pulse, slow and deep. I fell into his rhythm. We were together, hands clasped. My divided soul was at peace. For the first time since my spirit had been sundered, I could sense my destiny calling to me, far, far away.</p><p>So far away, it might be home.</p><p>\u201cWest,\u201d I whispered, opening my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s beckoning us westward.\u201d</p><p>Bao nodded. \u201cI dream of bears, Moirin. I dream of a hollow hill with a wondrous, shining cave inside it. I dream of a doorway built of three slabs of stone. And I would like to go there with you.\u201d</p><p>I flung my arms around his neck, kissing him. \u201cThen we will find a way.\u201d</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>By the time we returned, the campsite was abuzz with a fresh set of gossip, spurred by the tales Batu had told.</p><p>\u201cWhy do they stare anew?\u201d Bao muttered.</p><p>\u201cAh.....\u201d I winced. \u201cI daresay it is because Batu told them you were restored from death, and I am the sorceress who made it happen. Twice-born, they call you. Bao, why didn\u2019t you tell them?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI sought to begin a new life. And I did not wish to stir trouble. I have not told anyone my story since I left a very small village in Ch\u2019in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonghe?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a startled look. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed in your footsteps,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cI found the village. I met your mother and your sister\u2014and your father, too.\u201d</p><p>Bao looked away. \u201cHe is not my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know.\u201d I fidgeted with the last remaining jade bangle on my wrist, the one the color of the dragon\u2019s pool. \u201cBut he is a man racked by guilt and sorrow. Anyway, I liked your mother and sister very much. I have a gift for you,\u201d I added. \u201cA piece of your mother\u2019s embroidery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d For a moment, he looked young and vulnerable.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>Bao blew out his breath. \u201cYes. She is my mother. I should have asked for a gift to remember her by.\u201d</p><p>I did not say that I had bought the piece, paying Auntie Ai\u2019s best price because his mother could not afford to make a gift of it. Not to me, not even to Bao, her long-lost and much-beloved son. I did not tell him that I had given gifts of Imperial jade to his mother and sister\u2014and aye, to his father who was not a father.</p><p>\u201cIt is enough that she remembers you,\u201d I said instead. \u201cIt is a square she embroidered after your visit. You spoke of your travels with Master Lo Feng to her. It has a pattern of magpies. She hoped that it would please you.\u201d</p><p>Bao\u2019s dark eyes shone, this time with unshed tears. \u201cThank you. Your kindness is not confined to princesses and dragons, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of one eye, I caught sight of a small, stalwart figure surrounded by guards glaring at me.</p><p>Erdene, the Great Khan\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d I murmured, tightening my reins, tightening the grip of my thighs. Ember stepped backward, picking up his hooves with precision, obedient to my touch. \u201cBut a kindness extended to one may be an unwitting cruelty dealt to another. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will talk on the morrow, then.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, turning my mount. \u201cOn the morrow. I\u2019ll bring your mother\u2019s gift.\u201d</p><p>I slept, deep and dreamless. Complicated though matters might be, for the first time since Bao had died, I was at peace.</p><p>The following day brought a request for an appearance\u2014not from Bao, but from his father, General Arslan. I was reluctant to accept it, but Batu advised me that it would be rude to refuse.</p><p>\u201cOyun and I will accompany you,\u201d Batu said firmly. \u201cI will make it clear that you are under the hospitality of my roof.\u201d</p><p>I was reluctant to endanger him. \u201cWhat happens if the general chooses to ignore that fact?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIf he harms you, it will be cause for a blood feud. I do not think he will be quick to do so.\u201d</p><p>It was not particularly reassuring, but when Batu pointed out that Checheg would have his hide if he didn\u2019t do his best to protect me, I acceded. So it was that Batu and Oyun, one of the young men with whom I\u2019d often raced and shot at targets, accompanied me to General Arslan\u2019s ger.</p><p>A burly fellow wearing a curved scimitar at his belt ducked inside to fetch the general when we arrived. We dismounted and waited until General Arslan emerged.</p><p>Bao\u2019s father.</p><p>I could see the resemblance in the strong line of his brows, and most of all, his eyes. They were set at the same angle as Bao\u2019s, and they held the same proud spark in their dark depths. Although an old scar bisected the general\u2019s right eyebrow and dragged down his lid, his eye glittered fiercely beneath the drooping lid. The men exchanged customary Tatar pleasantries about cattle while I waited nervously.</p><p>\u201cThis is Moirin,\u201d Batu said at length, speaking slowly for my benefit. \u201cShe is a guest under my roof.\u201d He nodded significantly at the blue silk scarf I wore draped around my neck. \u201cMy wife, Checheg, has given her a gift of kinship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d General Arslan\u2019s gaze settled on me. \u201cMoirin mac Fainche.\u201d He made a point of pronouncing my name with care. \u201cI would speak with you. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will accompany her,\u201d Batu said.</p><p>The general raised his left brow in a familiar, sardonic gesture. \u201cSurely you do not question the hospitality of my roof?\u201d</p><p>Batu hesitated, then shook his head, defeated. \u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d General Arslan beckoned to me. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>I followed him into the ger. There was a youngish woman there who did not meet my eyes, and two girls no older than Sarangerel who stole curious glances at me. The youngish woman poured a bowl of salty tea and offered it to me, all the while avoiding my gaze. I accepted it with thanks. As soon as she had done the same for the general, she gathered her daughters and left.</p><p>\u201cLet us sit.\u201d The general indicated the table and low chairs. I sat warily opposite him. He sipped his tea and studied me, taking my measure without speaking.</p><p>Suspecting I could not match his capacity for silence, I didn\u2019t bother trying. \u201cYou wished to speak to me?\u201d I asked politely.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He took another sip of tea. \u201cFirst, I wished to see you. Having done so, I understand why my son is enamored.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head. \u201cYou are kind to say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you bewitched him?\u201d he asked in a steady tone. \u201cThere is talk of it.\u201d</p><p>I flushed. The inquiry evoked painful memories of Cillian, my lost first love. His mother had accused me of bewitching him, too. And yet this time there was an element of truth to it. \u201cNo,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cWe are bound together, he and I. But it was not by my choice. I did not know it would happen.\u201d</p><p>General Arslan took a thoughtful sip of tea. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we are bound together,\u201d I said, adding, \u201cAnd I love him.\u201d</p><p>He ignored my last comment. \u201cIf it is true that you are bound, it seems to me that until you arrived, my son sought to break that binding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shifted in my chair. \u201cI do not believe that is exactly true, but I cannot speak for Bao. It may be that there are truths of his heart he has not shared with you.\u201d</p><p>He raised that eyebrow again. \u201cOf course there are. I am not so foolish as to believe he came seeking me with an open heart. But he came seeking knowledge of himself, and he has found more than he expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd now he is ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>The general folded his hands atop the table. \u201cI do not wish to lose my son,\u201d he said in a formal tone. \u201cWhen I lost my wife, I spent many long months searching for her, and many months avenging her loss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cI did not take another wife for a long time,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen I did, she gave me nothing but daughters. I have yearned for a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Emperor of Ch\u2019in is content to take pride in a daughter,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The scar tissue on General Arslan\u2019s right eyelid tightened. \u201cSo it is said. The warrior princess who descended from heaven in a dragon\u2019s claw to reunify the Celestial Empire.\u201d His eye twitched. \u201cIt is rumored that you are more than passing familiar with the tale.\u201d</p><p>I held my tongue\u2014and my breath, too.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, that means that there is a good possibility that the same holds true for my son,\u201d he mused. \u201cSo I will not pursue these rumors. You might wish to tell Batu that his young tribesmen are not discreet when their tongues are plied with airag.\u201d</p><p>I let out my breath in a sigh. \u201cI am sorry for the loss of your first wife, for it seems you loved her very much. And I am sorry that your second wife has not given you sons. But Bao\u2019s choice is his own to make, and I swear to you, all the magic in the world could not sway him against his will. He is very, very stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Unexpectedly, General Arslan smiled. It lent his scarred face a sudden roguish charm, and I found myself smiling in response. \u201cThat is one of the reasons I know he is my son.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cMoirin mac Fainche.\u201d He leaned forward, his smile fading. Intensity returned to his eyes. \u201cWhat offer can I make you that would persuade you to leave, and leave my son in peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d I swallowed the laughter that died in my throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is none. If Bao bade me go, I would go. But he carries half of my soul inside him, and so long as I live, I will yearn to be with him.\u201d</p> <p>The general leaned back in his chair. \u201cYou claim this matter of his death and rebirth is true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see it, then.\u201d He gestured. \u201cYour magic.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cBecause it is a gift of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, and a sacred trust given to my people to hold. Because I have let myself be used unwisely in the past. I will not perform tricks to satisfy your curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill not or cannot?\u201d General Arslan eyed me speculatively. \u201cThe Vralians tell a tale about one of your kind, you know. He was either cursed or sainted. I am not certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d I murmured.</p> <p>\u201cCan you take on the form of a bear?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI think not.\u201d He pushed his chair decisively away from the table. \u201cI think that although there may be a kernel of truth to these tales, you are weaker than you pretend. And I will ask you one last time, Moirin mac Fainche. Will you go from this place and leave my son in peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The general inclined his head. \u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p>I rose to my feet, leaving my tea untouched on the table. \u201cIs that all? Are we enemies, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He drained his bowl of tea noisily, then shoved it away as though it had offended him, his face stony. \u201cBut we are not friends, either.\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Bao, your father is a bit..... scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed, not sounding particularly displeased by it. \u201cI think so, too.\u201d</p><p>I shivered. \u201cHe wants you to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d As we walked through the campsite together, Bao and I behaved in a circumspect manner, making sure to keep several feet of space between us. It didn\u2019t matter. He was near enough that our diadh-anams whispered together. It felt at once odd and familiar. \u201cBut I am going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is the problem.\u201d He paused to watch a pair of wrestlers engaging in a practice bout. I\u2019d been wrong, the formal games had not yet begun. \u201cThe Great Khan has informed me that he has no intention of allowing me to leave his daughter. But if I won one of the contests, I would earn the right to ask him for a boon. He would not like it, but he would be honor-bound to grant it.\u201d</p><p>I felt relieved, remembering the ease with which he had dispatched his opponents the other day. \u201cWell, then! Fighting is what you do best, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFighting, yes.\u201d Bao looked somber. \u201cBut there is no fighting that suits my skill in the contests. Only traditional Tatar sports. Horse-racing, archery, and wrestling.\u201d He pointed at the two men grunting and straining for purchase as they grappled with one another. \u201cThey have been doing this all their lives. I do not think I can beat the best of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cArmed with my staff, I would gladly take on any man here with any weapon he chose. Unarmed, I am very good in a brawl. But I\u2019m not a wrestler, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I believed him. Gods knew, Bao wasn\u2019t given to false modesty. He wasn\u2019t given to idle boasting, either. If he said he could do a thing, he could. If he said he could not, it must be true. I swallowed my disappointment.</p><p>Horse-racing was out\u2014and archery, too. I\u2019d seen Bao ride, and while he was skilled enough, I was a better rider. If I couldn\u2019t win against the young men of Batu\u2019s tribe, there was no way Bao could win against the best here. And he had become a stick-fighter because peasants were forbidden edged weapons in Ch\u2019in. He had no skill with a bow.</p><p>I did, though.</p><p>I contemplated that fact in silence for a moment. It was a daring enough notion that it made me sweat with anxiety at the mere thought of it. \u201cBao..... in the archery contest, do they shoot on foot or from horseback?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are three contests. Two for the short bow\u2014one on foot and one on horseback at a full gallop. One for the long bow on foot. But, Moirin, I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d He paused, gazing at me with a speculative gleam in his eye. \u201cYou are. Do you think you could outshoot a Tatar?\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips, finding them dry. \u201cNot on horseback, no. But on foot I held my own against Batu\u2019s folk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgainst men?\u201d Bao asked. \u201cBecause there are no contests only for women.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at him. \u201cAye, against men!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace, Moirin. For you, I am willing to swallow my pride. I only wanted to be certain.\u201d He flashed a grin at me. \u201cI know you are a very good archer. Do you remember in Shuntian when that fellow interfered in my fight with Ten Tigers Dai, and you shot the hat clean off his head? Even a Tatar would think twice at taking that risk.\u201d</p><p>It made me smile. \u201cWell, I was angry\u2014and it was at close range. I don\u2019t know if I could beat the best here, Bao. Probably not. Do you think they would even let me try?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his chin. \u201cMaybe. I do not think there is any rule forbidding a woman to compete against the men, it is only that women are not strong enough to draw a bow hard enough to shoot as far as a man.\u201d He glanced sidelong at me. \u201cIf you won, they would say it was magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike as not,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Bao\u2019s gaze was candid. \u201cWould it be?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say no, then paused, frowning. \u201cTruly? I don\u2019t know, Bao. I\u2019ve been shooting for the pot since I was a child in Alba. My skill is fairly earned.\u201d</p><p>He followed my thoughts. \u201cWhat about your bow? Is it charmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cMy uncle Mabon made it for me. My mother said he had a gift for working with wood.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she meant an ordinary knack, or a gift of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother wasn\u2019t very talkative, was she?\u201d Bao observed.</p><p>It was true, and I laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He gave a dismissive wave. \u201cThey will claim it, but they cannot prove it. I have seen your bow, and there is nothing remarkable-looking about it, nothing to suggest it is charmed in any way. Actually, it looks quite primitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonetheless, it is a very fine bow,\u201d I said with a touch of indignation.</p><p>\u201cSo it is.\u201d Bao\u2019s expression turned grave. \u201cMoirin, this might be our best course. If you fail, the worst that will happen is that your opponents will gloat. And I think they might permit it in the hope of that outcome. Are you at least willing to try?\u201d</p><p>I eyed him. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not a wrestler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d he said with regret. \u201cGiven a few more months\u2019 time, I might become one. I\u2019m good at learning such skills. Now?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAs little as I like to admit it, I stand no chance of winning.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cThen I will try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>We walked together in silence for a time, keeping our careful distance from each other. Folk in the camp steered away to give us a wide berth, no one willing to start trouble so long as we were discreet. Giving the lie to appearances, our diadh-anams twined with one another, flickering and teasing, rising and falling joyfully in a private celebration. It was a sensation in some ways more intimate than a touch, both pleasurable and unnerving.</p><p>\u201cStrange as it is, I am learning to live with it,\u201d Bao said presently. \u201cNow that you are here, it is not entirely unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>I did not need to ask what he meant. \u201cYes, I know. Bao.....\u201d I halted. \u201cI would like to speak with her.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot upward. \u201cErdene?\u201d</p><p>I squared my shoulders. \u201cYes. I would like to apologize to her. I owe her that much, at least.\u201d</p><p>His expression turned dubious. \u201cMoirin, I think it is very wonderful that you always wish to do what you think is right and honorable. But it is not always what people want. Erdene is angry, very angry. Believe me, I have tried to apologize to her many times already. She is not ready to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap she is ready to hear mine,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d he said doubtfully.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t, at least not at first.</p><p>I called on the Great Khan\u2019s daughter later in the day, taking Oyun and one of the other young tribesmen as an escort. Erdene made me wait a long time outside her ger before deciding to honor the laws of hospitality and allow me to be admitted. She did not go so far as to offer me the traditional bowl of tea, for which I was just as glad. By the look on her face, it would have likely been poisoned.</p><p>It felt strange being in the dwelling she shared with Bao. Although I hadn\u2019t known it at the time, the ger to which he had led me that first day belonged to another family who had vacated it willingly at the request of the Great Khan\u2019s son-in-law. It embarrassed me to think on it.</p><p>Here, I saw signs of Bao\u2019s presence. There was a string of dried snowdrop bulbs hanging from the framework, their number diminished since I last saw them. The square of embroidered black and white magpies I had given to him was unfolded in a deliberate display on a bed.</p><p>That, I thought, was Erdene\u2019s doing. Bao would not have flaunted it. She wanted to remind me they shared a bed.</p><p>Having granted me admission, Erdene sat stiffly on a chair, several attendants around her. She did not invite me to sit.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, your highness,\u201d I said politely. \u201cDo your cattle prosper?\u201d</p><p>A flicker of irritation crossed her face. \u201cWhat do you want, witch?\u201d</p><p>So much for pleasantries. \u201cI come to offer an apology,\u201d I said in a steady tone. \u201cMy actions have caused you pain. I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>Erdene\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cThen undo it! Undo your magic and give me back my husband!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot undo it,\u201d I said softly. \u201cAnd Bao is not mine to give. His choices are his own to make.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth hardened. \u201cYou lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cMy father once told me that the gods use their chosen hard. I believe it is true. I believe it is also true that the gods are careless of those whose fates are crossed by their chosen.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, Erdene rose from the chair and launched herself at me, plucking a dagger from her sash. It was so quick and unexpected, it took me utterly by surprise. She planted the tip of her dagger against my throat, grabbing my hair with her other hand. \u201cI do not want to hear you speak! One more word, and I will cut out your tongue!\u201d</p><p>I forced myself to breathe slowly and calmly\u2014the Breath of Ocean\u2019s Rolling Waves, the most soothing of all the Five Styles. The Great Khan\u2019s daughter was a head shorter than me, but there was a great deal of strength in her small, sturdy figure.</p><p>Her grip on my hair tightened, the point of the dagger digging into my skin. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d she asked fiercely, her voice trembling. \u201cDo you, o chosen one?\u201d</p><p>I gazed at her without speaking. There were angry tears in her wide-set eyes. Gods, she was young! No more than sixteen.</p><p>Erdene pressed the dagger harder and I felt a warning pin-prick of pain as the tip pierced my skin. \u201cDo you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, your highness,\u201d I said quietly, ignoring the trickle of blood at my throat and speaking to the hurt and anger within her. \u201cBetter than you know. I am a woman, too. I once loved a man who could not give his heart to me. I persisted in loving him well beyond folly. Bao has been cruel to you in his thoughtlessness, but I do not think he meant to be. This man used me badly on purpose, and I let him.\u201d</p><p>The pressure eased.</p><p>\u201cI understand the pain, the sense of shame, the anger at the unfairness of it all,\u201d I continued. \u201cBut it is not your fault. There is no shame in loving, no shame in honest desire. You did nothing wrong. It is only that the gods have decreed otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>The Great Khan\u2019s daughter blinked rapidly, her throat working. \u201cIt hurts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered, my heart aching for her. \u201cI know it all too well, which is why I am so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>She released me abruptly, turning to hurl her dagger across the ger. Her attendants flinched.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d Erdene kept her back turned to me, her shoulders hunched and tight. \u201cI have heard your apology. I do not wish to hear more.\u201d</p><p>I bowed, and went.</p> <p>FIFTEEN</p><p>The archery contest was set to take place three days later, and I was to be allowed to compete in it.</p><p>All in all, spirits were running high in the campsite. There were exceptions, of course. The Great Khan\u2019s daughter was miserable; the Great Khan himself was disgruntled. His loyal general Arslan was unhappy. I was torn between guilt and hope; and I knew Bao felt much the same.</p><p>Everyone else was excited.</p><p>It was almost all Tatars, now. Whatever negotiations took place among the northern Bhodistani and the Vralians had been concluded. Most of them had departed, only a few lingering out of a mild curiosity, I supposed. No one but the Tatars truly cared about the contests.</p><p>And they cared very much. They were eager to see me humiliated, or at least most of them were.</p> <p>When I thought about it, I felt sick and scared inside. I was no warrior, raised to take pride in my prowess with a bow. I was just..... me. I had only learned to shoot to help provide for my mother and myself. It was a way of life, nothing more.</p><p>\u201cThat is the best reason of all, Moirin,\u201d Batu said firmly to me. \u201cSurvival. Do not worry. Whatever happens, you will not embarrass yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His kind eyes crinkled. \u201cI am aware of the games that were played in the deep of winter. It has always galled the young men of my tribe that they cannot defeat you in this sport. Do you think that we are so unskilled that we cannot hold our own with the best of the Great Khan\u2019s men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cBatu, with your kindness and generosity, I am quite sure you are the best of the Great Khan\u2019s men.\u201d</p><p>He blushed and averted his head, which I found utterly charming. I would have kissed his cheek, except I knew it would scandalize him. \u201cI have asked everyone to cull their arrows to choose those with the straightest shafts and the finest fletching. We will do our best to make sure you have arrows that fly true.\u201d</p><p>I was touched. \u201cI will try not to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could never disappoint me, Moirin,\u201d Batu said in a gentle voice. \u201cI wish you well.\u201d</p> <p>I spent many hours practicing away from the campsite, honing my skill. Alone, I was better able to concentrate, and I found that the discipline that Master Lo had taught me served me well.</p><p>On the day before the archery contest, Bao rode out to meet me. Although it was hard to be apart, we had continued to be circumspect. There had been little contact between us since it had been decreed that I would be allowed to compete. My heart and my diadh-anam leapt inside me at his approach, and I knew he felt the same.</p><p>We found ourselves smiling foolishly at each other, both of us self-consciously aware of it, yet unable to help ourselves.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Bao echoed, dismounting. \u201cIt is almost upon us. I will be glad when this is over, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>My anxiety returned ten-fold. \u201cSo will I, but, Bao, please don\u2019t count on me to win! Truly, I think the odds are very much against it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d he observed. \u201cAlmost no one is wagering on you. And yes, I know it is unlikely. It is only that it is our best chance of seeing the matter resolved peaceably.\u201d</p><p>I was relieved that he wasn\u2019t putting unreasonable expectations on me. \u201cWhat happens if I do lose? Other than the gloating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bao admitted. \u201cErdene tells me that her father has promised to hunt me down like a dog and slit my throat if I leave without his permission.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t do much to alleviate my anxiety. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least she is speaking to me, which is an improvement. Whatever you said to her, it helped.\u201d He gave me a curious glance. \u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I understood how she felt,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI told her I had once loved a man who could not give his heart to me.\u201d</p><p>Bao\u2019s eyes widened with indignation. \u201cYou compared me to that stupid ass Lord Lion Mane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I did.\u201d I raised my brows at him. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t intend to hurt Erdene. Nonetheless, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know!\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd I am sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I steered the conversation back to more pressing matters. \u201cBao, I\u2019m serious. If I lose, what will we do?\u201d</p><p>He smiled ruefully. \u201cIf the Great Khan\u2019s threat is sincere, I think there is only one way we can evade his pursuit. We can\u2019t outrace a Tatar hunting party. Have you seen them ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d I nodded. \u201cYou mean for me to call the twilight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bao\u2019s smile faded. \u201cAnd I know you are concerned about your ability to shield both of us within it long enough. I am, too. I remember how difficult it was for you with the princess when we climbed toward White Jade Mountain. Believe me, I do not like to ask. It is a piece of irony, Moirin. Before..... before I died, when I had decided I would offer to leave Master Lo\u2019s service, it was because I meant to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d His eyes softened. \u201cAlso because of your noble instincts and generous heart, and yes, your beauty, and the way you revel in pleasure, and many other things large and small. But you\u2019re impulsive, too, and all these things combined make you a danger to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not impulsive,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI have an inconvenient destiny, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are impulsive,\u201d Bao repeated, ignoring my disclaimer. \u201cAnyway..... it is a piece of irony that I can do nothing to protect you here, but must rely on your skills and gifts to save us both from a dangerous situation I created.\u201d He looked unhappy. \u201cI am not making a very good start as a heroic protector like the ones in your tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d I said to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I blew out my breath. \u201cJust do it!\u201d</p><p>He obeyed, and I summoned the twilight, folding it around us both. Bao opened his eyes to a world gone silvery, dim, and lovely.</p><p>I touched his face. \u201cI do not recall asking for a protector, my stubborn magpie. And before you take the entire blame for our troubles, I will remind you that I created the problem by coming after you.\u201d</p><p>Bao smiled. \u201cImpulsively, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine.\u201d I slid my hand around to the back of his neck, tugging his head down so I could kiss him.</p><p>Naamah\u2019s gift sang within me as he kissed me back, one arm around my waist. His other hand pressed against my back, claiming me firmly.</p><p>We made love on the twilit steppe, and it was gentle and magical.</p><p>Never before had I been able to surrender to pleasure without losing my grasp on the twilight. It was different with Bao. He carried the missing half of my divided soul within him, and I could hold us both in the twilight as easily as I could myself\u2014as easily and naturally as breathing.</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d He whispered my name against my throat, his hand parting my thighs. \u201cIt is so beautiful here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered in reply, my back arching as his fingers teased my slick cleft.</p><p>Bao lifted his head, his gaze intent on mine. \u201cIs it like this beyond the stone doorway?\u201d</p><p>Ripples of pleasure ran through me. \u201cEven more so.\u201d I gazed back at him, seeing the flickering penumbra of his aura. \u201cIt is everything bright and dark all at once, everything in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d He moved over me.</p><p>I spread my thighs wider to welcome him, feeling the bonfire of the spirit as our diadh-anams joined in full. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>All through our lovemaking and beyond, I held on to the twilight, not losing it even in the throes of climax\u2014not mine nor his. In the aftermath of love, I lay with my head on Bao\u2019s chest, listening to his steady heartbeat and watching the silvery grasses move slowly in the breeze. Everything seemed to move more slowly in the twilight.</p><p>Time passed differently in the spirit world, I remembered. When I had gone through the stone doorway, days had passed without my knowledge.</p><p>Bao\u2019s warm breath stirred my hair, and his arms were warm around me, strong with corded muscle.</p><p>It felt good.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want it to end.</p><p>\u201cMoirin,\u201d he said at last, his voice reluctant. \u201cWe should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I forced myself to sit upright. After we donned our clothing, I took one last, deep breath of the twilight, and then let it out, releasing the magic.</p><p>The world returned in a rush. It was late\u2014later than I had reckoned. The setting sun hovered over the horizon like a great orange orb, staining the grasslands with ruddy light, throwing our long, stark shadows before us.</p><p>For the first time in days, I felt calm.</p><p>\u201cI can do this,\u201d I said to Bao. \u201cIf I fail on the morrow, we can escape into the twilight. I can hold it long enough.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face in his hands and kissed me. \u201cYes, you can.\u201d</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>Pull!\u201d</p><p>I eased the bowstring back\u2014gently, gently. The sturdy yew-wood bow my uncle Mabon had made for me bent obligingly. The fletching of the arrow I had nocked tickled my earlobe\u2014vulture feathers, from one of the arrows borrowed from the members of Batu\u2019s tribe.</p><p>I eyed the distant target, gauging my angle. I did my best to ignore the fact that my heart was hammering inside my chest.</p><p>\u201cLoose!\u201d</p><p>I loosed the bowstring.</p><p>A puff of errant wind blew as my arrow arced into the sky\u2014mine, and six others. Against all odds, I had shot well enough to reach the penultimate round.</p><p>Now, I sucked in my breath.</p><p>Six arrows thudded into six leather targets stuffed with wool. I winced, seeing I had missed the crudely painted red circle on mine. I had misjudged the wind and the angle.</p><p>Two had pierced the circle, one dead-center, the other slightly off. Three others had missed by a wider margin than I had.</p><p>The watching crowd of Tatars murmured. The judges conferred.</p><p>\u201cYou, and you.\u201d An officious fellow serving as the judges\u2019 liaison pointed at the two men who had shot best. When he came to me, his mouth tightened. \u201cAnd you. Now, you will shoot one by one. Ten paces!\u201d</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Ah, gods! If it hadn\u2019t been for the sense of calm I\u2019d found yesterday, I was quite sure my nerves would have undone me. The riding archery contest had taken place earlier. I\u2019d watched the competitors shoot from the saddle at a row of dangling rings while they raced at a flat-out gallop. They were incredibly accurate, and I resigned myself to the fact that there was no way I could truly compete against the best of the best here.</p><p>But so long as I had the knowledge that Bao and I could escape into the twilight, that I could hold it long enough to keep us both safe, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>As a result, I had shot fearlessly and well in the early rounds of the standing archery contest. Over a hundred men took part, shooting in groups of a dozen at a time. For each group to partake, half passed on to the next round and half were eliminated. With each successive round, we retreated ten paces from the targets.</p><p>Again and again, I found myself placing within the top half of my group. It wasn\u2019t until the number of competitors had dwindled to a mere dozen that I\u2019d begun to wonder if I could win, and my anxiety returned in full force.</p><p>That was also when my opponents began to grumble and mutter about magic, and the officious liaison had come to inspect my bow.</p><p>Was it charmed? I truly had no idea. Mayhap my uncle Mabon had whispered some arcane charm into the very wood and sinew. I did not know the extent of the small gifts of magic the Maghuin Dhonn possessed. Mayhap there was some secret in the way he had seasoned the wood. Mayhap the secret lay in the powerful resilience of the wood itself, or the sinews or the glue.</p><p>Whatever the truth, Bao was right. It didn\u2019t look remarkable and there was nothing for the official to find. After testing my bow for himself and finding that it shot no more true than the archer\u2019s skill, he shrugged and handed it back to me.</p><p>Now.....</p><p>Now there were only three of us, and I had begun to sweat. Oh aye, if I lost, there was still the twilight. But now that victory was actually within reach, I could not help but think how much better it would be if the Great Khan were forced to grant my boon, and let Bao and me go freely.</p><p>The steppe was a vast expanse of open land to traverse. I had no doubt that there were skilled trackers among the Khan\u2019s men. Even having discovered that I could ward Bao as easily as myself, it could be a long, long time to hold the twilight. And there would be no room for error. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first of my remaining two opponents stepped up to the mark. He nocked an arrow and drew with the unique Tatar grip, using a ring on his thumb to pull the bowstring, the muscles of his heavy shoulders bunching. He was a strong, burly fellow, and if the contest were to be decided on distance alone, I had no doubt that he would prevail.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t, though. Accuracy counted.</p><p>With a grunt, he loosed the bowstring. His arrow sank into the distant target, landing on the outer rim of the red circle. His supporters cheered and shouted.</p> <p>It was the second fellow who worried me the most. He was lean and taciturn, and he shot with great accuracy and ferocious concentration. It was he whose last shot had been dead-center. He took his place at the mark, drawing his bow with fluid precision.</p><p>Another gust of wind blew as he loosed his arrow, more lively than the first. Even so, his arrow pierced very close to the center of the target. My last opponent gave a little sigh, and an unexpected, courteous bow in my direction.</p><p>Holding my bow loosely, I toed the mark. The onlookers had grown quiet. I didn\u2019t dare look at them, not even my few supporters, fearful of losing my own concentration.</p><p>I had missed the circle on my last shot. This one could mean the difference between safe passage, no matter how reluctantly granted, and deadly pursuit.</p><p>I chose the straightest shaft in my quiver, the one I had left for the end, nocking it carefully. Gently, gently, I hooked my forefingers around the bowstring and drew it back beyond my ear.</p> <p>My heart thudded in my chest, and my extended left arm trembled, my knuckles pale where I clutched my bow\u2019s grip. Beneath the thick Tatar coat I wore, trickles of nervous sweat trailed down my skin. A fitful breeze rose and fell, tugging at my hair.</p><p>I fixed my gaze on the distant target. Gods, it looked far away and small!</p><p>There were no official commands to be given in this final round. A handful of spectators took it on themselves to remedy the situation.</p><p>\u201cLoose!\u201d someone shouted; and scores of other voices took up the chant, seeking to unnerve me. \u201cLoose, loose, loose!\u201d</p><p>I ignored them.</p><p>I breathed the Breath of Wind\u2019s Sigh, drawing it up behind my eyes, remembering all that Master Lo Feng had taught me. I meditated on the calm I had found in the twilight. I willed my body to be still and quiet. I willed the world to be still and quiet.</p> <p>The fitful wind died, and I loosed the bowstring.</p><p>My arrow arced into the blue, blue sky. Too high, I thought for the space of a heartbeat, my chest constricting. Once again, I had misjudged the angle.</p><p>And then my arrow completed its arc with consummate grace, falling to pierce the very heart of the red circle on my target.</p><p>I stood staring in disbelief.</p><p>The Tatar beside me, the taciturn fellow I\u2019d reckoned my worst competition, clapped me on the shoulder. \u201cWell shot, lady.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cI didn\u2019t..... the wind. I was lucky.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThere is always luck. The gods favored you today, and you deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>The others were not so gracious. There were jeers and boos, and cries of sorcery. But it was done. The judges confirmed it and the official announced their decision. For the first time since I\u2019d reached the final dozen, I dared to glance in the Great Khan\u2019s direction.</p><p>Although the Great Khan Naram was a short, stocky fellow with bowed legs, he had a commanding presence nonetheless. His broad face was impassive, but his body language radiated disapproval, his bowed legs planted, his arms folded over his chest as he stood amongst his wives and children, watching the contest. Even as I wondered if I should approach him, he beckoned to one of his warriors and spoke to the man.</p><p>The warrior nodded and trotted over to me. \u201cThe Great Khan wishes to confer with his shamans,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will send for you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Given no choice in the matter, I bowed. \u201cI await his summons.\u201d</p><p>The Great Khan clapped his hands, turning to depart. Bao left his entourage and came over to congratulate me. He halted some feet away from me, and I felt the familiar-strange sensation of intimacy as our diadh-anams intertwined. Although Bao was taking care not to gloat, his eyes shone with pride.</p><p>\u201cGods, that was well done, Moirin,\u201d he said in a low, fierce voice.</p><p>The victory didn\u2019t feel as sweet as I would have reckoned. \u201cWhy does the Khan want to confer with his shamans?\u201d</p><p>Bao shrugged. \u201cHe knows what boon you will ask. I suppose he wants to talk to them about releasing me from my marriage vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cYou should go celebrate with your tribe.\u201d He nodded toward Batu and the others. \u201cThey are nearly bursting with pride.\u201d He gave me a smile filled with rare, genuine tenderness. \u201cI feel the same way, but I will wait until the Great Khan\u2019s boon is granted to show it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at him. \u201cTomorrow, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Due to the amount of resentment in the camp, our celebration was muted, but it was heartfelt nonetheless. Many, many bowls of airag were consumed, the frothy, fermented mare\u2019s milk all Tatars loved.</p><p>In the late hours of the night, Batu gave me a drunken, fatherly embrace. \u201cIf all goes well tomorrow, I hope you will be happy with your young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Batu.\u201d This time, I did plant a kiss on his cheek. \u201cYou have stood as a father to me, and I will always be grateful for it.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long time since I\u2019d drunk spirits of any kind; and too, I\u2019d been too nervous to eat much that day. Although I did my best to keep up with my adopted Tatar tribe, the celebration was still under way when I gave up and staggered to my pallet, my head swimming with airag.</p><p>I felt dizzy, drunk, and more than a little nauseated; but I felt good, too. The warmth of the tribe\u2019s response had let me savor my victory. As soon as the walls of the ger ceased the semblance of spinning around me, I fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p><p>It seemed as though only a few hours had passed when one of the tribeswomen shook me awake\u2014Solongo, her name was. I propped myself up on one elbow and squinted at her through the haze filling my head.</p><p>\u201cThe Great Khan Naram sends for you, Moirin,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe wishes to see you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The inside of my mouth felt foul. I licked my dry lips and swallowed against a sudden surge of nausea.</p><p>Solongo shook her head. \u201cYou may shoot like a man, but you cannot hold your drink like one,\u201d she said, not unkindly. \u201cI will bring you tea.\u201d</p><p>The hot, rich tea helped. I drank it down in gulps, willing it to settle my stomach. The ger was filled with snoring, slumbering men sleeping off the aftereffects of too much airag. Not wanting to disturb anyone, I washed my face in a bucket of clean water and went to answer the Great Khan\u2019s summons.</p><p>He had sent an escort of ten warriors. They greeted me with nods of acknowledgment, and we set off through the campsite. It was early. The sun had not yet cleared the horizon. In the east, faint streaks of gold lit the sky, but it was still dark in the west. The Khan\u2019s men set a brisk pace, and I stumbled as I tried to keep up with them. I felt disheveled, disoriented, and out of sorts, and irritated at the Great Khan for exacting such a petty revenge.</p><p>Inside a spacious ger with a splendidly painted door, the Great Khan Naram was waiting for me, flanked by a pair of somber, bearded Vralian men with gold chains around their necks, heavy medallions dangling.</p><p>I blinked, perplexed. The Khan\u2019s men crowded into the room behind me.</p><p>\u201cMoirin mac Fainche.\u201d Like General Arslan before him, the Khan pronounced my name with care. There was no expression I could read on his face. \u201cThese fine men from Vralia wish to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Both of them inclined their heads.</p><p>I supposed they were among those few who had stayed out of idle curiosity. I couldn\u2019t imagine why they cared about the outcome of a Tatar archery contest, or why they wanted to meet me, but I inclined my head in polite reply. When one of them stepped forward and extended his hand toward mine, I gave it to him.</p><p>Instantaneously, his fingers tightened around mine in a crushing grip. His other hand came from behind his back, trailing a rattling chain. Before I could react, he had clamped a cuff of silver metal around my wrist.</p><p>I pulled back sharply, drawing breath to shout.</p><p>A hard hand covered my mouth from behind\u2014one of the Khan\u2019s men. He twisted my head, wrenching it backward and sideways until my neck bones strained in agony.</p><p>Terror flooded through me.</p><p>Now the Great Khan\u2019s face came alive with righteous fury. \u201cStruggle, and he will snap your neck,\u201d he hissed at me. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d Behind the warrior\u2019s hand, I made a faint, terrified sound of assent. \u201cGood.\u201d He gestured at the Vralians to continue.</p><p>One of them produced a key, locking the silver cuff in place around my right wrist. I felt the beginning sensation of my spirit being suffocated, the way I still felt sometimes in man-made places. Panicked, I breathed hard through my nose.</p><p>Chains jangled. A second cuff was clamped on my left wrist, and then a larger circlet around my neck. The Tatar holding my head wrenched sideways moved considerately to make room for the Vralians, who worked gravely and dispassionately.</p><p>With each shackle, the sense of suffocation intensified\u2014and my awareness of Bao\u2019s diadh-anam faded.</p><p>And then the Vralians yanked off my thick, felt-lined boots and placed shackles and a chain on my bare ankles, and the process was complete.</p><p>My spirit was bound.</p><p>My diadh-anam was a frantic blaze inside me, beating at the walls of my chest like a caged hawk. I could no longer feel Bao\u2019s presence in the camp. I could no longer sense the faint call of destiny in the west. I couldn\u2019t even sense all the familiar things I took for granted, like the whisper of grass growing.</p><p>Seeing the horror written on my face, the Great Khan smiled slowly. \u201cThe witch is contained, I think. Now you will listen.\u201d He raised one finger. \u201cI will tell my man to release you. If you hold your tongue, I will honor my agreement with the Vralians. You will go with them, alive. If you cry out for help.....\u201d He plucked a dagger from his belt. \u201cI will simply kill you here and now. Will you be silent?\u201d</p><p>I nodded as best I could.</p><p>The Khan gestured to the man holding me. He let go of my head. I fell to my knees in a rattling tangle of chains, breathing hard, my neck aching.</p><p>\u201cYou cheated yesterday.\u201d The Great Khan stooped to grab a handful of my hair, yanking my head upright. \u201cMy shamans agree. You used witchcraft to still the wind.\u201d</p><p>I gave my head a faint shake of denial.</p><p>\u201cDo not lie!\u201d Clutching a hank of my hair, he gave my head a fierce shake. My scalp burned, bringing tears to my eyes. He narrowed his gaze at me. \u201cI will not allow you to make a mockery of me, to bring shame and dishonor upon my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.....\u201d I whispered.</p><p>The Khan struck me across the face\u2014hard enough to sting, no harder. It was only a warning. \u201cYou will be silent.\u201d He released his grip on my hair, setting his hands on his belt and contemplating me. \u201cClearly, you possess magic. I think Arslan is right, and you are not so powerful as you pretend. Still, your tongue is a dangerous weapon. As much as he resents you, you charmed him to the point where he would not counsel violence against you.\u201d He raised his brows. \u201cBatu\u2019s tribe is bewitched. Even my own daughter softened toward you. Should a daughter of mine accept her own humiliation?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNever. I regret that she did not cut out your cursed tongue, but listened to it instead.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard.</p><p>He leaned over me. \u201cWhat did you say to her? That it was not her fault, that she had done nothing wrong?\u201d With a cruel smile, he quoted my words. \u201cIt is only that the gods have decreed otherwise. Perhaps you may take comfort in those words as you find your fate is not as you had imagined.\u201d Straightening, he nodded toward the Vralians. \u201cIt seems their gods have decreed otherwise.\u201d</p><p>My heart was hammering in my chest, competing with my frantic diadh-anam. And yet I had to speak, even if the Great Khan struck me again. \u201cBao,\u201d I whispered, flinching in anticipation. \u201cHe will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Magnanimous in victory, the Khan withheld the blow I deserved. \u201cI daresay he will when he wakes. Like you, he was plied with strong drink last night. If the magic of Vralia\u2019s gods is as strong as they claim, my son-in-law will be free of the ties that bind you to him. Perhaps he will choose to stay after all.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIf not, for the sake of my soft-hearted daughter and my good general Arslan, I will show him mercy.\u201d</p><p>It gave me a glimmer of hope.</p><p>The Khan Naram saw it, and crushed it with pleasure. \u201cIn time, I will relent and tell him what befell you. I have a fine tale prepared.\u201d Another cruel smile curved his lips. \u201cOne that will send him far, far away from where you are going.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes in despair.</p><p>The Great Khan gave an order.</p><p>Someone struck me hard from behind. Pain burst across my skull, and stars of spangled light burst behind my eyelids, flickering and fading.</p><p>I fell into darkness.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>I awoke in a covered cart, jolting over the plains.</p><p>At first I thought it was a bad dream, a nightmare brought on by strained nerves and too much airag, a jumbled mess of old fables and dire magic spun by my sleeping mind. But when I stirred, chains rattled.</p><p>Bound.</p><p>I was bound, well and truly bound. I remembered the shackles being clamped on to me and locked into place, the Vralians\u2019 grave, dispassionate faces. My head ached ferociously. My diadh-anam was a faint, defeated spark inside me. I couldn\u2019t sense Bao\u2019s presence anywhere. I couldn\u2019t feel a thing beyond the confines of my skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My stomach lurched, and I swallowed bile. Gods, I needed air! Frantic as a trapped animal, I scrambled blindly toward the rear of the cart, dragging my chains, bumping into obstacles I couldn\u2019t make out in the dim light.</p><p>It was a tarpaulin of oiled canvas that covered the cart, secured in place by ropes. It gapped at the far end, glimpses of the brightening blue sky visible between the rope lashings.</p><p>Rope could be cut. Ignoring my chains, I groped at the sash around my waist for the dagger that Snow Tiger had given me, with its ivory hilt carved in the shape of a dragon\u2019s coils.</p> <p>It was gone.</p><p>Wheels creaking, the cart ground to a halt. Deprived of any sense beyond the ordinary mortal ones, I lay still and took quick, shallow breaths, listening to the faint sound of approaching boot steps. Unseen fingers fumbled with unseen knots. I willed myself to be calm, and sought to summon the twilight.</p><p>It was gone, too\u2014or at least, it was beyond my reach. With my magic constrained by these bedamned chains, I could no more take a half-step into the spirit world than I could fly to the moon.</p><p>The canvas was folded back to reveal a bearded Vralian face peering at me. Filled with an unreasoning mix of panic and fury, I tried to hurl myself at him. Weighted down by shackles and chains, I merely fell over the tailgate of the wagon, the impact driving the air from my lungs.</p><p>\u201cNo good!\u201d Retreating out of reach, the Vralian wagged a stern finger at me, speaking a limited version of the Tatar language. \u201cWe save you.\u201d</p> <p>I heaved myself and my chains backward, huddling in the rear of the wagon, wrapping my arms around me until I caught my breath. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The second Vralian, who looked to be a few years younger than the first, came to confer with him, speaking in an unfamiliar tongue. The first raised his medallion to his lips and kissed it. \u201cGod wills it,\u201d he said in a reverent tone.</p><p>\u201cThen I am grateful to your god,\u201d I said slowly and carefully, unfolding one arm and extending it. \u201cIf you will take off these chains, I will go with thanks.\u201d</p><p>Free of the chains, I could summon the twilight and pass through the campsite like a phantom, taking Bao with me.</p><p>The Vralian smiled gently and shook his head at me, as though I were a child who\u2019d said somewhat foolish. \u201cWe save you from you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, and then raised my voice. \u201cWell, then, I bedamned well don\u2019t want to be saved!\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cGod wills it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d</p><p>He made a hushing sound, pointing backward toward the Tatar campsite. \u201cNot far yet. No trouble, or the young man.....\u201d He made a slashing gesture across his throat. \u201cKhan say he kill.\u201d</p><p>Bao.</p><p>I weighed my choices. My head ached too much to think straight. If Bao was awake, he would know something had happened to me, for as surely as the chains kept me from sensing his diadh-anam, they would prevent him from sensing mine. Whatever their purpose, the Vralians didn\u2019t seem intent on harming me. They said we had not gone far yet, so I couldn\u2019t have been unconscious for long. If I screamed and shouted at the top of my lungs, it might be that Bao would hear me.</p><p>And what then?</p><p>I didn\u2019t doubt that the Great Khan would sooner kill Bao than allow him to rescue me. Skilled as he was, Bao couldn\u2019t take on all the Khan\u2019s men; and he surely couldn\u2019t outride them. It would be best to be patient. There was a key to these chains. All I needed was a chance to steal it, and a minute or two to undo my shackles.</p><p>I raised my hands in surrender, chains dangling from my wrists. \u201cNo trouble.\u201d</p> <p>The Vralian nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d He pointed at the floor of the cart. \u201cToday, hide.\u201d</p><p>Forcing myself to be compliant, I lay down. They pulled the tarpaulin back in place, lashing it securely.</p><p>Hours passed, long, stifling hours filled with fear, nausea, and tedium. Every hour took me farther away from Bao, farther away from freedom, farther away from the hope that my destiny was calling me home.</p><p>What in the name of all the gods did the Vralians want with me?</p><p>Never in my life had I felt more alone, miserable, and helpless. At least in the face of the storm that had nearly killed me, I\u2019d been too busy trying to survive to even know what I was feeling.</p><p>Although I tried not to, I wept.</p><p>My only comfort was the spark of my diadh-anam, alive and flickering inside me, a promise that the Maghuin Dhonn Herself had not forgotten me. I was Her child. These cursed chains could bind Her gifts, but they could not kill Her divine spark within me. In the suffocating darkness beneath the tarpaulin, I prayed to Her; and I prayed to Naamah and Anael, who were my D\u2019Angeline patron gods. Although I could not sense their presence, I prayed they had not forgotten me, either.</p><p>At last, the interminable cart-ride came to an end. The Vralians unhitched their horses, hobbled them, and turned them loose to graze, then untied the tarpaulin once more. With a strange, reluctant solicitousness, they helped me clamber out of the cart.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>In the early-evening light, I got a better look at the shackles that bound me. They were etched with sigils and inscriptions in a strange alphabet. The cuffs around my wrists were linked to the circlet around my neck by chains long enough that they didn\u2019t restrict the movement of my arms overmuch. That wasn\u2019t their purpose. The chain that linked the shackles around my ankles was another matter. It was short enough that I was forced to adopt a halting, mincing gait.</p><p>Clearly, running away was not an option.</p><p>In case the matter was in doubt, one of the Vralians\u2014the one who spoke a bit of the Tatar language\u2014produced yet another chain, looping it around the front axle of the cart, and lacing it through the chain on my left arm. Averting his gaze, he put down a pallet of furs for me, indicating that I could take shelter beneath the wagon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Deeming me safely secured, he studied me with deep-set eyes. \u201cGod wills this.\u201d</p><p>Already, I was perishing sick of his bedamned god; but I had the sense to hold my tongue. The other fellow set about erecting a tent well beyond the reach of my tether, which I was sorry to see. They had not been overtly cruel to me thus far, but what kindness they had shown me, chaining me like a dog, I misliked.</p><p>I was scared and alone, and if they had given me the opportunity to bash in their heads with a rock while they slept, I would have taken it.</p><p>They didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, they kindled a careful fire of dried dung-chips, heating a pot of water filled with strips of dried meat and root vegetables. They knelt in prayer before they ladled out servings, murmuring in sonorous tones.</p><p>The second fellow brought me a steaming bowl of stew and a spoon. Far from it though I felt, I resolved to try being pleasant.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I accepted the bowl, my chains rattling as I reached for it. I took a deep sniff, miming pleasure, then smiled at him. \u201cIt smells good.\u201d</p><p>He beat a hasty retreat, avoiding my gaze. Stone and sea, what was wrong with these men?</p><p>Whatever it was, I didn\u2019t learn the answer that night. When dusk fell over the steppe, they extinguished their fire with care, retiring to the safety of their tent. Huddled in my cocoon of furs, I watched the moon rise and spill its silvery light over the plains, thinking and thinking, my mind restless.</p><p>I wondered if I could shift the cart.</p><p>I tried. Scuttling underneath it, I found the wooden chocks that braced the front wheels and pried them loose. When I banged them softly together in my fists, it made a very satisfying sound.</p><p>Scrambling out from beneath the cart, I got to my feet and went to the end of my short tether. Throwing my weight into the effort, I tried to drag the cart toward the tent.</p><p>I failed.</p><p>There were chocks bracing the rear wheels, too, and those I could neither reach nor dislodge, no matter how hard I strained. My tether was too short, and the cart was too heavy. I could not do it.</p><p>In the end, I gave up. I was cold and tired and heartsick, and tomorrow was another day. Sooner or later, I thought, an opportunity would present itself. When it did, I would take it and flee.</p><p>Gathering my furs, I crawled beneath the cart.</p><p>There, I curled up like a dog, and slept.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>On the morrow, my situation looked as bleak as ever.</p><p>The Vralians were careful not to give me any opportunities for escape or violence\u2014not that I could have taken either easily, entangled in a clinking, rattling mass of chains as I was, unable to take a single full stride.</p><p>They gave me hard black bread and water to break my fast in the morning. When I explained to the older fellow that I needed to answer nature\u2019s call, he shook his head, not comprehending. Clearly, his limited Tatar vocabulary did not extend to encompass the mortal body\u2019s most basic requirements.</p><p>\u201cI need to piss!\u201d I said in frustrated Alban, using a vulgar slang term and knowing he wouldn\u2019t understand a word of it. I pointed at his crotch, and mimed a man holding his phallus and relieving himself. \u201cGods! Do you people lack bladders as well as hearts?\u201d</p><p>He flushed to the roots of his hair, his face darkening with embarrassment and disgust. But at least he unlocked the chain that tethered me to the wagon and pointed toward the outskirts of the camp.</p><p>I made my clanking, mincing way over the plain. Whatever else the Vralians were, they weren\u2019t voyeurs. Both of them turned their backs on me as I concluded my business. And an awkward business it was, hovering in a narrow squat, trying not to let urine splash on my bare feet, my felt trousers, or the bedamned chain between my ankles.</p><p>The sheer misery of the experience nearly brought me to tears.</p><p>I breathed slowly until the moment passed, distracting myself with thoughts of flight. It was impossible, at least for now. I could barely walk, let alone run. Still, the thought of forcing them to chase me down held a certain grim satisfaction.</p><p>But there was no point in rousing my captors\u2019 ire for the sake of a foolish whim\u2014and my body was stiff and aching from the wagon\u2019s jolting. So instead I hobbled back to rejoin them like an obedient dog.</p><p>For a mercy, they didn\u2019t force me to hide beneath the tarpaulin today, but allowed me to ride atop it, pointing out a spot where I could sit atop some covered bales of wool. As such things went, it was reasonably comfortable.</p><p>We set out once more, heading due north. The younger man drove the cart, his hands firm on the reins. The older sat beside him. Their backs were rigid and upright, and they exchanged few words. There was only the sound of the breeze and the steady clopping of the cart-horses\u2019 hooves.</p><p>I endured the silence for the better part of an hour, staring at the backs of their heads and despising them.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask why your god wills this?\u201d I asked in the Tatar tongue, forcing myself to speak politely.</p><p>The older man turned his head in my direction without actually looking at me. \u201cTo save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo save me, yes.\u201d I was as perishing sick of the phrase as I was of his god. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He held up his gold medallion, which was shaped like a square cross with flared arms, and kissed it reverently. \u201cYeshua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeshua,\u201d I repeated. It wasn\u2019t much of an answer. \u201cYeshua ben Yosef? Are you his priests? Did he tell you to save me? Am I to save him?\u201d</p><p>That the Vralian understood; he reacted in shock, drawing back as though I had struck him. His companion queried him in their own tongue. They spoke for a moment, and the first man took on a thoughtful look.</p><p>Gods, I didn\u2019t understand a thing about these men!</p><p>\u201cNo talk here,\u201d the older man said. He pointed toward the north. \u201cThere, in Vralia.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, collapsing onto my canvas-covered bales. If I didn\u2019t escape soon, it was going to be a very long, very miserable journey.</p><p>I occupied myself with studying my shackles and chains. Now that my head was no longer spinning and yesterday\u2019s vicious ache had dwindled to a tender, throbbing lump on the back of my skull, I realized I\u2019d seen the like before.</p><p>When Raphael de Mereliot and the Circle of Shalomon had summoned the spirit Focalor, a Grand Duke of the Fallen, the silversmith Balric Maitland had wrought a chain to bind him\u2014a silver chain with a silver lock, each link etched with sigils. These were much the same, and I thought the inscriptions on the shackles might have been written in the Habiru alphabet. I\u2019d seen it before in the summoning invocations the Circle studied.</p><p>Well and so, I thought. Focalor, who had appeared in the form of a tall man with immense wings like an eagle\u2019s, had broken the chain with ease.</p><p>He had also killed Claire Fourcay, another member of the Circle, and breathed her life force into me, forcing me to keep open the doorway to the spirit world that had allowed him to be summoned. And he had very nearly succeeded in pouring his own essence into Raphael, taking possession of his mortal being and wreaking untold havoc on the world.</p><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for Bao and Master Lo, Focalor would have succeeded. But the important thing now was that the fallen spirit we summoned had been able to break the chain in the first place.</p><p>I racked my brains trying to remember how he had done it, recalling at last that the spirit had accused Claire Fourcay of mispronouncing two words in the spell of binding. That was no help, since the Vralians hadn\u2019t spoken at all when they bound me. If there was a spell, like as not it was written in the inscriptions on the cuffs.</p><p>There had been another thing, though. Focalor had told the silversmith that a single drop of solder had obscured the sigil on one of the links.</p><p>That, mayhap, could be of use to me\u2014although how the spirit had known it to be true, I couldn\u2019t say. I supposed a Grand Duke of the Fallen, able to wield power over wind and sea, had magical resources well beyond the ken of one frightened, lonely bear-witch. Still, I could examine the chains for myself. I set about examining the links one by one, starting with the chain that ran from my left wrist to the collar around my neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hearing the slow, methodical rattle as I made a close study of each link, the older Vralian glanced behind him to see what I was about. I raised my brows coolly at him and kept at it. He watched me in that reluctant, sidelong fashion for a moment, then shrugged and turned back.</p><p>His lack of concern didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>There was good reason for it. The chains that bound me were impeccably wrought. Every single bedamned link was a miracle of perfection, joined without the slightest gap or chink, burnished to immaculate smoothness. I couldn\u2019t find a single drop of solder that had fallen astray. Every perfect link was etched with a tiny, perfect sigil.</p> <p>Insofar as I could tell, the chains were flawless. And to be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure what I would have done if I had found a flaw. Focalor had spread his enormous wings, and thunder had rolled. Lightning had flashed in his eyes. The chain wrapped around him had burst with a sharp crack and fallen to the floor.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t summon thunder and lightning, only the gentle twilight. I was good at the arts of pleasure and coaxing plants to grow, not commanding the sea to rise and fall.</p><p>At last, I gave up searching for a flaw that didn\u2019t exist, and that I wouldn\u2019t know how to exploit if it did. Instead, I began testing the chains\u2019 strength, gathering short lengths in my hands and hauling on them with all my might. Mayhap there was some weakness in a link not visible to the eye.</p><p>Again, the older Vralian glanced back at my strenuous efforts and the elaborate contortions that accompanied them.</p><p>I was short of breath, furious, and sweating beneath my thick Tatar coat. \u201cDo you expect me not to try?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, his expression curiously gentle. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I wore myself out with trying.</p><p>By the time we made camp that evening, I was too tired to despair. Chained to the axle once more, I ate my bowl of stringy stew-meat and stale roots, and retreated beneath the wagon to curl up in my nest of furs. The ground was harder and rockier than it had been. Shifting stones out of the way, I had another idea. Selecting an especially keen-edged shard, I fell asleep clutching it in my hand.</p><p>On the following day, I set about trying to destroy the integrity of my chains. I affected a docile appearance and hid the stone shard in my sleeve until we were under way. As soon as the cart-horses leaned into their traces and we resumed our plodding, jolting progress toward the north, I shook the shard into my palm.</p><p>Both Vralians gazed fixedly forward. I had begun to note that they had a marked reluctance to look directly at me, especially the younger one.</p><p>Fine.</p> <p>This time, I took care to make my movements small and unobtrusive. Leaning back against the covered bales of wool, I drew up my knees. I braced my left wrist against my left knee, shoving my last remaining jade bangle higher on my forearm so it wouldn\u2019t rattle against the metal and give me away. I chose a link, the third closest to the cuff around my wrist, easiest to reach.</p><p>Its perfect little sigil gleamed.</p><p>With my right hand, I drew the sharp edge of my stone shard across it, timing my action to the dull, thudding fall of the cart-horses\u2019 hooves.</p><p>It didn\u2019t even make a scratch at first. But I kept at it, patient and deliberate, timing each careful stroke to hide the faint scraping sound, scoring the metal\u2019s surface over and over until the lines of the sigil were blurred and imperfect.</p><p>It should have worked. I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t, except that it didn\u2019t. Like as not there was some rule governing its magic. The chains had been made perfectly at their inception, and I could not unmake them by inducing a flaw after the fact.</p><p>And I hadn\u2019t been as discreet as I\u2019d thought. When we halted for the evening, the older Vralian came around to the side of the wagon and put out his hand, looking like a reproving parent. \u201cGive the stone.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, fingering the edge of the shard. With sufficient force behind the effort, it was sharp enough to cut through flesh.</p><p>A trained warrior like Snow Tiger wouldn\u2019t even have hesitated. I\u2019d watched the princess snatch an arrow from an enemy\u2019s hand and plunge it into his throat in a move as swift and deadly as a snake striking.</p> <p>Of course, she hadn\u2019t been laden with chains.</p><p>A clever, cunning fighter like Bao would have found a way to use the chains to his advantage. He probably wouldn\u2019t even bother with the stone. I could imagine him vaulting over the Vralian\u2019s head, wrapping his chains around the fellow\u2019s neck in the process and throttling him on landing. By the time the second man had a chance to react, Bao would have plucked the knife from the first man\u2019s belt and armed himself.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t a trained warrior or a skilled, clever fighter any more than I was a Grand Duke of the Fallen. With the element of surprise, I might, might succeed in slashing the first man\u2019s throat. Even if I did, I could barely climb out of the cart unaided. I didn\u2019t like my chances against the second fellow.</p><p>The Vralian watched me with his deep-set gaze, holding out his hand and waiting for me to make up my mind. Obviously, the element of surprise was gone.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, I put the shard in his palm.</p><p>His expression softened. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my gaze in a penitent manner, replying in vulgar Alban and a sweet, remorseful tone. \u201cGo to hell, you miserable goat-fucking bastard.\u201d</p><p>We made camp that night within the sight of mountains. After I finished the bowl of barley gruel that they gave me for the evening meal, I sat with my back against one of the wagon-wheels and gazed at the distant range. Here and there, I could make out carpets of dark green on the slopes.</p><p>Trees.</p><p>As much as I\u2019d come to be fond of the vast, wide-open expanse of the Tatar steppe and its immense blue sky, I\u2019d never stopped missing trees. I\u2019d never imagined that my first glimpse of them would be aught but joyful. Instead, it was a reminder that I was bound and helpless, cut off from my own inner senses, and headed in the opposite direction from everything and everyone I had ever loved.</p><p>It was not a joyful moment.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>The older Vralian\u2019s name was Ilya; the younger\u2019s was Leonid.</p><p>I learned this through observation over the course of days, since neither of them deigned to tell me when I asked. It is more difficult than one might expect to pick out proper names in the midst of an utterly foreign tongue, especially among folk who speak seldom.</p><p>Beyond that, I learned nothing. By the time we had spent a week\u2019s time jolting our way through the mountain passes, I was just as puzzled and confused as I had been from the moment Ilya first clamped a cuff around my wrist. I could not for the life of me understand what it was they wanted of me.</p><p>Not pleasure, that was certain. They were as reluctant to touch me as they were to look at me or talk to me.</p><p>For that, I was grateful. If they had been intent on committing heresy on me, I would have been helpless to prevent it. But instead, it seemed quite the opposite. I had the sense that they regarded me as unclean, and not in a way that owed to my limited and unsuccessful attempts to maintain good hygiene, a difficult task rendered near impossible by virtue of being chained within my dirty clothing.</p><p>No, it was somewhat deeper and more profound.</p><p>Over and over, in a thousand different ways, I asked what it was they wanted, why they had taken me. The only answer I ever got was, \u201cGod wills it.\u201d Eventually, I gave up asking and pondered why Vralia\u2019s god wanted me.</p><p>What little I knew of Vralian faith came from Berlik\u2019s tale\u2014Berlik the Oath-Breaker, who had fled to the snowy wastes, carrying his curse far, far away from his people. In the end, the Maghuin Dhonn Herself had accepted his atonement.</p><p>I knew that Berlik had fallen in with Yeshuite pilgrims on his journey, and that he had found a place of sanctuary in a Yeshuite monastery in Vralia. No one had clapped him in chains. No, the head priest had given Berlik his blessing, allowing him to retreat into hermitage and roam freely in an immense tract of pristine wilderness owned by the monastery. When Imriel de la Courcel came seeking vengeance for the life of his wife and unborn child, the priest begged him to spare Berlik.</p><p>Of course, we only know Prince Imriel\u2019s side of the tale, but the Maghuin Dhonn have always believed he told it fairly. Tales say that Berlik bowed his head to the sword willingly, and the prince fell to his knees in the snow and wept after he took his life. A man with every right to vengeance would not lie about such a thing.</p><p>I wondered what had changed in a hundred and some years that Yeshua\u2019s priests had gone from giving succor to a great magician of the Maghuin Dhonn, one with a dire curse on his head, to dragging me away in chains for the dubious sin of having been falsely accused of cheating in an archery contest.</p><p>It was madness.</p><p>Vralia had been a country at war in Berlik\u2019s time, that I remembered. The Yeshuite faith was not born here; indeed, it had far closer ties to Terre d\u2019Ange. Mayhap I was approaching the matter from the wrong direction, and Vralia\u2019s gods were interested in me because of my D\u2019Angeline blood.</p><p>I tried to think the matter through, looking for some thread of a clue woven into the tapestry of history.</p><p>\u201cYeshua ben Yosef was the only begotten son of the One God of the Habiru folk,\u201d I said aloud in my native tongue, addressing the back of Ilya and Leonid\u2019s heads. \u201cAnd they acknowledged him as the long-awaited savior of their people. Is that not so?\u201d</p><p>I could see both of them stiffen at hearing Yeshua\u2019s name coming from my lips. Although they understood nothing else, they did not like it when I spoke of him, but it helped me think and remember.</p><p>\u201cBut the Tiberians reviled him for sowing disorder. They took him prisoner, and killed him like a common criminal,\u201d I continued. \u201cAnd as his true love Mary wept at the foot of the post to which he was nailed, her tears mingled with his dripping blood in the soil. From this joining, Blessed Elua was engendered, and Mother Earth herself nurtured him in her womb.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t like hearing Elua\u2019s name, either, although I had the impression it was for different reasons.</p><p>I pondered what little else I knew. Of Yeshua ben Yosef, not much. The history of Blessed Elua and his Companions, I knew well. Ever since I had learned that I was half-D\u2019Angeline, I had been curious about it.</p><p>The One God had turned his back on his Earth-begotten grandson, but a handful of his divine servants had abandoned their posts in Heaven and gone to Elua\u2019s side: Naamah, Anael, Shemhazai, Eisheth, Azza, Camael, and Cassiel. When the King of Persis put Elua in chains, Naamah offered herself to him in exchange for Elua\u2019s freedom. When Elua hungered, Naamah lay down with strangers in exchange for coin that he might eat.</p><p>Wandering the earth, they came at last to Terre d\u2019Ange, where they were welcomed with joy. There, they made a home and begat thousands upon thousands of children.</p><p>Except for Cassiel, anyway. Although he stayed for love of Blessed Elua, he obeyed the One God\u2019s commandment that his servants remain chaste.</p><p>I\u2019d never quite understood Cassiel.</p><p>When their descendants grew too numerous, the One God took notice at last. He sent his commander-in-chief to fetch Elua and his Companions back to Heaven, but Elua refused, saying his grandfather\u2019s Heaven was bloodless. In the end, Mother Earth intervened and struck a bargain with the One God, who had been her husband long, long ago. Together they created a new place beyond the mortal realm, which D\u2019Angelines call the Terre d\u2019Ange-that-lies-beyond.</p><p>Well and so, it seemed to me that the matter had been peacefully resolved. It had taken place over a thousand years ago. So far as I knew, Yeshuites and D\u2019Angelines had lived peaceably together for those long centuries.</p><p>Mayhap the answer lay in more recent history. My thoughts circled back around to Berlik\u2019s tale. In his day, there had been a great exodus of Yeshuites around the world as they embarked on pilgrimages to Vralia. There was a prophecy that when Yeshua ben Yosef returned to the world, he would establish his kingdom in the north, and the Yeshuites believed the time was nigh.</p><p>That, I remembered, was because of the war in Vralia. Some royal prince named Tadeuz Vral had set himself up as the supreme monarch. He\u2019d even named the place after himself. But his brother had rebelled against him. Tadeuz Vral had appointed a Yeshuite immigrant with a gift for military strategy to lead his army, and swore an oath that he would convert and rule the country in Yeshua\u2019s name if the fellow was victorious.</p><p>As it happened, he was.</p><p>That was how Vralia had become a Yeshuite nation, and that was the extent of my knowledge. I did recall that in Prince Imriel\u2019s tale, this Tadeuz Vral had been none too pleased with him for killing Berlik, as all Yeshuite pilgrims were under his protection and Prince Imriel had lied about his intentions. But it was the very same priest who had begged Prince Imriel to spare Berlik who convinced Vral to let the prince go, so I did not see how the incident could be the cause of a grudge that had festered for over a hundred years and led to my own half-breed D\u2019Angeline self being taken into captivity.</p><p>Again, so far as I knew, it was the start of a diplomatic relationship between the nations, and I didn\u2019t recall hearing aught to suggest it was anything but cordial in the decades that had followed.</p><p>None of it made a damn bit of sense.</p><p>Of course, I had been gone for a long while. For all I knew, there had been some new incident that had Vralia in an uproar against D\u2019Angelines or the folk of the Maghuin Dhonn, and I was paying the price.</p><p>It seemed unlikely, though. There were no great, shape-shifting magicians like Berlik left to my people, and I could hardly imagine thoughtful, steady-minded King Daniel of Terre d\u2019Ange allowing a diplomatic outrage to take place on his watch. No, if anything, he was overly cautious. The only outrageous thing he had ever done in his life was marry Jehanne.</p><p>Despite everything, the thought made me smile.</p><p>Few folk had ever understood that match, but I did. Daniel\u2019s first wife, the one who died, had been the love of his life, gracious, noble, and kind. To this day, he grieved deeply for her. He had allowed himself to love the fickle, tempestuous courtesan that was my lady Jehanne because she was nothing like her predecessor\u2014and Jehanne knew it full well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s why he tolerates my foibles, she had told me once. We\u2019re unfaithful to one another in different ways.</p><p>It was true, but not wholly so. Deep down, Jehanne was a great deal wiser and kinder than she pretended. I knew, because she\u2019d let herself show it to me. And for all her fears and uncertainties, I didn\u2019t doubt that motherhood would bring out the best in her.</p><p>I only hoped I\u2019d have the chance to see so for myself one day. Rattling my chains ruefully, I remembered gentle Checheg lying exhausted and calm in the aftermath of giving birth, assuring me of just that thing as she described my glad return to Terre d\u2019Ange with Bao at my side\u2014and little Sarangerel telling me that Jehanne\u2019s babe would be as big as her bright-eyed, toddling brother, Mongke, already creating mischief.</p> <p>It had seemed possible then.</p><p>Now.....</p><p>I fought down a wave of despair, stroking the blue silk scarf that Checheg had given me. I wore it knotted around my throat.</p><p>That, and one jade bangle the color of the dragon\u2019s translucent reflecting lake were all that were left to me of the tokens I had collected along the way, reminders that I had been loved once.</p><p>Everything else was gone.</p> <p>My yew-wood bow, gone, left behind in Batu\u2019s ger. My ivory-hilted dagger, gone or taken. Also left behind, my battered canvas satchel that held items of little value to anyone but me. There was the Emperor\u2019s jade seal, which I\u2019d stashed there for safe-keeping. That, I supposed, might be bartered for a considerable amount. The same was not true of the other items. Not the signet ring my mother had given me, proof that I was a child of Alais\u2019 line.</p><p>Not the square of cloth embroidered with flowering bamboo by Bao\u2019s half-sister, Song.</p><p>And surely, surely, not the little crystal vial of perfume that Jehanne had given me to remember her by.</p><p>No one but a D\u2019Angeline would know what that was worth.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have mattered so much; they were only things, after all. But they were things that had given me comfort.</p><p>And there was no comfort here.</p> <p>None at all.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>We began to pass through villages.</p><p>I had some mad idea that I might find help or allies within them. I called out to the staring villagers in the Tatar tongue, rattling my chains plaintively, clasping my hands and pleading, doing my best to convey that I was a captive in need of rescue.</p><p>They looked away.</p><p>Ilya spoke to them in his deep, sonorous voice, and they nodded in understanding. Some turned and spat as I passed. One little boy stooped, picked up a rock, and hurled it at me, his face contorted with disgust. He had good aim and a strong arm; although I jerked away, the rock grazed my brow in passing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying to them?\u201d I asked in fierce frustration.</p><p>He eyed me sidelong. \u201cGod wills this.\u201d</p> <p>God.</p><p>God.</p><p>God.</p><p>Oh, how perishing sick I was of hearing it! Why? It nagged at me.</p><p>If the answer didn\u2019t lie in the distant past, nor the recent past, mayhap it lay in the immediate past. The Vralians and the Tatars appeared to have an alliance of sorts, and it was no secret that the Tatars would gladly invade Ch\u2019in if the opportunity presented itself. I knew Batu\u2019s men had been indiscreet regarding my role in resolving the civil war there. Mayhap I was being punished for it; or mayhap the Vralians believed they could use me as a bargaining chip in some way.</p><p>\u201cIlya?\u201d I tapped his shoulder. Although he did not meet my eyes, his head turned in my direction. \u201cIs it because of what I did in Ch\u2019in?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d I persisted. \u201cThere were tales told, I know. Am I being punished?\u201d</p><p>Ilya gave his head a faint shake. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it politics, then?\u201d I asked. \u201cIf you imagine the Emperor of Ch\u2019in will move heaven and earth to rescue me, you are mistaken.\u201d</p><p>Another shake of his head. \u201cGod wills this.\u201d</p><p>I had reached the end of my tether. Ilya was never going to give me a meaningful answer. I was never going to fathom his god\u2019s mysterious intent on my own. I couldn\u2019t think of any further way to break or compromise the chains that bound me, nor to overpower my captors and escape.</p><p>And no one, no one was going to aid me.</p><p>We passed through forests of majestic spruce trees and stands of graceful birch. I gazed at them with bittersweet longing, severed from my awareness of their slow, stately thoughts. I wished I were a great magician like Berlik. I wished I could take on the shape of the Great Bear Herself and burst my chains, vanishing into the wilderness where no one would ever find me unless I willed it.</p><p>My imprisoned diadh-anam flared in agreement.</p><p>I wished I knew what had befallen Bao. Despite what the Khan had said, I did not for an instant think that he would rest content among the Tatars with his hot-tempered princess now that the bond between us was broken\u2014or at least blocked.</p><p>No, my stubborn magpie had made his choice; and Bao would move heaven and earth to rescue me. Of that, I hadn\u2019t the slightest doubt.</p><p>I suspected in truth the Great Khan didn\u2019t, either. That was why he had prepared a tale to send Bao far, far away.</p><p>The thought made my heart ache. Gods, it seemed so unfair! Bao and I had only just begun to make sense of our strange fate, sorting out the tangled threads of friendship, love, desire, and magic that bound us together.</p><p>I missed him, and this time it was a yearning that owed nothing to magic. Until we were reunited, I hadn\u2019t realized how much I simply liked being with him\u2014even when he infuriated me, even when he told me true things about myself no one else saw.</p><p>After conceding that at least for the moment, my situation was hopeless, I allowed myself a full day to wallow in self-pity and despair.</p><p>I turned the jade bangle on my wrist, thinking of the dragon dreaming on the distant peaks of White Jade Mountain above his reflecting pool, and allowed myself to entertain a fantasy of rescue and revenge in which the dragon flew to my aid and descended from the sky in all his celestial glory, roaring in mighty fury while Ilya and Leonid cowered and begged forgiveness.</p><p>It was a pleasant fantasy.</p><p>But it was nothing more, and I knew it all too well. If I were not bound, mayhap it would be different. Snow Tiger had said once that no one in Ch\u2019in would raise a hand to me for fear of the dragon\u2019s fury. If he had been able to sense my plight, mayhap he would have come to my rescue.</p><p>I doubted it, though. For all his celestial might and majesty, the dragon was very much a creature of his place, inextricably linked to his mountain and pool. I did not think his jurisdiction over the skies extended beyond the boundaries of Ch\u2019in.</p><p>Anyway, so long as I was constrained by my chains, it didn\u2019t matter. After a day of wallowing, I did my best to set aside despair, self-pity, and useless fantasies.</p><p>For the first time since I had been taken captive, I willed my thoughts to be quiet and practiced the Five Styles of Breathing, returning to my original plan.</p><p>I would wait.</p><p>I would be patient. Sooner or later, a chance would come. When it did, I would be ready to seize it.</p><p>Such were my thoughts several days later when we emerged from the mountain passes and caught sight of the city of Riva, as I later learned it was called, built along the shores of an inland lake in a sizable valley.</p><p>It was the first settlement of any significance that we had encountered, and I knew within the space of a few heartbeats that it was our destination. Almost entirely deprived of conversation, I\u2019d grown skilled at reading more subtle cues. Leonid\u2019s chin rose, and he gave the reins a brisk shake. Beside him, Ilya took a deep breath. The cart-horses pricked their ears and leaned into the traces.</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d I murmured in Tatar.</p><p>Ilya turned his bearded head a few degrees in my direction. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I gazed at the city as we approached. It wasn\u2019t large, but it wasn\u2019t insubstantial, either. There were farms on the outskirts, using up every bit of arable land in the valley. The city proper was compact, nestled against the shores of the lake.</p><p>It had one building of note, larger than the rest. It put me in mind of the palace of the Lady of Marsilikos, where Raphael de Mereliot\u2019s sister, who had once reviled me spitefully, held that ancient hereditary title. Like the palace, it sported a gilded dome that shone in the sunlight, a beacon to weary travellers. There was one difference, though. Unlike the palace, this dome ended in a spire, for all the world like a sprouting onion.</p><p>Atop the spire, a flared cross gleamed.</p><p>Ilya raised his medallion to his lips and kissed it.</p><p>I found myself tensing as we descended into the valley and entered the city. Folk going about their business on the narrow streets paused to stare. A few\u2014men, always\u2014called out questions.</p><p>Ilya answered in his deep voice.</p><p>In response, they shuddered with distaste and gazed at me with fascinated horror. I flinched, waiting for stones that were not thrown.</p><p>Not yet, anyway.</p><p>The promise was there. I saw it in the way the men clenched their fists, muscles knotting. I saw it in the hot gazes of small boys, ever unwittingly eager for mayhem. I saw it in the way modest Vralian women with scarves wrapped around their heads turned away, averting their eyes, blocking the sight of me with their bodies lest their daughters see.</p><p>It scared me.</p><p>Stone and sea! What in the world had I ever done that these people, total strangers, should hate and despise me? I thought I\u2019d become accustomed to living with fear, but I was wrong. After the initial rush of terror, I\u2019d come to rely on Ilya and Leonid\u2019s reluctant forbearance. This, this was different.</p><p>I huddled in my chains, breathing quietly, trying to cling to a sense of calm. It was not easy. I felt helpless and vulnerable, dirty, disheveled, and very, very alone.</p><p>When we reached the building with the gilded dome, Leonid reined in the cart-horses. They cocked their haunches, resting in the traces. Ilya dismounted and came around the side of the wagon to help me climb down, touching me as little as possible.</p><p>My bare feet struck the cobblestones, my toes curling.</p><p>I was scared, so scared.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Ilya beckoned to me. \u201cHere, it is good.\u201d</p><p>I went with him, mincing awkwardly in my chains.</p><p>Inside the temple, there was a large space for worshippers to gather. There was an altar, and a vast mosaic on the wall behind it, an image of a bearded man I took to be Yeshua ben Yosef. His big eyes were hot and stern, and he held a disc that depicted the earth in the palm of one hand, a flared cross sprouting from it, his other hand raised in a foreboding gesture.</p><p>It seemed word of our arrival had already reached the temple. A bearded middle-aged man in embroidered woolen robes stood before the altar. Like Ilya and Leonid, he wore a flared cross medallion on a gold chain. Behind him were three other figures: two women, and a much younger man, taller than the other, his head averted.</p><p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d The man in the front breathed the word with a startling reverence, addressing me in flawless D\u2019Angeline. \u201cMoirin mac Fainche of the Maghuin Dhonn, be welcome to this place God has brought you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He came toward me, smiling. \u201cDo not be afraid. My name is Pyotr Rostov, and I am the Patriarch of Riva. Let me have a look at you, child.\u201d</p><p>Since I didn\u2019t have a choice, I stood my ground as he lifted my chin with gentle fingers, peering at me.</p><p>I took his measure, too. He was ruggedly handsome in the Vralian manner, with weather-beaten skin and strong, prominent bones. His hair and long, thick beard were black, his eyes a dark, velvety brown. At the moment, they shone at me with surpassing warmth, so much so that I felt myself relaxing.</p><p>\u201cFlawless!\u201d Pyotr Rostov breathed with the same peculiar reverence. Releasing my chin, he lifted his medallion and kissed it, murmuring a prayer in Vralian. \u201cOh, child! I have been looking for someone like you for so very, very long, but never in my fondest dreams did I imagine God would grant my prayers with such perfection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I whispered uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He smiled at me with a father\u2019s tenderness. \u201cLook at you! Every abomination of two sinful races combined in one flesh, trailing a history of foul magic and blasphemy\u2014and all of it wrapped in a package of unholy temptation.\u201d He kissed his medallion again. \u201cTruly, God is great.\u201d</p><p>I felt sick. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked for the thousandth time, trying not to break down in tears. \u201cWhat do you and your god want of me?\u201d</p><p>This time, I got an answer. The Patriarch of Riva spread his arms. \u201cI am the servant of God and his son Yeshua, and I pray that they work through me.\u201d His eyes shone even brighter, taking on a hectic, avid quality. \u201cIf I can lead one such as you to salvation, surely I can change the world!\u201d</p><p>My trapped diadh-anam surged in alarm.</p><p>I had my answer, and I did not like it. Not one bit.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>With unctuous courtesy, the Patriarch of Riva introduced me to his family, my new jailors.</p><p>The older of the two women was his wife, Luba, a stern-looking woman with grey eyes and lips thinned with disapproval. The other woman, Valentina, was his sister. Although she was younger than her brother, she had the same velvety brown eyes and worn traces of beauty in her features. Both of them wore scarves wrapped around their heads.</p><p>Neither of them cared to meet my eyes, nor did the young man.</p><p>He intrigued me.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t lifted his head once since Ilya escorted me into the temple, keeping his face stubbornly averted. Tawny hair, bronze streaked with lighter gold, fell to curtain his features, reminding me uncomfortably of Raphael de Mereliot.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that, though. When I gazed at him, I felt the unmistakable stirring of Naamah\u2019s gift within me, recognizing its presence in another. Without ever looking at me, the young man flushed beneath my gaze, a tide of red blood creeping upward to stain his throat and cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAleksei,\u201d the Patriarch said in a somber voice. \u201cShe is a test and a trial of your faith as much as mine, and perhaps even more so. It is the only way you can ever redeem your mother\u2019s sin.\u201d</p><p>The young man nodded. \u201cYes, Uncle.\u201d Squaring his broad shoulders, he lifted his head and met my gaze.</p><p>I drew in a sharp breath. He was half-D\u2019Angeline, no doubt. The stamp of Terre d\u2019Ange was on his features, that keen, fearful symmetry wedded to the rugged Vralian bones to form a different kind of beauty. His full lips were made for kissing, and his eyes, gods! They were a vivid hue of blue tinged with violet, like rain-washed speedwell blossoms.</p> <p>At the moment, they gazed at me with a mixture of fascination and morbid fear.</p><p>His mother, Valentina, made a choked sound and turned away.</p><p>I let out my breath. \u201cIs that what this is really about?\u201d I asked the Patriarch, trying not to let my anger show. \u201cSome D\u2019Angeline laid a cuckoo\u2019s egg in your sister\u2019s nest, and I must be punished for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, child.\u201d Pyotr Rostov shook his head. \u201cI spoke the truth. It is about sin and redemption\u2014yours, mine, Aleksei\u2019s, Valentina\u2019s, and the whole world\u2019s. It is about the Rebbe Avraham ben David, and the struggle for the soul of Vralia\u2019s faith. It is about the prophecies of Elijah of Antioch..... do you know of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said curtly.</p> <p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he said in a calm tone. \u201cHave no fear, Moirin mac Fainche. I will teach you. Through Yeshua\u2019s grace, I will guide you to the light of the One True God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would rather you didn\u2019t,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>The Patriarch laid a hand on my shoulder. \u201cChild, you only think that because there are blinders on your eyes. I will remove them and teach you to see. What men call Hell is but the absence of God. When you learn to see, when you accept God\u2019s presence in your life, you will understand that you have been suffering needlessly for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>I jerked away from him, my chains rattling. \u201cWill you remove these when I do?\u201d I asked, holding out my shackled wrists.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He beckoned to Ilya, still loitering discreetly behind us. Ilya came forward, fishing the key from a second chain around his neck, hidden beneath his robes. It was one of the first places I would have looked if I\u2019d ever succeeded in bashing his head in. I wished I had. He handed it over with ceremony. The Patriarch let it dangle from his fist. \u201cOn the day that you pledge yourself heart and soul to the One True God and his son Yeshua, I will unlock your chains, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it now,\u201d I offered, reckoning that under the circumstances the Maghuin Dhonn Herself would forgive me the lie.</p> <p>He gave me a condescending smile. \u201cTrue faith is hard won. I will know when you have won yours. You have not even made a beginning until you confess the full litany of your sins.\u201d He stroked his beard. \u201cI suspect that alone will take a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>I was silent.</p><p>The Patriarch sighed. \u201cThere will come a day when you will thank me, but I do not expect you to believe me now. Now.....\u201d His nostrils flared. \u201cI do believe you would be well served by a good scrubbing.\u201d</p><p>With that, I was dismissed.</p><p>Luba and Valentina led me away. I glanced over my shoulder to see Aleksei kneeling at his uncle\u2019s feet, the Patriarch\u2019s hand resting on his head in benediction as he spoke to the young man in hushed tones.</p><p>There were living quarters attached to the temple, modest and simply adorned. The bathing chamber was a stark affair\u2014a room with a tin tub filled with water, and a wooden bench with a ball of soap and a wire brush. As I wondered exactly how I was meant to bathe while I was still chained into my clothing, Luba exited and returned with a pair of sharp shears and a grim smile.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to cut through the thick Tatar wool and felt. She struggled, breathing hard, scoring my skin a number of times as she strove to find an angle that would give her leverage.</p><p>The third time it happened, I winced. \u201cIt would be a great deal easier if you just took off the chains for one bedamned moment.\u201d</p> <p>She ignored me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as though there aren\u2019t enough of you to overpower me,\u201d I added.</p><p>The tip of the shears dug into my spine. She gave a wrenching squeeze, and more thick fabric tore. I sighed.</p><p>\u201cLuba does not speak your tongue,\u201d Valentina said in a low voice. \u201cYou cannot tempt her to folly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not trying\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gave me a sharp look. \u201cSave your lies!\u201d</p><p>At least she had looked at me. I breathed slowly and held my tongue, reminding myself to be patient. I needed some ally, any ally. I would not find one in this woman by insulting her intelligence.</p><p>It must have taken the better part of an hour for Luba to cut away the last of my filthy clothing. Avoiding my gaze, she gestured for me to climb into the tub. Naked and clanking, I did.</p><p>The water was cold, and although I would gladly have done it myself, Luba set about scrubbing me with relentless determination, as though the act were some kind of hateful duty. The lye soap was stinging and caustic, especially on the myriad nicks she had inflicted on my skin and the chafed welts that had begun to rise beneath my shackles. The wire brush was harsh and painful, taking off layers of skin. Unbidden tears came to my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt is good to mortify the flesh,\u201d Valentina said unexpectedly, an edge to her tone. \u201cThe flesh is weak and sinful. Only the spirit is pure.\u201d</p><p>I sought her gaze. \u201cIs that what you believe?\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cYou should not be here. My brother is a fool to bring you under his roof.\u201d</p><p>I raised my hands helplessly. \u201cSteal his key and set me free, and I will go, my lady. I will go so swiftly, it will be as though I were never here.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders tensed. \u201cI dare not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of him?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cYour brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPyotr? No.\u201d Valentina fixed me with a hard stare, pointing at me. \u201cI fear you, and all you represent. I am afraid for myself, and I am afraid for my son. I am afraid of God\u2019s judgment upon us. But if there is a chance that I am wrong and my brother is right, I will take it. If you are the penance we must endure, I will accept it.\u201d</p><p>I was confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>She gave a short, harsh laugh. \u201cYou will in time.\u201d</p><p>Luba spoke to her in Vralian, words that sounded like a warning; and then the Patriarch\u2019s wife put her hand on the back of my neck, dunking my head forcibly beneath the cold water. When at last she allowed me to lift my head, I sputtered for breath. She scoured irritably at my long, tangled hair with the lye soap, then gave up and put out her hand for the shears, which Valentina gave to her.</p><p>I felt an unexpected pang. \u201cOh, please don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The shears closed with a sharp, snicking sound. I felt cool air on the nape of my neck. My wet hair swung forward, chin-length.</p><p>\u201cVanity, vanity, all is vanity!\u201d Valentina said bitterly. \u201cHow weak is a woman\u2019s spirit? How willing is she to succumb to the temptations of the flesh? How eager to tempt others into sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am hardly in a position to tempt anyone,\u201d I muttered. \u201cNor am I to blame for whoever led you into temptation.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWe shall see.\u201d</p><p>They took no chances with me, no matter how much effort it entailed. Once I was scrubbed and shorn, the two women worked together to pick apart the seams of a coarse woolen dress, then draped it around my chained body and sewed it in place. It was drab, shapeless, and grey, and the unrefined wool itched and chafed against my raw, abraded skin. Valentina wrapped a woolen scarf around my head, tucking the strands of my wet hair beneath it.</p><p>\u201cYou will learn to cover your head like a decent woman,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cWear this at all times in the presence of men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLest I tempt them with my dazzling beauty?\u201d I asked in a wry tone. Never in my whole life had I felt so thoroughly miserable and unappealing.</p><p>Even so, Valentina\u2019s mouth tightened. She surveyed me with profound distaste and apprehension. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>From the bathing chamber, they led me to my cell\u2014another simple, stark room. It contained a bed with a thin pallet and a single blanket, a chamberpot, a straight-backed chair, a wooden stool, a stand with a ewer of water, and a tin cup. There was one high, narrow window, far too narrow for anything larger than a cat to squeeze through.</p><p>Luba spoke to Valentina, who nodded and translated. \u201cHere, you will stay. Today and tonight, you will fast and think on your sins. Fasting clears the mind. Tomorrow, the Patriarch will begin your instruction.\u201d</p><p>I unwound the head-scarf with a yank, shaking my damp, shorn hair loose in a defiant gesture. \u201cThen I\u2019ll not need this until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be wise to heed my advice and think on your sins.\u201d Valentina\u2019s gaze was bleak. \u201cAs my brother said, the path to salvation begins with confession. And he will demand a very full accounting.\u201d</p><p>Pity stirred in me. \u201cAs he did of you?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid away. \u201cThink on it.\u201d</p><p>The women left me, locking the door behind them with a firm click. I tried it anyway and found I couldn\u2019t budge it.</p><p>I was alone with my sins, whatever they were.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>As promised, the Patriarch came on the morrow, bringing with him sheaves of paper filled with writing in yet another unfamiliar alphabet. He smiled at me with unnervingly genuine warmth. \u201cGood morning, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I bowed my head, demurely wrapped in the woolen scarf. Left to contemplate my sins, I had taken Valentina\u2019s advice to heart, insofar as I had determined to wrestle my fear and anger into submission, and give the semblance of cooperating with Pyotr Rostov to the utmost of my ability. \u201cGood morning, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He fixed me with a shrewd look, and I warned myself inwardly against overplaying my hand. \u201cI expect you have many questions.\u201d He took a seat in the straight-backed chair, indicating the stool with a nod. \u201cLet us see if I might answer some of them before we begin.\u201d</p><p>I sat obediently, wondering if this was some sort of trick.</p><p>The Patriarch saw the uncertainty on my face. \u201cAllow me to speculate,\u201d he said gently. \u201cSurely you must wonder how I knew of your existence, your nature, and your history. Is that fair to say?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAye, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He stroked the sheaves of paper in his lap. \u201cAre you aware of the prophecy that Yeshua will return to establish his kingdom in the north?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d He gazed into the distance. \u201cWhen I was a child, I believed that Vralia had done everything possible to make ready for his return. Every day, I awaited it; and yet it did not come. As a man, I began to doubt. I sought answers. In my quest, I turned to men of great wisdom and discipline.\u201d His expression turned stern. \u201cAre you aware that there was a schism in the Vralian Church of Yeshua?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d The Patriarch nodded, half to himself. \u201cIt came about after the death of Avraham ben David, the Rebbe who counseled the mighty Grand Prince Tadeuz Vral in the aftermath of his historic victory and shepherded the birth of the Church of Yeshua.\u201d</p><p>It struck a distant chord of memory within me. \u201cWas he the priest who granted sanctuary to Berlik?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly so!\u201d His eyes shone, his gaze returning to me. \u201cBerlik of the Maghuin Dhonn, Berlik the Cursed. Is he your ancestor?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cAll of the Maghuin Dhonn are kin in some way. We are a scarce folk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are,\u201d he agreed. \u201cScarce and secretive.\u201d</p><p>I was confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Pyotr Rostov lifted a finger. \u201cPatience, child. I am telling you a tale.\u201d A deep solemnity returned to his features. \u201cIn his last years, when he was old and ailing, Avraham ben David wrote a series of essays, memoirs of his life. One infamous tract centers around his encounter with Berlik the Cursed, and the many discussions they had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>He leaned forward, like a man uttering a confidence. \u201cIt is called Conversations with a Heretic Saint.\u201d</p><p>I still didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>The Patriarch of Riva leaned back in his chair, obviously feeling he had made his point clear. \u201cThat is the tract that led to the Great Schism,\u201d he said in a satisfied tone. \u201cFor all that he was a great man, the Rebbe Avraham ben David faltered in the face of his mortality. The path to God\u2019s grace is a straight and narrow one. In his final days, the Rebbe expressed regrets for helping make it so in Vralia.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cBecause he was kind?\u201d</p><p>He raised his voice like thunder. \u201cBecause he was weak and fearful!\u201d</p><p>I forced myself to breathe slowly and deeply. \u201cForgive me, my lord. I do not understand why you are angry with this man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d With an effort, he controlled himself. \u201cNo, of course not. Suffice it to say that from that day forward, the Church was divided. Tadeuz Vral\u2019s heirs embraced a broader path toward the faith. It is only in the far east of Vralia, where greater discipline was necessary to enforce order, that they remember it is not meant to be an easy path to tread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked honestly.</p><p>Pyotr Rostov ignored the question. \u201cThus began my interest in your mother\u2019s folk,\u201d he said in a conversational manner. \u201cYour people. Berlik\u2019s folk. The bear-witches of the Maghuin Dhonn. I was intrigued by the fact that they had gone so deep into hiding. For three generations..... nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were not in hiding, exactly,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt is the way we live. We are a reclusive folk as well as a scarce one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he observed. \u201cBut then, you\u2019re a half-blood. No matter.\u201d He waved the issue away. \u201cI\u2019ll come to your father\u2019s people in time. You know, there is very, very little written or known about the Maghuin Dhonn. And yet one bear-witch managed to change the entire course of the Vralian Church.\u201d</p><p>Since I didn\u2019t know what to say, I held my tongue.</p><p>\u201cFor all their conversations, the Rebbe Avraham was never able to persuade Berlik to accept salvation through Yeshua\u2019s sacrifice,\u201d the Patriarch continued. \u201cThat is when it came to me that if I could succeed where he failed, it would restore the Church to its rightful path. I let it be known that I would pay traders or diplomats for any word of the Maghuin Dhonn resurfacing.\u201d</p> <p>I met his gaze. \u201cAnd they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for many long years,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cIt was during that time, when my sister succumbed to temptation and fell into sin, that I turned my attention to Terre d\u2019Ange. Now, about Elua ben Yeshua and the Fallen Ones, much is written. I began reading the lesser-known prophets. Do you recall I spoke of Elijah of Antioch yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Rostov\u2019s eyes took on a hectic light. \u201cDo you know what apostasy means, Moirin?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt is the sin of abandoning one\u2019s faith in God.\u201d He steepled his fingers and touched them to his lips. \u201cIt is not uncommon to find scripture that names Cassiel of the Fallen Ones the Apostate whose return to God will bring about the return of Yeshua ben Yosef. Elijah of Antioch believed otherwise. He believed that it is Elua ben Yeshua himself who is the Apostate, that it is the Fallen Ones, and most especially the Great Whore Naamah, who led him astray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said politely.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cBut I am giving you the tools to understand, and in time, you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am trying, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch shook his head. \u201cYou are dissembling in the hope of fooling me. Don\u2019t worry, child. God is patient, and so am I. I came to understand that my sister\u2019s disgrace was an opportunity in disguise. Like you, my nephew is afflicted by Naamah\u2019s curse, but I have taught him that it may be repudiated through prayer and discipline. Once you have accepted salvation, I will do the same for you.\u201d</p><p>Unable to hide my feelings, I looked away.</p><p>\u201cYou are angry.\u201d He gave me another indulgent smile. \u201cOnly consider this, Moirin.\u201d He tapped the sheaf of papers on his lap. \u201cLong after I had begun to lose hope that the Maghuin Dhonn would ever resurface, you appeared. Not only a witch born to Berlik\u2019s folk, but the daughter of a priest of the Great Whore herself. And your deeds!\u201d He fanned the pages. \u201cFornicating with men and women alike..... well, that is no surprise in Terre d\u2019Ange, bastion of depravity as it is. But wreaking false miracles and summoning demons?\u201d He raised his brows. \u201cSurely your presence is a sign that God is testing us to see if we are prepared for his son Yeshua\u2019s return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were no false miracles,\u201d I said in a low tone. \u201cThe gift of healing was Raphael\u2019s, not mine.\u201d</p> <p>Pyotr Rostov peered at his notes. \u201cBy all accounts, he was a skilled physician, but he credited your magic with allowing him to achieve miraculous cures. But we are getting ahead of ourselves. When you make your full confession, you may tell me how you used your dark arts to tempt him into the sin of hubris. Do you know that word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I shifted on the stool, my chains rattling. \u201cIt is a Hellene word for excessive pride that leads to folly. Cillian taught it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCillian.....\u201d He glanced at his notes again. I suspected it was just for show, and that he had my entire history memorized. Not for the first time, I cursed the fact that gossip was the life-blood of Terre d\u2019Ange, and precious little I had done in my life was hidden from common knowledge. \u201cCillian mac Tiernan, son of the Lord of the Dalriada. That\u2019s a good place to begin your confession. He is the first man you ensorceled, is he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ensorcel him. He was my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it says!\u201d I sighed. \u201cHow did you find me, anyway? The Tatar lands are a long way from Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d The Patriarch nodded gravely. \u201cI received these reports only last autumn, for they were many months on the road. It was in my thoughts to petition the Duke of Vralsturm to fund an expedition to Terre d\u2019Ange in the spring to seek you out. Instead.....\u201d A look of awe settled over his features. \u201cBefore winter fell, traders from the east brought rumors of war in Ch\u2019in, and a jade-eyed foreign witch who served the Emperor. I did not think there could be two such in the world. So I had these chains forged over the course of the winter, and come spring, I sent Brother Ilya and Brother Leonid eastward to investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d I said bitterly.</p> <p>\u201cDo you not see that it is a sign from God that they found you so swiftly, so near to this place?\u201d he asked with the inexorable logic of his faith. \u201cYou were already on a path toward salvation, Moirin. You just didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>My palms were sweating, and I rubbed them against the prickly woolen fabric of my dress. \u201cAre you so certain you know your God\u2019s will? Mayhap I was sent here for some other purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The Patriarch shook his head. \u201cYou were not. I am not immune to doubt, but in this, I am certain. There have been other signs that the days of conflict that will accompany Yeshua\u2019s return are nigh. I have sensed it ever since the King of Terre d\u2019Ange had the temerity to raise a whore, an unrepentant whore, to the royal throne.\u201d</p><p>I flushed.</p><p>He ruffled his notes. \u201cYes, you knew her intimately, did you not? Take heed from her fate, Moirin mac Fainche, lest God strike you down, too.\u201d</p><p>A jolt of unexpected horror ran through me, and I found myself staring at him. \u201cWhat fate?\u201d I raised my voice. \u201cWhat fate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d It was a statement, not a question. The Patriarch of Riva met my gaze without flinching. He didn\u2019t smile, not exactly, but his lips curled and his face took on a satisfied expression I would come to think of as his creamy look, the one that meant he was reveling in the pain he was about to inflict upon me for my own good.</p><p>It came and went in the flicker of an eye, but it was there, and already I dreaded the words that would follow it.</p><p>He spoke them. \u201cThe D\u2019Angeline whore-queen Jehanne de la Courcel died in childbirth over a year ago.\u201d</p><p>It hit me like a fist to the belly. I wasn\u2019t aware of toppling from the stool, wasn\u2019t aware of falling. Only that there was cold stone pressed against my cheek, and I couldn\u2019t breathe. I lay curled around my misery and shoved my manacled hands against my stomach, gasping for air, my body punishing itself.</p><p>Jehanne! Ah, gods.</p><p>All this time.</p><p>No.</p><p>I wanted to weep, and couldn\u2019t. The grief was too vast, too unanticipated. Not Jehanne, my unlikely rescuer, my mercurial Queen. I dragged a ragged gulp of air into my lungs, expelling it with a low keening sound.</p><p>I wanted to believe it was a lie.</p><p>I knew it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Chair legs scraped. \u201cYou are upset,\u201d Pyotr Rostov said with regret from somewhere above me. \u201cForgive me, I should have realized it had been a very long time since you had news from your homeland, Moirin. I will leave you to your grief, and we will resume on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>He left.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>The days that followed were a blur.</p><p>I refused to eat, refused to talk, turning my face to the wall of my cell. There was no thought or strategy behind it, only the profound, endless ache of grief.</p><p>Jehanne. My lady Jehanne.</p><p>All this time..... ah, gods! She had been frightened, so frightened. Frightened of impending motherhood, frightened of childbirth. And I had left her anyway, obeying the call of my bedamned destiny.</p><p>If I had stayed, I could have saved her. Raphael de Mereliot and I could have saved her.</p><p>It was a thought that haunted me, circling back upon me no matter how hard I sought to avoid it. We had done it before, Raphael and I. Together, with my magic channeling his gift for healing, we had saved a young mother bleeding excessively during the act of giving birth.</p><p>I wondered if he had been there at the end.</p><p>I suspected he had.</p><p>King Daniel would have sent for him. It was true, even without my aid Raphael was a skilled physician. In their own ways, they had both loved her, and Jehanne had loved them, too.</p><p>And me.</p><p>I tortured myself with imagining it. Jehanne, weakening, her exquisite face drained of blood. Raphael, rubbing his healer\u2019s hands together to generate warmth, laying them on her, trying in vain to staunch the bleeding. King Daniel hovering over the tableau in anguish, all his solemn poise undone.</p><p>And all the while, a thing unsaid lying between them.</p><p>If Moirin were here.....</p><p>Folk came and went. The Patriarch tried to coax me into talking. Valentina and Luba took turns trying to coax me into eating, putting spoonfuls of hot broth to my lips. I ignored them, keeping my mouth stubbornly closed. For a mercy, no one tried to force me.</p><p>I ached at the unfairness of it. Even if I\u2019d known what would happen, I couldn\u2019t have chosen otherwise. How many more would have died in the war in Ch\u2019in if I hadn\u2019t been able to help free the dragon? Thousands, likely.</p><p>Or mayhap there would have been no war; mayhap Emperor Zhu would have surrendered, believing he had lost the Mandate of Heaven. Master Lo and Bao would have failed in their mission. My lovely princess Snow Tiger would have been put to death, and the dragon\u2019s splendid spirit would have died with her, ceasing to exist forevermore.</p><p>Black Sleeve and Lord Jiang would have been free to loose the dreadful weapons of the Divine Thunder on the world, and the world would have become a far more terrible place. I couldn\u2019t weigh Jehanne\u2019s life against such a fate.</p><p>But oh, gods! It hurt.</p><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for Aleksei, I don\u2019t know how long I would have kept my fast. It wasn\u2019t that I sought death, at least not consciously. But I hadn\u2019t much will to live, either. Everything I loved had been taken from me. This last blow was simply more than I could bear.</p><p>Every day, Aleksei came and read to me from the Yeshuite scriptures, beginning with the tale of the world\u2019s creation, and Edom the First Man and his wife, the All-Mother, Yeva. At first I ignored him, too, sitting huddled on the hard stone floor of my cell with my manacled arms wrapped around my knees and my face turned toward the wall.</p><p>He persisted, hunkering on the wooden stool that he might be closer to my level, reading in a pleasant, melodious voice.</p><p>I could ignore him, and I could let the words he spoke wash over me, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the presence of Naamah\u2019s gift in the room between us. Every time his voice faltered, I felt it.</p><p>In those brief moments of silence, I felt his gaze on me.</p><p>And I felt Naamah\u2019s gift respond within me. It was not desire on my part, not even close. My grief ran too deep. I hadn\u2019t even begun to cope with the shock and pain of being torn away from Bao\u2019s side so unexpectedly, so soon after being reunited with my stubborn peasant-boy and the missing half of my soul, before being struck with the news of Jehanne\u2019s death.</p><p>But it was a response to his desire, an instinctive urge toward life as simple and natural as a plant yearning toward the sun.</p><p>On the third day, or mayhap the fourth, Aleksei\u2019s voice faltered, and he let the silence stretch.</p><p>When it didn\u2019t break, I shifted, turning away from the wall to meet his gaze.</p><p>He flushed, and I saw his throat work as he swallowed hard. \u201cYour queen..... the babe was a girl. I thought you would want to know.\u201d</p><p>Grief caught in my chest. \u201cIs she alive and well?\u201d I whispered. \u201cJehanne\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei nodded and looked away from me, fidgeting with the leather-bound book in his hands. \u201cBefore..... before she died, the queen asked that the babe be called Desir\u00e9e, so she would always know she was loved and wanted.\u201d</p><p>Something within me broke, and for the first time since I\u2019d heard the news, I wept in great, racking sobs\u2014a storm of sorrow, my head bowed against my knees, tears soaking the coarse wool of my dress. Ah, gods! Everything I had told Jehanne was true. She had been a great deal kinder, wiser, and more gracious than she pretended, and for all her fears, she would have been a good mother.</p><p>Even in dying, Jehanne had found a way to let her daughter know she was loved.</p><p>Aleksei waited awkwardly for my sobs to subside. It was a long while before I got myself under control, rubbing my tear-stained face.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said to him. \u201cIt was kind of you to tell me.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, looked back at me. \u201cI wish you would relent. My uncle feels terrible about telling you thusly.\u201d His color rose again, his fearful gaze skidding away. \u201cHe did not know you cared for her so.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back against the wall, resting my head on the cool stone. I felt tired and hollow, and weak with hunger. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>His blue-violet eyes widened. \u201cOf course it is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I moved my head from side to side. \u201cI saw his face, Aleksei. He heard the fear in my voice when I begged him to tell me what he meant by Jehanne\u2019s fate. He knew. He relished the pain it would inflict.\u201d</p><p>His flush deepened with anger, his voice dropping to a lower register. \u201cYou seek to sow doubt. I do not believe it.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged wearily. \u201cBelieve what you like.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei closed his eyes, his lips moving in a silent prayer. When he opened those glorious blue eyes again, they were luminous with the inner light of his faith. \u201cI will not be swayed,\u201d he said in a firm tone. \u201cYou were sent to us as a test and a trial, and I will not fail. God loves you, Moirin, and his son Yeshua gave his life that you might know it. I am trying; we are all trying. Do you but open your heart and listen, and you will hear the call to salvation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I studied him, studied the rugged planes of his young face, graced with that unmistakable D\u2019Angeline symmetry. I tried to guess his age. Sixteen, mayhap; seventeen at most.</p><p>A year younger than me? Two years? Or mayhap three? Gods, I wasn\u2019t even sure how old I was anymore.</p><p>He had only just begun to grow into the newfound strength of his adult frame\u2014broad-shouldered and rangy, with long, loose limbs and oversized feet and hands. I remembered Cillian at that age.</p> <p>And I remembered Jehanne at Cereus House, where she had first seduced me as a ploy in her ongoing game with Raphael de Mereliot, her fair skin flawless in the sunlight, her blue-grey eyes sparkling like stars as she caressed my face, uttering one of desire\u2019s truths. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since I let myself indulge in the headlong rush of youth\u2019s untutored passion?</p><p>No.</p><p>She had kissed my lips, a kiss as sweet as a promise. Far, far too long, my gorgeous young savage.</p><p>And I had succumbed to her charms\u2014oh so gladly!</p><p>The memory hurt. Neither of us could have guessed that that moment would lead us into a far more significant and complicated bond, one that I would never, ever regret. I had loved Jehanne, and I had loved her well. I took a deep breath, steeling myself against the pain, and contemplated young Aleksei, a tightly wound knot of desire and denial, sitting hunched on my wooden stool.</p> <p>He was filled with youth\u2019s untutored passion, taught to consider it a curse. Perhaps Naamah had some purpose for me here after all. One thing was sure; I was in desperate need of an ally.</p><p>I loosed my breath. \u201cRead to me,\u201d I said gently to him. \u201cI will listen, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei bowed his head and read to me, his tawny-gold hair falling about his face.</p><p>I listened, and began to plot.</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Seducing Aleksei might well prove to be my best chance at finding an ally to help me escape, but if I had any illusions about how difficult it would be, they were shattered the following day when his uncle the Patriarch returned to bear witness to my confession.</p> <p>\u201cCan it not wait a bit longer?\u201d I asked him. The prospect of laying my life bare for him repulsed me. \u201cAleksei\u2019s reading is very instructive, but I am only just beginning to learn to understand what God wants of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, child.\u201d Pyotr Rostov gave me a compassionate look. \u201cLet me put it to you in a way you might understand. You have studied the healing arts, have you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d I knew enough to assist Raphael, and later Master Lo, though not enough to consider myself skilled.</p><p>He steepled his fingers, which meant he was in a lecturing mood. \u201cSuppose you had a patient suffering from festering boils. Is it more important to lance the boils, or to serve the patient a nourishing broth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo lance the boils,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cEven so.\u201d The Patriarch nodded. \u201cYou are that patient, Moirin. The scripture that Aleksei reads to you is a fine, nourishing broth. But your unconfessed sins are boils festering on your soul. Left untouched, they will poison your soul, heart, and mind. Confession is the needle that will burst them, and repentance will heal the abscesses. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded reluctantly. I didn\u2019t like it, and I didn\u2019t agree with it, but I understood his meaning.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d He had a portable writing desk on his lap. Now he dipped a quill pen in the inkpot. \u201cI will record your confession. I do not expect to succeed all at once. It may be that some boils are more stubborn than others, and must be lanced many times before they are fully drained. This document will be helpful, and I hope my notes will prove useful over the course of history.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so very pleased.\u201d I could not keep the bitterness from my tone. \u201cAll that was missing in my life was a written catalogue of my every folly.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch\u2019s expression turned stern. \u201cWe are not speaking of mere folly, child. We are speaking of beast-worship, witchcraft, unholy fornication, demon-summoning, and blasphemy. These are things that are abominations in the eyes of God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He blinked, startled. \u201cHave you not been listening to the scripture Aleksei reads to you? Did you not just say you were beginning to gain understanding of God\u2019s will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he wills, aye, but not why he wills it,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cNot always, anyway. Obviously, it is a very bad and foolish idea to summon fallen spirits, and if God wishes to call it a sin, I will not argue. I wish\u2014\u201d It was on the tip of my tongue to say I wished I had never taken part in it, but then I remembered the gift that the spirit Marbas had given me, the charm to reveal hidden things. Had it not been for Marbas\u2019 gift, the dragon\u2019s spirit would have remained trapped in the princess\u2019 mortal being.</p><p>Rostov was still staring at me with incomprehension. \u201cYes? You wish what?\u201d</p><p>I took a different tack. \u201cFor greater understanding. Why does it matter who I bed, so long as we are both consenting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaamah\u2019s curse has a strong hold on you indeed,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut do not despair, Moirin. No one comes to understanding without guidance. It is my role to help you understand the word of God and his son Yeshua.\u201d</p><p>I waited.</p><p>\u201cOur goal in life is to join with God in a perfect spiritual union,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cThat is pure joy, and pure love. Anything that distracts from this goal is a trap, and the pleasures of the flesh is one of the greatest traps in existence. God allows us the sacrament of marriage that we might obey his command to be fruitful and multiply. To abuse the flesh in pursuit of carnal pleasure is an abomination to him, for it causes us to stray far, far from our true goal. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d Again, I didn\u2019t agree, but at least the logic was clearer to me. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch rewetted his pen in the inkwell. \u201cLet us set aside matters of the flesh for the moment,\u201d he said in a judicious manner. \u201cLet us begin at the very beginning. Is it true that the Maghuin Dhonn worship a bear?\u201d</p><p>I did my best to answer his questions honestly, reckoning I had nothing to lose; and too, I was wary of his perceptive shrewdness. He could track a lie like a hound on the scent. The truth was a greater struggle for him.</p><p>It had always been difficult to explain the existence of a diadh-anam to folk who had none, and the Patriarch of Riva was no exception. And I had no words to describe the Maghuin Dhonn Herself.</p><p>The irony of it was that when he spoke of a perfect union with his God, of pure joy and pure love, I knew what he meant. Beyond the stone doorway, when the Maghuin Dhonn Herself had come to me, I had felt it. Half-blood though I may be, with my patron D\u2019Angeline gods attendant on my life, She had claimed me as Her child, then and always. She had laid a grave destiny on me, but She had claimed me.</p><p>It had been a moment of perfect bliss, and if it had gone on forever and ever, I would have been content.</p><p>But I could not convey it\u2014not the joy, not the immense, overwhelming nature of Her presence. Not the way the earth had trembled beneath Her tread, not the awe and humility I had felt as She dwindled willingly and shaped Herself to a mortal scale. Surely, surely, not the profound depth of sorrow and compassion in Her eyes.</p><p>No, to everyone but my people, She was a bear, only a bear.</p><p>Eventually, he gave up on that line of questioning, turning instead toward magic. \u201cWhen did you begin to practice witchcraft?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, already weary of explaining myself. \u201cMy mother taught me to summon the twilight when I was some five years of age.\u201d</p><p>Pyotr Rostov\u2019s pen hovered over the page. \u201cSummon the twilight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>His eyes took on a gleam. \u201cWhat is it? How is it done?\u201d</p><p>I told him, but he didn\u2019t like that truth, either. It was too simple, too elemental. He did not want a gentle magic that came as naturally as breathing. He wanted charms, incantations, dire rites filled with chanting and blood sacrifices. It did not satisfy him when I said it was a small gift, meant to protect and conceal us. That in Alba I had only ever used it to hide, to catch fish with my bare hands, and to coax plants to grow.</p><p>\u201cIs that a sin?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The Patriarch set down his pen and pinched the bridge of his nose as though to alleviate the pressure of an aching head. \u201cPlants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, plants.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI do not believe it is addressed in the scripture. But this gift, how did you describe it? Taking a half-step into the spirit world?\u201d I nodded. \u201cIn Terre d\u2019Ange, you found other purposes for it.\u201d</p><p>I looked away. \u201cIt is more as though they found me. Is that what you wish to speak of next, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He took up the pen with grim determination. \u201cLet us proceed in the proper order. I believe we have come to Cillian mac Tiernan, and the sins of the flesh.\u201d</p><p>So we had.</p><p>On the point of having ensorceled Cillian, I resisted stubbornly. It was a false accusation, and one that still pained me, inextricably linked as it was to the sorrow of his death. At length, the Patriarch relented, although only on that single point.</p><p>\u201cBut you did fornicate with him out of wedlock?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>His pen hovered. \u201cHow many times?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly. How many times? I hadn\u2019t counted. Cillian had come to me whenever he could. In the spring and summer, we had lain together in the Alban meadows, flowers and plumy grasses springing around us. I\u2019d come to know his body as well as my own, reveling the feel of him between my thighs, his strong, young phallus plowing my depths. Afterward, I had counted the freckles on his fair skin, his long, muscled limbs tangled with mine. Once, I had coaxed a dragonfly with translucent wings to land on my fingertip, and he had marveled at it, asking if it was magic. Only the ordinary, everyday kind, I had told him.</p><p>Was that sin?</p><p>In hindsight, it seemed a profoundly innocent time.</p><p>The Patriarch dipped his pen, tapped it impatiently against the inkwell. \u201cHow many times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cMany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I closed my eyes, tears leaking from beneath my lids. Since the news of Jehanne\u2019s death, my grief was still very, very close to the surface. \u201cCillian died in a cattle-raid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I rubbed my face. \u201cYes. I don\u2019t know. It was foolish and unnecessary. He shouldn\u2019t have gone. Cillian was a scholar, not a warrior. But he felt he had somewhat to prove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me, to his father, to the Dalriada. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d The tears wouldn\u2019t stop coming. \u201cIf I had loved him better, if I had agreed to wed him, mayhap he would not have gone.\u201d</p><p>I bowed my head against my knees, and wept.</p><p>There was a rustling sound as the Patriarch gathered his accounting, and then the scraping sound of chair legs as he stood. \u201cNow you begin to see, Moirin,\u201d he said in a gentle tone. \u201cHad you engaged in the holy sacrament of marriage, matters would have fallen out differently. Your sorrow stems from failing to obey God\u2019s will.\u201d He laid one hand on my shaking shoulder. \u201cIt is a good beginning. Tomorrow, we will continue.\u201d</p><p>He left me alone, locking the door behind him. After my tears had run their course, I rose and splashed cool water from the ewer on my face.</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel like a good beginning to me. I felt hot, flushed, confused, and miserable. I\u2019d always felt a powerful measure of guilt for Cillian\u2019s death. At the same time, I knew in my heart of hearts that I could never have been the faithful wife he wanted me to be. It would only have led to a different kind of sorrow and acrimony.</p><p>Now.....</p><p>Somehow, the confession the Patriarch had dragged from me had soiled every aspect of my relationship with Cillian. Was our lovemaking a sin? I didn\u2019t believe it, didn\u2019t want to believe it.</p><p>And yet the mere act of confessing it made it seem so. My memories had been violated\u2014and it was only the beginning.</p><p>With beliefs so deeply ingrained, seducing Aleksei was going to be very, very difficult indeed.</p><p>Still, I meant to try.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>I n Terre d\u2019Ange, seduction is reckoned an art and a sport alike, and yet I\u2019d never had cause to practice it, not really.</p><p>When I arrived in the City of Elua, I fell straightaway into Raphael de Mereliot\u2019s schemes\u2014quite literally, from the moment his carriage struck me down unwittingly in the street and he found the signet ring around my neck identifying me as a descendant of House Courcel.</p><p>And from the moment Raphael made me a pawn in his complicated game with Jehanne, I became a target, a prize to be claimed.</p><p>I\u2019d known it when I let Jehanne seduce me.</p><p>I\u2019d known it when Prince Thierry courted me, and I bedded him in a moment of loneliness.</p><p>I\u2019d been prey, not a hunter, albeit rather willing prey. Now that would have to change, and I would have to play a very subtle game with my oh so skittish prey.</p><p>Well and so, I knew how to hunt. Unlike D\u2019Angelines, I had never practiced it as a sport. It was a means of survival.</p><p>So was this. And as Batu had said, survival was the best reason of all.</p><p>Any overt move on my part would send Aleksei fleeing, of that I was sure. I could sense it in the nervous tension in his body when he was alone in my cell with me, in the way his voice broke and faltered as he read to me, in the way he avoided my gaze. But a good hunter observes his prey, and a very good hunter makes the prey come to him. For now, I was content to wait and observe Aleksei.</p><p>I sat demurely on my stool and listened to him read, keeping my expression open and earnest. I learned to look away when he faltered, for those were the times when he allowed himself to steal glances at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In Terre d\u2019Ange, one of the Thirteen Houses of the Night Court is dedicated to modesty\u2014Alyssum House, whose motto is With eyes averted. When first I heard of it, I hadn\u2019t understood the allure. Jehanne had explained to me that there were two kinds of patrons drawn to modesty. The first kind simply reveled in the delicious sense of wickedness involved in coaxing a modest adept to a state of wanton abandonment.</p><p>The second, more sensitive kind was moved by the tender sense of protectiveness modesty aroused in them.</p><p>Young Aleksei was surely the latter.</p> <p>So I played at being modest, feeling him relax a measure in my presence. When he finished his reading for the day, I thanked him for it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He gave me a shy smile. \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>It had been a long, repetitive tale about the plight of the Habiru folk in the land of Menekhet in which their prophet Moishe dueled with the Pharaoh\u2019s magicians. I felt very sorry for the Habiru, enslaved in a foreign land and forced to labor, but I also felt sorry for the ordinary folk of Menekhet, forced to endure rivers of blood, plagues of flies and frogs, boils, hailstorms and locusts, darkness that lasted three days, and the death of their firstborn children, all because the ridiculously stubborn Pharaoh wouldn\u2019t grant the Habiru their freedom. It seemed to me that God was cruel to punish a whole nation of common folk for the whim of one stubborn man.</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t understand for the life of me why it was acceptable for this fellow Moishe to call down darkness across the entire land, while it was a sin for me to summon the gentle twilight. But I had a sense it would be better not to ask.</p><p>\u201cIt was very interesting,\u201d I said politely. \u201cWhen do we begin to learn about Yeshua ben Yosef?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot for a long while,\u201d Aleksei admitted. \u201cThe history of the Habiru is a lengthy one. Perhaps..... perhaps Uncle would consent to allow me to read to you from the gospels that tell Yeshua\u2019s tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like that, I think.\u201d I averted my eyes, smoothing the prickly grey wool of my dress over my knees. \u201cAmong my people, it is said that Berlik, who came here many years ago, said that if there were any god he might call a friend, it was Yeshua ben Yosef.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei drew in a sharp breath. \u201cBerlik the Cursed?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cYou should not take him for your example. I have read about him.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up in surprise. \u201cYou read Rebbe Avraham\u2019s memoir?\u201d</p> <p>Aleksei colored. \u201cConversations with a Heretic Saint, yes. My mother.....\u201d He looked away. \u201cA year ago I came across a copy in her things, hidden beneath a false binding. I began reading before I knew what it was. I found it..... dangerous.\u201d</p><p>The soft tone of his voice said otherwise, said he had found beauty in it. I kept my mouth shut on that observation, watching him.</p><p>He looked back at me, his brow furrowed with worry. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything. Don\u2019t tell my uncle, please? He doesn\u2019t know she has it. It\u2019s a small thing, but it gives her comfort, and I cannot find it in my heart to begrudge her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I promised.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The worry lines eased from his face. \u201cI will ask Uncle about reading from the gospels.\u201d He essayed another shy smile. \u201cHe said your confession yesterday went well. He is pleased with your progress.\u201d</p><p>I bit my tongue on a number of scathing responses, lowering my gaze modestly once more. \u201cI am pleased to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Now that, I thought, was an auspicious beginning more to my liking. We shared a secret, Aleksei and I.</p><p>Trust was a beginning. The rest would come.</p> <p>Far less to my liking was my second confessional session with the Patriarch. As before, he came laden with notes and his portable desk, balancing it on his knees, dipping his pen in the inkwell and preparing to exhume every last private detail of my life, sullying each and every one in the process.</p><p>\u201cWell, Moirin.\u201d His creamy look came and went, quick as the flick of a cat\u2019s tail. \u201cLet us turn our attention to Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWhere do you want to start?\u201d</p><p>He shook a few drops of ink from the quill and poised it over the paper. \u201cRaphael de Mereliot.\u201d</p><p>If I had a sin to confess, surely it was Raphael, and I knew it full well. I had let him use me. I\u2019d committed follies I regretted, the worst of which was helping the Circle of Shalomon to summon Focalor.</p><p>Even so, it hadn\u2019t been all bad. There had been moments of brightness here and there, moments when I felt Raphael genuinely cared for me and desired me. The first time he kissed me and I felt his healer\u2019s gift entwine with my own magic in a way I hadn\u2019t known was possible..... it had been glorious. We had saved lives together, Raphael and I, and even though the process proved too dangerous for me to continue, I had been proud of what we had done. He had introduced me to Master Lo Feng, for which I was grateful.</p><p>The act of confession tainted it all. Pyotr Rostov was merciless in his inquiry, already knowing many of the answers, but not content until I confessed them aloud.</p><p>Yes, I had engaged in fornication with Raphael de Mereliot. How many times? I don\u2019t know, mayhap a dozen times.</p><p>Yes, I had used my magic to help him heal others; and no, I did not understand why that was a bad thing, except insofar as it was an unnatural use of my gift that nearly killed me.</p><p>\u201cLife and death are God\u2019s to command, Moirin,\u201d the Patriarch said sternly. \u201cYou have meddled in affairs beyond the mortal ken, and nothing good can come of it.\u201d His velvet-brown eyes darkened ominously. \u201cWe will speak more of this later.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I had helped Raphael and the Circle of Shalomon summon fallen spirits, and yes, I had consorted with these spirits.</p><p>No, I had not fornicated with them. Yes, I was sure.</p><p>\u201cThey spoke to me!\u201d I said in frustration. \u201cWhat was I to do? Stop my ears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter you should thrust bodkins in your ears than listen to the beguilings of demons,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cDid they tempt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d I remembered Marbas.</p><p>Rostov was quick to seize on the slightest hesitation, the slightest opening. \u201cAha! What did they offer you?\u201d</p><p>I met his gaze. \u201cThe gift of shape-shifting, the gift the Maghuin Dhonn Herself withdrew from us. I refused it.\u201d</p><p>He studied my face, looking for the lie, then gave a slight, genuine smile when he did not find it. \u201cWell done, child.\u201d</p><p>Gods help me, I found myself grateful for his praise.</p><p>The summoning of spirits was a matter of great interest to the Patriarch of Riva, and he went back and forth over it, demanding that I relate each incident in ever-increasing detail. I obliged, talking myself hoarse while his pen hovered and scratched over the paper, recording my every word.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know about the gift Marbas had given me, the charm to reveal hidden things. I did not offer it. If there were any small secrets he was unable to exhume, I meant to keep them to myself.</p><p>Thus far, it was Marbas\u2019 gift, and the fact that I had bedded a coach-driver.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t much comfort.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d I inquired when he paused to dip his pen. I raised my hands, chains dangling from my wrists. \u201cIt seems to me that these chains are very like the silver chain with which we attempted to bind Focalor, only they were wrought without flaws. Tell me, how is this not witchcraft?\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch frowned. \u201cBecause it is done in the service of God\u2019s will and with the intention of saving your immortal soul. It is not even remotely the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I let my hands fall into my lap, chains rattling.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t like that question, I could tell. He began to gather up his things brusquely. \u201cThat is enough for today. We will resume your confession on the morrow.\u201d He hesitated, taking on a more compassionate tone. \u201cWhat we must discuss will be difficult for you. But it is necessary, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened, and I looked away. \u201cYou mean to make me speak of Jehanne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it seems cruel,\u201d he said gently. \u201cBut you must make your confession in full, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of it, knowing the covert pleasure he\u2019d taken in telling me of her death, and that grief yet raw. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod is patient, and so am I,\u201d Pyotr Rostov said. \u201cI am prepared to wait a long time. And yet I am only mortal. If, in the end, you prove intractable.....\u201d He gave a sad, weary shrug. \u201cIf you do not repent, you will be stoned to death for your sins.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cI fear that is the punishment God demands,\u201d he said to me. \u201cI do not wish to administer it, but I will. Think on it.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>Aleksei began reading Yeshua\u2019s tale to me.</p><p>It was clear he took pleasure in it. I did my best to appear to listen attentively, all the while scheming ways to engage him. With the Patriarch\u2019s threat hanging over my head, it had become more urgent than ever.</p><p>All I had to guide me was Naamah\u2019s gift and my own instincts. I developed a finely honed sense of Aleksei\u2019s reactions, and the response of Naamah\u2019s gift within him.</p><p>So long as I looked away from him, he could not resist stealing glances at me. Swaddled in a shapeless woolen dress and draped in chains, a long scarf wrapped around my cropped hair, I hardly felt at my most alluring.</p><p>Still, he was a young man with a young man\u2019s appetites surging beneath his efforts to suppress them, and I found ways to tempt him. If I angled my body just so and clasped my hands in my lap in a demure pose, the chains that ran from the collar around my neck to the cuffs at my wrists pressed the fabric against my skin, showing the shape of my breasts beneath the prickly wool.</p><p>When I smoothed the fabric over my knees in another seemingly absentminded gesture, it pulled it taut for a moment, revealing the line of my thigh; and when I tilted my head a certain way, the trailing end of the woolen scarf fell away to bare my throat.</p><p>Such small enticements! And yet, to a starving man, they held all the promise of an extravagant banquet.</p><p>Once again, I thanked him for the day\u2019s reading. \u201cI look forward to hearing more,\u201d I added. \u201cEspecially the love story.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei looked confused. \u201cWhat love story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe love between Yeshua ben Yosef and Mary of Magdala,\u201d I said. \u201cSurely that is one of the best parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh..... no.\u201d He flushed, fidgeting with the book. \u201cNo, it is not reckoned so in the Church of Yeshua Ascendant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I was disappointed.</p><p>He gave me a yearning look. \u201cMary of Magdala took the blood that Yeshua spilled on the cross and used it to a corrupt end. God only allowed it that even Elua might learn to resist temptation in the end. Moirin, you must set aside the false beliefs you were taught in Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThere is no sin in love, Aleksei, nor in honest desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do not say such things!\u201d His face looked pale and pinched.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cBecause they are dangerous truths you fear to hear? Or because your uncle will have me stoned to death for saying them?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei scrambled to his feet, once more avoiding my gaze, clutching the book before him as though it were a talisman to ward me off. \u201cIt\u2019s best that I go.\u201d</p><p>Still, he hesitated. I rose from my stool, crossing the space between us. Although it was difficult to move gracefully in shackles, I had been practicing. \u201cAleksei, I am trying,\u201d I said in a low tone. \u201cBut I am as the gods have made me. Naamah\u2019s gift is real. I have felt her blessing, and there is only grace and beauty in it. It is no curse, and I do not know if I can repent of it in earnest.\u201d</p><p>He was trembling, and I was standing close enough that I could feel the heat coming off him in waves. \u201cI should go,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>I touched his cheek\u2014oh so lightly. His pupils dilated, and the pulse in the hollow of his strong young throat beat hard and fast. \u201cYou feel it, too. I know you do.\u201d</p><p>If I pressed him any harder, I would lose him. I made myself turn away, bowing my head. Aleksei\u2019s breathing was ragged in the small cell.</p><p>\u201cMoirin.....\u201d He whispered my name.</p><p>Whatever else he meant to say, he fell silent at the sound of a key turning in the lock. Valentina opened the door and entered the chamber, bringing a tray with my mid-day meal. Mother and son exchanged a long glance, and then Aleksei left, stumbling and banging his shoulder against the door-frame in his haste.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re about with my son.\u201d Valentina set the tray down on the little table, hard enough to make it rattle. Her voice was grim. \u201cGod help me, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m praying for you to succeed or fail.\u201d</p><p>I extended my arms toward her in supplication, dangling my chains. \u201cBelieve what you will, my lady. My offer stands. Purloin the key, and I will go and take any dilemma I may pose from you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth hardened. \u201cWould you take him with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAleksei?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIf he wished to go, yes, of course. Your son was not meant to live this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you love him?\u201d Valentina appraised me with a mother\u2019s shrewdness.</p><p>I found myself unable to lie to her. For all I knew, I could come to love him. As Bao had observed, I had a tendency to give my heart away quickly. But at the moment, Aleksei was but a means to an end; and no matter what else transpired, it was Bao who held the missing half of my soul.</p><p>So I stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cAs I thought,\u201d Valentina said bitterly. \u201cYou do but ply him with a whore\u2019s cheap wiles.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sank onto my narrow bed, unwinding my head-scarf and shaking my shorn hair loose, weary of playing games. \u201cForbid him my company if you fear for him so.\u201d</p><p>Her voice dropped. \u201cI dare not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I glanced at her. \u201cGod\u2019s judgment?\u201d</p> <p>She looked away from me. \u201cIt is a test and a trial.

I should not even speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you fear I\u2019ll seek to seduce you instead?\u201d I asked wryly, giving my chains an enticing jangle. \u201cI\u2019m willing to try, but I\u2019m not at my best.\u201d</p><p>Valentina shook her head. \u201cEven if I were inclined to such depravity, do you think I would not know it for a lie, old and haggard as I have grown?\u201d Unexpectedly, her voice cracked. \u201cDo not mock me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mocking you.\u201d There were tears on her cheeks and the pain in her voice tugged at my heart, making me relent. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady. I\u2019m alone, scared, and desperate.\u201d I paused, addressing her in a more gentle tone. \u201cWho was he? Did he break your heart?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t pretend not to understand. \u201cAleksei\u2019s father?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cJust a man.\u201d Valentina dabbed at her eyes. \u201cHe was a young D\u2019Angeline diplomat in Vralgrad. I was a young bride wed to an elderly groom, a match meant to bring prestige to the Rostov family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis man tempted you?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders rose and fell. \u201cI let it happen. I wanted it to happen, wanted him. All that youth and unholy beauty. Aleksei\u2019s father told me no lies, made me no false promises. Nonetheless, I fell in love and broke my heart against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen can be careless,\u201d I murmured, thinking of Raphael de Mereliot, thinking of Bao and his Tatar princess.</p><p>\u201cYes, they can.\u201d We regarded each other.</p> <p>\u201cGive my brother whatever he wants,\u201d Valentina said softly. \u201cHe is not given to making idle threats. I don\u2019t know how much time you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you not help me?\u201d I asked. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head from side to side, slow and deliberate. \u201cI am sure of nothing. I have made mistakes. Forgive me, Moirin. God has decreed your person a battleground. I dare not intervene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady Valentina!\u201d I called after her as she made for the door. She paused, raising her brows in inquiry. I smiled at her, a genuine smile. Even though she had refused me, I could not help but pity her. \u201cNot so very old, nor so careworn that I do not see the beauty your young D\u2019Angeline diplomat saw in you. Careless or no, he must have accounted himself a fortunate fellow.\u201d</p><p>Tears shone in her velvet-brown eyes, and she gave a harsh laugh. \u201cI\u2019d rather you weren\u2019t kind.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cThat is your burden to bear.\u201d</p><p>That afternoon, the Patriarch of Riva returned to hear my continuing confession.</p><p>I dreaded it.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want to speak of Jehanne to him. Against all odds, it had become one of the purest and best things in my life.</p><p>He would taint it, of that I was sure.</p><p>He settled into the straight-backed chair, settling his portable writing desk on his lap. His dark eyes gleamed at me, his pen hovering over the virgin pages.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he began in a conversational manner. \u201cTell me of the whore-queen, Jehanne de la Courcel.\u201d</p><p>I held back only what I dared. The Patriarch did not know how early in our acquaintance Jehanne had seduced me\u2014no one did, save the Dowayne of Cereus House. He knew what the rest of the world knew, that Jehanne had stolen me away from Raphael de Mereliot at a dinner party.</p><p>\u201cYou became her.....\u201d He glanced at his notes. \u201cRoyal companion? Tell me of this practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a jest of sorts at first between us,\u201d I said candidly. \u201cI was all wrong for it. A royal companion is meant to be someone older and wiser. Skilled in Naamah\u2019s arts, aye, but willing to offer loyalty above all else.\u201d</p><p>He studied me. \u201cAnd you come from a long line of these..... royal companions, is that not true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My palms were itching and sweating. \u201cThe tradition began with my great-great-grandmother, who served as royal companion to the Dauphine Sidonie. My father served as royal companion to the Duc de Barthelme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d the Patriarch murmured. \u201cIs a royal companion always of the same sex as his master or her mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, yes.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his beard. \u201cVery cunning. So Naamah\u2019s Order seeks to corrupt and debauch the flower of D\u2019Angeline nobility from a youthful age, enticing them into unnatural perversions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I rubbed my palms on my dress. \u201cIt is only because a royal companion is meant to be a friend, and it is easier to forge a friendship with someone of the same sex, especially at a young age. Men and women take different paths to adulthood.\u201d</p><p>Pyotr Rostov scowled. \u201cIt is a pretty argument to hide an ugly, sordid truth.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, unwilling to relent. \u201cMy lord, I have not lied to you. Loyalty is the most important aspect\u2014the ability to give them one person they can trust without fear, one friend who will keep all their confidences. That is the one gift I had to offer Jehanne, and the one gift she accepted from me.\u201d</p><p>He wetted his pen, tapping it on the edge of the inkwell. \u201cBut it was part of your job to service the queen in a sexual manner, was it not?\u201d</p><p>Give my brother whatever he wants.</p><p>He would not listen; he would never listen. These Yeshuites accused me of closing my ears to God, but at least I was trying to understand what they wanted and why. The Patriarch of Riva would never hear aught but what he wanted to believe from my lips. To service, gods! As though anyone in their right mind wouldn\u2019t rejoice at the chance to share Jehanne de la Courcel\u2019s bed, as though anyone could consider it a job, and not an honor and a privilege. It was an ugly, sordid term to describe something lovely.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said wearily, leaning back on my stool and resting my scarf-wrapped head against the wall. \u201cIt was part of my job.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch\u2019s pen skated avidly across the page. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He gestured impatiently at me. \u201cThese are sins against nature, child. You must confess them in full. What acts did you commit?\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cI have heard that D\u2019Angelines sculpt vile semblances of a man\u2019s generative organ through art and artifice. Did you play the man\u2019s role with her? Or did you take turns at it?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, remembering Jehanne in Cereus House, showing me the ivory aide d\u2019amour, cradling it in her palm and promising with a wickedly sweet smile to demonstrate all its uses to me. It had been one of the only times. \u201cNot usually, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you perform unclean acts on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnclean acts?\u201d I opened my eyes.</p><p>The hectic sheen had returned to his gaze. \u201cDid you pleasure her with your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a topic that had arisen before. I wondered if it was because the act of the languisement was less unclean when performed on a man, or if the confession of fornication had sufficed, or if the Patriarch had been saving the accusation for the moment when it would hurt me the most, knowing my grief was still fresh. All three, mayhap. \u201cThat, yes.\u201d</p><p>He muttered to himself in Vralian, recording my confession. \u201cHow many times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany. But it is not listed among the things that God finds an abomination, my lord,\u201d I observed. \u201cWhy is it reckoned unclean?\u201d</p><p>His head jerked up, outrage written on his features. \u201cNeed you ask?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cApparently so.\u201d</p><p>Pyotr Rostov\u2019s face darkened, and he leaned forward in his chair. \u201cGod gave you lips and a tongue that you might give praise to him, Moirin. Not that you might pollute them by placing them where the body\u2019s foulest excrescences emerge. It should be obvious. Is it so hard to understand?\u201d</p><p>I flinched away from him, my chains rattling.</p><p>Give my brother whatever he wants.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t, not this. \u201cYou speak of the very font and wellspring of life, my lord,\u201d I whispered, tears stinging my eyes. \u201cAnd no, I do not understand.\u201d</p><p>My memories blurred.</p><p>There was my lady Jehanne, lying indolent and languid in the bower she\u2019d had created for me, her arms stretched above her head, her thighs parted so I could kneel between them, her pink nether-lips already glistening with desire. She had smiled at me, her eyes sparkling with unremitting delight, the overhanging ferns painting intricate green shadows on her oh so fair skin. And Checheg, grunting and straining in the ger in the throes of labor, the babe Bayar\u2019s head crowning, tearing delicate flesh. It was all part and parcel of the same thing.</p><p>My voice shook. \u201cHow is that not a sacred thing to worship?\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch did not answer, not right away. He sat very still, gazing at me with fixed intensity, until I had to look away. \u201cIt is not your fault that you were born into sin, Moirin,\u201d he said at length. \u201cBut your actions are your own. If you cannot learn to acknowledge them for what they are, I cannot help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am trying!\u201d I said in frustration.</p><p>\u201cNot hard enough.\u201d He took his line of questioning in a different direction. \u201cLet us move forward in time. You spent a great deal of time travelling with the Emperor of Ch\u2019in\u2019s daughter. Did you serve as a royal companion to her?\u201d</p><p>It caught me unaware, and I felt the breath go out of me. Pyotr Rostov\u2019s lids drooped and his lips curved in the beginning of his creamy look, sensing he had landed a blow.</p><p>A cold, hard anger settled over me. He could tell himself whatever he liked, but deep inside, this confession he was forcing from me titillated him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said coolly, watching his creamy look deepen. \u201cI had the honor of serving as her confidante on several occasions.\u201d</p><p>That drove the smirk from his lips. \u201cThat is not what I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is exactly what you asked, my lord,\u201d I retorted. \u201cYou were not listening when I spoke of trust and loyalty.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cYou deny a physical relationship with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysical?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cNot entirely, no. I offered such comfort as she would accept. The princess suffered from night terrors, memories of her bridegroom\u2019s death. When it was very bad, when she would awaken shaking and trembling, sometimes she would let me hold her until she fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch studied me with a hooded gaze. \u201cBut that is not the whole truth, is it, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is!\u201d I protested.</p><p>His lips curled. \u201cDo you think you can lie to me? I am a servant of God, and I hear the lie in your voice. I see it festering on your soul. Tell me, did you debauch the Emperor\u2019s daughter under the guise of giving comfort to her?\u201d</p><p>Gods, I hadn\u2019t been prepared for this. Too much of my life was an open book. I\u2019d known I couldn\u2019t protect my memories of Cillian, of Raphael such as they were, of Jehanne, or Bao when it came his turn. I\u2019d conducted my affairs in far too public a manner.</p><p>But it should have been different with Snow Tiger, my fiercely private and reserved princess.</p><p>What had passed between us in the beginning at the dragon\u2019s insistence, neither of us had chosen\u2014and only Bao knew about it. What had passed between us at the end was another matter altogether. She had blushed to the tips of her ears when she had asked me to invoke Naamah\u2019s blessing for her, charming me beyond words. She knew how deeply she was wounded, but she was proud and it had not been easy for her to ask.</p><p>And Naamah..... Naamah had granted her blessing when I prayed for it, placing words in my mouth that took the fear away, every last bit of it. Snow Tiger had laughed out of sheer wonder\u2014laughed, and kissed me. I had laughed, too, pulling her down atop me.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t willing to give up that memory, either. The Patriarch was merely guessing in his ungodly perceptive way, probing at my vulnerabilities. I couldn\u2019t bear to have him sully it with his vulgar accusations. He didn\u2019t know. No one knew, except mayhap a few discreet servants who loved their mistress too well to gossip. I had gladly given the princess every ounce of pleasure I had to offer, gladly accepted it in return, delighting in the healing she found in it, delighting in her.</p><p>But I had not sought it out.</p><p>And I hated the Patriarch for trying to make it something vile. He awaited my answer with infernal patience.</p><p>I remembered how the fallen spirits had tricked the Circle of Shalomon over and over, finding loopholes in the commandments given them even as they obeyed to the letter, and I parsed my words with care.</p><p>\u201cYou are asking if I seduced her, and the answer is no.\u201d I met his gaze steadily, my anger a cold blaze within me. \u201cDo you need to hear truth in my voice, my lord? Very well, I will swear to it.\u201d I uttered the sacred oath of the Maghuin Dhonn, each word precise. \u201cBy stone and sea and sky, and all that they encompass, by the sacred troth that binds me to my diadh-anam, I swear I did not seduce the Emperor\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>My chains shivered, the sigils and inscriptions etched on them flaring briefly. This time, it was the Patriarch who flinched.</p><p>\u201cWitch!\u201d he hissed.</p><p>The spark of my diadh-anam was undiminished. Although I had pared it to the bone, I had spoken the truth. \u201cIt is the sacred oath of my people,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cThe one Berlik the Cursed broke. I do not swear it lightly.\u201d</p><p>Pyotr Rostov mastered his unease, resuming his study of me. \u201cAnd yet you are angry,\u201d he observed. \u201cAngrier than the question warrants. Even under oath, you withhold the greater truth.\u201d His creamy look returned. \u201cYou say you did not seduce the princess, but you do not deny making the attempt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked away, willing him to believe it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded to himself in satisfaction. \u201cI think it is so, child. You tried and failed. Is it not so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust you humiliate me as well?\u201d I muttered.</p> <p>\u201cIt is for the good of your soul,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cYou must confess it.\u201d</p><p>It seemed I could lie to the Patriarch after all\u2014so long as it was a lie he already wished to believe.</p><p>I let my shoulders slump. \u201cYes, my lord,\u201d I lied in a defeated whisper. \u201cIn the small hours of the night, when she was lonely and frightened, I sought to entice the Emperor\u2019s daughter. I failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, very good.\u201d His pen skated over the page. \u201cThe Ch\u2019in are a heathen folk, but they have a great respect for custom and propriety,\u201d he said in an absent tone. \u201cTake heed from the lesson of the Emperor\u2019s daughter, Moirin. The temptations of the flesh can be resisted. All it takes is discipline.\u201d</p><p>I bowed my head. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>W hen Aleksei came to read to me the following morning, he was moving stiffly, as though he were in pain.</p><p>I eyed him. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Predictably, he flushed. \u201cNo..... no!\u201d He shrank away from me as I ignored his protestations, stooping beside the stiff-backed chair and unlacing the ties of his linen shirt, peeling back the lapels. \u201cMoirin, please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>I did, though. I caught a glimpse of the garment he wore beneath the outer layer of his clothing, a crude goat\u2019s-hair vest.</p><p>My nostrils flared. \u201cStone and sea!\u201d I gagged. \u201cAleksei, this thing is crawling with lice. How is that not unclean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helps me ignore the distraction of temptation.\u201d He pulled away from me, lacing his shirt. \u201cEven the lowest of the low is part of God\u2019s creation, and may serve his purpose. Do you not see the beauty in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yesterday\u2019s anger lingered in me. I paced my cell, taking precise, mincing steps. \u201cNo, Aleksei. I do not. I am sick unto death of hearing about your God and his everlasting fascination with things he has decided are abominations. Apparently, that includes everything in my life I have ever done that brought me joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalse joy,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I rounded on him. \u201cHow in the name of all the gods would you know? Filled with abject terror as you are?\u201d</p><p>He shuddered away from me.</p><p>That, and the sight of that crude, stinking vest seething with lice, broke something inside me.</p> <p>I sank to my heels, covering my face with my hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d I forced myself to breathe slowly, fighting a losing battle with tears.</p><p>Aleksei hovered anxiously in front of me, undone by my tears. \u201cDon\u2019t cry! Moirin, please.\u201d Greatly daring, he knelt and held out his hands. \u201cCome, pray with me. It will help, I promise.\u201d</p><p>His glorious blue eyes were filled with genuine pity and compassion. Unlike his uncle, I\u2019d never seen anything less in him. I took one of his hands in mine, rubbing at my tears with the other.</p><p>His breathing quickened, and his long fingers stirred in mine. I stroked them gently. \u201cSweet boy, do you know what I see when I look at you?\u201d I whispered. He shook his head, tawny locks shining in the sunlight that slanted through my narrow window. \u201cI see a bird raised in captivity, taught that his wings were a curse and flight a sin. A beautiful bird taught from birth to love his cage and fear the open sky.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei\u2019s lips parted. \u201cYou must not say such things!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d I lifted my free hand, chains dangling. \u201cYour uncle has clipped my wings. But he will not be content until he has broken every bone in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true!\u201d He wrenched himself away from me, fumbling back toward the chair for his book. \u201cI will read to you. Only..... be still, and listen. I keep telling you, you must open your heart and listen, Moirin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have listened,\u201d I said wearily. \u201cAnd yes, there are moments of glory and wonder in your tales. Yes, your Yeshua sounds like a decent fellow for a god, filled with love and kindness toward mankind. But there are also great, long boring bits about the genealogy of the Habiru, which holds little interest for me, and there are tales that make no sense at all, and other parts that are simply harsh and cruel.\u201d</p><p>He looked aghast. \u201cOnly because you do not understand them yet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo, I think I am beginning to understand. These scriptures, they were written by mortal men. And mayhap some of them were moved by divine grace, but others were petty, jealous fellows moved by the ordinary concerns of everyday life, like being cuckolded by a straying wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you throw my mother\u2019s sin in my face?\u201d For the first time, he sounded angry. \u201cI have spent my life trying to atone for it!\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose your D\u2019Angelines would not reckon it a sin,\u201d Aleksei said bitterly. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s just fine for a woman to betray her husband, to give a man a bastard son and expect him to call it his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d That brought him up short. \u201cFor all her infidelities, my lady Jehanne knew full well that was the one betrayal the King would not tolerate. But unlike your mother, I suspect, she loved her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cruel blow,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cIt is. And yet if your mother had been allowed to wed for love instead of prestige, would she have strayed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019Angelines do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany, aye. Within their culture, it is permitted. Blessed Elua allows what God and Yeshua forbid.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cAnd it is possible to love more than one person.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei swallowed hard, the words evoking a yearning in him that he could not hide. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>I held his gaze. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gods, I could almost taste the ache of desire in him! And not only for sex, no. He was Naamah\u2019s child, as surely as I was. His poor, caged spirit longed to love freely. To share Naamah\u2019s gift within him, to delight in pleasures ranging from the sheer carnal bliss of pleasure to all of love\u2019s myriad tendernesses. Oh, he hungered for it so.</p><p>He turned away, his shoulders hunched. \u201cI will read to you.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cAs you will.\u201d</p><p>Later that day, the Patriarch returned with his hateful desk and his hateful quill to resume the hateful process of hearing my confession.</p><p>\u201cSo, Moirin,\u201d he said when he had everything in readiness, pen poised above his account of my sins. \u201cLet us speak of this young Tatar prince.\u201d</p><p>I almost laughed, picturing Bao\u2019s insolent grin at hearing himself described thusly. \u201cBao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBao, yes.\u201d Pyotr Rostov frowned. \u201cI must confess, I am confused. Is he Ch\u2019in or Tatar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d I said. \u201cHis mother was a Ch\u2019in woman, ravaged by a raiding Tatar warlord. Although to be fair,\u201d I added, \u201cBao\u2019s father sought to avenge the loss of his own wife, taken by the Ch\u2019in. It is a complicated matter.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me. \u201cAnd this Bao, who is the Great Khan\u2019s son-in-law, is also the companion of the physician Lo Feng?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou travelled from Terre d\u2019Ange to Ch\u2019in in his company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Although I had dreaded this moment, too, now that it had arrived, it was not as awful as I had feared. It was different from the others. My diadh-anam shone within me, a reminder that there was a powerful magic about the bond between Bao and me that not even Pyotr Rostov could sully. And, too, the thought of Bao\u2019s cocky grin made me smile inwardly. I could guess what he would say if he knew, could almost hear the cheerful cynicism in his voice. Tell the stunted old pervert whatever he wants to hear, Moirin, and I will bash his head in when I have the chance. \u201cDo you want to hear about the fornication and unclean acts?\u201d I asked politely. \u201cIt was a very long journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh..... yes, of course.\u201d The Patriarch glanced at his notes. \u201cFor the moment, let us take it as a given fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Bao, I thought, would be obscurely disappointed. He was proud of his prowess in bed\u2014and rightfully so. As usual, he made good on his boasts.</p><p>Rostov gave me a sharp look. \u201cBrother Ilya gathered extraordinary reports from the Tatar gathering. It seems that you claimed that this young man, this Bao, died and was restored to life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cSo he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not exactly.\u201d My moment of private mirth faded. This was another trap I hadn\u2019t seen coming, one I didn\u2019t begin to understand. Gods, it seemed there was an unintended sin lying in wait around every corner of my life! Once again, my palms were sweating. \u201cIt was Master Lo Feng\u2019s doing. He was grieving. He gave his life to restore Bao\u2019s, and required my magic and half my diadh-anam to do it, although I did not know what he was asking at the time.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cAnd if you are asking me to tell you how it was done, I cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am asking nothing.\u201d The Patriarch\u2019s expression had gone stony. \u201cI am telling you it cannot have been done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was,\u201d I said, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He raised one finger. \u201cOnly Yeshua ben Yosef rose from the dead, and lived. No other. You are mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not claim to explain it, my lord,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I assure you, Bao was dead. I felt for a pulse myself. There was none.\u201d</p><p>His face was implacable. \u201cYou are mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor over an hour!\u201d I shook my head again. \u201cNo. I tried to suck the poison from his flesh, tried to breathe life into his lungs. Bao died, and lived. Believe me, my lord, he was none too happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are mistaken.\u201d</p><p>Why it mattered to him so deeply, I could not begin to guess; I could only see that it did. He demanded truth from me, but only when it agreed with his beliefs, and I did not understand the intricacies of his faith. All I knew was that I would not win this argument; I would never win this argument or any argument with the Patriarch of Riva.</p><p>Never, ever, ever.</p><p>There are ways and ways of betraying memory, of betraying the truth. I hadn\u2019t expected this one. In my mind\u2019s eye, I saw the amusement fade from Bao\u2019s face. The fierce determination and stubborn pride lingered. Bao would not care what lie I told, what truth I betrayed, so long as I lived.</p><p>Tell the stunted old pervert what he wants to hear.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cMayhap..... mayhap I was mistaken. Mayhap I let my fear master me. And Bao was never dead, only stunned.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch smiled his creamy smile, his eyelids drooping with satisfaction. \u201cYes. Yes, indeed. Good girl.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>I had begun to think the hellish cycle of confession would never end, but the next day, the Patriarch surprised me.</p><p>He came in the morning, instead of the afternoon as he was usually wont to do. I wondered if it meant Aleksei would not be reading to me anymore, but I was reluctant to ask, wary of showing too much interest in the lad. I hoped I hadn\u2019t driven him into a full-blown retreat the other day.</p><p>I had to own, it galled me that I\u2019d had so little success seducing a young man at the apex of his transition to adulthood, a young man so desperately starved for love. I\u2019d lain awake for hours berating myself for it, convinced that a skilled adept like Jehanne would have had Aleksei eating out of the palm of her hand in a matter of minutes.</p><p>Then I would remember the lice, and think again.</p><p>I\u2019d known it wouldn\u2019t be an easy task, but I was still struggling to grasp the scope of the damage done to him. It wasn\u2019t just the deeply ingrained strictures of his faith. Aleksei had been raised his entire life to believe he was the product of his mother\u2019s sinful downfall, tainted with a foul curse. He was determined to redeem them both through this trial\u2014and, I sensed, to redeem me, too.</p><p>I was no mere mortal temptation, oh, no. As Valentina had said, God had decreed my person a battleground.</p><p>Stone and sea, it surely felt that way.</p><p>For two hours, I endured another assault as the Patriarch questioned me, exhuming another batch of sins and false beliefs.</p><p>First, it was the dragon.</p><p>Pyotr Rostov was convinced it was a demon that had possessed the princess. I could not entirely blame him, since everyone in Ch\u2019in had believed it, too, including Snow Tiger herself. She had only believed otherwise when I had summoned the twilight and shown her the dragon\u2019s reflection in the mirror.</p><p>I could still see the wonder on her face.</p><p>The rest of Ch\u2019in had come to believe after we succeeded in freeing the dragon, when he came arrowing through the skies over White Jade Mountain, silver coils shimmering, calling down rain and lightning.</p><p>Pyotr Rostov refused to believe, refused to accept the dragon\u2019s nature as a celestial being of elemental magic. No, nothing would do but that it was a fallen spirit bent on wreaking havoc and harm in the world.</p><p>\u201cYou said yourself that the fallen ones took strange and fantastic forms, Moirin,\u201d he pointed out to me. \u201cThat they liked speaking to you, that at least one wielded power over the elements. Can you not see that this is exactly the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not, my lord.\u201d I turned the jade bangle on my wrist, agitated. \u201cThe dragon is a creature of his place. He wanted nothing more than to drowse on the peaks of White Jade Mountain, gazing at his reflection and guarding his pearl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd yet he caused the Emperor\u2019s daughter to tear her bridegroom from limb to limb,\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>\u201cHe awoke trapped in her flesh! He was in a blind panic. It drove him mad not to be able to see himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou excuse the deed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! Of course not. I understand it, which is not the same. When the dragon understood what he had done, when he understood what had befallen him, he regretted it very deeply.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch shook his head with sorrow. \u201cChild, have you learned nothing from your experience yet? Nothing of the lies unclean spirits will offer to tempt you? You of all people should know better.\u201d</p><p>Around and around we went. I was fighting another losing battle, and I knew it. In the end, I would acquiesce. I was alone and scared, and I did not want to be stoned to death. I would betray the dragon\u2019s memory as surely as I had betrayed Cillian\u2019s, Jehanne\u2019s, Bao\u2019s..... even Raphael\u2019s, as much as he deserved it. Unless one counted the coach-driver, Snow Tiger\u2019s memory was the only one I\u2019d been able to protect. I couldn\u2019t save the dragon\u2019s.</p><p>But I would not surrender without a fight.</p><p>During the long, losing argument, I thought about a woman I had known in the City of Elua, Lianne Tremaine, the King\u2019s Poet. She was the youngest ever to have been appointed to that post.</p> <p>And she was good, very good. I heard her recite a poem about a man mourning the death of his beloved. It had moved everyone in the room to tears, including me.</p><p>Even so, she had been a member of the Circle of Shalomon, longing for gifts the spirits they summoned could bestow. When I asked her what more a poet of her stature could possibly want, she had replied that there were always further thresholds to cross.</p><p>I seek words of such surpassing beauty that they might melt the hardest heart of stone, she had said to me.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t understood the hunger at the time, but I was beginning to. If one of those fallen spirits had appeared in my cell and offered to gift my tongue with words that would melt the Patriarch\u2019s heart, I would have accepted it in a heartbeat and damned the consequences.</p><p>Of course, the King\u2019s Poet had been driven by excessive ambition, not fear and desperation. Still, I did not think this business of forcing me to betray my fondest memories was teaching me to resist the temptation to sin.</p><p>Quite the opposite, in fact.</p> <p>When I saw the Patriarch\u2019s face begin to darken with frustration and impatience flickering in his eyes, I gave up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lord,\u201d I whispered, bowing my head and gazing at the translucent jade bangle, apologizing in my heart to the dragon above his reflecting pool. \u201cI do not mean to be so stubborn. It is only..... it is hard to admit one has been so foolish as to be taken in by the same lies twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done, child.\u201d Leaning over his portable desk, Pyotr Rostov reached out and lifted my chin. At least he didn\u2019t have his creamy look. Apparently, the confession of sins that didn\u2019t involve fornication, unclean acts, or blaspheming against Yeshua weren\u2019t quite as delectable. \u201cRemember, pride is also a sin.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Having stripped that away from me and besmirched it to his satisfaction, he moved on to further acts of iniquity on my part\u2014namely, my role as Emperor Zhu\u2019s jade-eyed witch, the Imperial swallower-of-memories.</p><p>It was a gift of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, the ability to take away memories.</p><p>Among my folk, it had a purpose. It hid the hollow hill and the stone doorway that I had passed through after Cillian\u2019s death, that Bao had seen in his dreams since he\u2019d held half of my diadh-anam. Those of us whom the Maghuin Dhonn Herself acknowledged as Her own kept the secret of Her sacred place. Those She did not accept surrendered it, giving unto the keeping of Old Nemed, who was the only one of us to wield that particular gift until I had discovered it within myself at a time of extreme need.</p><p>It worked only if the memory was offered freely and willingly. Old Nemed had said no one the Maghuin Dhonn Herself did not acknowledge ever, ever failed to consent to have her take their memory.</p> <p>I believed it.</p><p>The memories I had taken in Ch\u2019in were those of every soldier, engineer, and alchemist with knowledge of the workings of the Divine Thunder, those terrible bronze tubes and fire-powder that belched foul smoke and spat death across an impossible distance. I had seen firsthand the horrible carnage they wrought on the battlefield.</p><p>Tortoise.....</p><p>Tortoise had been one of the stick-fighters who had accompanied us, a member of Bao\u2019s old gang of thugs and ruffians. For all that, he\u2019d been a loyal companion with a generous heart, the first to pledge himself to the quest to free the dragon and the princess. In my last memory of him, he had been hurrying across the battlefield to aid me, jouncing in the saddle, his homely face determined.</p><p>And then the Divine Thunder had boomed, and Tortoise was no longer there. There was only a smoldering crater with his unrecognizable remains.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it, Moirin?\u201d the Patriarch asked in a gentle tone. Lost in my reverie, I looked blankly at him. \u201cWhy did you use witchcraft to steal men\u2019s memories on the Emperor\u2019s behalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.....\u201d I rubbed my hands over my face, remembering the acrid taste of sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal permeating my awareness. Too weary to argue, I tried a different tack. \u201cIs that what folk are saying? I fear it is but a fanciful tale spread by the Emperor\u2019s men to explain his clemency.\u201d</p><p>Pyotr Rostov regarded me in silence.</p><p>Beneath my head-scarf, sweat gathered along my brow. \u201cSurely you do not believe me capable of such a dire thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said soberly. \u201cMake no mistake, Moirin. I do not underestimate your foul magics, bound though they may be.\u201d His voice took on an edge. \u201cDo you think I do not know your folk have the ability to cloud men\u2019s minds? Your ancestor Berlik swayed the thoughts of Rebbe Avraham ben David, a great and devout leader, one of the greatest thinkers of his day; swayed him from the path of righteousness and discipline to a soft-minded tolerance of sin. By what dire magic was that done?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNone that I know of, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are lying again.\u201d A note of sorrow returned to his voice. \u201cAh, Moirin! God cannot save you if you will not let me help you.\u201d Behind his veneer of compassion, the threat of stoning lurked. He dipped his pen in the inkwell. \u201cNow, why did you use witchcraft to steal men\u2019s memories?\u201d</p><p>My eyes stung with defeat. \u201cI did not steal them, my lord. Every single one was offered to me.\u201d</p><p>That made him pause. \u201cBut you did not have to take them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cBut if I had not, the Emperor would have put to death every man with knowledge of the Divine Thunder\u2019s workings. It was an act of mercy on his part to allow me to take their memories instead.\u201d</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>\u201cThat was the choice, my lord,\u201d I added. \u201cYou will have to explain to me how what I did was a sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was witchcraft,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cAye, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.....\u201d Pyotr Rostov sighed. \u201cOh, child! I do not deny that this was a very difficult choice. But the choice Emperor Zhu laid upon you was a false one, based on a false premise.\u201d He steepled his fingers. \u201cHe did not have to kill those men, did he? That was his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but\u2014\u201d My voice faltered. How could I make him understand that the weapons of the Divine Thunder had been that terrible? That it was worth almost any cost to suppress that knowledge, even the cost of innocent lives? Although I lacked a poet\u2019s words, I had glimpsed a future more dreadful than I could begin to articulate. The smoking crater that housed Tortoise\u2019s remains was only the beginning. It led to a far, far worse place.</p><p>\u201cYou took this sin upon your head that the Emperor\u2019s hands might remain clean,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cIt is enough that you repent of it.\u201d</p><p>I bowed my head. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cYes, my lord?\u201d</p><p>His fingers were still steepled. \u201cUnderstand, child. The scripture is very clear in places. In the earliest writings, it tells us that we must not allow a witch to live.\u201d His velvet-brown eyes were warm and earnest. \u201cBased on what you have confessed from the first day to the last, I would be justified in putting you to death. But I believe that God\u2019s grace is truly infinite, and even one such as you should be given the chance to repent. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I shivered involuntarily, huddled on my stool, my chains rattling. \u201cI am trying. I am always trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pyotr Rostov smiled at me. \u201cMostly, you are still trying to defy me, still trying to find some way to escape. I know. But God and I have not given up on you, Moirin. Here and there, we catch glimpses of the truth, and it is the truth that will free you in the end.\u201d He paused, contemplating me. \u201cHave you anything left to confess?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He put away his things, straightened his papers, and corked his inkwell. He stood and laid a hand on my scarf-wrapped head. \u201cMy child, you have made your confession to me. I, a mortal man and a lowly sinner myself, do not have the power to absolve you. This, only God can do. These sins you have confessed to me, and any you may have neglected, either through ignorance or forgetfulness, may God forgive you for them, in this world and the next.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if I was supposed to feel any different. I didn\u2019t feel much of anything, except a vague sense of relief that the process of confession appeared to have reached an end, and apprehension about what came next.</p><p>The latter was well placed.</p><p>The Patriarch removed his hand from my head. \u201cI am satisfied with your progress, Moirin. I am willing to pronounce you ready for the next stage of your penance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d My heart sank. \u201cWhat is that, my lord?\u201d</p><p>He gave me another smile. \u201cCome, and see.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>For the first time in days, I was allowed to leave my cell.</p><p>That was the one good thing about this second stage of my penance. To be sure, it was the only good thing about it.</p><p>Pyotr Rostov led me through the modest living quarters back to the temple where I had first arrived, passing through a curtained doorway in an alcove behind what I would later learn was a stand for chanters during the liturgy.</p><p>We entered the temple proper. Yeshua ben Yosef was there in the presence of the immense mosaic on the wall, holding the world cupped in his hand, looking stern and imposing and not at all like the kind fellow from Aleksei\u2019s readings. That Yeshua had prevented an adulterous woman from being stoned. This one looked like he would give the order himself, and look on with an impassive gaze.</p><p>The Patriarch\u2019s wife, Luba, was there waiting for us at the foot of the altar, a wooden bucket on the floor beside her. They exchanged a few words in Vralian.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Rostov said, switching back to D\u2019Angeline for my benefit. \u201cNow, Moirin. It is important that you understand this is not a punishment. To do penance is to seek redemption, to purge one\u2019s sins. It is a time to reflect and meditate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d I said obediently when he paused.</p><p>Luba\u2019s upper lip curled. A few times, she had brought food to me; otherwise, I\u2019d seen very little of her since I\u2019d been brought here, and I suspected that was by her choice. On no occasion had she spoken a single word to me. But although she did not like me and did not want me here, based on their interactions, I was certain she would sooner cut out her tongue than defy her husband.</p><p>\u201cAs an act of penance, you will wash the floor,\u201d the Patriarch said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d I relaxed a bit. No doubt he thought it was a fitting humiliation for the descendant of three royal houses, but I had been raised in a cave in the Alban wilderness. From the time I was old enough to hold a broom, I\u2019d swept our hearth every day. I wasn\u2019t afraid of hard work, nor did I think it beneath me.</p><p>I glanced at the bucket, looking for a mop.</p><p>With a satisfied look on her face, Luba held out a very, very small scrub-brush.</p><p>\u201cYou see the squares, Moirin?\u201d Her husband pointed at the floor. Until this moment, I hadn\u2019t bothered to take it in. The floor was also a mosaic, this one formed of pebbles in contrasting hues. The pattern was an abstract one of small squares, each one a box containing a flared cross.</p><p>Any sense of relief I had vanished. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn your knees, you will scrub each one in order,\u201d he said, pacing to the far right of the altar. \u201cBeginning here.\u201d He raised a finger in caution. \u201cYou are not to touch the altar, or anything on it. You are not to venture past it into the sanctuary. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a punishment,\u201d the Patriarch repeated. \u201cIt is an opportunity. Focus your thoughts on each square. Contemplate the sign of the cross, that vile instrument on which Yeshua suffered for your sake. Think upon his suffering. Think upon your sins, and beg his forgiveness. Will you do this?\u201d</p><p>As if I had a choice. \u201cYes, my lord,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d He said my name sharply. I looked reluctantly at him. \u201cOver each square, you will utter this prayer. \u2018Yeshua the Anointed, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u2019 Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeshua the Anointed, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner,\u201d I echoed.</p><p>He spoke to his wife in Vralian, then addressed me in D\u2019Angeline. \u201cVery good. Say it again.\u201d</p><p>I repeated it, while Luba listened intently.</p><p>The Patriarch nodded in satisfaction. \u201cShe will be listening to make sure you do not err.\u201d His face softened. \u201cI know you do not mean the words, not yet. But repetition is a powerful tool. If you say a thing often enough, it may become true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I blew out my breath, glancing over the vast expanse of squares and crosses. \u201cDo you expect me to finish it today, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cI do not think that is humanly possible. But it matters not when you finish, for you can always begin again.\u201d</p><p>Helpless tears stung my eyes, and I bit the inside of my cheek to try to keep the tears from spilling. I didn\u2019t want him to see.</p> <p>He knew, anyway. \u201cGod\u2019s work is endless, Moirin,\u201d he said, and took his leave.</p><p>Luba handed me the scrub-brush and addressed me for the first time, pointing toward the corner and speaking three curt words in Vralian. They didn\u2019t need translating.</p><p>Get to work.</p><p>Scrub-brush in hand, I hauled the wooden bucket to the far right of the altar and knelt on the pebbled floor, my chains clanking and rattling around me.</p><p>It hurt; of course it hurt. If the mosaic floor had been comprised of smooth bits of tile like the one on the wall, it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad. But the inlaid pebbles were raised, digging into my knees. Right now, the pain was a minor annoyance. Over the course of hours, or gods, days, it would grow much, much worse. Gritting my teeth, I contemplated the first square. It was a bit larger than the palm of my hand, mayhap four inches by four.</p> <p>It was the first of more than I could count.</p><p>Hovering behind me, Luba repeated her curt Vralian injunction. I dipped the brush into the bucket, into cold water that smelled strongly of lye. Water sloshed onto the floor as I withdrew the brush, scrubbing the pebbles.</p><p>\u201cYeshua the Anointed,\u201d I said grimly, \u201cSon of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u201d</p><p>I moved the brush to the adjacent square. Luba made a disapproving sound, leaning over to tap the bucket, indicating that I was to dip the brush anew.</p><p>I sat back on my heels. \u201cEvery single bedamned square?\u201d I pointed, miming. \u201cEach and every one?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and tapped the bucket again.</p> <p>I eyed her, remembering the fantasies of violent escape I had entertained on my journey here. We were alone in the temple together. If I rose right now and wrapped my chains around Luba\u2019s neck, throttling her, there was no one to stop me. I was young and strong, and I was fairly confident I could overpower her.</p><p>And go..... where?</p><p>Alarmed by the unspoken menace in my face, Luba retreated a few cautious steps, fixing me with a seething gaze. She pointed toward the temple doors far behind us, interlacing her fingers with a sharp gesture. She pointed at my chains, and mimed rattling them, mimed stones being thrown. She shook her head slowly at me, pointing at the bucket and the floor.</p><p>In the Tatar lands, I had come to recognize how easily two people of like minds could converse without a common tongue. Checheg with her gentle, unremitting kindness and hospitality had taught it to me, long before I had mastered the rudiments of her language.</p><p>This was the other side of the coin.</p><p>And I understood it full well. The meaning of Luba\u2019s gestures was clear. The temple doors were locked, inside and out. Even if I could escape, my chains marked me as a witch, singled out for death in eastern Vralia.</p><p>Here, I would be stoned.</p><p>I dipped my brush into the harsh lye and scrubbed at the second square, intoning the prayer the Patriarch had taught me.</p> <p>\u201cYeshua the Anointed, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u201d</p><p>Again.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Again.</p><p>I kept count during that first row. There were one hundred and fifty squares in it. Each and every one, I scoured. Over each and every one, I uttered the same prayer.</p><p>I reached the end of one row, moved on to the second one. The temple was at least twice as long as it was wide, which meant there were at least three hundred rows. I was no mathematician, but by my calculation, that meant I had some forty-five thousand squares in total.</p><p>I drew a long, shaking breath, trying once more not to weep.</p><p>Luba smirked.</p><p>I shuffled on my bruised, aching knees, bowing my head to the task. I was sweating and itchy beneath the coarse woolen dress. My back began to ache from bending. The words of the prayer began to blend together into one long stream of meaningless syllables.</p><p>Yeshuatheanointedsonofgodhavemercyonmeasinner.</p><p>Although she did not speak D\u2019Angeline, Luba had a good ear. When my prayer degenerated into an inarticulate mumble, she tapped me on the shoulder and made a gesture with both hands as though stretching a rope, telling me without words to slow down and do a proper job of it.</p><p>\u201cYeshua the Anointed, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner,\u201d I said with fierce precision, dipping and scrubbing. \u201cYeshua the Anointed, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u201d</p><p>The only small mercy that Yeshua the Anointed saw fit to grant me was that by the time I had finished the second row, Valentina came to replace Luba on sentinel duty. Her, at least, I could bear.</p><p>And she did not badger me when I paused to wipe my sleeve over my sweating brow and stretch my aching back. My spine made unpleasant crackling sounds. I shifted on my sore knees, trying to find a position in which the pebbles didn\u2019t dig into my flesh so.</p><p>\u201cHe assigned me this penance, too,\u201d Valentina said in a low voice. \u201cFor sins committed with Aleksei\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find redemption in it?\u201d I asked wearily.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said simply. I gave her a sharp look, and for once she did not look away. \u201cThere is peace to be found in surrendering to God\u2019s will and begging his forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cFor his children, mayhap. I am not one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are all God\u2019s children,\u201d she replied.</p><p>I smiled bitterly. \u201cTell that to the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, who claimed me as Her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she, then?\u201d Valentina gestured around. \u201cYou are here in the temple of God and his son Yeshua, Moirin. Where is your bear-god? Where is your D\u2019Angeline whore-goddess Naamah? They have abandoned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I touched my chest. \u201cPerhaps they cannot find me, with my spirit shrouded in chains and charms. But I carry the divine spark of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself within me. I carry Naamah\u2019s gifts in my blood. So long as that is true, I do not believe they have abandoned me.\u201d</p><p>There was sympathy in her gaze. \u201cIt would be better for you if you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I picked up the brush, dipped it in the bucket, and began scrubbing anew. \u201cYeshua the Anointed, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u201d</p><p>I had completed a grand total of four rows when Valentina bade me stop\u2014not out of any sense of pity, but because it was time to prepare the temple for the afternoon liturgy.</p><p>I got gratefully to my feet, pain shooting through my abused knees and stiff, aching back. I felt a hundred years old. \u201cDoes it get any easier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d assumed as much. I wiped my tired, stinging hands on the woolen dress. I stank of lye and sweat. \u201cMy lady, is it possible to have a bath?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI do not ask with an eye toward seducing your son, who seems to be avoiding me anyway.\u201d Even my voice was tired, my throat raw from endless prayer. \u201cI\u2019ve been chained in the same garment for many days. Whatever else you may think of me, I do not like being unclean.\u201d</p><p>For a mercy, another small mercy, Valentina relented. She even let me scour myself, although I suspected it was due to a reluctance to get anywhere close to touching my skin. I could feel the tension in her haste as she sewed me into a fresh, sack-shaped woolen dress just as drab, prickly, and hateful as the first one.</p><p>Still, it was something.</p><p>My soul might be black with sin, but my flesh was clean.</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>I was wrong about Aleksei.</p><p>To my surprise, he came in the early evening to read to me. I hadn\u2019t expected him, and I was in a morbidly foul mood. My entire body was sore and aching. In something like three hours of scrubbing, I\u2019d gotten through four rows.</p><p>If my rough calculation was remotely accurate, that left at least two hundred and ninety-six to go.</p><p>And then I could start over.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother rising from the narrow bed where I had flung myself, greeting Aleksei with silence and a sullen glare.</p><p>It took him aback. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asked in a cool tone. \u201cHave you ever knelt on that bedamned floor?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes were wide and earnest. \u201cMany times, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor three hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He flushed a little, looking away from me in that skittish way. \u201cMoirin..... your head is bare.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t put on the head-scarf when I heard the key in the lock, expecting Valentina or Luba. \u201cOh, for the love of all the gods! My hair is cropped like a twelve-year-old boy\u2019s. How tempting can it be?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei shivered. \u201cIt\u2019s..... very shiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clean,\u201d I said rudely.</p><p>\u201cAnd soft-looking,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I hauled myself upright, tilting my head. My hair fell forward in a short, glossy curtain. \u201cYou may be interested to learn that there is an act of love in Terre d\u2019Ange called Winding the Spindle,\u201d I said in a conversational tone. \u201cOne twines one\u2019s hair around a man\u2019s erect phallus, then pulls it away slowly. To be done properly, it is done without using one\u2019s hands, only swirling one\u2019s head gently around the phallus.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me in shock. I\u2019d never spoken to him thusly before.</p><p>\u201cMy lady Jehanne says that the technique is a tricky one,\u201d I said sweetly. \u201cBut she assures me that men find the sensation subtle and exquisite, and the sight most provocative. I fear it will be some time before I\u2019m able to attempt it, since your aunt Luba saw fit to shear me like a sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d Aleksei\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cWhy are you saying such things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d I raised my brows. \u201cYour uncle does. Nothing brings him greater pleasure than hearing me confess to unclean acts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it is.\u201d I gave him a pointed look. \u201cDo you think I cannot tell when a man is aroused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI..... yes. No.\u201d His chest rose and fell as he took a deep breath, struggling for self-control. \u201cYou\u2019re being cruel, Moirin. That\u2019s unlike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I rattled my chains with a theatrical gesture. \u201cToday, I entertained the notion of throttling your aunt. A wolf in the wild will leave you alone. If you capture it and put it in chains, do not be surprised when it tries to bite your hand off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not you,\u201d Aleksei said stubbornly. \u201cIt is only Naamah\u2019s curse talking, trying to sway me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no curse!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>He ignored me, pulling up the stool. \u201cI will read to you. What would you like to hear today? I\u2019ll let you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d I sighed, losing my will to antagonize him. \u201cDo you know, the Maghuin Dhonn have no written language?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause knowledge is a living thing.\u201d I leaned against the wall of my cell, rubbing my sore knees. \u201cI knew the name of every plant and tree that grew in our woods. I knew which were good to eat, which were good for other purposes, which were to be avoided. I knew when they came into season, and how to recognize signs of rot or taint. I knew the habits of every creature that shared our woods, how to track and hunt them, or merely to spy on them with delight, like a fox playing with her kits. It is a living knowledge that changes with the seasons. The whole of it could never have been confined to writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a written record could be a useful tool, could it not?\u201d Aleksei asked with genuine curiosity.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYes and no. When I first learned such a thing as writing existed, I thought it a fine kind of magic. But folk come to rely on the record, and ignore the living truth before their eyes.\u201d I pointed at the book in his hands. \u201cWhat happens when there are errors in the record?\u201d</p><p>His color rose. \u201cNow you are baiting me again. Come, Moirin. If you won\u2019t choose, I will.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cRead what you like, Aleksei. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m tired. I hate this place. I hate your uncle. I hate your aunt. I hate your mean-spirited God and his precious son Yeshua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, I do.\u201d I shrugged again. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I? Everything I am is hateful to them.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei was silent long enough that I opened my eyes again and glanced at him. He wore an uncertain look that gave way to one of determination. \u201cWait,\u201d he said to me, getting to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Since I had no choice, I waited.</p><p>He left and returned a few moments later with another book in his hands\u2014a different one, a slender volume.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He presented it to me.</p><p>I glanced at it without interest. The title was etched on the leather binding in the Vralian alphabet. \u201cI cannot read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it says it is.\u201d Aleksei hunkered on the stool, watching me with a grave look. \u201cInside, it\u2019s written in D\u2019Angeline script. You..... ah, can you read your native tongue, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I scowled a bit. \u201cI am no scholar like Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay, who could likely recite your bedamned scriptures to you backward and forward in the original Habiru, but I can read. And D\u2019Angeline is not my native tongue, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He flushed. \u201cWho is Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe D\u2019Angeline courtesan who sought out and found the Name of God? You don\u2019t know that story?\u201d I asked. He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll have to tell it to you,\u201d I said absently, opening the book he had given me. \u201cAmong other things, it suggests that perhaps you do not know your God as well as you think.\u201d I glanced at the inner title page. \u201cThis is the priest\u2019s book about Berlik.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aleksei murmured. \u201cI took it from my mother\u2019s hiding place.\u201d</p><p>I was intrigued, especially given the Patriarch\u2019s aversion to the book. \u201cYou said you found it dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Although his rangy, long-limbed figure was hunched and awkward, his blue gaze was clear and steady. \u201cBut..... I think what you are feeling now is dangerous, too. You are giving in to hatred and anger, straying farther and farther from grace. And though I am loath to question my uncle\u2019s judgment in any way, I do not think he understands your need for, um.....\u201d His voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cLove.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove,\u201d I echoed.</p><p>Aleksei nodded. \u201cThe Rebbe Avraham ben David found much to love in your people, Moirin. Both in the magician Berlik and the D\u2019Angeline prince Imriel who delivered him into martyrdom. I hope..... I hope that perhaps his words will find a path to your heart, and you will allow yourself to accept God\u2019s love, and learn to love him and his son Yeshua in return.\u201d</p><p>I contemplated him thoughtfully. \u201cYou\u2019re an interesting young man, Aleksei.\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cWill you at least read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>THIRTY-ONE</p><p>The Rebbe\u2019s memoir was beautiful, so beautiful in places that it made my heart ache.</p><p>He was a wise, compassionate, eloquent, and profoundly conflicted man, who had seen his deepest-held desire come to pass, and feared he did not welcome the form it had taken, even though he had helped to shape it.</p><p>At the center of the book was his struggle to reconcile the two Yeshuas: Yeshua-that-was, the gentle philosopher whose teachings formed much of the long-held faith of the Habiru, whom he called the Children of Yisra-el; and Yeshua-who-comes, the fierce warrior in whose name a new faith arose in Vralia.</p><p>It was during his long conversations with Berlik that doubt had arisen. Here was a man who had committed a terrible deed to save his people, who had taken on his shoulders the price of breaking an oath sworn in their name. If ever there were a man in need of Yeshua\u2019s salvation, it was Berlik.</p><p>And yet he refused it.</p> <p>\u201cGently, sorrowfully, and steadfastly, he refused it,\u201d the Rebbe wrote. \u201cInsisting that the burden was his own to bear, he refused it; and with consummate and relentless kindness, he pointed out the discrepancies between my own beliefs and events transpiring in war-torn Vralia. Yet it was also true that Berlik found his own grace through Yeshua, whose compassion made him believe that the gods themselves were capable of forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>There were things the Rebbe had not fully understood, but I did. When Berlik broke the oath he had sworn on his diadh-anam, the Maghuin Dhonn Herself had turned Her back on him. The divine spark within him had been extinguished.</p><p>In distant Vralia, where Berlik had resigned himself to death at the prince\u2019s hands, She had forgiven him and it had been rekindled.</p><p>Accepting sanctuary, Berlik had vanished into the wilderness. And then Prince Imriel had come, and in time Berlik had surrendered himself willingly to his justice, bowing his head for the sword.</p><p>Before he died, he spoke of Yeshua ben Yosef.</p><p>I had known part of it, but the Rebbe had recorded Berlik\u2019s words in full\u2014at least as related to him by the prince. \u201cI came to see that he is the one god who understands what it is to fall low. That when every other face is turned away from you, he is the friend who is there, not only for the innocent, but for the guilty, too. For the thieves and murderers and oath-breakers alike, Yeshua is there.\u201d</p><p>It made me want to weep. I could pray to that Yeshua, if he had not seemed so very, very far away.</p><p>Such was the argument the Rebbe Avraham ben David made, that until such a time as Yeshua-who-comes returned to make his will manifest, an hour that Yeshua himself had declared unknowable, those who worshipped him should obey the teachings of Yeshua-that-was, who turned no one away.</p> <p>\u201cAgainst the backdrop of war, of great and awesome change, I witnessed a profound mystery take place,\u201d the Rebbe wrote. \u201cEven now, I cannot claim to understand it. As I reflect upon those events, I am reminded that the will of Adonai is vaster and more wondrous than any mortal mind can encompass, and that the world is filled with marvels and terrible beauty. To those who will shape Vralia\u2019s future, I say this. You are mortal, and you will err. It is inevitable, as inevitable as the rising of the sun. I beg of you, have compassion in all your doings and always err on the side of love, for that is the greatest gift of all.\u201d</p><p>Reading that, I did weep.</p><p>Aleksei\u2019s gift had accomplished its purpose.</p><p>I tried, I truly did. After reading the Rebbe\u2019s book, I thought that mayhap if Berlik could find his way back to grace through Yeshua, so could I. Mayhap the Maghuin Dhonn Herself was wroth with me. I had done some very foolish things, especially allowing the gifts She had given me to serve Raphael de Mereliot\u2019s ambitions.</p><p>For four days, I was good.</p><p>Day after day, I did my slow, exacting penance, row by row, shuffling in my chains, kneeling on the hard pebbles, and dipping my scrub-brush into the bucket that I might scour each and every square.</p><p>\u201cYeshua the Anointed, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner,\u201d I murmured, speaking to the gentle Yeshua-that-was, and not the hot-eyed warrior on the wall, holding the world in his palm. \u201cYeshua the Anointed, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch of Riva approved.</p><p>\u201cI have a mind to reward you, Moirin,\u201d he said to me in a jovial tone, visiting me in my cell after I had completed my fourth day of flawless penance.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI will be conducting the morning service tomorrow. Would you care to attend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord,\u201d I said politely. It was a lie. I wanted nothing to do with him. I still hated Pyotr Rostov. I would always hate him.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cSince you are unbaptized, you will have to observe from the narthex, but I think you will benefit from the experience. Luba will escort you.\u201d</p><p>Doubtless that would be a pleasure for both of us. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch laid one hand on my head. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, I had to own that I was curious\u2014and more than a bit apprehensive, too. Since the day I arrived, I hadn\u2019t seen another living soul save Pyotr Rostov and his family. I would see them in the temple, all the fine folk of Riva who would take part in stoning me to death if I didn\u2019t find a path out of this mess one way or another.</p><p>Scowling Luba came for me at daybreak, the ferocity of her expression letting me know just exactly how little she welcomed this chore. At least her dislike was honest and genuine. I preferred her heartfelt scowls to her husband\u2019s unctuous smiles. Since I was still trying to be good and open myself to the possibility that there was some purpose in my presence here, I met her glare with a calm, steady gaze.</p><p>It didn\u2019t impress her.</p><p>She led me on a different course through the living quarters. It seemed we were to exit onto the street, and enter the temple through the main doors.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been outdoors for days\u2014weeks, by this time. If it hadn\u2019t been for the magic of the bedamned chains stifling my senses, like as not I would have lost my mind by now, confined in a man-made structure for so long.</p><p>Even so, the sight of the blue sky above me and the feel of open air around me was a powerful tonic. I drew a long, shaking breath, every fiber in my body urging me to run, to flee, to get away.</p><p>But there were the shackles on my ankles, limiting me to mincing steps. There was Luba at my side, taking a fierce grip on my elbow. There were streams of Vralian worshippers heading for the temple, eyeing me with avid curiosity.</p><p>I let out my breath and allowed Luba to steer me into the temple.</p><p>Vralians stood to worship\u2014men on the right, women on the left. Most of them passed beyond the outermost chamber of the narthex to enter the inner chamber of the nave. I winced to see dirty shoes and boots trampling the pebbled floor.</p><p>A few lingered in the narthex, staring and whispering. I did not see kindness or pity in any of their faces. At best, curiosity; at worst, revulsion. I made myself meet their eyes, willing my expression to give nothing away. When I did, they averted their eyes. It was altogether too easy to picture the stones in their hands.</p><p>It was better when the service began. Since it was conducted in Vralian, I understood none of it. Pyotr Rostov had been careful to ensure that precious little was spoken in my presence so I had no chance to learn to communicate with anyone else, keeping me as isolated as possible. But there were long prayers chanted in deep, sonorous tones, and at least the sound of it was pleasing. The Patriarch stood before the altar wearing a fine embroidered stole over his robes and swinging a censer from which sweet-smelling smoke trickled.</p><p>I let the sounds wash over me, lifting my gaze to contemplate the image of Yeshua on the wall above the altar.</p><p>I tried to envision him as Yeshua-that-was, willing his stern visage to soften into the gentler one Rebbe Avraham described.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you will of me?\u201d I whispered under my breath, asking the question in earnest for the first time.</p><p>A vision unfolded behind my eyes: Yeshua ben Yosef as savior and intercessor, coming to my aid as he had come to the aid of the adulterous woman in one of the tales Aleksei had read to me.</p><p>And truly, his face was oh so very kind.</p><p>And as in the tale, Yeshua stooped and traced an unknown word on the ground. Then he stood and touched my chains one by one, and one by one my chains fell away. He reached out his hand to me, beckoning for me to take it.</p><p>I gazed into his eyes.</p><p>They were dark, dark and wise and fathomless. There was an entire world behind them, a night sky filled with stars, vast mountains blotting out sections.</p><p>No.</p><p>The mountain moved forward and dwindled, taking on a familiar shape, taking on mortal dimensions. I gazed through the eyes of Yeshua into the eyes of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, and they were filled with infinite sorrow.</p><p>With infinite regret, She turned away from me. I felt the divine spark of my diadh-anam go out like a blown candle and gasped, my soul suddenly empty and hollow.</p><p>There would be no more twilight, no more gifts, no more magic. Never again would I sense the slow thoughts of trees growing, the flickering awareness of animals in the field. Never, ever, would I pass through the stone doorway. That was the price of accepting Yeshua\u2019s salvation.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>The world, the real world came crashing back as though I had released the twilight. I hadn\u2019t known I\u2019d shouted aloud until I heard the echoes of my own voice in the sudden, shocked silence. My chains were shivering, the sigils on them glowing.</p><p>My diadh-anam blazed within me. It had only been a vision\u2014a true vision, mayhap, but a vision nonetheless.</p><p>I had not taken Yeshua\u2019s hand.</p><p>I gasped again with relief, and then a third time as Luba fetched me a great, ringing slap across the face, knocking me sideways, staggering in my shackles. Without giving me a chance to recover, she grabbed the chains that ran from my collar to my wrists, hauling me out of the temple unceremoniously.</p><p>I stumbled in her wake, scarce able to keep my feet, my wits addled and my face stinging. The anger that Aleksei\u2019s compassion and the Rebbe\u2019s book had softened returned full force. Halfway to the door to the living quarters, I got my feet beneath me, planted my heels, and yanked the chains out of her grasp.</p><p>Luba reached for me. I grabbed her arm first, pivoting on my heel to swing her against the outer wall of the temple.</p><p>Her grey eyes went wide and shocked.</p><p>I leaned my right forearm across her throat. \u201cI am not a dog, and you will not treat me like one!\u201d</p><p>And then there was the sound of running feet and shouting, and there were hands dragging me off her, many hands. I didn\u2019t fight. Three Vralian men held me uncertainly, waiting for the Patriarch, who came striding down the street, his fine vestments swinging, his face filled with anger.</p><p>\u201cYou disappoint me, Moirin,\u201d he rumbled. \u201cYou disappoint me sorely!\u201d</p><p>Behind him, I could see Aleksei shaking his head in frantic warning, urging me not to further anger his uncle.</p><p>I gazed at the sky and breathed the Breath of Ocean\u2019s Rolling Waves, willing myself to find the still, calm place within me that Master Lo had taught me to seek. It had been too long since I had practiced the discipline of the Way.</p><p>It helped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lord,\u201d I said to the Patriarch. \u201cA kind of fit came over me.\u201d</p><p>It was an answer he could understand, and the worst of his anger abated. \u201cIt is Naamah\u2019s curse within you struggling against the forces that would contain it,\u201d he said in a judicious tone. \u201cIn my eagerness, I fear I misjudged your progress, as well as the tenacious nature of the curse. I should have allowed you to finish a full cycle of penance before exposing you to God\u2019s holy liturgy.\u201d</p><p>I sagged a bit in my captors\u2019 grip. \u201cThank you, my lord. I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><p>Pyotr Rostov said somewhat in Vralian to the men holding my arms. They let me go with alacrity. Luba coughed and massaged her throat in an ostentatious manner, malice in her gaze. Rostov turned back to me, his face grave. \u201cYou understand, of course, that you will have to be punished. It is for your own good. I fear the demons that possess you will only respond to strong discipline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d I met his gaze. \u201cFor my own good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled with gentle regret. \u201cI\u2019m glad you understand.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-TWO</p><p>My punishment was a whipping, and the Patriarch administered it himself.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>It took place in a small inner courtyard I hadn\u2019t even known existed. There, I was made to kneel on the slate, my chained wrists draped over a hook on a large post. With great delight, Luba took her shears to the back of my dress, cutting downward from the neckline and parting the flaps of fabric to lay my back bare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pyotr Rostov beat me with a knotted rope, administering twenty firm lashes, counting out each one in a solemn voice.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>I\u2019d only ever been struck thrice before in my life. Once, when I told Jehanne I was leaving. She had slapped me with surprising strength, and fallen weeping at my feet. That was one blow I didn\u2019t begrudge her. The second time was in the Great Khan\u2019s ger. To be fair, he hadn\u2019t hit me hard. It had only been a warning.</p> <p>The third time was Luba, and that, I did begrudge her.</p><p>This was much worse.</p><p>The rope was heavy, and the knots struck with bruising force. I managed not to cry out loud, but I flinched in anticipation of each blow. My breath grew ragged and helpless tears filled my eyes. There are those who find pleasure in pain and in Terre d\u2019Ange, it is one of Naamah\u2019s arts, but it was not one I had ever relished.</p><p>After ten blows, my back was a welter of pain. By fifteen, I was biting my lip and squeezing my eyes shut, willing it to end.</p><p>\u201c..... eighteen.\u201d</p> <p>Thud.</p><p>\u201c..... nineteen.\u201d</p><p>Thud.</p><p>The Patriarch was beginning to breathe hard, too. Through the haze of pain, I sensed that there was more than exertion in it. Although he might deny it to himself, he took pleasure in administering this punishment to me, as surely as he did in forcing my unwilling confessions. The exercise of power aroused him.</p><p>\u201c..... twenty.\u201d</p><p>Thud.</p> <p>It was finished. He unhooked my chains from the post and helped me to my feet. I stood unsteadily, my back throbbing in agony. My violated dress hung low on my shoulders, baring the upper swell of my breasts. He looked away, but not before his gaze had skated oh so briefly over my exposed flesh. A dark flush suffused his face, further betraying him.</p><p>Valentina hurried to my side, a needle and thread in her hand, yanking my dress in place and beginning to stitch.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Rostov said brusquely. \u201cSister, see Moirin to her chamber. She is to fast for two days. Luba, Aleksei, come.\u201d</p><p>Oh yes, the entire household had been required to bear witness to my punishment. I glanced at Aleksei, who was staring fixedly at his feet. He went with his aunt and uncle without a word, without ever looking in my direction.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you persist in defying him?\u201d Valentina whispered behind me, stitching furiously.</p><p>I turned my head in her direction. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, not this time. I had a vision in the temple. It caught me unaware.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was low. \u201cAnd assaulting Luba?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my shoulders, testing the depth of my pain. It was considerable. The Patriarch was a fairly strong fellow, and he had not held back. \u201cAh, no. That I meant to do. And it was almost worth it.\u201d</p> <p>A shocked sound escaped Valentina. It took me a moment to recognize it as a stifled laugh. Her hand flew up to cover her mouth. \u201cI have entertained similar thoughts on occasion. But, Moirin, you will get yourself killed if you continue this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her hand from her lips and touched me lightly, ever so softly, her fingertips grazing the sore skin between my shoulder blades where my dress yet gaped. It made me shiver. There was something of a mother\u2019s tenderness in it, and something else, too. It seemed a very, very long time since anyone had touched me with kindness. Despite everything, I yearned for it. \u201cI would rather you didn\u2019t die,\u201d she murmured. \u201cStill, I owe everything to my brother, and I have nowhere else to go. You know I dare not intervene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I said wearily. \u201cAnd I do not blame you. I am learning. This is a harsh place for a woman, especially one judged and found wanting. But your son is proving stubbornly incorruptible, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Valentina bent her head to the task at hand, finishing sewing my dress. \u201cOh? And yet he stole my book for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She tied a knot in the thread and broke it. \u201cYes, of course. Offer Aleksei what he craves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d I guessed. \u201cPleasure?\u201d</p><p>Valentina shook her head. \u201cTruth.\u201d</p><p>So I did.</p><p>Two days passed before Aleksei came to me again. In accordance with the Patriarch\u2019s orders, I was given no food, only water. I was not even allowed to continue my penance, which I did not mind a bit. It gave my aching body a chance to heal. My lower back hurt from kneeling and bending; bruised to the bone, my upper back hurt from the lash. The pain in my knees was chronic.</p><p>I spent the time returning to the discipline that Master Lo had taught me. I sat cross-legged and half-starved on my narrow berth until Aleksei came back, cycling through the Five Styles of Breathing.</p><p>I prayed, too. Not to God and Yeshua, but to the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, and to Blessed Elua and his Companions, and most especially among them to Naamah. In this, too, I had been neglectful.</p><p>When Aleksei returned with his book of scriptures, I could see the trepidation in every line of his body. His broad shoulders were hunched and tight, and I suspected he was wearing that vile goat\u2019s-hair vest beneath his shirt again. His uneasy gaze skidded toward me.</p><p>I sat cross-legged on my bed, my mood and my face calm. \u201cHello, Aleksei.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d His hunched shoulders relaxed by an inch or two. He met my eyes, frowning a little. \u201cI thought to find you angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI have gone beyond anger, at least for the moment. I do not promise it will not return.\u201d I nodded at the chair. \u201cWill you sit? I\u2019d like to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei pulled the stool over instead, hunkering on it with that combination of awkwardness and grace unique to young men. He turned the book over in his hands, his glorious blue eyes wide and uncertain. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to read to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and in a little while, you may,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you willing to listen to me first?\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, he smiled. \u201cYes, Moirin. I do like listening to you, and I am trying to understand, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smiled back at him, and took a deep breath. \u201cAleksei, I had a vision in the temple. That is why I cried out.\u201d</p><p>I told him what I had seen, my vision of Yeshua and the Maghuin Dhonn beyond him, and the spark of my diadh-anam extinguished.</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t understand it, not wholly, he listened attentively and he understood as well as any Vralian could.</p><p>\u201cIt has made one thing clear to me,\u201d I said gently when I had finished. \u201cNo matter what else, I cannot accept Yeshua\u2019s salvation without betraying the Maghuin Dhonn Herself and losing my soul in the bargain. I can\u2019t do it, Aleksei. I do not want to die, not at all, but I would rather die than lose my diadh-anam and live without it.\u201d</p><p>There were tears in his blue, blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nodded. \u201cMore sure than I\u2019ve ever been of anything in my life. And if you do not help me, sooner or later, your uncle will kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to help you escape,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTo betray my uncle and everything he holds dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seeks my redemption as a means to an end,\u201d I said. \u201cA sign from God that it is time to launch a crusade to convert the D\u2019Angelines, to bring the apostate Elua and his Companions back to the fold.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt will not happen, not here and now. Not beginning with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he write?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei rubbed his hands on his knees. \u201cYeshua. In your vision. You said he wrote a word on the floor. What was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWhat was the word he wrote in his encounter with the adulterous woman? Mayhap it was the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows.\u201d He looked somber. \u201cSometimes I think the entire mystery of Yeshua must be contained in that word.\u201d</p><p>What he was thinking, I couldn\u2019t begin to guess. I put out my hands, palms upward. \u201cIf I were free, I would invoke Naamah\u2019s blessing for you, Aleksei. You think you understand what that means. You don\u2019t. There would be healing in it for you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, unable to hide the hunger and the yearning in him. \u201cYou seek to tempt me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled wryly. \u201cFor quite some time now, yes. But this is an honest offer. You need not accept it. I am asking you to free me out of the kindness of your heart. And,\u201d I added, \u201cbecause I do not think you wish to see me cut down in a hail of stones, my skull cracked open and my brains leaking onto the cobbles.\u201d Aleksei jerked as though I\u2019d struck him, then winced in obvious discomfort. I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cAre you wearing that bedamned goat\u2019s-hair vest again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured, bringing his shoulders forward. \u201cI..... after your punishment, I thought it only fair I endured the same. If I had been a better teacher, you would not have been punished.\u201d</p><p>I drew a sharp breath. \u201cYour uncle beat you?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei shook his head. \u201cNo. Oh, no. I administered it to myself.\u201d He gave me an earnest glance. \u201cMortification of the flesh is good for the soul.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to cry. \u201cAleksei.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Moirin,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d I wrestled myself back to calmness, breathing slowly and trying to find words that would reach him. \u201cYou know, I do believe your mother would do it if she dared. Set me free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo.....\u201d He drew out the word, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cI understand her fears,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t at first. But she is a woman shunned by her society, always and forever paying for her youthful mistake. It is a cruel world for one such as her, and she has nowhere else to go. It would be different for you. You\u2019re a young man, healthy and strong. You could apprentice yourself, learn a trade.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei squared his shoulders. \u201cI have a trade. A calling. My uncle has raised me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo convert D\u2019Angelines,\u201d I finished for him.</p><p>He flushed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is his dream, his interpretation of God\u2019s will.\u201d I eyed him speculatively. \u201cWhat is yours? With your fluent tongue, you could find work as an interpreter in the D\u2019Angeline embassy. With your training, you could go west and study with those priests who took Rebbe Avraham\u2019s words to heart, those on the opposite side of the Great Schism.\u201d</p><p>That hit home.</p><p>Aleksei\u2019s fists knotted, his raw-boned knuckles turning white, the book of scriptures forgotten in his lap. The hot flush on his rugged cheekbones deepened, and his blue eyes darkened with anger and despair. \u201cYou seek to tempt me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said simply. \u201cI seek to live. And I am only telling you the truth, whether you welcome it or not.\u201d</p><p>He surged to his feet with fluid grace, all awkwardness forgotten in the heat of the moment. The book of scripture fell to the floor. He paced the confines of my cell, muttering to himself in Vralian, his fists clenching and unclenching.</p><p>I watched him, fearful and fascinated.</p><p>At length, Aleksei fetched up before me, looming over my narrow bed, wild-eyed and grim-faced, his tawny hair tousled. \u201cI cannot do it, Moirin. After so long, I dare not succumb to temptation. I cannot set you free. I cannot betray my uncle. Everything I am, I owe to him. Everything! Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I murmured with regret.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cNor can I watch you die and believe it God\u2019s will in truth. So.....\u201d His chest rose and fell. \u201cInstead, I will teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach me?\u201d I echoed. \u201cWere you not listening when I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Aleksei cut me off. \u201cI was.\u201d He picked up the fallen book, kissing it reverently.</p><p>I was confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He settled onto the stool. \u201cIn a little more than two months\u2019 time, the Duke of Vralsturm will come to Riva to attend the midsummer festival. It is my uncle\u2019s hope that he might present you as his greatest success, and gain the Duke\u2019s patronage. If he succeeds, the Duke might petition his kin in Vralgrad on behalf of his D\u2019Angeline crusade. It is my uncle\u2019s fondest dream, to see the prophecies of Elijah of Antioch bear fruit,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I told you, it will not begin with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but my uncle does not know that.\u201d Aleksei opened the book. \u201cAre you willing to lie?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, of course. But, Aleksei, even when I am telling the truth, he does not always believe me. I do not know how to make him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He nodded, too, turning the pages. \u201cAnd I will teach you what lies you must utter to save your life.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-THREE</p><p>Playing the role of a lifetime, I lied.</p><p>For two months, I lied through my teeth. I memorized the creed and the lengthy catechism Aleksei taught me, until I could recite it in my sleep. I kept my temper in check. I gave no one cause to doubt me.</p><p>I resumed my penance, scouring squares. I uttered the prayer that the Patriarch had given me.</p><p>In time, I was allowed to attend another service. I had no visions or fits. I did not assault Luba.</p><p>It was without a doubt one of the most excruciating things I\u2019d been called upon to do in my young, but eventful, life. I was not a patient person by nature, but it seemed the gods were hell-bent on teaching me to become one.</p><p>Betimes I thought of my restlessness during the long Tatar winter when I was frustrated by the knowledge that Bao was so very near, and I could have laughed in despair at the irony. I would have traded this hardship for that one in a heartbeat.</p><p>Then I\u2019d had the kindness of Batu and Checheg and their family to sustain me, the innocent ardor of the children to fulfill my yearning for the warmth of human contact. I\u2019d had chores that made me feel useful and welcome, not pointless ones that left my body sore and aching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d had the escape of the vast, wide-open steppe, the immense blue sky. I\u2019d had the distraction of horse races and archery contests. And ah, gods! I\u2019d had the solace of being able to summon the twilight.</p><p>Now I was a prisoner wrapped in chains, condemned to harsh labor and the tedium of memorizing the tenets of a faith I would never embrace. I had a captor I despised. My senses and my magic were stifled.</p><p>And Bao..... like as not Bao was a thousand leagues away from me by now, heading determinedly in the wrong direction, taking the missing half of my soul with him. I wondered what would have befallen him if I had taken Yeshua\u2019s hand in my vision, if I had lost my diadh-anam.</p> <p>Would his be extinguished, too? Would he survive it?</p><p>Somehow, I didn\u2019t think so. Master Lo had given his life that Bao might live, but it hadn\u2019t been enough. It had required the divine spark of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself to rekindle his life. If that were gone..... I feared death would reclaim Bao.</p><p>It was a terrifying thought.</p><p>I wondered, too, what would happen to Bao if I were to die. I didn\u2019t think it was the same. If I died with my diadh-anam alight, it would not be extinguished. I would pass through the stone doorway to rejoin the Maghuin Dhonn Herself.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t entirely sure, and that thought terrified me, too. So I applied myself diligently to my scrub-brush and my studies, and I became far more skilled than I had ever been at lying and deception in the service of my purported redemption, pretending to be humble and earnest in my desire for God\u2019s forgiveness.</p> <p>Even so, had it not been for Aleksei, I would have lost my wits. To be sure, he was a very peculiar young man and there were times when I couldn\u2019t understand him in the slightest. But since he had compromised his conscience and agreed to help me on his own terms, he was a bit easier in my presence.</p><p>For my part, I abandoned the myriad small ways in which I\u2019d sought to tempt him. Of course, the matter lay between us nonetheless. Naamah\u2019s gift could be suppressed, but it could not be extinguished. It was no ephemeral spark like my diadh-anam. It was written in flesh as well as spirit, written in the quickening of the blood, the gladdening of the heart, the language of desire.</p><p>I had to own, the boy had a formidable will to resist it. I didn\u2019t doubt that much of it was due to having a lifetime\u2019s worth of repression and discipline drilled into him. Still, in his own way, Aleksei was as stubborn as Bao.</p><p>Unlike my stubborn magpie, who had once posed rather unconvincingly as a travelling monk sworn to celibacy, I thought Aleksei would make a good priest..... if he were ever to free himself from the shackles of the Church of Yeshua Ascendant and its harsh strictures and embrace the kinder tenets Rebbe Avraham had espoused, as he so clearly longed to do in his heart of hearts.</p><p>He liked the role of teacher, and he was good at it. When I pleaded with him, he relented and began teaching me a few words of Vralian along with the Yeshuite scriptures. When I escaped, I meant to vanish into the twilight and stay there as long as possible, but there might be times when I would need to communicate.</p><p>But Aleksei listened, too. True to my word, I told him the tale of Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay de Montr\u00e8ve and her quest to find the Name of God. Fascinated and horrified, he hung on my every word. He thought about it for days, although the things he pondered were often issues that never would have occurred to me.</p> <p>\u201cThis lost tribe, the Tribe of D\u00e2n. Did they embrace Yeshua as the mashiach once they learned of him?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cThe mashiach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Anointed One,\u201d he clarified. I had learned that along with the D\u2019Angeline tongue Aleksei had learned that he might one day use to convert us all, he spoke and read fluent Habiru.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d I knew only a little about the matter, having overheard discussions among members of the Circle of Shalomon regarding various Habiru scholars.</p><p>Aleksei looked astonished. \u201cWhy ever not?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI think they believe the true mash..... Anointed One is yet to come.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop gaping. Clearly, the notion rocked the foundations of his world. As intelligent and well studied as he was, he had led an extremely insular life.</p><p>\u201cThe world is a vast place, Aleksei,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI know you are very sure that your God is the One True God, but..... I do not believe it. If there is a truth beyond all other truths, I think Master Lo has the right of it. The Way that can be told is not the eternal Way. It comes before all else, and everything comes from it. Even gods.\u201d</p> <p>Aleksei shook his head at me. \u201cYou are a heretic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you, aye.\u201d Deciding it had been too long since I\u2019d seen his blush, I gave him a wicked smile, letting it linger on my lips. \u201cBut decidedly not a saint.\u201d</p><p>His color rose; but he\u2019d found his own ways of dealing with me. A muscle in his jaw twitched. \u201cIf you bait me, I will not teach you Vralian, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine.\u201d I let my smile fade.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I am not so sure,\u201d Aleksei said unexpectedly, once again taking the conversation in a direction I couldn\u2019t have anticipated. He bowed his head, his tawny hair falling over his brow, bronze locks shot through with gold. I longed to run my fingers through it. \u201cI wonder..... I wonder, why has God sent you to tempt me? Surely, you have suffered in the bargain. Are you my heretic saint? What am I meant to learn from this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt is hard, so hard,\u201d he said, more to himself than to me. \u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>I did, too.</p><p>And because I had come to care for Aleksei, compassionate, damaged soul that he was, I wished I could comfort him. I wanted to go to him, put my arms around him, offer the solace of human warmth and kindness.</p><p>I didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>He might have accepted it\u2014might have. Or he might have pushed me away and fled, fearful that I meant to seduce him. The stakes were too high, and I was too afraid. So I remained where I was and stifled my urge to give comfort, reckoning it was but one more casualty in the ongoing war for my soul.</p><p>THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>Beneath the Patriarch\u2019s stern gaze, I dipped my brush in the lye bucket and scrubbed the last square of my penance.</p><p>\u201cYeshua the Anointed, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u201d</p><p>It was done, twice over. Over the course of weeks and months, I had finished one complete circuit and begun anew.</p><p>Now that was done, too.</p><p>I clambered wearily to my feet, my stiff back and bruised knees protesting. \u201cAgain, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pyotr Rostov placed both hands on my shoulders. \u201cNo, child. You have done well, so very, very well, and I am proud of you.\u201d His velvet-brown eyes shone with genuine warmth. \u201cMoirin mac Fainche of the Maghuin Dhonn, are you prepared to be baptized into the Yeshuite faith?\u201d</p><p>I would have danced naked in the village square if it meant getting rid of these hateful chains.</p><p>I lowered my gaze. \u201cDo you think me worthy?\u201d</p><p>He embraced me. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I made myself glance shyly at him beneath my lashes. \u201cThen it would be my honor, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, good!\u201d The Patriarch embraced me again. I managed not to shudder with revulsion. After a moment, he let me go, regarding me and steepling his fingers. \u201cThe Duke of Vralsturm comes next week for the festival. I shall arrange for your baptism and chrismation to coincide with his visit, that he might see God\u2019s glory at work. I trust you do not mind?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, my lord. I am privileged to serve as an example.\u201d</p><p>His creamy look came and went, replaced by one of solemn gravity. \u201cAnd I to serve as the vessel of your redemption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>In the privacy of my cell, I wondered if he believed it. I daresay he did. Like Raphael de Mereliot, he was a man of great ambition. Unlike Raphael, I had no idea what forces had shaped the Patriarch\u2019s nature. I only knew he had a profound hunger to believe himself the conduit of his God\u2019s will.</p><p>Well and so, I would let him.</p><p>Like Aleksei, I did not feel wholly good about our endeavor. Alone in my cell, I addressed Yeshua ben Yosef in quiet prayer.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI do not wish to lie. But I do not wish to die, either. So when the time comes, I will lie. If Berlik was right about you, you will understand and forgive me, along with the oath-breakers and the murderers, and everyone else who has fallen low. Will you?\u201d</p><p>Yeshua did not answer me\u2014but then, gods seldom did.</p><p>The following week, the Duke of Vralsturm arrived in Riva, where he was received with great fanfare. I was not permitted to take part in any of the celebrations, but I could hear them through the narrow window of my cell. Hard as it was for me to imagine them rejoicing, the folk of Riva sounded merry.</p><p>My baptism was to take place the following day on the shores of Lake Severin, for one of Yeshua\u2019s apostles had decreed that it was best done in living water. There was to be a solemn procession through the town wherein the Patriarch and a coterie of lesser priests led me in my chains to the lake. There I was to be submerged in water three times, and then led in procession back to the temple, where the final ceremony of the chrismation was to be performed.</p><p>I was not looking forward to it.</p><p>But Pyotr Rostov had promised that once I was baptized and anointed, once he had pronounced me born anew in the Yeshuite faith, he would unlock my chains and set me free; and Aleksei claimed his uncle was a man of his word.</p><p>Stone and sea, I hoped so.</p><p>For two days before the ceremony, I was made to fast. I would have reckoned it yet another punishment, but the truth was, these Yeshuites were mad for fasting. Aleksei regularly fasted for days at a time. I wondered if they would be quite so keen on the practice if they\u2019d ever had to endure a long, lean winter.</p><p>Probably. In Aleksei\u2019s case, definitely. He would welcome the opportunity to offer his suffering up to God. Me, I could not help but think that there was more than enough suffering in the world without adding to the balance.</p><p>The morning of my baptism, Valentina came to fetch me. I was to be given a thorough bath and dressed in a clean garment of white wool. Gods willing, I thought, it would be the last time I had to be sewn into my clothing.</p><p>Although she had shown me occasional small gestures of tenderness since my whipping, today Valentina handled me with impersonal efficiency, draping the shapeless robe of white wool over me once I was scrubbed clean. Her face was more careworn than usual, and she looked unhappy.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cIs this not the very outcome you desired upon my arrival, my lady?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a sharp look. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son has helped guide me on the path toward redemption.\u201d I\u2019d developed a certain fondness for poor Valentina, forever punished for her transgression, unable to help yearning for beauty nonetheless\u2014but not enough to trust her with the truth. \u201cIs that not pleasing in God\u2019s eyes? Does it not suggest he has forgiven you?\u201d</p><p>Valentina laughed, a broken sound. \u201cIt begs the axiom, does it not? Beware what you pray for, lest God grant your prayers.\u201d</p><p>I was silent.</p><p>She paused in her stitching, gazing into the distance. \u201cDo you know, in the western Church, they venerate Yeshua\u2019s mother, Marya. We do not do that here in the east. Women are not venerated, not even the Mother of God. After all these years, I still miss it.\u201d She continued stitching. \u201cWould that I had appreciated such grace when I had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I murmured. I did, all too well.</p><p>A single bitter tear trickled down her cheek. \u201cGod help me, I\u2019d come to hope.....\u201d She did not finish the thought.</p><p>I knew, though. Valentina had come to hope that I would succeed in seducing her son, that I would persuade him to leave this place and find his wings. I wanted to tell her that I had tried my best, that one cannot free someone who doesn\u2019t wish to be set free. Two months ago, I would have done it without hesitation.</p><p>Moirin the unrepentant sinner would have said it. Moirin the penitent catechumen didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>Even so, I reached out and wiped the tear gently from Valentina\u2019s face, trying to tell her without words that I was sorry for failing. She shook her head at me, and finished stitching me into my white robe, then winding a white woolen scarf around my head.</p><p>And then it was time.</p><p>My nemesis Luba came to fetch us. Once again, I was led outside so that I might enter the temple properly. It was a fine, bright summer day. If I\u2019d actually wanted to be baptized, I couldn\u2019t have asked for a more auspicious day.</p><p>Inside the temple, there was a considerable crowd. Scores of villagers were present. Aleksei was there, and gave me a slight, encouraging nod. The Patriarch was there before the altar in his vestments, flanked by a handful of priests including my former captors Ilya and Leonid. There was a wide-set fellow with a greying beard and keen blue-grey eyes. He wore fine clothes and was surrounded by soldiers, and I took him to be the Duke of Vralsturm. He eyed me with intense interest as I approached the altar, breathing the Breath of Ocean\u2019s Rolling Waves to calm my nerves.</p><p>\u201cMoirin mac Fainche of the Maghuin Dhonn,\u201d Pyotr Rostov addressed me in a deep voice, speaking in D\u2019Angeline for my benefit. \u201cIs it your will this day to be baptized into the faith of the One True God and his son Yeshua?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, my lord,\u201d I said firmly, willing myself to meet his eyes without a trace of guile.</p><p>He asked me the first question of the catechism. \u201cWhat is our church called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Church of Yeshua Ascendant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it called the Church of Yeshua Ascendant?\u201d</p><p>These were the easy questions. \u201cBecause it is dedicated to building the Kingdom of Yeshua on earth and preparing for his return.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Patriarch nodded in approval. \u201cState its teaching briefly.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, reciting the words Aleksei had taught me. \u201cGod made the world and created Edom the First Man and his wife, the All-Mother, Yeva. Although our first parents were fashioned to be good, they succumbed to temptation and disobeyed God. Through the sin of disobedience, their minds were darkened. Their hearts were made evil, and they fell into wickedness and death. Their descendants suffered for their sins. But God in his infinite love sent his son Yeshua ben Yosef to redeem them.....\u201d</p><p>On and on it went.</p> <p>I made a few mistakes, faltering here or there. Aleksei and I had agreed it would be more believable if I didn\u2019t have the catechism down letter-perfect. But on the whole, I performed to Pyotr Rostov\u2019s satisfaction.</p><p>The Duke of Vralsturm appeared impressed. I wondered if he spoke D\u2019Angeline, but then I realized Aleksei was translating for him in a quiet murmur.</p><p>The Patriarch was pleased. On the surface of it, his expression remained grave, but I could sense his creamy look hovering just beneath his solemnity. This was the beginning of his great moment of triumph.</p><p>I let him bask in it.</p><p>He stepped down from the dais, swinging his censer about me, enveloping me in a cloud of fragrant smoke, laying a hand on my head and speaking in sonorous Vralian. The crowd murmured, ascertaining that I had passed the first test.</p> <p>From thence, the processional to the shores of the lake.</p><p>It was a slow process, the pace dictated by the mincing steps I was forced to take, constrained by the shackles around my ankles and the short length of chain joining them, my bare feet shuffling on the sun-warmed cobbled streets. Pyotr Rostov didn\u2019t mind. He would be happy for this moment to stretch into eternity.</p><p>I saw the Duke of Vralsturm gesture at my chains, leaning in to ask the Patriarch a question.</p><p>Rostov made him a somber reply. I\u2019d learned enough Vralian to catch the gist of it.</p><p>Yes, yes, it is necessary.</p><p>We reached the shores of Lake Severin. They were stony and harsh beneath my bare soles. I\u2019d gone unshod since the day Ilya and Leonid had wrenched off my thick Tatar boots in the Great Khan\u2019s ger and clamped the shackles onto me.</p> <p>That seemed a very long time ago.</p><p>The sun was high overhead, sparkling on the lake\u2019s surface. I felt a touch lightheaded, no doubt from fasting. The villagers fanned out along the rocky shoreline, watching with avid interest. The Duke took a good vantage point for himself and his men, watching, his expression curious and interested.</p><p>The Patriarch waded into the lake and beckoned to me.</p><p>I wallowed into the cold water, my white robes billowing around me, my chains weighing me down.</p><p>\u201cMoirin, recite the creed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and all things visible and invisible,\u201d I said in a breathless rush. \u201cAnd in Yeshua the Anointed, the only-begotten son of God, light of the light, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made. Yeshua, who came down from Heaven and was made man, who suffered and was buried and rose again. Yeshua, who will come again in glory to judge us all, whose kingdom shall have no end.\u201d</p><p>Pyotr Rostov smiled, laying his hand on my head. Gods, I hated that gesture.</p><p>\u201cVerily, verily I say unto thee,\u201d he quoted. \u201cExcept a man be born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Moirin mac Fainche, be you born anew this day in the faith of God and Yeshua, his son.\u201d</p> <p>He pushed my head underwater.</p><p>Once.....</p><p>Twice.....</p><p>Thrice.</p><p>I came up dripping, my wet robe plastered to my body, my head-scarf askew. The wool was thick enough that it didn\u2019t become sheer, but I doubted it left much to the imagination otherwise. Onlookers murmured once more, and I made an extra effort to keep my expression earnest and guileless.</p><p>\u201cWell done, child.\u201d The Patriarch extended his hand to me, and I took it, letting him help me out of the lake\u2019s chilly depths. \u201cOnly the final step remains.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, my lord. I am ready for it.\u201d</p><p>Dripping, we returned to the temple in another slow, mincing procession. I was acutely aware of my own sodden discomfort and the gaze of others on me.</p><p>I was ready, so ready, for this to be over.</p><p>To be free.</p><p>I had entertained fantasies of defying the Patriarch the instant my chains were loosed, but I had decided against it. Better to be circumspect and keep up the charade until the Duke had departed.</p><p>Once more, I stood before the altar. Pyotr Rostov swung his censer, sanctifying the dish that held the holy oil, then took up the dish, dipping his fingers into the oil. He offered another prayer in Vralian, then turned his attention to me. \u201cOne last step, Moirin,\u201d he repeated, his fingers glistening with oil.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d I raised my face obediently, ready for him to anoint me.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what he meant. \u201cVery good. Before God and all here assembled, pledge yourself to the Yeshuite faith on the sacred oath of your people.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, my mind a blank.</p><p>It felt as though the ground had crumbled beneath me, leaving me teetering on the edge of a precipice. This wasn\u2019t part of the chrismation ceremony. I knew it backwards and forwards, Aleksei had gone over it with me a hundred times. This was not part of it.</p><p>\u201cThe oath Berlik the Cursed swore and broke,\u201d the Patriarch reminded me. \u201cThe one you uttered to me once before. Swear it now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>If I swore it and broke it, I would lose my diadh-anam. If I swore it and kept it, I would lose my diadh-anam.</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cI can\u2019t, my lord.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>The Patriarch of Riva had not expected defiance. He frowned at me, holy oil dripping from the tips of his fingers. \u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>It had gotten very quiet in the temple. I could hear the low murmur of Aleksei translating for the Duke of Vralsturm, and faint whispers as those around him eavesdropped and passed on his words.</p><p>I\u2019d gone ice-cold beneath my damp robe. My mind worked frantically. \u201cI..... It would be blasphemy, my lord. I cannot swear an oath to Yeshua on the troth that binds me to my diadh-anam.\u201d My voice trembled. \u201cYou may as well ask me to swear it by the Maghuin Dhonn Herself! That cannot be right!\u201d</p><p>Over the course of months, I\u2019d gotten good at lying, good at dissembling. Not good enough. Not here, not now. He could see the panic in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI will be the judge of what is blasphemous or not, Moirin,\u201d Pyotr Rostov said in a smooth tone. \u201cNot you, a lowly catechumen. Will you swear the oath or not?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He lowered the dish of holy oil. \u201cThen I will cancel the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord.....\u201d My mouth had gone dry. \u201cPlease, no. I\u2019ve worked so very hard to obey you. This is your moment of triumph. Will you spoil it?\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch\u2019s eyes narrowed. I watched him weigh the decision. If he acceded, he would have his moment of mortal triumph intact and unspoiled, but it would be a lie, a holy rite violated in the temple of God. In the struggle for my soul, he would be acknowledging his failure.</p><p>All I could do was pray that his ambition outweighed his fanaticism.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Moirin. More sorry than you know. I take no pleasure in what must follow.\u201d He returned the dish to its stand, addressing the congregation in sonorous Vralian, his voice heavy with regret.</p><p>Shocked gasps rippled through the crowd. I didn\u2019t know enough Vralian to follow everything he said, but I didn\u2019t need to. Here and there, I caught words I knew. The reaction of the crowd and the look of dawning horror on Aleksei\u2019s face told me everything I needed to know. All my hard work, all my patience, everything had unraveled in a matter of heartbeats. All for one oath unsworn.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re condemning me to death, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Rostov didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cYou leave me no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo choice!\u201d My long-repressed anger returned ten-fold, fueled by mindless terror. \u201cOh, please, my lord! You have chosen everything! Everything! You have chosen which of the prophets you will heed, and which you will ignore! You have chosen to elevate the harshest strictures over the kindest of Yeshua\u2019s teaching!\u201d I yanked off my sodden head-scarf, hurling it away from me. \u201cYou have chosen this endless fascination with sins of the flesh!\u201d</p><p>His face darkened. \u201cMoirin, be silent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted at him. \u201cI have been silent long enough! Do you think I do not know how it aroused you to hear my confession? How many times did you fornicate with him?Did you pleasure her with your mouth?\u201d I asked, mimicking him. \u201cDo you think I did not know it made your rod harden and swell to hear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be silent!\u201d The Patriarch strode down from the dais and struck me hard across the face, knocking me to the floor in a tangle of chains and wet robes.</p><p>I scrambled backward, my head ringing, but I did not cease taunting him. \u201cDoes it harden even now, my lord?\u201d</p><p>He strode after me, reaching down to grasp my chains and haul me to my feet, raising his hand to strike another blow.</p><p>And then the Duke of Vralsturm and his men were there to intervene, easing us apart. I gasped with relief at the reprieve and gazed at the Duke\u2019s weather-beaten face, a spark of hope coming to me. I tried to think of a single word of Vralian, and failed. My wits were too scrambled. \u201cAleksei!\u201d I looked frantically for him, found him and caught his arm. \u201cAleksei, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.....\u201d Aleksei wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust translate for me!\u201d I said. He nodded reluctantly. Collecting myself as best I could, I turned to the Duke. \u201cMy lord, forgive me this scene. But I have been held prisoner here against my will for many months. I am a citizen of Terre d\u2019Ange and Alba, and descended from the royal houses of both nations.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei translated. The Duke listened and nodded, appraising me with his sharp blue-grey eyes. He asked a question, and Aleksei relayed it. \u201cDescended how so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will give him my genealogy if he wishes,\u201d I said. \u201cDaniel de la Courcel, the King of Terre d\u2019Ange, acknowledged me as kin. Ask the Patriarch himself; his own notes confirm it. I have no doubt his highness would reward my rescuer, as I have no doubt he would be most wroth if I were put to death here.\u201d</p><p>It was a gamble, but King Daniel had always been fond of me. I wished now I had presented myself to the Cruarch before I\u2019d left Alba.</p><p>Once again, Aleksei translated; once again, the Duke asked questions of him. These, Aleksei answered himself. The Duke bowed his head toward me and spoke at length, and there was regret in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I asked dully.</p><p>\u201cHe said.....\u201d Aleksei cleared his throat and stared at the pebbled floor. \u201cHe said what you say may be true, but you have sinned against the Church nonetheless. You are far from home. No one knows you are here, and no one will know if you die here. And although..... although it is a shame to destroy such exquisite beauty, any woman who can tempt the Patriarch of Riva to lose control of himself in the temple of God is too dangerous to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My last spark of hope guttered and died.</p><p>The Duke of Vralsturm spoke to the Patriarch briefly, then beckoned to his men. Together, they exited the temple.</p><p>In the wake of their departure, the crowd began to surge forward. They may not have understood all that had transpired, but they were ready to drag me to the town square and stone me here and now.</p><p>\u201cAleksei.....\u201d My voice was high with fear.</p><p>With only a moment\u2019s hesitation, he put himself between me and the crowd, reaching out his hands in a pleading gesture.</p><p>What would have happened if Pyotr Rostov had not addressed the crowd, I cannot say. But he did, and it quieted them. One by one, they began to file out of the temple.</p><p>I did not think it was much of a reprieve.</p><p>I was right.</p><p>The Patriarch turned to me. \u201cMoirin mac Fainche of the Maghuin Dhonn,\u201d he said with velvety malice. \u201cFor sins of the flesh, witchcraft, and blasphemy against the Church of Yeshua Ascendant, you will be put to death by stoning at dawn tomorrow. I recommend you spend the night meditating on your sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell, you stunted old pervert,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>He gave me a creamy smile, not trying to hide it for once. \u201cNephew, I think it best if you have no further contact with the witch. Luba, Valentina, escort her to her cell.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder at Aleksei as we left. He was staring at the floor again, which didn\u2019t bode well for me.</p><p>Luba was smiling, broadly and openly. For a piece of irony, it made her look pleasant and kind for the first time since I\u2019d known her. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to hear her burst into song.</p><p>Valentina was silent, her face shuttered and averted. When they made to leave, I caught her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lady,\u201d I said softly. \u201cFor such small kindnesses as you have shown me. My mother.....\u201d My voice broke. \u201cIf she knew, my mother would be glad that her daughter did not die entirely friendless.\u201d</p><p>She did not answer or meet my eyes, only freed my hand gently from her sleeve. They left, and I heard the key turn in the lock.</p><p>I was alone.</p><p>Tomorrow, I was going to die\u2014and quite horribly.</p><p>It took some time for the enormity of that notion to settle over me. I had faced death before, more than once. I wasn\u2019t afraid of death, not exactly. I had made peace with it. I knew what awaited me on the far side of the stone doorway. The precious spark of my diadh-anam shone inside me, a promise that the Maghuin Dhonn Herself would welcome me home, and I would be free at last. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dying itself was another matter.</p><p>I wondered how long it would take, and how much it would hurt. A lot, I thought. The bones of my face ached where the Patriarch had struck me, and my cheek was bruised and swollen.</p><p>I prayed.</p> <p>I cried.</p><p>I thought about all the people who would never know that I had died here and would always wonder what had befallen me. I wished I could speak to them. My mother, most of all\u2014and Bao, a close second.</p><p>What would become of him? If I were right and I died with my diadh-anam unextinguished, he would live, condemned to wander the earth in search of the missing half of his soul, never knowing for sure.</p><p>Mayhap it would be better if I were wrong.</p><p>I thought about everything I had done here in Riva, wondering what I could have done differently. Something. Nothing. If I had not lost my temper and sworn the sacred oath of the Maghuin Dhonn earlier, mayhap the Patriarch would not have sought to bind me with it\u2014or mayhap not. He had known of Berlik\u2019s oath. Mayhap if I had not baited the Patriarch in the temple, the Duke of Vralsturm would have relented and aided me.</p> <p>Mayhap.</p><p>Bao had accused me of being impulsive. He was right; he was usually right. But I had been patient for so very, very long; and Pyotr Rostov had already condemned me to death. I didn\u2019t know if it would have made a difference if I had held my tongue.</p><p>I leaned my head against the wall and watched the light change in my narrow window, mellowing to an afternoon glow, fading slowly to dusk, a painful reminder of the twilight that was forbidden to me.</p><p>Come dawn.....</p><p>They would gloat, those bedamned villagers. Hurling stones that broke my bones and tore my flesh, eking out a slow, painful death; oh yes, they would gloat, glorying in their almighty self-righteousness.</p><p>It was going to hurt a lot, for a long time. It was a bad way to die.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, slow tears leaking beneath my lids. I wished I could be brave and defiant on the morrow, but I was fairly sure I would just be terrified. And I was fairly sure the Patriarch had granted me this day\u2019s reprieve only that I might fully experience the depth of my terror.</p><p>No, I was sure.</p><p>When I heard the sound of a key turning in the lock of my cell door, I thought at first that I was dreaming.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>My narrow window was dark. I sat upright on my narrow bed, watching a gilded wedge of lamplight enter my chamber as a lone figure slipped through the door, tall and rangy.</p><p>\u201cAleksei,\u201d I breathed. \u201cYou\u2019ve risked everything to free me after all?\u201d</p><p>In the lamp-lit darkness, he shook his head. A silver key dangled from his fist on a chain. \u201cNot I, no. My mother.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-SIX</p> <p>Valentina; oh Valentina! \u201cHow?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Aleksei knelt at my feet, busying himself with the key, unlocking the shackles around my ankles. \u201cMy uncle takes tea after supper. From time to time, Mother puts a sedative in it to ease his rest and give the rest of us a measure of peace. A tincture of valerian. He\u2019s never known about it.\u201d He eased the cuffs from my ankles. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I wanted to leap to my feet and dance. \u201cBut..... you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stole the key and gave me a choice,\u201d he murmured, his head bowed. \u201cTo do this myself and see you to the border, and take my own freedom. Or to let her free you, and watch her suffer the punishment for it. I chose. Hands, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I held them out to him. \u201cYou chose this?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei gave me a pained, fleeting smile. \u201cWhat is the fifth commandment that God inscribed on Moishe\u2019s tablets?\u201d</p><p>This, too, I had memorized. \u201cHonor your mother and father.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cEven so.\u201d</p><p>One shackle opened. I raised my left hand, shaking it. I didn\u2019t feel any different yet, and a creeping fear filled me. I tried to take comfort from the spark of my diadh-anam inside me, but I was scared. What if that were the most I would ever feel? What if the damage done to me were permanent? What if God and Yeshua were punishing me after all? I had lied, I had violated the sanctity of their rites. I whispered a soft prayer for their forgiveness as Aleksei unlocked the second wrist cuff.</p><p>\u201cThat almost sounded genuine,\u201d he murmured, moving behind me to unlock the collar around my neck.</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased.\u201d Aleksei got the lock undone and removed the silver collar, the chains coming away with it.</p><p>My diadh-anam blazed riotously as my senses opened and expanded in a hectic rush, my awareness surging outward to embrace the world. All of my senses were suddenly keener, sharper, more alert.</p><p>I laughed aloud for the sheer joy of it. \u201cAleksei, Aleksei, I can see again! I can feel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he cautioned me, looking perplexed. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t blind, Moirin. Were you?\u201d</p><p>Bao. Where was Bao? I stood and turned instinctively, seeking the beacon of his diadh-anam.</p><p>It was far away, far to the south, and fainter than it ought to be even at such a distance. I frowned, wondering what that meant. Was he ill? Injured? It seemed I should have felt some flare of recognition in his diadh-anam at sensing mine unveiled after so long. But mayhap I was wrong. After all, this was uncharted territory. Insofar as I knew, no one had ever had the divine spark of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself divided and shared with another living soul.</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Aleksei, still looking perplexed. Fretting over Bao would have to wait. I had a long way to go before I was safe. Wherever he was, my magpie could take care of himself. \u201cNot blind, no, but something akin to it. The chains blocked my sense of magic in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Now he looked uneasy.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d I said to him. \u201cClose your eyes a moment.\u201d Although he didn\u2019t like it, he obeyed. I took a deep breath, let it out, took another and summoned the twilight, breathing it out over both of us.</p><p>It settled over me like an embrace, soft and gentle, drenching the lamp-lit cell in silvery-violet dusk, turning it into a magical place. It felt like a homecoming, like being reunited with a long-lost love.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNow, see.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei opened his eyes. \u201cOh!\u201d Wonder dawned over his features. \u201cIt\u2019s..... it\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d I breathed it deep into my lungs, along with the scent of pine-trees growing on the outskirts of town. I longed to touch their rough bark, listen to their slow thoughts. \u201cNow you\u2019ve seen the great and terrible sin of witchcraft at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAnd you..... you\u2019re beautiful in it.\u201d He smiled shyly at me. \u201cEven more so, I mean. And it doesn\u2019t feel like a sin.\u201d</p><p>I touched his cheek. \u201cThank you, my sweet boy. Now, how do we get ourselves safely away from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Caught up in the twilight\u2019s charm, he\u2019d nearly forgotten our plight. \u201cHere.\u201d He fetched a bundle from the floor and thrust it at me. \u201cFrom my mother. Clothing, shoes, a head-scarf. Bread and cheese, as much as she could get on short notice.\u201d He jingled a purse at his belt. \u201cShe had a little money. Not much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlessed Valentina,\u201d I murmured, shaking out the drab woolen dress. It was a good deal less conspicuous than my catechumen\u2019s white robe. \u201cDo we have waterskins? A striking kit? Bow and arrows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Realizing I was preparing to change my clothes, modest Aleksei turned his back on me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Moirin. I\u2019ve never done anything like this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d I shed the robe, donned the dress. Shoved my feet into the shoes, and wrapped the scarf around my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll find what we need along the way. You can turn around,\u201d I added.</p><p>He did, looking dubious. \u201cWe haven\u2019t much coin, truly.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of my tongue to say I\u2019d gladly steal whatever was needful when my gaze fell on the hateful, discarded chains. \u201cActually, we do.\u201d I picked up the chains. \u201cThese are nearly solid silver. They must be worth a small fortune.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei frowned. \u201cYou mean to steal them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sweet boy, I do,\u201d I said. \u201cAs fair exchange for the months of my life stolen from me. They were made for me, were they not? And I mean to sell them to a smith who will melt them down and ensure they are never, ever used again to bind someone against their will.\u201d</p><p>He was silent a moment.</p><p>I raised my brows at him. \u201cAleksei, whatever sins must be committed in the pursuit of freedom, I will gladly take on myself. If you are going to scruple at it, stay. Stay and take your punishment, and break your mother\u2019s heart. Only tell me first where I might find a smithy south of Riva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin, you can\u2019t go south.\u201d</p><p>I glanced in the direction of Bao\u2019s distant diadh-anam. \u201cOh, but I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right away,\u201d Aleksei said in stubborn tone. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly where my uncle will look for you. And he will look, believe me.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe cannot find me in the twilight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you work your magic while sleeping?\u201d he asked shrewdly. \u201cCan you be on guard every minute of every day? Do you imagine there\u2019s a single village between here and the border that doesn\u2019t remember you passing through it in those chains? It\u2019s not a sight one forgets. Any smith you approach would know you in an instant for the Patriarch\u2019s witch. Any baker in the market, any..... anyone!\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI may not have thought this through, but this part, I have. It\u2019s too dangerous to do exactly what my uncle will expect.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like it, but he had a point. \u201cWhere, then? We haven\u2019t much time to debate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUdinsk,\u201d Aleksei said promptly. \u201cIt\u2019s a city some days away to the northeast. It\u2019s a trade center. I thought I could find work there. I\u2019m sure we could find a smith willing to ask no questions, and aught we need to purchase for the journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe journey south,\u201d I said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIn two weeks\u2019 time, my uncle will realize his mistake and begin searching farther afield. Then we can slip through, amply provisioned, hidden by your magic when need be.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated.</p><p>Every impulse in me yearned to go south, toward Bao, to flee. To trust to my magic to conceal me, to my hard-won skills to allow me to survive. But I\u2019d ventured into Tatar territory alone despite being warned of the danger and nearly died because of it; and I\u2019d had all the supplies I thought I would need there. If I\u2019d learned nothing else from this ordeal, I\u2019d learned a measure of patience.</p><p>And, too, there was Aleksei to consider. He was betraying everything he held dear to help me. I owed it to him, and especially to his mother, Valentina, not to do anything rash and impulsive for once in my life.</p><p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Udinsk.\u201d</p><p>Cloaked in the twilight, we stole through the Patriarch\u2019s living quarters, Aleksei carrying bread and cheese and a few weighty yards of bespelled silver chains knotted in a worn woolen blanket.</p><p>My senses heightened in the twilight, I let my awareness roam through the quarters, touching on its inhabitants.</p><p>Stone and sea, it was good to feel wholly myself once more!</p><p>Pyotr Rostov slept deep and hard, and the acrid taste of his dreams reminded me of the sulfur and saltpeter of the Divine Thunder. Even in his sleep, he was angry. I shuddered, and looked elsewhere.</p><p>His wife, Luba, slept beside him, more lightly. She was smiling in her sleep, no doubt dreaming of selecting the perfect stone to hurl at me come dawn.</p><p>Valentina.....</p><p>She was awake, kneeling in the antechamber by the outer door, her head bowed and her arms wrapped around herself, filled with a despairing mix of hope and fear.</p><p>\u201cAleksei.\u201d I touched his arm. \u201cYour mother is waiting for us. I think she wishes to say farewell.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, he saw her huddled figure. A faint sound escaped him. Valentina didn\u2019t hear it, didn\u2019t raise her head. Aleksei glanced at me in alarm. \u201cMoirin.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweet boy.\u201d I brushed his cheek with my fingers. \u201cI told you, they cannot see or hear us in the twilight. I will try to bring her into it.\u201d</p><p>I breathed it in deeper, blew it softly over Valentina, spinning it around her like a gentle cocoon.</p><p>Her head came up. \u201cHow\u2014?\u201d She glanced all around her, eyes stretched wider than her son\u2019s. \u201cWhat is this? Am I dreaming?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her, helping her to her feet. \u201cNo, my lady. It is only a small piece of magic. I will release it if you like, but I think it is better if I don\u2019t. Your sister-in-law sleeps lightly, dreaming of cracking my skull open.\u201d</p><p>Valentina gave her broken laugh, hands rising involuntarily to stifle it. \u201cMoirin. It is you. So Aleksei..... he did it. He did it. Oh, God. God have mercy on me. I was afraid he wouldn\u2019t. Will you.....?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI will try.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her son. In the twilight, the tears in her eyes shone like stars. \u201cAleksei.....\u201d</p><p>He embraced her. \u201cMother.\u201d</p><p>Valentina clung to her tall, broad-shouldered son like a drowning woman\u2014and mayhap she was. My heart ached for the both of them. She tugged his head down to her shoulder and whispered somewhat in his ear. What she said to him, I could not say. Even if I could have heard it, I would not have listened.</p><p>Aleksei nodded, tears streaking his cheeks.</p><p>I peered through the small window set into the outer door. It was hard to gauge the hour in the twilight, but the summer nights were short, and every hour of darkness was precious. \u201cMy lady, I\u2019m sorry, but we have to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo.\u201d With an effort, she released her son, turning him loose. \u201cGo. For what it is worth, go with my blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mother\u2019s blessing is worth a great deal,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI will not forget this.\u201d I kissed her cheek. \u201cThank you, a thousand times over. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Valentina nodded. \u201cYou are a mother\u2019s child, too, Moirin. I can only begin to imagine how much she is missing you. For her sake, I pray you come home to her someday.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, it hurt.</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d It was all I could say, all I had to say. Valentina gave her son one last, long embrace, and then opened the door for us.</p><p>The street was empty and quiet. Aleksei squared his shoulders and began walking purposefully.</p><p>I ran after him. \u201cWait! Aleksei, you mean to go on foot?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a blank look. \u201cHow else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was brought here in a wagon. I know cart-horses are not ideal for riding, but it\u2019s faster than walking.\u201d I cast around with my senses. \u201cThe stable\u2019s over there, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin, you can\u2019t steal the Church\u2019s horses!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I can. Your precious Church didn\u2019t hesitate to steal me.\u201d Aleksei\u2019s delicate sensibilities were beginning to grate on my nerves. I set out in the direction of the stable. \u201cYou\u2019d best stay close to me,\u201d I said over my shoulder. \u201cElse you\u2019ll lose the cover of the twilight. I can only extend it so far, for so long.\u201d</p><p>He followed, silent.</p><p>The cart-horses were drowsing in their stalls, heads nodding low. I glanced around and quickly determined there was no riding tack, only the wagon and harness gear.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re not for riding,\u201d Aleksei murmured. \u201cMoirin, can we please go now?\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring him, I spun the twilight over one of the horses. He lifted his head, lambent eyes open and gleaming. I blew softly into his nostrils, touching his thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re a big, strong fellow, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I whispered. \u201cStrong enough to carry us both.\u201d The cart-horse pricked his ears in agreement and lipped at the trailing ends of my head-scarf. I smiled and unlatched the door to his stall.</p><p>\u201cMoirin!\u201d Aleksei sounded near to panic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d There was no mounting block, but the wagon would serve. I clambered onto it. The cart-horse moved obligingly into place for me. I grabbed a double fistful of his mane and swung myself astride. \u201cCome on,\u201d I said to Aleksei. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ride behind me.\u201d</p><p>He gazed uncertainly at me.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll turn him loose at the end of the day. Like as not, he\u2019ll find his way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might give our direction away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut not our destination, and we\u2019ll have gained a sizable lead. Aleksei, I haven\u2019t eaten in three days. Thanks to your uncle\u2019s penance, I have shooting pains in my knees. I\u2019m not even used to taking full strides. I won\u2019t get far on foot. So are you coming with me or not?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he climbed onto the wagon, then scrambled awkwardly astride behind me while the patient cart-horse stood motionless.</p> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d I asked when Aleksei was settled. Although he\u2019d wedged the bundle of supplies between us, his entire body was rigid at the forced contact with mine.</p><p>\u201cHow..... how are you controlling it?\u201d His voice sounded small.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said. \u201cI asked him if he\u2019s willing to carry us, and he is.\u201d I patted the horse\u2019s sturdy neck. \u201cSo hold on, because we\u2019re on our way whether you\u2019re ready or not.\u201d</p><p>The horse clopped steadily out of the stable, his abandoned stable-mate giving a low whicker. I wished we could have taken both of them, but it would have been too much effort to maintain a bond with both of them and keep my hold on the twilight. As it was, I was spreading myself thin.</p><p>On the street, I asked the cart-horse to pick up his pace. Once again, he pricked his ears in willing agreement and began walking at a good clip.</p><p>Behind me, Aleksei slid and jounced, nearly losing the bundle, grabbing for it and almost falling off in the process.</p><p>\u201cPass it to me.\u201d I reached backward. \u201cI\u2019ll hold it, and you can put your arms around my waist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.....\u201d He sounded miserable. \u201cIt\u2019s just that his back is so very broad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I struggled for patience. \u201cAleksei, give me the bedamned bundle and put your arms around my waist.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively, he did.</p><p>I settled the bundle of chains and supplies on the cart-horse\u2019s withers, holding it in place with one hand and knotting the other in his mane, then asked him again for a swifter pace. He answered by breaking into a brisk trot.</p><p>Aleksei exhaled sharply, his arms tightening around my waist. Now I felt the entire length of his body pressed against me, his thighs firm against mine. Despite everything, it felt very good.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well enjoy it,\u201d I said to him. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious business we\u2019re about,\u201d he protested. \u201cPlease don\u2019t try to scandalize me in the midst of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I let go the cart-horse\u2019s mane and touched Aleksei\u2019s knee lightly. \u201cI cannot begin to imagine what it\u2019s costing you to do this. I\u2019m very, very grateful, and I don\u2019t mean to bait you. In times of mortal danger, people often make jests. We\u2019d lose our wits if we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He relaxed a little. \u201cSo..... you were jesting?\u201d</p><p>Now he sounded disappointed. \u201cNo,\u201d I said gently. \u201cOnly teasing. It feels very good to have your arms around me, Aleksei.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>We rode in silence for a time while he contemplated that. The outskirts of Riva came into view and fell away behind us. The cart-horse continued at a steady trot. I glanced at the sky overhead, trying to determine if the moon was bright enough to see by if I released the twilight. Gauging it was, I let it go.</p><p>The gentle twilight faded, the world turning darker.</p><p>Behind me, Aleksei stiffened. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let the magic go for now,\u201d I said. \u201cNow that we\u2019re out of town, we\u2019re safe enough under cover of darkness. In daylight, we\u2019ll need it more.\u201d I yawned. \u201cI have to conserve my strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t do just anything you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a while longer. I breathed the Breath of Trees Growing, reveling in the presence of pine-trees along the road, listening to them dream of the sun\u2019s return. Gods, it felt good to be free! Never, ever would I take it for granted again.</p><p>I only wished I wasn\u2019t headed in the opposite direction from Bao. It worried me that the spark of his diadh-anam felt so far away and dim.</p><p>I pushed the thought away. Later. Survive first, worry later.</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d Aleksei\u2019s voice was low by my ear.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it, too.\u201d His arms tightened a bit. \u201cAnd you smell good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the odor of sanctity,\u201d I said, referencing one of the signs by which saints were known.</p><p>\u201cMoirin!\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat was a jest, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweet boy.\u201d I patted his knee. \u201cIt was a jest.\u201d</p><p>There was a hint of a smile in his voice. \u201cSo says my heretic saint.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>We rode through the night and into the day, alternating between trotting and walking. For a mercy, we were following the curve of the vast lake and were able to pause from time to time to water the cart-horse and ourselves.</p><p>Willing soul though he was, I felt our unlikely mount\u2019s strength begin to flag by midday, his steps beginning to plod. He was unaccustomed to carrying such a burden on his wide back. My own strength was failing, too. I was hoarding it as best I could, straining my eyes to catch sight of fellow travellers on the road so that I might shield us at need, but I was tired and hungry, and I began to find myself getting careless.</p><p>I daresay Aleksei felt it, too. When I suggested that we turn off the road, conceal ourselves in the pines, and catch a few hours of sleep, he agreed readily.</p><p>He watched in perplexity as I borrowed his little belt knife and cut a few long, narrow strips from the blanket in which we carried our supplies. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing, Moirin? Making some sort of charm?\u201d</p><p>I concentrated on braiding the strips together. \u201cHardly. I\u2019m making a hobble for this big fellow.\u201d I nodded at the cart-horse, who leaned down to lip at my head-scarf again. \u201cI think he\u2019s done in. We\u2019ll turn him loose before we go, but this way he\u2019ll rest without straying far, and we\u2019ll gain a few hours before his return is discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019d never have thought of such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might if you\u2019d spent three months in shackles,\u201d I said absently, knotting the makeshift hobble around the cart-horse\u2019s hairy fetlocks. \u201cSorry about this,\u201d I added to the horse, who responded by pulling the scarf clean off my head with his dexterous lips. I laughed and tugged it away from him, then kissed his velvety muzzle. \u201cWhat, do you think you\u2019re a goat now? Rest, great heart. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve nothing to feed you.\u201d I turned to find Aleksei gazing at me in wonder. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Realizing my head was bare, I touched my hair. \u201cThis? Aleksei, I will wear the scarf in public, I promise, but is there any chance you might endure it otherwise? It\u2019s very itchy.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the scarf. It\u2019s just..... you, Moirin. You\u2019re not like I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I sat cross-legged beside the blanket of supplies and cut myself a hunk of bread and cheese before passing them to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can put it into words.\u201d He took a modest portion of food for himself. \u201cFor all that you tease me, for all the sins you\u2019ve confessed to committing, there\u2019s something oddly..... innocent..... about you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cInnocent?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei nodded. \u201cSeeing you like this, yes.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cMayhap it\u2019s just that you\u2019re seeing me happy and free for the first time since you\u2019ve laid eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s something more.\u201d He rolled a hunk of brown bread in his hand, then whistled softly to the cart-horse, who came over to accept it gratefully, his lips nibbling Aleksei\u2019s palm. \u201cThey like bread, especially if you roll it like that,\u201d he added. \u201cI expect it\u2019s the salt from one\u2019s sweat. When I was a boy, I used to hide in the stables sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I chewed and swallowed a bite of my own. \u201cOh, aye? So did I when I was younger, when I visited Cillian at Innisclan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Cillian?\u201d</p><p>I forgot that unlike his uncle, Aleksei didn\u2019t have knowledge of the vast litany of my sins. He knew I had confessed to them, but he wasn\u2019t privy to all the salacious details. \u201cMy oldest friend, and my first lover.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei flushed, but he didn\u2019t look away. \u201cAre you trying to shock me because I called you innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it. Only do not mistake me for something I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He rolled another pellet of bread. \u201cI don\u2019t think I am.\u201d</p><p>I watched him feed it to the cart-horse. \u201cYou remind me of him a little. Cillian, that is.\u201d</p><p>His flush deepened. \u201cOh? How so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a similar build,\u201d I said. \u201cTall, long-limbed. And Cillian was a scholar, too, although it was tales of adventure and magic he loved.\u201d I smiled sadly. \u201cAnd he was only a little older than you when he died, I think.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei\u2019s face softened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I didn\u2019t know. How did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a cattle-raid,\u201d I murmured. \u201cHe was thrown and trampled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Aleksei repeated.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I was grateful for the simple gift of his sympathy, grateful that unlike his uncle, he was willing to allow me the privacy of my memories. I hadn\u2019t forgotten his kindness when I was dealing with the worst of my grief at hearing of Jehanne\u2019s death.</p><p>We ate together in companionable silence. When I had finished, I folded my head-scarf into a pillow, preparing to settle onto the pine-mast.</p><p>\u201cSleep for a few hours,\u201d I suggested. \u201cWe\u2019ll set out before dark, and walk through the night. It ought to be clear enough to see again, and it\u2019s safer.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf we do, we ought to reach the Ude River by noon tomorrow. I\u2019m hoping we can buy passage on a barge.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cAh, so you have thought this through, my hero.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei returned my smile wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s a poor excuse for a hero that has to be pushed by his mother into rescuing the maiden, then rely on the maiden to make their escape. But I am trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeroes are not made overnight,\u201d I murmured, curling up on the pine-mast and cushioning my head on the folded scarf and closing my eyes. \u201cI think you\u2019re doing very well.\u201d</p><p>Worn out by exertion and fear, I fell asleep almost immediately, although it was a restless sleep. I dreamed I was back in Riva, back in chains, scrubbing the temple floor under Luba\u2019s merciless gaze. Every time I thought I was finished with a mosaic square, she would point out ingrained dirt I had missed, forcing me to dip the scrub-brush back into the bucket of lye and begin over again, and it seemed to me in my dream that if I did not finish before the Patriarch came to inspect my work, I would be hauled to the town square and stoned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I awoke to low, slanting sunlight, the scent of pine-trees, and bird-song, and I laughed aloud for the sheer joy of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Aleksei mumbled, pushing himself upright. His tawny hair was disheveled with sleep and stuck about with pine needles. \u201cMoirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d I stretched luxuriously, arching my back and stretching my limbs as far as I could, free and unfettered. \u201cI\u2019m happy to find myself free, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>Aleksei gazed at me, his blue, blue eyes wide, his lips parted. Naamah\u2019s gift swirled between us. There was a question behind his eyes, and it was one that made the bright lady smile.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I smiled, too. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He ducked his head. \u201cWhat do you mean, yes?\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers through my hair, dislodging pine needles of my own. \u201cYou are wondering if I mean to honor my offer. I do. Only not here, not now.\u201d I probed my cheek with my fingertips, wincing at finding it still sore and swollen where Pyotr Rostov had struck me. \u201cLater, when we are safer, I will honor it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaamah\u2019s blessing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my sweet boy.\u201d I examined the raw, chafed marks the chains had left on my wrists and ankles. \u201cOnly if you wish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me, though.\u201d Aleksei\u2019s head came up. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care for you,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cIt is a gift I would like to give you, if you\u2019re willing to accept it. It is a gift I would gladly accept from you, if you are willing to offer it.\u201d I frowned, searching for words he would understand. \u201cIt is a sacrament, Aleksei. I could not offer it without love, although I do not know if it is the kind of love you mean when you ask if I love you.\u201d</p><p>He met my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not. Do you think you could, though? Come to love me?\u201d</p><p>A vision unfolded.</p><p>I\u2019d caught involuntary glimpses of others\u2019 memories before, but never of their dreams of what might be. Now, here, I saw Aleksei\u2019s\u2014and it made me catch my breath. Aleksei and I, together as man and wife, forging a new path in eastern Vralia, preaching a doctrine of love in which desire and innocence walked hand in hand. Aleksei and I, a new Edom the First Man and Yeva the All-Mother, sanctifying a new Garden of Eden.</p> <p>No, my diadh-anam whispered. No.</p><p>My eyes stung and watered. \u201cNo,\u201d I murmured, wiping at them. \u201cNo, Aleksei. Not like that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His throat worked. \u201cYou saw?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Aleksei\u2019s head dropped to his knees, his arms encircling them. \u201cI thought..... maybe. Maybe my uncle was wrong and this was what God and Yeshua willed after all. I have feared it, yearned for it, struggled against it for so long. Now, now that this has come to pass.....\u201d His broad shoulders rose and fell. \u201cI thought if I accepted it..... maybe.\u201d</p><p>I went to him, held him as I had longed to do before. \u201cSweet boy,\u201d I whispered against his temple. \u201cWhy do you struggle so hard to discern your God\u2019s will? Stop fighting, and let him reveal it to you. All will come clear in time.\u201d</p><p>Nearby, the cart-horse whickered as though in agreement.</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p> <p>I kissed his brow. \u201cTruly. Now, please, can we gather ourselves and take to the road?\u201d</p><p>After Aleksei went to scout to see that the road was clear, I cut the cart-horse\u2019s hobbles and we set out north on foot. The horse followed us for a while, peering after us through his forelock with great, liquid-dark eyes. I had to shoo him away, reminding him that his stable-mate would be missing him.</p><p>\u201cHe likes you,\u201d Aleksei commented.</p><p>\u201cAnimals usually do,\u201d I said. \u201cThough I suspect it had as much to do with the bits of bread you fed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you really talk to them?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter a fashion,\u201d I said. \u201cNot with words, not really. But I can touch their thoughts and feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you read mine,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened before. Only with memories. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to intrude. I don\u2019t always know what form the Maghuin Dhonn\u2019s gifts will take. It seems to change and grow as I get older.\u201d</p><p>He processed that in silence. The sun sank low in the west, gilding the surface of the lake and sending our shadows stretching sideways. I didn\u2019t relish the prospect of a long night\u2019s walk, but at least it was peaceful here, and I felt a great deal better after some food and a few hours of sleep.</p><p>I was young, and gods willing, the various aches and pains my ordeal had inflicted on me would vanish in time. The bruises would fade, the welts would heal, the stiffness would pass. In time, I hoped, the memory of the Patriarch\u2019s creamy smile as he heard my confession would fade, too, and the treasured memories he had violated would regain their luster.</p><p>I toyed with the jade bangle on my wrist as we walked, thinking about Aleksei\u2019s plight, thinking about invoking Naamah\u2019s blessing on Snow Tiger\u2019s behalf. It was a piece of irony that my effort to protect that memory had nearly gotten me killed. If I hadn\u2019t sworn the sacred oath in the Patriarch\u2019s presence, he might never have known what form it took. No one had ever recorded the exact wording, not even Rebbe Avraham. I could simply have lied in the temple and sworn a false oath.</p><p>And what if I had?</p><p>Mayhap Pyotr Rostov would have kept his word and freed me. And the moment I fled, I would have been in exactly the danger Aleksei had described\u2014alone, utterly dependent on my magic, conspicuous and vulnerable when my strength failed, sure to be pursued.</p><p>Instead, I had my awkward, fledgling hero to guide me, and the rudiments of a plan. Mayhap matters had fallen out for the best after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Aleksei broke the silence, nodding at the bangle. \u201cSome sort of charm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your obsession with charms?\u201d I smiled to take the sting out of my words. \u201cNo, Aleksei. It\u2019s a bracelet. It was a gift from the Emperor of Ch\u2019in\u2019s daughter.\u201d I held out my wrist. \u201cDo you see the color? It is the exact hue of a pool beneath the peak of White Jade Mountain, where the dragon gazes at his reflection. We jumped into that pool together from a very great height, the princess and I, and it was there that the dragon\u2019s immortal spirit was freed.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me. \u201cAre you teasing me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. You could ask your uncle if he were here; he\u2019s got it all written down. Only he made me say the dragon was a fallen spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was a dragon.\u201d It felt good to say it aloud, as though I were reclaiming the first of many truths the Patriarch had stolen.</p><p>The sun dipped beneath low mountains on the far side of the lake, and dusk, true dusk, settled over the empty road. Aleksei and I walked side by side, the only sound our steady footfalls and the faint jangling of the chains he carried in our bundle. I listened to the pine-trees murmur in the growing darkness.</p><p>\u201cMoirin, why not?\u201d Aleksei asked in a low voice. \u201cWhy are you so sure you couldn\u2019t love me? Is it that you\u2019re still mourning the young man you told me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my sweet boy,\u201d I said with regret. \u201cThat was a long time ago. The grief never goes away, but it gets easier to bear. And if it were because I was in mourning for a lost love, it would be my lady Jehanne I was grieving for, since that loss is fresh and the ache of it far from fading.\u201d</p><p>He stopped stock-still. \u201cThe D\u2019Angeline Queen?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him in surprise. \u201cI thought you knew. You were so kind to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you cared for her, yes, but.....\u201d Words failed him. \u201cDid my uncle know?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYes, Aleksei. What did you think I was shouting about in the temple? He took great pleasure in extracting every detail, twisting, perverting, and tarnishing my happiest memories.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei just stared at me.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I said to him. \u201cThis is why I could never be the wife and helpmate you envision. You\u2019re not seeing me as I am, Aleksei. Not yet. You\u2019re seeing me as you think I ought to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with wishing to see you perfected in God\u2019s eyes?\u201d he whispered. \u201cA God of love, not punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I set out walking again, forcing him to come after me. \u201cExcept that it will not happen. I told you before, I am a child of the Maghuin Dhonn, and I will die before I betray Her. And,\u201d I added, \u201cI am a child of Naamah and Anael, too. I cannot swear a sacred oath to serve them over the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, but I am grateful to allow Naamah to use me as her vessel when she sees fit. And when Anael the Good Steward makes his will known to me, I will obey that, too.\u201d</p><p>With his long legs, Aleksei caught up to me easily. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you cannot love me? The gods will not allow it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI am sorry, Aleksei, truly. I didn\u2019t know how you felt. And I thought you knew, I thought your uncle had shared the catalogue of my sins with you. It isn\u2019t only a question of faith. There\u2019s someone else.\u201d</p><p>His voice took on a savage note. \u201cOther than this Cillian, other than the D\u2019Angeline Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I said coolly. \u201cOther than Raphael de Mereliot, other than the carriage-driver not even your uncle knew about. Would you have me make my confession to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No, it\u2019s just.....\u201d His voice trailed away.</p><p>I sighed again. \u201cI know, I know! You had a dream, and I dashed it. You took me by surprise, you know. I didn\u2019t expect you to entertain such heretical fantasies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I struggled so hard against it?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy do you think I went to such extreme measures?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cOrdinary mortal desire was enough to terrify you. How was I to know it was more than just that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you weren\u2019t,\u201d Aleksei admitted. He walked without speaking for a while. \u201cSo who is he? This other?\u201d</p><p>Unable to help myself, I glanced over my shoulder toward the south where Bao\u2019s diadh-anam guttered so disturbingly low. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, and it\u2019s difficult to explain. There are parts of it you will find blasphemous. And I will tell you one day, but I don\u2019t feel like it tonight. He\u2019s very far away, looking for me in the wrong place, and I\u2019m worried about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where he is?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAlways, except when I was in chains.\u201d I rubbed my face wearily. \u201cWe\u2019re joined together, Bao and I.\u201d</p><p>Mercifully, Aleksei didn\u2019t press me. The dusk deepened, stars and a ghostly half-moon emerging in the soft violet-blue sky. The sound of bird-song faded. Dusk gave way to true darkness, the moon and stars brightening to light our way. Slowly and steadily, step by step, we made our way north.</p><p>An hour or so before dawn, I suggested that we break once more for sleep. I would need more rest if I were to be able to summon the twilight in daylight tomorrow. Aleksei nodded in agreement, and we left the road, stumbling through the pine-scented darkness until we found a good place to make camp.</p><p>Once again, I curled gratefully onto the pine-mast, half-asleep by the time I pillowed my head on my scarf.</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei\u2019s voice jolted me awake. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you truly love this other man, how can you offer to invoke Naamah\u2019s blessing for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh.....\u201d I yawned in the darkness. \u201cIt is possible to love more than one person, Aleksei. But that is one of Naamah\u2019s mysteries, and you will never understand it if you do not seek her blessing.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for so long I almost fell asleep again. \u201cI will pray on the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>True to Aleksei\u2019s prediction, we reached a settlement along the Ude River by mid-day.</p><p>Setting aside our differences, we worked together to hone our plans. He estimated it would take two days to reach Udinsk. I couldn\u2019t hold the twilight for both of us that long, not even close. But it was most important that the villagers in the settlement didn\u2019t see me, that we didn\u2019t leave behind rumors of a green-eyed witch.</p><p>So I would conceal myself while Aleksei sought to book passage for us. He was conspicuous too, but not as much as I was, with his half-Vralian features and his fluent tongue. When the time came to board the barge, I would swaddle myself in my scarf as best I could, keep my head low and myself largely silent. Aleksei would pass me off as his pilgrim bride, recently arrived in Vralia, unable to speak the language.</p><p>If the barge-hands suspected otherwise, so be it. At least we were carrying any rumors upriver, away from pursuit.</p><p>Gods be thanked, it worked.</p><p>Aleksei was beaming with pride when he came to fetch me out of concealment on the outskirts of town. \u201cMoirin! Moirin?\u201d</p><p>I let the twilight go.</p><p>He startled. \u201cYeshua have mercy! It\u2019s unnerving when you do that. Moirin, I did it! I booked passage for us on a fur-trapper\u2019s boat. It\u2019s a bit smelly and it took every coin I had, but I did it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him, genuinely pleased at his sense of pride. \u201cWell done, my hero. See, you\u2019ve a knack for this after all.\u201d</p><p>Color crept into his cheeks. Stone and sea, I\u2019d never known a man who blushed so easily! \u201cIt\u2019s a foolish thing to be proud of, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAleksei, I wasn\u2019t teasing.\u201d I laid my hand against his warm cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s a good plan, and I would never have thought of it. You were right; without you, I\u2019d be in dire trouble.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a pleasant journey. The boat was low and narrow, piled high with furs; and yes, they smelled, being scraped but uncured. The fur-trappers were taciturn fellows who concentrated on paddling, content to leave us alone except for stealing speculative glances at me from time to time. I strongly suspected Aleksei could have driven a harder bargain than he did, leaving us without coin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>We were on our way, headed east, outpacing any rumor of our presence. We had a little bit of bread and cheese left, and river water to drink. It wasn\u2019t the cleanest, but neither of us took sick from it. We had the silver chains of my captivity hidden in our bundle, and I was hopeful that we could dispose of them in Udinsk.</p><p>I had to wear that bedamned head-scarf at all times and pretend to a modesty I didn\u2019t possess, but I\u2019d had a great deal of recent practice at it.</p> <p>We were two and a half days on the river, and on the second day, Aleksei asked me about Bao. \u201cI do not mean to pry, Moirin,\u201d he said in a low, earnest voice. \u201cBut you\u2019re the most unusual person I\u2019ve ever met, and I cannot help but be curious what manner of man won your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.....\u201d I sighed. \u201cA rather infuriating one. And whether or not he\u2019s won my heart is a matter of debate. We\u2019re still working on that part. What is certain is that he carries half of my diadh-anam inside him.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei\u2019s blue eyes widened. \u201cYour soul-spark from your bear-goddess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were listening!\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly. \u201cYou were willing to die for it, Moirin. Yes, I was listening. I am trying to understand.\u201d</p> <p>So I told him about Bao\u2014not the sordid details his uncle would have extracted, but the deeper truth. How Master Lo\u2019s magpie and I had forged a friendship that had begun tipping toward love, stymied by the dragon\u2019s jealousy. How Bao had died, and how Master Lo had given his own life and taken half of my diadh-anam to restore him. How he had left, and I had gone after him, crossing the vast steppe to find him.</p><p>Unlike his uncle, Aleksei listened without judgment. \u201cAnd then we took you away from him,\u201d he said when I had finished.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I murmured. \u201cAnd the Great Khan sent him off in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><p>He touched my cheek, brushing away tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s a very sad story.\u201d He offered me another faint smile. \u201cNo wonder you were looking forward to a great love story in the scripture. You\u2019re living in one, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my eyes. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. You would probably not say that if you ever met Bao.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d Aleksei said, surprising me. \u201cHe sounds..... fearless. Interesting. Maybe even a match for you. You said you were worried about him. Why?\u201d</p> <p>My gaze turned unerringly south, drawn as though by a lodestone. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Something\u2019s wrong. His diadh-anam burns too low. And he hasn\u2019t moved since you took my chains off,\u201d I added. \u201cHe should have been able to sense my presence for days now. If he isn\u2019t coming toward me, something\u2019s keeping him from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that sure of him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBao had made his choice, and he\u2019s infernally stubborn. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei laced his hands around one knee. \u201cThat\u2019s why you were so determined to go south.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that you do,\u201d he said in a firm voice. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to make good on the debt you\u2019re owed for the suffering we caused you. And I swear..... I swear on my honor, I will not accept your offer.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cNaamah\u2019s blessing? Why ever not?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cWell..... it would be dishonorable, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Oh, no.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNaamah\u2019s blessing is a separate matter, and it has nothing to do with my relationship with Bao. Refuse it if you wish, but not on those grounds. I do not accept your promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d I added, overriding him, \u201cBao is the one who ran off and married a Tatar princess, so he hardly has reason to object.\u201d</p><p>It was Aleksei\u2019s turn to stare. \u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d skipped over that part. \u201cOh, yes. That\u2019s why the Great Khan was so eager to sell me into captivity and send Bao in the opposite direction. He was avenging a slight to his daughter\u2019s honor. And I do not blame him for being angry, but it was a rather extreme response if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei gave his head a bewildered shake. \u201cMoirin, I swear, the more I try to understand you, the less I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweet boy.\u201d I patted his hand. \u201cI told you, if you choose to accept Naamah\u2019s blessing, you will understand a great deal more.\u201d Regarding his troubled face, I softened my voice. \u201cIt is more than carnal congress, Aleksei\u2014so much more. We are both Naamah\u2019s children, you and I. It is a sacrament I offer to you. Whether or not you wish to accept it is entirely up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just seems so messy and complicated.\u201d He sounded dubious.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d I leaned back against a bale of fur. \u201cThe affairs of humanity tend to be messy and complicated. And at the same time, it\u2019s the simplest thing in the world.\u201d I remembered the look of wonder that had dawned on Snow Tiger\u2019s face when Naamah had taken her fears away, and smiled to myself. When all was said and done, I was glad I had kept that memory private. \u201cIt is a wondrous grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>I let my gaze linger on Aleksei\u2019s face, on his rugged cheekbones and full lips, on his eyes the color of rain-washed speedwell blossoms. \u201cI spoke the truth when I said it is a gift I would like to give you. But you cannot do it for my sake, Aleksei, no more than you can refuse it for Bao\u2019s. We are speaking of divine grace. It is your birthright as a child of Naamah\u2019s line, and it is her blessing that you refuse or accept.\u201d</p><p>He did understand then. \u201cJust as you refused Yeshua\u2019s blessing.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cEven so.\u201d</p><p>We spoke no more of the matter that day. The choice facing Aleksei had been cast in stark terms at last. At last, he had begun to understand that I was what I was, that I would never be what he wanted me to be. He understood that I offered what I could, no more and no less, and that I would leave him to seek Bao as soon as possible.</p><p>Usually, my instincts were good, but I had no idea what Aleksei would choose. He had been raised from birth to believe Naamah\u2019s gift was a curse, and Naamah was the whore-temptress who led Blessed Elua into apostasy.</p><p>There was nothing I could say to him to counter that belief. Faith cannot be proved, else it would not be faith. It can only be experienced. Whether or not Aleksei would allow himself to experience it, I could not say.</p><p>In truth, I did not even know which choice was right for him. He was a child of Naamah\u2019s line and he carried her gifts in his flesh and blood; but in his soul, he was a child of the One God and Yeshua, and no mistaking it. What I thought would bring healing to the damaged part of his spirit might well prove damaging in a different way if it strained and broke the covenant he knew so well and loved so deeply.</p><p>I hoped not, but it was possible.</p><p>In the scripture, the One God makes it clear that he is a jealous god; indeed, it is the first commandment he inscribed in stone on Moishe\u2019s tablets: I am the Lord your God, and you shall have no other gods before me.</p><p>And yet was that so different from the truth the Maghuin Dhonn Herself inscribed in the very souls of Her children, written in the living fire of divinity? I didn\u2019t know, but I didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>In every part of me, I knew it was true; I could set no other gods above Her, not without killing the divine spark within me. But nor did She begrudge me my heritage as Naamah\u2019s child. So long as I knew myself a child of the Maghuin Dhonn, She was content to allow me to worship others alongside Her.</p><p>If Aleksei chose to accept my offer, I hoped he would find that when freed from the tyranny of mortal men, their ambitions, and the harsh strictures they sought to set upon the nature of love and pleasure, the love of God and his son Yeshua was as vast, generous, and all-encompassing as that of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, my infinite bear-goddess whose worship was so often met with incredulity.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>THIRTY-NINE</p><p>The following day, we arrived in Udinsk.</p><p>Although it wasn\u2019t a very large city, it was bustling with traders and activity. I was glad to see it wasn\u2019t all Vralians. There were Tatar faces here and there, trading sheep, cattle, and goats for furs and timber. Any sort of diversity made it easier to blend into the crowd, and their brown skin made the honey-colored hue of my own less noticeable.</p><p>There were vendors selling food-stuff along the wharf where we disembarked, leaving behind our taciturn fur-trappers. I wished to all the gods that Aleksei hadn\u2019t spent our last coin on the passage. The smell of food\u2014ground, seasoned meat grilled on a stick, cooked cabbage stew with dumplings floating in it\u2014made my mouth water and my belly growl. Blessed Valentina had done her best, but it had been a long journey coming on the heels of three days\u2019 worth of fasting, and we\u2019d eaten the last of her bread and cheese yesterday.</p><p>I was starved for food, real food. I couldn\u2019t help but eye the vendors\u2019 fare longingly, breathing the savory aroma deep into my lungs.</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d Aleksei cleared his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly looking demure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201d I said plaintively. \u201cI\u2019m hungry and tired, and I would like a hot meal, a bath, and a clean place to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he said soothingly, jingling the bundle of chains. \u201cLet\u2019s find a place where you can call your magic safely, and I\u2019ll look for a smith willing to pay good coin for silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Oh, no.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo, I want to watch them melt. I need to see it done myself. I need to know for sure no one else will ever be forced to wear those chains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin, be reasonable!\u201d he pleaded with me. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve gotten rid of the chains, I won\u2019t worry so much. Until we do, the less you show yourself, the less chance there is that word will get back to Riva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not all that inconspicuous yourself, my blue-eyed boy.\u201d I pointed at the bundle. \u201cNot peddling those.\u201d</p><p>In the end, we struck a compromise. I would summon the twilight and accompany Aleksei cloaked in its concealment.</p><p>We found a narrow alley and ducked into it. Aleksei turned his back on me, shielding me from view, and I called the twilight. It was still a blessed relief to feel it settle over me, to watch the world turn soft and silvery.</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d Aleksei turned around.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I said, willing him to hear me. I reached out and touched his hand. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, please. It\u2019s unnerving. It feels like I\u2019m being touched by some unholy spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just me,\u201d I murmured. \u201cLead on, my hero.\u201d</p><p>There were three smithies in Udinsk, easily located by the smoke and clatter. The first smithy dealt only in weapons, horseshoes, tools, and the like, and sent us\u2014or at least, Aleksei and my invisible self\u2014on to the others.</p><p>The master smith at the second place gauged the chains with an appraising eye and asked questions. Too many questions. Aleksei flushed and stammered out the tale we had concocted about the chains being his wife\u2019s dowry, an heirloom from her mother, who was freed from vile servitude in a D\u2019Angeline pleasure-house. Even with my limited Vralian, I could tell he was doing a bad job of it. It wasn\u2019t a very convincing tale, and my earnest Yeshuite scholar lied very, very badly.</p><p>\u201cAleksei,\u201d I whispered in his ear, making him jump. \u201cNot here. Let\u2019s try the third smithy.\u201d</p><p>He twitched and bit back a reply, stuffing the chains back in the makeshift satchel and bidding the second smith a curt farewell.</p><p>To my everlasting relief, the thick-set master smith at the last place was every bit as taciturn as our fur-trappers. He examined the chains, bit into a link to test the quality of the silver, and made a gruff offer.</p><p>Aleksei countered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t haggle any better than he lied, but I was proud of him for making the effort. When he told the smith that he had promised his wife he wouldn\u2019t leave until the chains had been rendered molten silver, the fellow merely nodded without a trace of curiosity and placed a crucible on the forge, ordering an apprentice to feed the forge and pump the bellows.</p><p>It was a tedious process, but I didn\u2019t mind. It was worth it to see those bedamned chains destroyed.</p><p>While the crucible heated and Aleksei hovered nervously, I wandered the smithy unseen, examining a tray of wares on display. Some of the work was surprisingly lovely and delicate\u2014brooches and necklaces set with gems. Amber, I thought, although it was hard to tell in the twilight. I glanced at the master smith with his bushy beard and thick, blunt fingers, wondering what inspired him to create such delicate beauty.</p><p>I touched his work lightly, thinking of Terre d\u2019Ange and all the careless riches that had been bestowed on me there.</p><p>Of Jehanne, commissioning her former adversaries at Atelier Favrielle to make a sensuous gown and an elaborate headpiece with gilded branches and garnet berries for me to wear on the Longest Night.</p><p>Of how she had smiled and stroked my cheek. I\u2019ve no objection to you looking as stunning as possible now that you\u2019re mine, Moirin.</p><p>It made my heart ache, but it was a good memory, too. It had surprised and delighted me to find such an unexpected streak of generosity in Jehanne. On the Longest Night, she\u2019d had living pine-trees brought in to decorate the great hall in the Palace; immense evergreen trees in huge pots, their tops reaching for the ceiling high overhead, releasing their fragrance into the hall, their branches hung about with sparkling glass icicles. No one had ever conceived of adorning the hall on that scale before. She had done it just to please me.</p><p>I looked across the smithy at Aleksei, the forge-light flickering over his features. I wondered if he could ever understand that it was a blessing, not a sin, to be graced with more than one love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It could be complicated; of course it could be complicated. And it opened one up to the possibility of more pain and loss.</p><p>Still, it was a blessing I would never relinquish. Love, genuine love, was always a cause for joy.</p><p>At last the crucible reached the proper temperature, glowing bright silver in the twilight. The smith began feeding the chains into its maw, and I drifted over to observe the process, standing unseen at Aleksei\u2019s shoulder and peering into the crucible. Slowly, slowly, the chains and shackles began to glow with heat, the perfect links softening, the cursed lines of each perfectly etched sigil and inscription beginning to blur.</p> <p>It was profoundly satisfying.</p><p>Once or twice, Aleksei shifted restlessly, glancing around as though to ask if I were ready to leave, but I wasn\u2019t content until those chains were altogether gone forever, reduced to a seething mass of molten silver. Then, and only then, did I whisper in his ear that I was ready to go.</p><p>Outside in the cool air, it was hard to contain my exhilaration. Those hateful chains were gone, gone, gone. Oh, I knew they could be forged anew, but for now, they were gone. Even if the Patriarch found me, he couldn\u2019t bind my spirit. Those chains would buy my passage out of Vralia. I laughed and spun around Aleksei in circles as he led us back to the narrow alley where I could release the twilight safely.</p><p>He smiled wryly when I did. \u201cYou look positively giddy, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to look it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, do. It\u2019s nice, though,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Until we fled, I\u2019d never seen you happy. I imagine.....\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI imagine it would make a person want to go to any length to coax such a dazzling smile from you.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cAre you turning romantic on me after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Aleksei frowned a little, nodding to himself. \u201cMayhap I am. It\u2019s a bit like trying on a strange garment. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks well on you,\u201d I said. \u201cBut if the fit doesn\u2019t suit you, you needn\u2019t keep it. However, since we\u2019re posing as husband and wife, you may as well wear it a while longer.\u201d I took his arm, resting my fingers lightly on his forearm. He gazed at my hand as though it were a foreign object. \u201cHere.\u201d I adjusted the angle of his elbow. \u201cThis is how you would escort your beloved, at least in Terre d\u2019Ange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike so?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cAye, perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Naamah\u2019s gift stirred between us, coils as hot and bright as the molten silver roiling in the crucible.</p><p>Aleksei tensed, but he didn\u2019t pull away from me. He returned my smile, and there was yearning in his eyes, but there was sorrow and regret, too. \u201cLet\u2019s find an inn, and a hot meal for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a bath,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAnd a bath,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>There were several inns to choose from in Udinsk. We found a quiet one on the outskirts of town run by a devout Yeshuite couple. They regarded me warily at first, but I kept my eyes modestly downcast and Aleksei\u2019s earnestness soon won them over. It was too late for a bath that day, but they offered us an ample supper and a private room, with the promise of a bath on the morrow\u2014a hot bath, if we were willing to pay extra.</p><p>\u201cCan we, please?\u201d I begged Aleksei. \u201cI know we can\u2019t afford to be wasteful, but just this once?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I kissed his cheek, making him blush. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d</p> <p>It won a smile from the innkeepers. So they were not so dour after all that they could not be touched by a pair of young newlyweds in love, the shy husband indulging his foreign bride in a small luxury.</p><p>It was such a pleasant fiction, I almost wished it were true.</p><p>That evening we dined on roasted chicken generously basted with butter, the skin a crisp golden brown, with stewed cabbage and dumplings on the side. It tasted like the best thing I\u2019d ever eaten, and when I complimented our hostess in my halting Vralian, she seemed genuinely pleased.</p><p>Even Aleksei relaxed over the meal, setting aside his abstemious discipline to eat with rare gusto. I was glad to see it. I knew what young men\u2019s appetites were like. If I was hungry, he had to be ravenous. He was too young for the ascetic lifestyle he led. The hollows of his cheeks were too gaunt beneath those rugged cheekbones with their perfect D\u2019Angeline symmetry, his rangy, long-limbed body too rawboned.</p><p>If he were my husband, I thought, I\u2019d take better care of him. The thought filled me with unexpected tenderness.</p><p>\u201cMoirin, why are you looking at me that way?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I bent my head to my plate, knowing it was unfair to give him even a hint of false hope. \u201cOh, no reason.\u201d</p><p>Once our hosts escorted us to our chamber and the door closed behind us, the pleasant fiction ended. There was one bed in the chamber, big enough for two, but with little room to spare. Aleksei eyed it sidelong, nervous as a green-broken colt shying at a fence, fidgeting with the worn blanket that had served to carry our possessions. \u201cI..... I will sleep on the floor. I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMortification of the flesh?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>I was sorry, but not surprised. \u201cAs you wish, sweet boy,\u201d I murmured, turning back the bed-linens. \u201cSleep well.\u201d</p><p>FORTY</p><p>I slept.</p><p>I slept without dreams, long and hard and deep. I slept the sleep of finding respite after profound fear and exhaustions\u2014luxurious sleep, healing sleep. I slept well past dawn and awoke to slanting sunlight and a sense of being watched.</p><p>Opening my eyes, I found Aleksei sitting awkwardly on the foot of the bed, his hands clasped in his lap.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been watching me?\u201d I asked sleepily.</p><p>\u201cHours,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I propped myself on my elbows. \u201cDid you not sleep well?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Half-awake, I yawned and ran a hand through my hair, untangling the silken strands. It had grown a few inches since Luba had cropped it, long enough to fall over my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Tonight, you will take the bed, and I the floor. You\u2019ll sleep better for it, I promise.\u201d I paused. \u201cIs there some reason you\u2019re staring at me, Aleksei?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>It was one word, one syllable, but something in the way he spoke it caught my attention. That, and the way he was sitting\u2014awkwardly, aye, and yet as still and grave as a carved saint.</p><p>I hauled myself upright, rubbed my eyes, and shook my head, trying to dispel the last dregs of sleep. \u201cI am listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin.....\u201d</p><p>I waited. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei took a deep breath. \u201cI have been thinking. And praying. And yes, watching you while you slept. Watching you at your most vulnerable, with no magic to protect and conceal you, no teasing to bait and entice me. No tales of depravity to shock me. I have been trying to see that unclean spirit in you which seeks to tempt me and lead me astray.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to speak.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He raised one hand, his face solemn. \u201cI don\u2019t see it, Moirin. I don\u2019t. Only you, mortal and fallible, and..... yourself. Beautiful, yes. Impetuous. Uncanny, to be sure. But a girl, only a girl, too\u2014one apt to kiss a horse on the nose, and quick to delight in a meal of roasted chicken and dumplings. A mother\u2019s child far from home. And I have been asking myself, if it is not to fulfill my uncle\u2019s dream, why has God set you in my path?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo test you?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Aleksei spread both hands. \u201cIf that is so, I have already failed. I have betrayed my uncle to aid you. Does it matter how much farther I fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d His chest rose and fell as he took another sharp breath. \u201cAnd so..... so I am thinking, I will never know if I do not accept what you offer. And I believe strongly enough in Yeshua\u2019s forgiveness that I am willing to risk damnation in pursuit of truth.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it, I laughed aloud for the sheer joy of it; and I flung myself forward, putting my arms around Aleksei\u2019s neck, kissing his face. \u201cYou mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d He pushed me away, blushing furiously. \u201cOnly not this very moment, all right? Give me some time to grow accustomed to the notion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I sat back on my heels, beaming at him.</p><p>He scowled. \u201cYou needn\u2019t look so pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d I asked. \u201cI am pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo have won?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Gods, he was as infuriating as Bao in his own prickly way. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d I took one of Aleksei\u2019s hands and kissed it. \u201cYour choice makes me happy, sweet boy. That\u2019s all. I pray it will make you happy, too.\u201d</p><p>It mollified him, and restored a sense of brightness to the day. In the common room, we broke our fast with brown bread and fresh-churned butter. Our hostess promised a hot bath would be made ready in a few hours\u2019 time, so we set out for the marketplace to begin purchasing supplies for the journey south.</p><p>I was happy, happy with Aleksei\u2019s choice, happy that he wasn\u2019t fussing about me needing to conceal myself today. Those bedamned chains had been a weight on both our minds. And in truth, he needed my counsel to provision us for the journey. I saw to it that we spent our coin wisely.</p><p>In a rag-merchant\u2019s shop, we bought a canvas satchel, a spare blanket, and a change of clothing for both of us. A leather-worker sold us a pair of generous waterskins, and also a pair of well-made boots for me to replace the shoes Valentina had given me, which pinched my feet and gave me blisters. We purchased several tallow candles and a flint-striking kit from a chandler.</p><p>Other than a sack of barley we bought, we decided food supplies could wait a few days. Aleksei reckoned it best if we gave it a week before heading south. Still, we identified a smoke-house where we could purchase dried meat, and a baker and a cheese-maker for additional, fresher fare.</p><p>Our greatest expense would be horses and tack, and both of us were eager to have the matter settled and our escape secured. There was one horse-trader in the city, a squinty-eyed fellow. I didn\u2019t like the look of him, and I liked him less when he offered to sell us a sway-backed mare, an elderly gelding, and a spavined pack-horse for an outrageous price.</p><p>When Aleksei glanced at me in inquiry, I shook my head. \u201cWalk away,\u201d I murmured in D\u2019Angeline. \u201cDon\u2019t argue, don\u2019t haggle. Just walk away in disgust.\u201d</p><p>He did, me at his side.</p><p>The horse-trader ran after us, protesting and apologizing, claiming that he had merely been testing us to see if we were any judges of horse-flesh.</p><p>It took the better part of an hour to conclude a deal with him, but in the end, we struck a bargain to purchase a trio of sturdy little horses, as well as tack and grain. After living on the steppe, I could tell that these horses had Tatar stock mixed in their lineage, and I knew full well how swiftly and willingly they travelled. After some more haggling, the squinty-eyed fellow agreed to board them for another week for an additional fee.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s done, then,\u201d Aleksei said after we left the horse-trader. He looked pleased with himself. \u201cAre we finished?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll want a tent. Mayhap there are sail-cloth merchants along the wharf who make such things. And a pot..... it might be best if you returned to the smithy alone. We don\u2019t want him linking my face to those chains. And a bow and arrows, if we can find a fletcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.....\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ve never shot a bow, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Aleksei looked dubious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve shot for the pot since I was ten years old,\u201d I told him. \u201cBelieve me, after days of dried meat, you\u2019ll be grateful for fresh when we can get it. Besides, I\u2019ll feel safer with a bow at hand. One never knows what one might encounter on the road.\u201d</p><p>It seemed there was no fletcher in the city of Udinsk, but our inquiries led us to a camp of Tatar traders on the outskirts of town. Given my history with the Great Khan, I was reluctant to approach them; but Aleksei didn\u2019t speak the Tatar tongue, and I was determined to procure a bow for myself.</p><p>The sight of felted gers with smoke trickling out of the holes at the apex of their domes made me feel nostalgic. A young woman at the first ger we tried greeted us politely and directed us to seek out a fellow named Vachir, a renowned archer.</p><p>\u201cHe may have a bow to sell you, or he may not,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not know.\u201d</p><p>I thanked her. \u201cMay your herds prosper, my lady.\u201d</p><p>We found this Vachir some distance away, squatting outside his ger and working on the very thing I coveted, a fine-looking bow. I began to greet him in the Tatar tongue when he glanced up, and my heart skipped a beat.</p><p>I knew him.</p><p>His eyes widened, and he rose to his feet. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d Aleksei said behind me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know him,\u201d I said helplessly. \u201cOr at least I\u2019ve met him. More to the point, he knows who I am.\u201d</p><p>Another man would have sworn; Aleksei\u2019s voice tightened. \u201cI knew this was a bad idea!\u201d</p><p>The fellow came forward, unfinished bow in one hand. I took a step backward, bumping into Aleksei. The renowned Tatar archer Vachir, who happened to be the last man I\u2019d defeated in an archery contest, smiled quietly and clapped his free hand on my shoulder. \u201cI am pleased to see you alive, lady,\u201d he said with a gentleness that reminded me of Batu and Checheg. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I blinked. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>He blinked back at me. \u201cYes, of course! It was a fair contest. I have no quarrel with you. Many wondered what befell you when you vanished. I would hear your tale. Will you accept the hospitality of my roof?\u201d</p><p>I relaxed. \u201cIt would be an honor.\u201d</p> <p>With a bewildered Aleksei trailing behind me, I followed Vachir into his ger. He introduced us to his wife, Arigh, who served us bowls of hot, salty tea, the steaming liquid\u2019s surface slick with butter-fat.</p><p>Beneath the felted dome, I told them how the Great Khan Naram had betrayed me to the Vralians. It was impulsive, aye, but all my instincts told me I could trust them. They listened with disapproval, shaking their heads.</p><p>\u201cBatu\u2019s tribe had acknowledged you as kin,\u201d Arigh said firmly. \u201cNot even the Khan himself had the right to do what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin, you will explain all this to me, will you not?\u201d Aleksei asked in a low voice.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cMy lord, my lady, do you know what happened to Bao? General Arslan\u2019s son who wed the Khan\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p> <p>They exchanged a glance and shook their heads. \u201cThat young man vanished, too,\u201d Vachir said. \u201cNo one knows where or why. Only that the Great Khan\u2019s daughter Erdene was very angry at her father.\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeking the young man?\u201d Arigh asked in a gentle voice.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d I spared a guilty glance at Aleksei. \u201cHe\u2019s nowhere close, though. Far away. Right now, I come seeking to purchase a bow for the journey. My quest led me to you.\u201d</p><p>Husband and wife exchanged another look. Arigh rose and went to the back of the ger, returning with a Tatar-style bow smaller than the one Vachir had been working on outside, as well as a quiver of arrows.</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d she said simply. \u201cMy husband made it for me. I wish you to have it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour own?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo, I cannot accept it.\u201d</p><p>She thrust it at me. \u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it, please,\u201d Vachir added. \u201cI will make her another. It will go a little way toward settling the debt you are owed.\u201d</p><p>I closed my fingers around the bow. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Vachir smiled, his eyes crinkling. \u201cWould you have me set a price on it? I will, then. Give me a chance to reclaim my honor. Grant me a rematch, here and now.\u201d He saw me hesitate. \u201cYou are fearful. I promise you, no one among us will endanger you. I have granted you hospitality. I swear by the sky itself, we will protect your secret as our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d I smiled back at him. \u201cA rematch.\u201d</p><p>It being a Tatar encampment, naturally there was an archery range with targets already established. Word swept through the camp as we ventured out to the range, and folk abandoned their chores to watch.</p><p>\u201cMoirin, this is foolish!\u201d Aleksei pleaded with me. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re doing, I wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said. \u201cI trust them.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in mute dismay.</p><p>Vachir and I agreed to a simple contest\u2014the best of three shots at the distance at which we had last competed. He let me take a couple of practice shots to accustom myself to the feel of a new bow. It was different, very different, from the yew-wood bow my uncle Mabon had made me. It was shorter and stiffer, and the ends curved sharply outward, making for a tighter, more concentrated draw, the bow recoiling sharply when the string was loosed.</p><p>On my first shot, I missed the target altogether, provoking good-natured laughter from the onlookers. But I got the feel of it and adjusted quickly, acquitting myself well enough with my three official shots.</p><p>And then Vachir stepped up to the mark, drawing and releasing three times in quick succession, clustering three arrows in the center of the crude red heart painted on the stuffed target.</p><p>I laughed and bowed to him in the Ch\u2019in manner, one hand clasped over the other. \u201cYour honor is restored.\u201d</p><p>He smiled his quiet smile. \u201cI suspect we would be closer matched if you had more time to practice with an unfamiliar bow. May it serve you well, lady archer.\u201d</p><p>After I had thanked Vachir and Arigh for their generous gift one last time, Aleksei and I took our leave of the Tatar camp. I gave him the bow and quiver to carry, reckoning it would look less conspicuous on the streets of Udinsk. He listened silently to my explanation of how I had come to compete against Vachir in the archery contest at the spring gathering.</p><p>\u201cAre you angry?\u201d I asked when I had finished. \u201cTruly, I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I didn\u2019t think we could trust them. The laws of hospitality are sacred among the Tatars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot angry, no,\u201d Aleksei said slowly. \u201cYou lived among them, you know their ways. It was just..... strange..... seeing you thusly. Strange, and beautiful. It made me understand why the old Hellenes gave one of their goddesses a bow. Every time I think I am coming to know you, Moirin, I discover a new you. It\u2019s as though I turned a corner I thought was familiar, and found myself in a hallway I hadn\u2019t known existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how to respond.</p><p>He gave me a sidelong glance. \u201cAre there many more of you?\u201d</p><p>I thought about it. \u201cWell, there is the Moirin of Terre d\u2019Ange who served as royal companion to the Queen, who went about in jewels and finery, attending balls and concerts and poetry recitals. And there is the Moirin who was Master Lo Feng\u2019s pupil, and learned to master the Five Styles of Breathing and studied the Way. But they are all me, Aleksei. Does it trouble you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve only ever been one person, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>I took his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re an uncut gem, sweet boy. Time will reveal your facets. The Aleksei I met three months ago is not the Aleksei who offered to teach me to lie to his uncle, and that young man is not the Aleksei who plotted our escape. Of a surety, none of them are the Aleksei who consented this very morning to accept Naamah\u2019s blessing.\u201d I raised my brows. \u201cOr had you forgotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Aleksei flushed and looked downward, his dark lashes shuttering his eyes. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I squeezed his arm. \u201cNow let us see if that bath is ready.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-ONE</p><p>The bathing-chamber was small and steamy, the tin tub was small and cramped\u2014and the bath was altogether a glorious thing. It was the first hot bath I\u2019d had since leaving Shuntian, and the first time in months I\u2019d been able to bathe without chains rattling and clanking around me, and shackles chafing my skin. If I hadn\u2019t had to share it with Aleksei, I\u2019d have stayed in that tub until the water cooled.</p><p>It was worth every cent it cost.</p><p>Such a simple thing; and yet it felt as though I\u2019d taken a step further toward reclaiming myself, washing the taint of the Patriarch\u2019s touch from my soul even as I washed the grime from the journey from my skin.</p><p>Afterward, I found myself humming. To be sure, all was not right with the world. Distant Bao and his low-burning diadh-anam were never far from my thoughts; and I was a long way from being safely out of Vralia.</p><p>But yesterday I had been penniless, tired, and hungry, with scarce a possession in the world. Today, I had nearly everything I would need to set out on a long journey. I was well fed, well rested, and clean.</p><p>And today I was on Naamah\u2019s business, which made me happy.</p><p>I had assumed my modest, blushing boy would want to wait for nightfall and the cover of darkness to invoke Naamah\u2019s blessing, that I might even have to coax him into letting me light a candle.</p><p>Much to my delight, I was wrong.</p><p>I sensed it in the common room where our hostess, whose name was Polina, served us leftover chicken and dumplings for a midday meal. Clean and damp from his bath, Aleksei stole covert glances at me as we dined, and I could sense the yearning rising in him, an aching hunger I longed to assuage.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to wait for nightfall, do you?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was low and steady; and although he blushed, he held my gaze without flinching. \u201cI want to see you, Moirin. All of you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, rose, and held out my hand to him. \u201cLet us go, then.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, nodded in agreement, and took my hand. As we left the common room together, our hostess Polina gazed after us with a maternal look of habitual disapproval mixed with indulgence.</p><p>In the bedchamber, I closed the door and latched it. Aleksei glanced around the sunlit room. \u201cIt does seem very bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bright?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. I will not hide from this.\u201d</p><p>I fetched one of the tallow candles we had purchased earlier that day. It took several tries to kindle it with the flint striker.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn offering to Naamah.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cIt should be incense, but I thought you\u2019d take it amiss if I stole some from a temple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike as not.\u201d Aleksei tried to smile back at me, but it came out as an anxious grimace, tension beginning to war with desire in him. He took another deep breath, shuddering as he exhaled. \u201cWhat..... what am I supposed to be doing, Moirin? You will have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, sweet boy.\u201d I laid one hand on his chest. \u201cI am going to pray to Naamah. If you like, you may pray with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cBut I will keep you company if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice.\u201d After removing my shoes, I knelt on the wooden floor, sitting on my heels and fixing my gaze on the candle- flame, barely visible in the bright daylight. Aleksei knelt beside me, quiet and still, doing his best to contain his nerves.</p><p>I prayed.</p><p>As strongly as I felt Naamah\u2019s presence in the gift that Aleksei and I shared, it took a long time before I was able to sense her will. I had sought to seduce Aleksei toward my own ends; I carried a burden of resentment that I had failed, a burden of resentment toward his uncle and his aunt; and aye, a lingering burden of resentment toward God and his son Yeshua.</p><p>I had to let go of those things, offer them up.</p><p>I did.</p><p>The bright lady smiled, but she remained silent. I concentrated on the flickering candle-flame, willing my heart to be open and my ears to hear.</p><p>\u201cYou wished this, O brightest of goddesses,\u201d I whispered in Alban, reverting to the tongue of my birth. \u201cWill you not grant your blessing to this hurt and damaged child of yours? I offer myself as your vessel.\u201d</p><p>When it came, it came in a rush, a sense of Naamah\u2019s grace settling over me like a cloak of sunlight, like an embrace, like the tenderest of kisses, making my heart ache, setting the doves to fluttering in my belly. She was here, present between us. I drew a shaking breath, tears filling my eyes, words filling my mouth.</p><p>\u201cAleksei.....\u201d</p><p>He nodded, wordless.</p><p>I laid my hand on his chest again, spreading my fingers, feeling his strong, young heart pounding beneath my touch. \u201cWhat you carry is no curse, but a gift. Like any gift, it can be used for good or evil. If you use it wisely and kindly, it will bring only joy, and never sorrow. Trust your heart to guide you. Take your shame, and offer it to God. Let him burn it away until only what is pure remains.\u201d</p><p>Naamah\u2019s grace expanded, encompassing Aleksei. He caught his breath, a single, gasping sob escaping him.</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand, not wholly. But her words were meant for him, not me. \u201cIs all well?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Wonder dawned in his blue, blue eyes. \u201cOh, yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I shifted, straddling his knees. \u201cI am going to kiss you now.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei smiled through his tears. \u201cDo you think you need to warn me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, I cupped his face in my hands. He closed his eyes, tears trickling beneath his lashes. I brushed them away with my thumbs, kissed the salty trails they left behind on his skin. I kissed his warm, firm lips until I felt them soften, and parted them with the tip of my tongue, letting it touch his.</p><p>He jerked back, eyes open and wide. \u201cIs that..... customary?\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. \u201cYes. Did you not like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI..... don\u2019t know.\u201d Aleksei looked at me with that extraordinary earnestness. \u201cWill you do it again, please?\u201d</p><p>I kissed him again. This time, his lips parted more readily. I let my tongue slip between them, finding his and teasing it, coaxing and retreating. I let my hands slide upward into his damp, tawny hair. Let myself lean farther forward, pressing my breasts against his chest. Gods, it felt good.</p><p>Aleksei groaned into my mouth, his arms encircling my waist hard, his hands pressing against my back. In the bright sunlight, he pulled me down atop him, kissing me fervently.</p><p>\u201cNo sin?\u201d I asked, breathless.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo sin.\u201d He tugged away my head-scarf. \u201cWhy are you wearing this? You hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>He stroked my hair. \u201cIt is as soft as it looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d I kissed his throat, biting softly at his skin.</p><p>He groaned again, his back arching. \u201cMoirin, don\u2019t..... don\u2019t. It\u2019s too much. I want to see you. I need to see you.\u201d</p><p>I sat back on my heels. \u201cThen do.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei rose. I let him pull me to my feet. His big hands clutched folds of my drab woolen dress, lifting it and easing it over my head, discarding it. His hands tugged down my undergarments, and I stepped out of them.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d With profound reverence, he took his deity\u2019s name in vain, his voice shaking as he gazed at me. \u201cOh, God! Moirin. You are so very, very beautiful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d I unlaced his shirt and removed it deftly. \u201cSo are you, sweet Aleksei.\u201d His pale skin gleamed in the sunlight, stretched taut over his angular bones. I trailed my fingertips over the jutting ridges of his collarbones, over his hard chest and his lean belly. I slid one finger along the waist of his breeches, glancing up at him. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Kneeling, I unlaced his breeches and eased them down over his narrow hips. His erect phallus sprang free, straining so hard it looked as though it must hurt. I blew softly on it, and Aleksei groaned at the touch of my warm breath.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t..... don\u2019t.....\u201d He breathed raggedly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it unclean?\u201d I stroked his phallus lightly, feeling the silken skin sliding over the rigid core, and swirled my tongue gently around the swollen head. \u201cIt is the staff of life, Aleksei.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know.\u201d He took a step backward, stumbling in the breeches I hadn\u2019t finished removing, and sat down hard on the edge of the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s just too much! Just the sight of you doing it. I don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I hid a smile. It had been a long time since I\u2019d been with a man as young and inexperienced as Aleksei, fearful of spilling his seed too soon. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweet boy,\u201d I said, pulling off his breeches. \u201cWe have all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t protest when I took him into my mouth, only made a strangled sound deep in his throat and clutched my head. I performed the languisement as an act of worship\u2014albeit a brief one, to be sure. Aleksei\u2019s hips jerked forward as he poured his seed and years upon years\u2019 worth of repressed desire into my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cGod!\u201d he said in a hoarse voice. \u201cOh, God!\u201d</p><p>I sat back, smiling.</p><p>Aleksei eyed me, flushed for once with pleasure and not shame. \u201cYou are a witch,\u201d he murmured, reaching down to take my hands. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I let him tug me onto the bed beside him, where he kissed me without reservation, his tongue exploring my mouth, his hands exploring my body. He was Naamah\u2019s child, and he had found his element. He kissed my throat, hands cupping my breasts, then gave me an inquiring look.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>His tawny head moved lower, his mouth closing over one nipple, suckling hard. Stone and sea, I had been too long deprived! I shivered with pleasure and ran my fingers through his hair, encouraging him.</p> <p>\u201cYou like that.\u201d Aleksei lifted his head, eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I said languidly.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>I took his hand, guiding it between my thighs. \u201cTouch me. Stroke me.\u201d</p><p>He did, propping himself on one elbow, gazing at the cleft of my nether-lips with intense interest. \u201cSo soft! And so hot and so wet. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re arousing me,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>With one fingertip, he circled Naamah\u2019s Pearl, caressing my tender, sensitive bud. \u201cAnd this?\u201d</p><p>I jerked involuntarily. \u201cIs the seat of a woman\u2019s pleasure, my hero,\u201d I said breathlessly. \u201cYour instincts are true.\u201d</p> <p>Aleksei smiled. \u201cShall I kiss you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish.\u201d I hoped he did.</p><p>\u201cI think I do.\u201d Kneeling between my thighs, he studied me, looking like a scholarly angel. \u201cEven here, you are beautiful, Moirin.\u201d Lowering his head, he kissed me\u2014kissed and licked me with ardent desire. And although there was neither art nor skill in it, there was passion, and Naamah\u2019s blessing hovering over us.</p><p>I climaxed beneath his mouth, moaning shamelessly and clutching his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI pleased you?\u201d Aleksei looked startled and glad.</p><p>I laughed softly. \u201cYes, my hero. Would you like to please us both further?\u201d I pulled him down atop me, reveling in the weight of him, reveling in the warmth of his skin against mine, wrapping my legs around him. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei was fully hard and erect again, the blunt head of his phallus nudging at my nether-lips in a tantalizing manner. His blue, blue eyes gazed earnestly into mine. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYou would need to have greater care with a virgin,\u201d I added. \u201cBut you will not hurt me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as though I\u2019d given him a gift.</p><p>I reached between us, grasping his phallus and shifting my hips. The swollen head slid into me.</p><p>Aleksei caught his breath, thrusting; and the whole thick length of him filled me. His blue eyes widened. \u201cIt\u2019s so.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I kissed him, hard and deep, Naamah\u2019s blessing like honey on my tongue. \u201cI know, sweet boy. I know.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-TWO</p><p>I liked the aftermath almost better than the love-making.</p><p>For the first time since I had known him, Aleksei was content in his own skin, calm and happy.</p><p>Fading sunlight filled the room. The candle I had lit burned low on the windowsill.</p><p>Naamah\u2019s blessing lay over us like a blanket.</p><p>\u201cYou are so very well made, Moirin,\u201d Aleksei murmured, stroking the curve of my hip. \u201cAs though your disparate gods conspired to combine all the best aspects of their folk in you. Tell me, how did you know the right words to say to me?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNaamah put them in my mouth.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cWhat did they mean to you?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei touched my face. \u201cI cannot explain it, not entirely. But she told me to trust my heart. And I realized that it does not matter that you cannot love me as I wish. It matters that I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered, my eyes stinging.</p><p>He wrapped his strong, young arms around me. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>I laid my head on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this is what it must have been like for Edom and Yeva in the Garden before the fall,\u201d Aleksei mused. \u201cTo take pleasure in the light of day without fear of sinning, to be naked and unashamed. I think this is what I was meant to understand, Moirin. That state of grace is not lost to us after all; it is only that we have lost our way. Perhaps that is why God granted a measure of license to his errant grandson Elua and his disobedient servants. Perhaps their message is one we need to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods have mercy, I\u2019ve made a heretic of you,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>He laughed, his breath stirring my hair. \u201cMaybe. But I think rather that you\u2019ve led me to the beginning of a deeper understanding of my faith.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head. \u201cNo more mortification of the flesh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d Aleksei promised. \u201cAt least not the kind meant to punish for desires that are natural and beautiful in their own right. I still believe there is merit in discipline such as fasting. As you said, this is a gift, and like any gift, it can be used for good or evil. I needed to hear that, too. Needed to hear it acknowledged.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cI suspect you\u2019ll use it for good, sweet boy. You\u2019re too gentle a soul to do otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cBut my father used it carelessly, and ruined my mother\u2019s life because of it..... Oh!\u201d His expression changed, half-stricken and half-hopeful. \u201cMoirin. What if I\u2019ve gotten you with child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t,\u201d I said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift Eisheth granted to the women of Terre d\u2019Ange, and I\u2019m D\u2019Angeline enough to have inherited it. I\u2019ll not be fertile until I pray to her to open the gates of my womb.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei\u2019s face fell. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I sat upright, taking his hand and stroking it. \u201cYou\u2019ll find her someday, Aleksei. A helpmate to share your vision and your dream, who will love you and only you with all her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love you, though,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I suspect there is a part of me that always will. I cannot imagine I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I agreed, thinking of my own lost loves. \u201cBut I think you will be surprised to find how much room there is for love in your heart.\u201d</p><p>He reached up to touch my hair, running strands of it through his fingers. \u201cLike you? Have you made a little space in your heart for me, Moirin, that my memory might exist alongside that of the princes and queens and peasant-boys you\u2019ve loved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, a little.\u201d I smiled at him again. \u201cI will always be grateful for the gift you\u2019ve given me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Aleksei looked startled.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweet boy.\u201d I leaned down to kiss him. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>Stone and sea, no one in the world could look as bemused and earnest as Aleksei! I drew idle circles on the bare skin of his chest, gazing at him and wondering what manner of man he would become. A strong one, I thought; a good one. Right now, he was like a half-grown lion, only just beginning to come into his strength.</p><p>One day.....</p><p>One day he might become a priest such as the Rebbe Avraham ben David, swaying the course of Vralian history with his eloquent passion and his faith, swaying it away from judgment and punishment, toward love and compassion and joy. Always, always seeking a deeper understanding of what the gods want of us.</p><p>Always seeking to divine the unknown word that Yeshua had written in the dust, that Yeshua had written in my vision.</p><p>Always deciding it must be love\u2014over and over again.</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t answered Aleksei\u2019s question. I came back to myself, smiling into his blue, blue eyes. \u201cYou gave me your trust,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd that is the greatest gift anyone can give. You allowed me to invoke Naamah\u2019s blessing on your behalf, and you accepted it with grace and gladness, and an open, willing heart. And for the first time, I do believe there was a purpose in my presence here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back at me. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>I kissed him again. \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>When the low afternoon light began to dim toward dusk, we donned our clothes and left our bedchamber for the common room, entering it hand-in-hand. It seemed to me as though Naamah\u2019s blessing had graced the entire establishment.</p><p>Polina shook her head at us knowingly, disapproval giving way to pure indulgence. Her husband, Rodya, grinned and winked, setting deep bowls of cabbage stew simmered with seasoned balls of ground spiced meat before us.</p><p>The other four patrons of the inn watched us with envy and yearning.</p><p>\u201cI feel so strange, Moirin,\u201d Aleksei murmured. \u201cI feel as though I want to embrace them all, share this moment with them. Is that not strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me, no,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know my father is a Priest of Naamah?\u201d He nodded. \u201cI think he sees the world this way all the time. I used to walk with him through the City. It made people glad just to see him. And when he smiled at them, they became beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He gazed around the room. \u201cThey\u2019re all beautiful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you stand it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.....\u201d I shrugged. \u201cYou just love them, I suppose. After all, you can\u2019t take the whole world to your bed.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei glanced at me. \u201cYou would if you could.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>He laughed, too.</p><p>\u201cSweet boy,\u201d I said fondly. \u201cI do believe you have begun to understand me.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei spooned stew into his mouth, eating with a good appetite. \u201cDo you suppose other women have the same capacity for pleasure?\u201d he asked, only flushing a very little bit at the question. \u201cNon-D\u2019Angeline women, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I said without thinking. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, but you can\u2019t know for sure unless.....\u201d His voice trailed off, his flush deepening. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again at his expression. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as possessing Naamah\u2019s gift, no. Of understanding pleasure as a birthright, of reaching for it as simply and naturally as breathing, of swimming in it like a salmon in a stream. But it\u2019s there, it\u2019s always there. It may need to be coaxed a bit, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He took another bite. \u201cYou\u2019ll note I\u2019m not asking who you may have been coaxing.\u201d</p><p>I smiled sweetly at him. \u201cWhich is to the good, since it was a piece of Naamah\u2019s business that does not concern you.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s an aspect of D\u2019Angeline culture I cannot embrace. It is unnatural, and a point on which the scriptures are very clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d I dipped a piece of brown bread into my stew. \u201cI recall. A man shall not lie with another man as with a woman, or he shall be put to death. I expect that was written by a man who was used badly in his youth. But that is why there must always be consent on both sides of a union. You understand that is a sacred tenet in Terre d\u2019Ange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d I ate my bread. \u201cNo doubt sodomy is a vile and painful experience if it is forced. That does not make the act sinful in and of itself, nor does it mean it cannot be pleasant if done willingly and properly..... Aleksei, your mouth is agape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to find some further means of shocking me, Moirin?\u201d he asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled hard. \u201cEvery time I think I\u2019ve begun to understand, there seems some further goal on the horizon. And I will say again, this is one I will not pursue. Not with a woman, and most assuredly not with a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a requirement, sweet boy.\u201d I toyed with my spoon. \u201cThere are D\u2019Angelines who find pleasure in acts even I would shun; and there are D\u2019Angelines who find the deepest abiding joy in remaining faithful to their chosen loves. So long as Blessed Elua\u2019s precept is obeyed and the sacred tenet of consensuality is honored, Naamah\u2019s blessing is on all of them.\u201d I took a bite of stew, and swallowed. \u201cI would have you be mindful of it as you seek to bring new understanding to your faith, that\u2019s all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aleksei was silent a moment. \u201cI will try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of it shocked me, too,\u201d I added. \u201cAt least at first.\u201d</p><p>He looked relieved. \u201cI confess myself glad to hear it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can teach you some of Naamah\u2019s arts if you wish,\u201d I offered. \u201cOnly the parts I think you will like.\u201d</p><p>His expression turned confused. \u201cBut you already have.\u201d</p><p>I hid a smile. \u201cAh, no. That was love-making as a simple act of benediction. There are a hundred different kinds of kisses and caresses one can use to coax and please a lover, and that is only the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei paused, then nodded. \u201cI would like that, if you are willing. I think.....\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cI think perhaps one day my bride will be very glad I said yes.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but think of my lady Jehanne teaching me at Cereus House, naming and demonstrating until I had to beg her to stop; and Jehanne months later, giving me one of her sparkling looks in the enchanted bower she\u2019d had made for me. Oh, I\u2019ve got you well on your way to possessing an adept\u2019s skills, Moirin.</p> <p>Gods, it hurt to think of her being gone. I wondered what she would make of the uses to which I\u2019d put the arts she had taught me.</p><p>I thought she would approve; mayhap even laugh with delight. She was Naamah\u2019s child through and through. And ever since I had first laid eyes on Jehanne, Naamah\u2019s face had come to resemble hers in my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI was taught by the foremost courtesan in Terre d\u2019Ange, Aleksei,\u201d I said to him. \u201cTrust me, your bride will be glad of it.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-THREE</p><p>Several days of pure indolence followed.</p><p>In truth, we had little else to do in Udinsk while we waited for the Patriarch to turn his attention away from the south. We listened to gossip in the marketplace, hoping in vain to hear rumors of his movements. Aleksei returned to the smith who had bought my chains and purchased a cooking-pot and a small belt knife for me. We found a sail-maker and commissioned a tent of tough canvas that was done in a day\u2019s time.</p> <p>Beyond that, our time was our own.</p><p>And Aleksei proved an apt pupil.</p><p>Betimes I was hard put not to laugh, as determined and earnest as he was. He was Naamah\u2019s child, aye; but he was a scholar by nature and training alike, and he applied a scholar\u2019s discipline to learning Naamah\u2019s arts.</p><p>\u201cTracing the nautilus,\u201d he breathed in my ear, echoing the latest term I had taught him. The tip of his tongue described a dwindling spiral and probed my inner canal rather too insistently. \u201cMoirin, stop giggling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt tickles!\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes were wide and sincere. \u201cIsn\u2019t it supposed to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, no.\u201d I showed him again, beginning with a line of soft kisses along his jaw, nipping gently on his earlobe, sucking it into my mouth. \u201cSoftly,\u201d I whispered into his ear. \u201cSlowly. Delicately; oh so delicately.\u201d I traced circles with my tongue, darting and flickering it until Aleksei shuddered and groaned. I pulled back. \u201cListen, and pay attention to your lover\u2019s response. After all, that is the most important thing. Let her body\u2019s response tell you what pleases her.\u201d</p><p>Letting out a growl, Aleksei pinned me to the bed. \u201cI know what pleases you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome things, aye.\u201d I wound my arms around his neck, kissing his lips. \u201cNot all, sweet boy. Not even close. And you do not know what pleases this wife you have not yet met, who will no doubt be far less licentious than I. So I suggest you heed my advice.\u201d</p><p>By and large, he did.</p><p>And by and large, Aleksei blossomed under my tutelage. The sense of grace that Naamah\u2019s blessing had bestowed lingered over us. He remained comfortable in his skin. He walked differently, even stood differently. He held his head higher, no longer ducking it modestly under the slightest scrutiny, blushing less.</p><p>His taut, hunched shoulders straightened and squared. The movement of his long, rangy limbs acquired a loose grace. He ate heartily, loved freely. He began to laugh more easily and readily, even at himself.</p><p>It was beautiful to see.</p><p>I thought often of Aleksei\u2019s mother, Valentina, in those days, wishing she could see her son as I did. It was what she had wanted for him\u2014her caged bird set free, free to stretch his wings and fly, finding his true element. I liked teaching him, but I liked best those times when lessons were over, and Aleksei gave himself over to sheer passion, rocking between my thighs and thrusting deep inside me, whispering blasphemous prayers into the crook of my neck.</p><p>But by the fourth day, I was restless, too long confined indoors.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for a ride,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>He paused. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWhy not? It will be good to acquaint ourselves with our mounts\u2014and to make certain that dealer hasn\u2019t sold them out from under us,\u201d I added. \u201cI don\u2019t trust that fellow.\u201d</p><p>That swayed him\u2014that and the picnic lunch that Polina kindly offered to pack for us. Having discovered his appetite, Aleksei was constantly hungry, and I was pleased that he wasn\u2019t yet inclined to resume the discipline of fasting.</p><p>I took my Tatar bow with me, or at least, I had Aleksei bring it. I had in mind to practice with it. Taking note of it, Polina suggested that we might find grouse or pheasant in the meadows upriver, and that game-birds would be a welcome addition to supper. The thought of shooting for the pot made me homesick, missing my own mother, but it brought good memories, too.</p><p>For a mercy, our sturdy little horses were awaiting us safely in the dealer\u2019s stable. We rode out of town, past the Tatar encampment, and set out upriver in search of the meadows Polina had mentioned.</p><p>I was in good spirits. All had gone well in Udinsk, and in two days\u2019 time, we would take our leave.</p><p>And at last I would be travelling in the direction of Bao and the missing half of my diadh-anam. I\u2019d managed to keep myself from constant worry, but it would be a relief to be moving toward him.</p><p>We found the meadows, filled with bright yellow flowers blossoming beneath the blue sky. I asked Aleksei what they were called, but he didn\u2019t know. After we tethered our mounts and spread a blanket for our picnic, I let myself stroke the blossoms, taking in their quick, joyous thoughts.</p><p>This, too, reminded me of home. I couldn\u2019t resist coaxing one unopened bud to blossom, breathing softly over it.</p><p>Aleksei watched wide-eyed as the bright yellow petals opened to the sun. \u201cMore magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d I smiled. \u201cA small gift, nothing more. If there\u2019s some greater purpose in it, it\u2019s not yet been revealed to me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises.\u201d</p><p>We ate the lunch of sausages, cheese, and brown bread that Polina had packed for us, and afterward, I introduced Aleksei to the pleasure of making love outdoors, with nothing but earth and sky around us.</p><p>\u201cNow I truly do feel like Edom and Yeva in the Garden,\u201d he whispered to me. \u201cI only wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped his mouth with a kiss. \u201cI know. But I cannot stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Aleksei said softly, brushing the hair back from my face. \u201cBut I do wish it, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him again. \u201cLet\u2019s see if I can get a brace of grouse for Polina, shall we?\u201d</p><p>He accompanied me as I walked along the piney woods that lined the meadow, an arrow nocked loosely. It took half an hour before I flushed a lone grouse, rising out of the underbrush with a startling clatter of wings.</p><p>That bird, I missed; and it took us another half hour to find the arrow I\u2019d loosed. But after that, I flushed and shot two birds in quick succession, wringing their necks swiftly so that they did not suffer. By then it was late enough in the afternoon that we decided to return to the inn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s passing strange,\u201d Aleksei mused as we rode. \u201cIn Riva, you seemed so very different to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the many Moirins,\u201d I said lightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not just that. I saw you as I was taught to see you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you were angry and bitter and resentful, I thought it was the badness in you, Naamah\u2019s curse, the unclean spirit fighting against God\u2019s efforts to redeem it. Even when I gave you my mother\u2019s book to read, it was because I hoped you would respond better to a message of love and compassion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t wrong,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, but..... seeing you now, in your own element, I realize you were angry for the exact reason you said.\u201d Aleksei glanced at me. \u201cYou were a wild creature meant to live free, and we cast you in chains.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cYou\u2019re only just now realizing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay by day, I realize it more.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cToday, I am realizing that you would have every right to hate me for the role I played in your captivity.\u201d He paused. \u201cDo you? At least a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I drew rein and leaned over in the saddle to touch his arm. \u201cYou were in a cage, too, Aleksei, only you could not even see the bars. I don\u2019t hate you. Even in my worst moments, I never hated you.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Moirin. I\u2019ve never said it, have I? I should have said it days ago. I\u2019m sorry for what my uncle did to you. I\u2019m sorry for what you have suffered. I\u2019m sorry for being a part of it. I\u2019m sorry we took you away from.....\u201d His voice faltered, then continued. \u201cFrom that Bao you spoke of, and your soul-spark he carries. No matter what I may wish, I can tell that you love him and fear for him.\u201d His blue eyes shone, guileless and remorseful. \u201cI\u2019m very, very sorry.\u201d</p><p>It touched me more than I could have reckoned. Until Aleksei gave me one, I hadn\u2019t known part of me yearned for an apology, any apology.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>Aleksei nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. For all the many kindnesses you have shown me.....\u201d His color rose. \u201cI owe you a great deal more than an apology.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cOh, I have enjoyed the kindnesses, sweet boy. Do not think I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He smiled back at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve taught me that much. But do not think I am not grateful for them, or for the generosity and forbearance you have shown me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I assured him. \u201cYou have a good heart, Aleksei.\u201d</p><p>Thus in accord, we resumed our journey back into Udinsk. Passing the Tatar encampment, I caught sight of Vachir\u2019s wife, Arigh, milking a goat and waved to her, hoisting the brace of grouse that she might see I\u2019d put her bow to good use. She smiled and raised a hand in reply.</p><p>We entered the city proper, our stalwart horses jogging steadily beneath us. I bowed my head and touched the thoughts of my mount lightly, stroking her withers, trying to think of a name that might suit her now that we had spent an entire day together. The squinty-eyed trader hadn\u2019t bothered to name his wares.</p><p>Something calm, I thought, something hardy.</p><p>Somewhere, someone shouted.</p><p>My head came up sharply.</p><p>\u201cMoirin.....\u201d Aleksei\u2019s voice shook. He pointed ahead of us.</p><p>There were men in the city square\u2014too many men. Armed and mounted men, not merchants and traders. I recognized the wide-set figure and grizzled beard of the Duke of Vralsturm, and the attire of his soldiers.</p><p>And beside him.....</p><p>I swore under my breath at the sight of the Patriarch of Riva, wearing black robes, seated astride a rather good-looking chestnut saddle-horse\u2014swore and reached for my bow, glad that I\u2019d forgotten to give it back to Aleksei for appearances\u2019 sake.</p><p>\u201cMoirin, no!\u201d</p><p>I ignored Aleksei, nocking an arrow. The Duke\u2019s men rode forward slowly, fanning out to create a semicircle. I willed my mount to be still, and she stood like a statue beneath me. Beside the Duke of Vralsturm, Pyotr Rostov smiled his creamy smile, raising one hand to stroke his beard in a thoughtful gesture.</p><p>\u201cMoirin mac Fainche,\u201d he said in a deep, resonant voice.</p><p>I leveled my arrow at his chest. \u201cOne and the same, my lord. How did you find us?\u201d</p><p>His smile broadened. \u201cA suspicious smith offered an unusual set of chains for sale made certain inquiries. Pity about the chains, but that\u2019s a moot point now.\u201d</p><p>Ah, gods! It was the fellow at that second smithy, the one who had asked too many questions. I glanced around the square. Some folk were pelting off in different directions, spreading the news of the brewing confrontation. Others gathered at a safe distance to watch, curiosity written in their faces.</p><p>All too well, I knew how quickly it could turn to hostility.</p><p>Even now, the Patriarch was addressing them in Vralian, and I\u2019d learned enough to grasp that he was explaining that I was a sinful witch possessed by unclean spirits, that I was sentenced to death, and that the Duke and his men had come to take me into custody and administer the sentence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Aleksei raised his voice, speaking slowly and distinctly in Vralian so that I could follow. \u201cUncle, I know Moirin. She has unusual gifts, yes, but there is no unclean spirit in her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are bewitched, boy,\u201d his uncle replied, his brows drawing together in a scowl. \u201cWe will pray together.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei shook his head stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. I would stake my life on it!\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch\u2019s voice dropped to a low rumble. \u201cAnd you just might if you insist on this course. You\u2019ve been like a son to me, Aleksei, but I cannot protect you if you will not renounce the witch.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei blanched.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cYou are right. I bewitched him so thoroughly he does not know it himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lying!\u201d Aleksei shouted. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to protect me! Moirin, I won\u2019t let you. I won\u2019t lie.\u201d There were tears in his blue eyes. \u201cI felt Naamah\u2019s blessing myself. It is real, it is true and beautiful, and there is no curse in it. None!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Duke of Vralsturm gestured curtly to his men. \u201cTake them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold!\u201d I drew the bowstring back two more inches to its fullest extension, keeping my arrow trained on Pyotr Rostov\u2019s chest, and my gaze fixed on his face. No one moved. \u201cLet us go, or I will kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin, don\u2019t!\u201d Aleksei murmured. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this. You\u2019re not a killer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have killed men before,\u201d I said with a calmness I did not feel. \u201cAnd I will kill your uncle if he does not recant his order.\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch returned my gaze steadily. He had courage, I\u2019d grant him that. Courage, ambition, and a fanatic\u2019s belief in the rightness of his cause. It was all written in his face. And I saw, too, that he believed in his heart that I was bluffing. I saw a vision of a future unspooling between us, a future in which my corruption of his golden nephew Aleksei became a rallying point for the Church of Yeshua Ascendant. Here in this square, Aleksei would be slain for the sin of loving me, martyred for his uncle\u2019s cause\u2014and my death would be but the first in a long crusade against the sinful D\u2019Angelines and the unnatural bear-witches of the Maghuin Dhonn.</p><p>A future of banners and bloodshed, preparing the world with fire and steel for Yeshua ben Yosef\u2019s return; and in the center of it all, the Patriarch of Riva stoking the fires with his splendid rhetoric, causing it all to happen.</p><p>I sucked in my breath, shaking at the vision, my arms trembling from the strain of holding the drawn bow.</p><p>Pyotr Rostov smiled in triumph. \u201cTake them.\u201d</p> <p>Steadying my grip, I loosed the bowstring.</p><p>\u201cMoirin, no!\u201d Aleksei cried a second time, hurling himself from the saddle and crashing into me, dragging me from my mount. I fell hard onto the cobbled square, striking my head on the stones, Aleksei falling atop me.</p><p>The world went black for a moment\u2014pitch-black, with starbursts of light spangling the darkness. My head hurt. Everywhere around us, there was shouting and clattering, sounds like an avalanche of rocks falling.</p><p>In the sparkling darkness, I wondered if the folk of Udinsk had begun to stone me already, wondered how they\u2019d armed themselves so quickly. I shoved frantically at Aleksei\u2019s weight, pushing him off me.</p><p>The clattering got louder, and so did the shouting.</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, shaking my head to clear it. There seemed to be a sea of surging horse-flesh between me and my adversaries. In between the churning legs, shaggy flanks, and thick, arching necks, I caught a glimpse of the Duke\u2019s men retreating to regroup and the Patriarch kneeling on the cobblestones, grimacing, his fingers clutching at the shaft of an arrow protruding just below his collarbone.</p> <p>\u201cLady archer.\u201d Vachir\u2019s face hung above me, silhouetted against the bright blue sky as he leaned down from the saddle. I squinted, seeing two of him. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>Tatars.</p><p>The Tatars from the encampment had come to my rescue.</p><p>I laughed, a short, wondering laugh. \u201cNot exactly. But, Vachir..... why?\u201d</p><p>He smiled his quiet smile. \u201cI offered you the hospitality of my roof.\u201d</p><p>There was more to it, but I understood. Vachir and his fellow traders were settling the balance of debt the Great Khan Naram himself incurred when he violated the sacred laws of hospitality. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>Vachir nodded. \u201cYou should come with us. Now.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my hands over my face, gave my aching head another shake, and took stock of the situation. Beside me, Aleksei got to his feet, trembling.</p> <p>It was a standoff. The Duke of Vralsturm and his men were in a cluster around the kneeling Patriarch, hands on their sword-hilts. Mounted Tatar warriors milled around them, bows drawn, arrows nocked and poised. The younger men among them had dark, glittering eyes and fierce battle-smiles that reminded me of Bao.</p><p>Vachir spoke.</p><p>One of the younger men translated his words into Vralian. \u201cWe are taking the lady archer and her companion,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cIf you do not wish to provoke a war, you will let us.\u201d</p><p>Pyotr Rostov drew a ragged breath, his voice hoarse with pain. \u201cYour Great Khan gave her to me!\u201d</p><p>The Tatars conferred.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d their spokesman agreed. \u201cThat was a mistake. And the Great Khan will thank us for fixing it..... one day.\u201d His battle-smile widened, his eyes bright. \u201cToday, do you wish to make war?\u201d</p><p>The Patriarch did.</p><p>The Duke of Vralsturm did not. He was a practical man. I watched resignation settle over his broad features, watched him signal his men to stand down.</p><p>I hoisted myself astride my mount, glancing at Aleksei. \u201cI think it is best we go with the Tatars. Will you come?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cAleksei, no!\u201d his uncle grated. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late for you, boy!\u201d</p><p>Aleksei squared his shoulders. \u201cIt is, actually,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Uncle. All my life, I have tried to conform to your vision of what I should be. I have tried to redeem my mother\u2019s sin. But I think..... I think you were wrong. I think you have tried to force God and his son Yeshua alike into a mold that is too small and narrow to contain them.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI did my best to honor you. I did my best to save your life. But I will not allow you to lessen the myriad wonder of God\u2019s infinite grace for me.\u201d</p><p>My heart and my diadh-anam sang within me.</p><p>\u201cAleksei.....\u201d The Patriarch of Riva repeated his name. \u201cAleksei, listen, only listen to me!\u201d</p><p>My sweet, scholarly boy turned away from him, refusing to hear him.</p><p>I kneed my unnamed mount gently, and she stepped forward, ears pricked. From my vantage point, I gazed down at Pyotr Rostov, who knelt on the cobblestones and clutched the protruding shaft, staring at me with hot, angry eyes, as hot and angry as the image of Yeshua on the wall of his temple.</p><p>He would live, I thought. Aleksei had done that much for his uncle, sending the arrow I had loosed astray by mere inches.</p><p>But his dream, his hateful dream, would die. Neither Aleksei nor I would die here today at the hands of an angry mob. The future the Patriarch had envisioned would no longer come to pass.</p><p>And for that, I was grateful. Alive, and grateful.</p><p>\u201cYou lose,\u201d I said in Vralian, loud enough for everyone nearby to hear. \u201cAnd I win.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-FOUR</p><p>We returned to the Tatar camp, Aleksei and I, protected by a guard of Vachir and his fellow traders.</p><p>They were in good spirits, having enjoyed the confrontation immensely, especially the younger men. I learned that it was a young fellow named Chagan, the one who had served as Vachir\u2019s translator, who had witnessed the beginning of the conflict and gone racing to rouse the camp, having recognized me from the archery rematch.</p><p>When I thanked him for it, he laughed, showing strong white teeth. \u201cIt was a matter of honor, lady archer! Anyone who shoots as well as you do must have Tatar blood in her somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei was quiet and withdrawn. Sensing he wished to be left alone, I didn\u2019t try to draw him out. When he suggested that he should return to the inn with an armed escort and fetch our things, I didn\u2019t argue, even though I had reservations.</p><p>I could not blame him for not wanting to be around me at the moment. After all, I had just attempted to kill his uncle in cold blood. The man might have been a monster to me, but for all his faults, he had been like a father to Aleksei; and Aleksei had no way of knowing the vision I had seen unfold.</p><p>Despite my reservations, he and his Tatar escorts returned safely with all the possessions we had purchased so painstakingly, even the pack-horse.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the mood in the city?\u201d I asked in an effort to gauge his own mood.</p><p>\u201cTense,\u201d he murmured without meeting my eyes. \u201cBut they are afraid of the Tatars. No one will make trouble.\u201d</p><p>I left him alone a while longer, busying myself with helping Arigh with chores around the ger. It felt oddly familiar, except for the absence of children. When I asked Arigh about it, she shook her head with regret, laying one hand over her belly. \u201cNo children, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>She glanced at Vachir, conferring with a handful of traders on the men\u2019s side of the ger. \u201cHe is a good husband, though. And I think.....\u201d Her eyes crinkled. \u201cI think if he had a daughter, he would like one like you. Spirited, and skilled with a bow.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re very kind.\u201d</p><p>It was a strange thing indeed, I thought, how much cruelty and kindness existed side by side in the world. The great magician Berlik had found sanctuary and redemption among the Yeshuites in Vralia; save for Aleksei and Valentina, I had found only condemnation.</p><p>I thought about the D\u2019Angeline Prince Imriel, who had pursued Berlik into the Vralian wilderness to avenge his wife\u2019s death. He had been used cruelly in his youth, stolen away into slavery, a captivity far worse than aught I had endured. There had been a Tatar warlord who hurt him badly, even branding him with a hot iron.</p><p>And yet when the adult Prince Imriel had been imprisoned with a young Tatar horse-thief in Vralia, he\u2019d set him free when he made his escape. I wondered if that act of compassion resonated over generations in some mysterious way, leading to this moment, and my salvation at the hands of Vachir and his fellows.</p><p>There are things no one can ever know, I supposed.</p><p>For the first time in a while, I found myself missing Master Lo Feng, feeling his loss acutely. He\u2019d always had a way of putting everything into perspective. I pictured him smiling, folding his hands into his wide sleeves.</p><p>All ways lead to the Way, Moirin.</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d I was startled out of my reverie by Vachir\u2019s voice, realizing I was standing and gazing into space, my hands sunk deep into floury wheat-dough. Arigh and I had been making meat-filled dumplings.</p><p>He gave a low chuckle, reaching out to rub a smudge of flour from my cheek; and indeed, there was a father\u2019s tenderness in his touch. \u201cWe were planning to return to Tatar territory in a week\u2019s time, but if we conclude our bargains swiftly, we can be on our way the day after tomorrow. Will you and your young companion accompany us? It will be safer for you,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I said without hesitating, glancing at Aleksei.</p><p>Vachir followed my gaze. \u201cAnd the boy?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Arigh laid her hand on my shoulder, squeezing it in gentle sympathy. \u201cTalk to him.\u201d</p><p>After supper, I did.</p><p>It was hard, harder than I had reckoned. Everyone else in the ger gave us a wide berth. I sat cross-legged opposite Aleksei, drawing a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you angry at me?\u201d I asked without mincing words. \u201cI do not blame you if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry?\u201d he echoed, his voice soft. \u201cNo..... not angry, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisappointed?\u201d</p><p>Aleksei frowned in thought. \u201cNo, I\u2019m..... I don\u2019t know. I understand, I do. And I cannot blame you, not really. After all, he was sentencing you to death. All you wanted was to be left alone. It\u2019s just.....\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt shocked me nonetheless. Are you angry at me for trying to stop you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I took his hand, holding it lightly. He tensed, but he didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cYou would not be who you are if you hadn\u2019t, sweet boy. Only I would have you know, I did not do it solely out of hatred or a desire for vengeance.\u201d</p><p>His brows knit. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>I stroked his palm. \u201cLong ago, my ancestors among the Maghuin Dhonn had the gift of scrying the future in the stone circles, seeing all the different paths that might come to pass and trying to choose among them. It is a gift we abandoned voluntarily after choosing unwisely, after Berlik was cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Aleksei murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a gift the Maghuin Dhonn Herself withdrew from us, Aleksei,\u201d I said softly. \u201cAnd I have seen visions of the future I did not seek. I saw one in the temple that day, do you remember?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt happened once before, too. On the battlefield in Ch\u2019in.\u201d I kept my voice low and steady, realizing he was listening. \u201cI saw a vision of a terrible future, one that should never be allowed to come to pass. I saw another one today, written in your uncle\u2019s eyes.\u201d Pausing, I debated whether or not to tell him that his uncle would have been willing to sacrifice Aleksei to his cause. \u201cYour uncle\u2019s threat wasn\u2019t an idle one, Aleksei. I saw our deaths give rise to a future of war and bloodshed in Yeshua\u2019s name, in which D\u2019Angelines and the Maghuin Dhonn alike were persecuted for their nature. And that is what I sought to avert.\u201d</p><p>Aleksei swallowed, his throat working. \u201cEven so..... you didn\u2019t even hesitate, Moirin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned him,\u201d I said. \u201cBeyond that, I didn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, and then looked back, gazing at his hand resting loosely in mine. Gently and regretfully, he extricated his hand. \u201cI believe you,\u201d he said in a quiet voice. \u201cI do. But I think our paths part here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Aleksei smiled with sorrow; and it was a man\u2019s smile, not a boy\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe with Vachir and his men. You have given me so much, Moirin. I suspect I will spend a lifetime contemplating its purpose in God\u2019s plan. But you are not for me, and I am not for you. I will free you to seek out this stubborn peasant-boy Bao, who carries half of the soul-spark of your unknowable bear-goddess within him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p><p>His wide shoulders rose and fell in a faint shrug. \u201cI will stay here in Vralia, where I am meant to be, and try to determine what God and Yeshua will of me. Mayhap I\u2019ll make my way west to seek out a yeshiva where the wisdom of Rebbe Avraham ben David is taught. Once I know I can care for her, I\u2019ll send for my mother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes stung.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Moirin,\u201d he pleaded with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d I lied.</p> <p>Aleksei shifted, kneeling, and cupped my face. \u201cYou are,\u201d he said softly, tenderly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all right. I do love you. I will always love you.\u201d He smiled again, his expression transcendent, his blue, blue eyes filled with light. \u201cAnd I will convince the world to do so, too; or at least my small corner of it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me.</p><p>I kissed him back, and sniffled. \u201cI will miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will I.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-FIVE</p> <p>Two days later, Aleksei and I parted forever.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>It always hurts, leaving a loved one behind. I hadn\u2019t meant to love Aleksei. Until the moment I knew I had lost him, I hadn\u2019t realized I did love him.</p><p>Naamah\u2019s curse, indeed.</p><p>Gods, he was such a gentle soul! He watched me depart amid Vachir\u2019s company of Tatars, following a southern tributary of the Ude River. He smiled in farewell, tall and broad-shouldered, raising one hand in a salute.</p><p>Our destinies tore and parted.</p> <p>\u201cMay you find yours, sweet boy,\u201d I murmured under my breath. \u201cMay you reshape your Church in a kinder, gentler image.\u201d</p><p>I hoped he would be safe and well. I didn\u2019t like leaving him with the Patriarch\u2019s threat hanging over him. Aleksei had helped me escape, and he had refused to renounce me. On the other hand, he had saved his uncle\u2019s life, and all of Udinsk had watched him do it. And I couldn\u2019t protect him. Even if he had been willing to come with us as far as the Tatar lands, he would have returned to Vralia afterward. It was his home.</p><p>Over his protests, I\u2019d left him one of the saddle-horses and half the remaining coin from selling the chains, along with a few supplies. Left to his own devices, Aleksei would have preferred to accept nothing, venturing out into the world like an itinerant wandering monk. I was glad I\u2019d been able to convince him to accept what he had. Still, he was so na\u00efve and inexperienced. I hoped it would be enough, and that the world would treat him kindly.</p><p>I wondered if I would ever know, and knew it was possible that I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>But mayhap I would; mayhap one day I would hear of a half-D\u2019Angeline priest in distant Vralia who preached a doctrine of compassion and acceptance that attempted to reconcile different faiths, who had written a tract regarding his encounter with his own unlikely heretic saint.</p><p>The thought cheered me during our journey.</p><p>And I was profoundly grateful to be travelling with the Tatars, profoundly grateful for their protection. The first leg of our journey was a tense one. Gossip had spread before us, and within days, we were passing through villages where Pyotr Rostov and the Duke\u2019s men had sought me.</p><p>In every village and settlement, people came out to stare and point, trying to pick me out among the Tatar throng.</p> <p>A few times, they threw stones\u2014small boys too foolish to be afraid, for the most part. When it happened, Chagan and the other young men dashed after them on horseback, instilling in them the fear the boys lacked.</p><p>At night when we camped, Vachir posted guards. No one came to molest us, too wary of the Tatars\u2019 reputation for ferocity, unwilling to provoke a conflict that might escalate. Still, I was glad when we passed the last settlement and entered the wilderness of the mountain range along the southern border.</p><p>For the first time in months, I truly felt I could breathe freely.</p><p>As the days passed, my worry over Aleksei began to fade into the background of my thoughts. He had chosen his path, and there was nothing I could do to aid him in a land where my very nature was despised. He had grown so much since first I met him, and he would continue to grow and change as he made his way alone in the world, preparing to meet whatever destiny awaited him. All I could do was pray for his safety.</p><p>My worry over Bao was another matter, growing stronger as I travelled in his direction. At least he was alive, I knew that much. Since first I\u2019d been freed from my chains, I\u2019d sensed no change in his diadh-anam. It continued to burn low\u2014alarmingly low, but burning nonetheless. If he was ill or injured, his condition was a stable one.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t moving, or at least not much. The distance that separated us was great enough that I wouldn\u2019t be able to detect small movements on his end. To be sure, he wasn\u2019t journeying toward me.</p><p>It could simply be that Bao had fallen ill with a lingering sickness. It had happened to my father. He\u2019d contracted an infection in his lungs and lain ill for long weeks without my knowing.</p><p>The thought made me shudder. If Raphael de Mereliot hadn\u2019t consented to aid me, albeit for a terrible price, my father would have died.</p><p>Raphael was ten thousand leagues away. If Bao was mortally ill, there was nothing I could do to save him even if I arrived in time.</p><p>But if it wasn\u2019t illness or injury, what could cause his diadh-anam to gutter so low, to burn so dim? Whatever it was, it was nothing good. I\u2019d learned firsthand that there were magics capable of constraining the divine spark of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself. Who knew what other magics existed that were capable of binding or poisoning it?</p><p>I didn\u2019t spend all my time fretting over him, of course. I\u2019d have driven myself mad if I did. Bao was simply too far away, and there was nothing I could do.</p><p>Still, I worried.</p><p>Riding with the Tatars, we passed more swiftly through the Vralian mountains than I had with my abductors. Vachir and his folk were travelling fairly light, having traded cattle and sheep for furs and amber, which they would trade in turn for more livestock once they reached Tatar lands. The weather was fair, and when we made camp, we slept in the open. Gers were only to be erected at more permanent campsites. We made good time, and it wasn\u2019t long before the mountains gave way to the vast, wide-open expanse of the steppe.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Vachir took a deep breath as we rode from the foothills onto the grassy plain, smiling with rare effusiveness. \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>I envied him; I envied all of them.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t glad to be back in Tatar lands. I was. I\u2019d come to love the steppe despite its absence of trees, and the kindness and generosity I\u2019d found here outweighed the sting of the Great Khan\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>But stone and sea..... home! I was so very, very far away from mine, wherever my home even was anymore. The word was every bit as painful and bittersweet as it had been when I set out from Shuntian so long ago in pursuit of the missing half of my soul. And in all that time, I\u2019d done naught but travel in an immense circle that had brought me back to the exact same plight: setting out to cross a vast land in search of Bao.</p><p>\u201cStupid boy,\u201d I muttered to myself. \u201cWhy did you have to go and wed the Tatar princess? We\u2019d be together and halfway home if you hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>In my heart, I understood, though. Bao had told me his reasons. Aside from the fact that one does not refuse the Great Khan, it was Bao\u2019s way of making himself my equal in status and rank, of giving himself a choice that entailed a sacrifice to make the choice meaningful. It didn\u2019t make sense, not really; but truths of the heart owe nothing to logic. Master Lo had laid a heavy burden on his magpie\u2019s shoulders when he gave his life to restore Bao\u2019s. This was Bao\u2019s way of accepting it.</p><p>Unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t reckoned on the consequences: the princess\u2019 injured pride and her father\u2019s wrath.</p><p>\u201cStupid boy,\u201d I said again.</p><p>The heart is a strange thing. Bao wasn\u2019t stupid, of course; in fact, he was quite clever. But he could be thoughtless with the feelings of others. He had a prickly sense of pride that was too easily rankled, and he was infernally stubborn. He was insulting and boastful, and he reveled in fighting.</p><p>And yet.....</p><p>I loved him in a way I could never have loved Aleksei. My sweet, innocent Yeshuite boy had certainly found a place in my heart after all. I\u2019d come to love him for his innate goodness that not even a lifetime of discipline and repression could extinguish, for the sense of wonder with which he viewed the world. But he had never made my heart soar, only ache at leaving him.</p><p>It was different with Bao.</p><p>When I tried to put my finger on the moment I knew, I couldn\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t one. There were myriad small moments, like the first time I\u2019d seen the tenderness Bao extended to Master Lo. The first time he had lowered his guard with me on the greatship, confessing the less than savory details of his past.</p><p>There was the moment in a garden in the Celestial City, when he bade me farewell and left me alone with the dragon-possessed princess, worry in his eyes, knowing what I was about to do and not trying to dissuade me, only telling me not to get myself killed.</p><p>For better or worse, Bao understood me.</p><p>And when the Emperor of Ch\u2019in had refused to heed Master Lo\u2019s advice, when he had accepted his fate and his daughter\u2019s fate as the will of Heaven, Bao hadn\u2019t hesitated to reject the Emperor\u2019s edict without a second thought. He had fetched a jar of rice-wine from the kitchen of our lodgings and sat us down in the courtyard, pouring three cups for us.</p><p>I smiled, remembering.</p><p>There is a time for strong spirits, Master, he had said. This is one of them. Now, how are we going to save the princess and the dragon?</p><p>I had choked on a sip of wine, startled at the fact that Bao was laying the matter bare before us. Bao had turned his dark, cynical gaze on me, that ironic look that masked his romantic and courageous heart.</p><p>You had other plans?</p><p>I hadn\u2019t; of course, I hadn\u2019t. In fact, I had already pledged to aid the princess in defying her father if it was necessary, promising to help her journey to White Jade Mountain to free the dragon by any means possible.</p><p>Somehow, Bao had known.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t hesitated.</p><p>The phrase struck a chord. I thought of Aleksei\u2019s voice raised in anguish as he wrestled with the fact that I had tried to kill his uncle. You didn\u2019t even hesitate, Moirin!</p><p>He was right, I hadn\u2019t. Nor would I if I had to do it again. Confronted with the hateful future the Patriarch envisioned, I would loose that bowstring a thousand times over without hesitating.</p><p>And confronted with the vision of the dragon in all his celestial majesty gazing at his reflection in the twilight, filled with sorrow and regret, and my grave, lovely princess fighting so hard to maintain her sanity in light of what had befallen her, I would pledge my aid without hesitating another thousand times.</p><p>That, Bao understood.</p><p>Aleksei didn\u2019t.</p><p>One day, he might. He had the potential for greatness in him. I had seen it, and I hoped he would fulfill it. But whatever else might have come to pass between us, I would never be able to forget that in my hour of greatest need, Aleksei had hesitated, any more than he would be able to forget I had tried to kill his uncle. My sweet boy would never have set me free in the first place if his mother, Valentina, had not pushed him into it.</p><p>Bao.....</p><p>Bao would not have hesitated.</p><p>I remembered another of the myriad moments. It was in the abandoned farmstead outside Shuntian where our small band of conspirators had first taken shelter with the escaped princess, and Bao and Master Lo were late in coming to join us. I had been worried, so worried.</p><p>They\u2019d come, though.</p><p>Did you think we would not? Bao\u2019s dark eyes had gleamed beneath the broad-brimmed straw hat he wore. He had slid one arm around my waist, holding me close, and come as close as he\u2019d done to a declaration of love, his voice a soft whisper in my ear. I would not let that happen, Moirin.</p><p>\u201cYou did, though,\u201d I said aloud to my memories. \u201cAlthough I know it is not your fault, you left me alone in a very bad place. Where are you? Where did the Great Khan send you? Gods bedamned, Bao! Where are you, and what\u2019s happened to you?\u201d</p><p>No one answered me.</p><p>I sighed, and kept riding.</p><p>FORTY-SIX</p><p>Two days into the steppe, my path diverged with that of Vachir and his folk.</p><p>He offered to send a couple of the young men of his tribe with me, an offer I declined with reluctance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me so much already,\u201d I said to Vachir. \u201cI cannot accept further aid. It would leave too great a balance of debt between us. Besides,\u201d I added, gazing south toward the faint, distant spark of Bao\u2019s diadh-anam, \u201cI suspect I am going far beyond the boundaries of Tatar lands.\u201d</p><p>Vachir didn\u2019t argue with me, only smiled his quiet smile, this time tinged with sadness. \u201cI wish you well, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him. \u201cAnd you, lord archer. May your cattle ever prosper.\u201d</p><p>His wife, Arigh, hugged me, too, and presented me with a blue silk scarf. \u201cA small gift to replace the one that was lost to you. Now you are kin to our tribe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so very much, my lady.\u201d It brought tears to my eyes. I wrapped the scarf around my neck and kissed her cheek. \u201cMay I ask one last kindness of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Arigh smiled, her eyes crinkling. \u201cYou are kin now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen next you encounter Batu and his folk, will you tell them I am well?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat I think of them with great fondness, and that the honor of their hospitality has been restored through your generosity.\u201d</p><p>Both of them nodded. \u201cWe will do this gladly,\u201d Vachir added.</p><p>I watched them ride eastward, watched until their company began to dwindle in the distance.</p><p>Once again, I was alone, save for my horses. \u201cWell, my friends,\u201d I said to them. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>They agreed they were.</p><p>And once again, I set out across the steppe.</p><p>At least this time the journey was easier. I was familiar with the terrain. The weather was temperate and mild, the skies largely cloudless. Most nights, I didn\u2019t bother pitching my tent, but slept in the open as I had been doing with Vachir\u2019s folk. The grazing was rich and my Tatar-stock horses were hardier than those the Emperor had given me, requiring less time to feed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was able to augment the stores of dried meat and hardened cheese that Vachir had given me with fresh game, mostly groundhog. I\u2019d had the sense to gather as much timber as my pack-horse could carry before we left the mountains, and I parceled it out carefully, allowing myself a small fire to cook with when I had fresh meat.</p><p>The gamey, greasy groundhogs were no tastier than I remembered, but I came across wild onions from time to time. With those and a handful of barley from a sack Aleksei and I had purchased in Udinsk, groundhog made for a tolerable stew.</p><p>One good thing about the wide-open steppe was that one could see for leagues beneath the immense blue sky. I had no trouble spotting encampments and giving them a wide berth, nor avoiding travellers and herdsmen, summoning the twilight if necessary.</p> <p>All in all, I made good progress.</p><p>Despite it, Bao\u2019s diadh-anam remained dim and distant.</p><p>I\u2019d been travelling alone for over a week when I spotted a Tatar camp larger than any I\u2019d seen since the spring gathering on the horizon. Out of habit, I began to veer well away from it, but curiosity niggled at me. One ger amidst the camp dwarfed the others, a mighty dome of white felt. I\u2019d seen one that large only once before, and it had belonged to the Great Khan Naram.</p><p>Impulse warred with common sense within me.</p><p>I had no desire to confront the Great Khan himself, suspecting he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to clap me in chains and send me back to Vralia.</p> <p>And yet.....</p><p>The Great Khan Naram had sent Bao toward whatever fate had befallen him. If the Khan knew, mayhap others did, too.</p><p>Others, like his daughter, the Tatar princess Erdene, who was said to be angry with her father.</p><p>I breathed the Breath of Earth\u2019s Pulse, centering myself and thinking. I was riding toward the unknown, and like as not, danger. The D\u2019Angelines of Siovale province, Shemhazai\u2019s folk, had a saying: All knowledge is worth having. And now when I thought of Shemhazai, the most scholarly of Blessed Elua\u2019s Companions, I pictured Aleksei\u2019s face\u2014grave, ascetic, and beautiful.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, my friends?\u201d I asked the horses. \u201cIs it a sign?\u201d</p><p>They flicked their ears, not understanding. The pack-horse lowered his head and cropped at the grass.</p> <p>It would be good, very good, to have some idea what I was getting myself into, to have some idea what had already befallen Bao. I made up my mind, choosing impulse over common sense.</p><p>Even so, I did not intend to be foolish about it. I studied the Great Khan\u2019s encampment and its movements, then stuck to my original plan, veering east to pass it, then veering back west to set up my own small camp alongside a bend in the river I had been following, well to the south where herds had already been pastured.</p><p>I watered the horses and turned them loose to graze, apologizing to them for the sparse fare. I gnawed on strips of dried meat for my supper. And when dusk began to settle over the plain, I saddled my mount, summoned the twilight, and backtracked toward the Great Khan\u2019s camp.</p><p>It was almost dark by the time I drew near, although I could see clearly in the twilight. At a hundred yards out, I dismounted and tethered my mare to a stake.</p><p>\u201cBe silent, great heart,\u201d I whispered to her, touching her thoughts. I stroked her thick, coarse forelock and scratched the base of her ears. \u201cThe darkness will hide you, but I cannot shield us both.\u201d</p><p>She bent her neck and turned her head to lip softly at my palm, huffing through her nostrils.</p><p>I kissed her muzzle. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>The last hundred yards, I crossed on foot, my Tatar bow held loosely in one hand, the quiver slung over my shoulder.</p> <p>It was a familiar scene, albeit one rendered strange by the twilight. The Great Khan and his folk were celebrating and the airag was flowing freely, the pungent scent of fermented mare\u2019s milk riding the night air. Fires of dried dung burned, silvery in the twilight, folk gathered around them.</p><p>Unseen, I prowled through the camp until I spotted Erdene.</p><p>Bao\u2019s wife.</p><p>In so many cultures, this would have been unthinkable, that a princess should be so accessible and ordinary. But the Tatars, like the Maghuin Dhonn, live close to nature. I waited until Erdene excused herself, made her unsteady way to the latrine alone.</p><p>I followed her.</p><p>I waited until she had finished.</p><p>And when Bao\u2019s Tatar princess began to make her way back to her father\u2019s great ger, I drew the twilight deeper into my lungs and blew it softly around her, spinning it around her like a web, drawing and nocking an arrow as I did.</p><p>Erdene shrieked.</p><p>\u201cHello, my lady,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>Her almond-shaped eyes were stretched wide, showing the whites. \u201cAre you a ghost? Have you come to haunt me?\u201d Her chest rose and fell in a panic. \u201cI swear, I did not know what my father intended!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I kept my voice gentle, but I also kept my arrow trained on her. \u201cI am no ghost, my lady. You are encompassed in my magic, nothing more. It will not harm you. Nor will I, if you are truthful. Tell me, where did your father send Bao, and what has befallen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ghost?\u201d Her voice trembled.</p><p>I shook my head, hoping to coax a measure of trust from her. \u201cFlesh and blood, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cHow did you escape from the Falconer\u2019s men if Bao did not find you? No one escapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Falconer?\u201d I was puzzled. \u201cIs that what you call the Patriarch?\u201d</p><p>Erdene looked blankly at me. \u201cWho is the Patriarch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPyotr Rostov, the Patriarch of Riva. Your father betrayed me to a pair of Vralian priests in his service.....\u201d I could see that the words meant nothing to her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. He said the Falconer had sent for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this Falconer? Is that where Bao\u2019s gone?\u201d I lowered the bow a few inches. \u201cHe\u2019s in trouble, my lady. Far away, and in trouble. Mayhap injured, mayhap ill, mayhap imprisoned\u2014mayhap all three, or worse. I don\u2019t know. If you care for him at all, I beg you to tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Erdene gave a curt nod. \u201cFor Bao\u2019s sake, I will help you, even though he does not deserve it. But not here. There is too much to tell. If I don\u2019t return soon, someone will come searching for me, and it\u2019s not safe for you to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will not find us unless I release the twilight,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>She shook her head again, stubbornly. \u201cI need to see you in daylight, to be certain you are flesh and blood. Tell me where to find you. Tomorrow at dawn, I will ride out to hunt alone.\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to hesitate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a trick.\u201d Erdene read my thoughts and gave a grim little smile. \u201cI swear by the sky itself, I will not lead anyone to you. And I have your things,\u201d she added. \u201cI can bring them to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy things?\u201d I echoed.</p><p>The Great Khan\u2019s daughter nodded, plucking a dagger from her belt. I raised the bow automatically, but she only showed the blade to me. It had a hilt of white ivory carved in the shape of a dragon\u2019s coils. \u201cSee? This my father gave to me after it was taken from you. The rest I had fetched from Batu\u2019s ger before they knew you were missing. Your bow, your satchel of trinkets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I felt bewildered. \u201cWere they trophies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrophies?\u201d Erdene gave a forlorn laugh. \u201cNo. Oh, perhaps at first. But after Bao left.....\u201d She lifted her shoulders in a faint, weary shrug. \u201cIn a strange way, they were all I had to remember him by.\u201d Reversing the dagger, she held it out to me hilt-first. \u201cTake it. It\u2019s yours, as surely as he was. I\u2019ll bring the rest tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Warily, I eased my drawn bowstring and reached out to take the blade. I had not forgotten that Erdene had held a dagger to my throat and threatened to cut out my tongue during our only previous conversation, nor that she was quick and strong.</p><p>But she only smiled sadly and let go of the hilt. \u201cTomorrow, then?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be camped along the river in the southern pastures. And if you\u2019ve sworn falsely, I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>With that, I unspun the twilight around her, leaving only myself cloaked in it.</p><p>Erdene blinked at the return of true darkness and my sudden absence. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said to the seemingly empty air, an edge of defiance in her voice. \u201cAnd you will see! I am no oath-breaker.\u201d</p><p>I hoped it was true.</p><p>FORTY-SEVEN</p><p>Dawn came, breaking golden over the steppe.</p><p>It did not bring a Tatar princess with it.</p><p>I waited restlessly, torn between staying and going. I\u2019d slept poorly, anxious that I\u2019d made a bad decision once more, wishing I had pressed Erdene harder to tell me about this mysterious Falconer fellow.</p><p>Why, oh why, had I trusted her?</p><p>I was an idiot. Oh, I could cloak myself in the twilight when I saw the Khan\u2019s hunting-party come searching for me, and like as not I\u2019d get away; but they would know I was there. They would pursue me. And sooner or later, I would have to sleep\u2014and my campsite and I would be vulnerable.</p><p>I thought wistfully of home. I\u2019d not had time to learn all the myriad possibilities that the gift of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself possessed, but I remembered that when my mother had taken me to attend the vigil at Clunderry, where we remembered Morwen\u2019s folly and Berlik\u2019s cruel sacrifice, there had been a celebration in a glade afterward, and the entire glade had been wrapped in the glimmering twilight.</p><p>It must have been a ward of some sort, for no one was minding it, no one was concentrating on holding the cloak in place. No, they had been reveling in the aftermath of the grave vigil, drinking uisghe, feasting, playing music, and dancing\u2014a rare party for my folk, who seldom gathered in numbers.</p><p>I wondered how it was done.</p><p>My mother hadn\u2019t taught it to me. Mayhap it was a gift she didn\u2019t possess, or mayhap she hadn\u2019t thought it necessary. I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Trying to distract myself as the sun inched higher above the horizon, I breathed through the cycle of the Five Styles and pondered the matter. I drew the twilight deep into my lungs, and flung it out as far as I could, encompassing the whole of my campsite, my neatly laden packs and gear.</p><p>Pushing myself, I extended it farther, encompassing my grazing horses, doing their best to find fodder in the abandoned pasture. To be sure, I had grown stronger; but I had to hold it, mindful and conscious. The moment I let my awareness lapse, it faded.</p><p>So how did they keep it in place?</p><p>Remembering Master Lo\u2019s teaching, I forced myself to stop thinking about it, to stop worrying at it. To let my thoughts arise one by one, one thought giving birth to another. Once again, I sat cross-legged and breathed the Five Styles, accepting what thoughts came.</p><p>I would figure it out, or I would not.</p><p>Erdene would betray me, or she would not.</p><p>I would find Bao, or I would not.</p><p>A sense of calm settled over me; and strangely, it was Aleksei\u2019s voice that nudged at my thoughts. A memory of a passage from the endless scriptures he had read to me merged with an image in my mind, an image of a compass rose etched on a map, the four cardinal points clearly marked.</p><p>Aleksei\u2019s voice persisted, hesitant and faltering, but persistent nonetheless. For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar.....</p><p>A compass rose, four cardinal points.</p><p>A dragon-hilted dagger, lost and restored.</p><p>All these things converged in my thoughts. \u201cIs it that simple?\u201d I said aloud. I opened my eyes, startled and chagrined to realize I\u2019d had them closed for so long. A quick glance assured me that the horizon was still empty. If Erdene had betrayed me, her father\u2019s men were not coming yet\u2014although neither was she.</p><p>I turned my hands palm upward on my knees, gazing at them. Gazing at the blue veins in my wrists. I breathed the Breath of Earth\u2019s Pulse.</p><p>Mayhap it was that simple.</p><p>Well and so, there was one way to find out. Rising, I called in the horses, tethering them close. I paced around my camp in a circle, glancing at the sun and marking the cardinal points of the compass in my mind.</p><p>I needed anchors.</p><p>Where that thought came from, I could not say; but it arose unbidden in my mind, the image of the compass rose now linked with that of an anchor rising from the deep, dripping with saltwater and seaweed.</p><p>Stones in the river called to me.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I murmured. \u201cAll right, then. Stone and sea and sky, and all that they encompass. The life of the flesh is in its blood. Let us see, shall we?\u201d</p><p>The horses watched with pricked ears and curious eyes as I shucked my boots and waded into the river, hoisting my skirts. I selected four smooth, fist-sized stones, carrying them in the apron of my skirt as I waded back to shore.</p><p>I spared another glance toward the horizon.</p><p>Still empty.</p><p>Drawing the dragon-hilted dagger that my princess Snow Tiger had given me and Bao\u2019s princess Erdene had restored to me, I set the sharp point against the ball of my left thumb and pushed, grimacing at the sting as it pierced my skin. A bead of blood welled and gathered there. I dabbed it on one of the river-stones. Another rose to take its place, another and another, until all the smooth stones were anointed.</p><p>I stuck my thumb in my mouth, contemplating them.</p><p>Anchors.</p><p>The word felt right, the stones felt right. Beneath the mildly curious gazes of my horses, I retraced the steps of my circle, placing one blood-smeared stone at each of the four cardinal points of the compass.</p><p>I retreated to the center, and summoned the twilight.</p><p>The anchor-stones flared to life, setting and holding the cloak of the twilight within their compass. Even when I released my conscious hold on it, it remained in place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHa!\u201d I felt a fierce grin split my face. \u201cI am learning, Great One,\u201d I said, bowing toward the west where the Maghuin Dhonn Herself resided. \u201cI am Your child. Always and always, I am trying to do Your will, no matter how hard I find it. And always and always, I am grateful for Your gifts. I will try.....\u201d</p><p>I heard hoofbeats.</p><p>Glancing toward the east, I saw a rider approaching, a lone rider, small and sturdy in the saddle.</p> <p>Erdene.</p><p>Late though she was, she hadn\u2019t lied. She had come alone. I saw the familiar shape of the yew-wood bow my uncle Mabon had made for me slung over her shoulder, the battered canvas satchel I had carried for so long tied to her saddle. I watched her slow her mount, gazing about nervously as she neared my campsite.</p><p>I blew out my breath, deliberately banishing the twilight and extinguishing the anchor-points.</p><p>A sharp gasp escaped her. \u201cMoirin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d Erdene said simply, dismounting in the bright sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And you\u2019re..... real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I am,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd you are no oath-breaker. I apologize for doubting you.\u201d</p><p>She handed over my bow and quiver, and set about untying the satchel. \u201cI cannot say I blame you.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers over the well-worn wood of my bow, reveling in the smooth feel of it. \u201cTell me about this Falconer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis kingdom lies in the Abode of the Gods.\u201d Erdene tugged the satchel free and hauled it over to sit cross-legged opposite me.</p><p>I took the satchel and gave her an inquiring look. \u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the name of a mountain range to the south,\u201d she said. \u201cA very, very large and deadly mountain range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I untied the mouth of the satchel and began removing and examining its contents.</p><p>\u201cEverything is there.\u201d Erdene\u2019s tone was stiff. \u201cI didn\u2019t steal anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you did,\u201d I said mildly, smoothing the square of silk embroidered with bamboo that Bao\u2019s half-sister had sewn. \u201cI am taking stock and reuniting with old friends, that\u2019s all. Tell me more. Why is he called the Falconer?\u201d</p><p>Erdene watched me lay the other items on the cloth square. \u201cHis stronghold is high in the mountains, inaccessible to anyone who does not know the secret path. Many have tried seeking it, and all have died. Only the Falconer, the Spider Queen, and their stable of assassins know the path.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows. \u201cSpider Queen? Assassins?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her round face grave. \u201cThe Spider Queen is his wife. Together they train the finest assassins in the world. His falcons, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I felt a little ill. \u201cAnd who do they kill?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor a price, anyone.\u201d Erdene watched me peer into a small purse, counting coins. \u201cThat\u2019s the most valuable thing you own, you know.\u201d She pointed to the Imperial jade seal medallion I\u2019d laid on the embroidered square. \u201cYou could trade it for almost anything to someone seeking guaranteed safe passage across Ch\u2019in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d I said.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThink on it. There is but one passage south through the Abode of the Gods\u2014the Path of Heaven\u2019s Spear. And you do not have coin enough to purchase the services of a caravan.\u201d</p><p>I set down the purse and examined my mother\u2019s signet ring with a pang, reminded once more how far from home I was. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d Erdene shook her head. \u201cYou have your magic, and it is clear you have skill at living in the wild. It is not enough. Believe me when I tell you you will die in the mountains without guides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Tell me more,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy would this Falconer have sent for me? And why is his wife called the Spider Queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe demands things that catch his fancy,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes famous jewels for his queen.\u201d Her mouth twisted. \u201cSometimes legendary beauties for himself. If they are not given to him, he sends his assassins\u2014and his assassins never fail. They are all fiercely loyal, for the Spider Queen has some magic that keeps them in her thrall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a spider in its web,\u201d I murmured. Erdene nodded. Now I felt more than a little ill. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s what happened to Bao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She looked sick, too. \u201cWhen he left..... when he set out after you, I was certain he would catch up to the Falconer\u2019s men long before they reached his stronghold, and that he would find a way to free you. He\u2019s very clever and very stubborn, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d My throat felt tight. \u201cBut I was on my way to Vralia instead, and there were no men for him to catch up to, so he must have gone all the way to the Falconer\u2019s stronghold.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Spider Queen\u2019s lair,\u201d Erdene finished my thought.</p><p>We gazed at one another in silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you really mean to go after him?\u201d she asked at length, looking and sounding terribly young.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do.\u201d</p><p>Erdene took a deep breath. \u201cThere is someone who may be able to help you. The Lady of Rats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRats,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>She gave me a wry smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I cannot remember their names properly. They are all foreign, and until you vanished, these were but tales told on a long winter\u2019s night, brought by northern Bhodistani traders and repeated to pass the hours. But she is real. She is a widowed queen whose husband was killed by the Falconer\u2019s assassins when he refused to surrender her. Her kingdom is in a valley below the Falconer\u2019s, and she is his enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy rats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is said they follow her.\u201d</p><p>I ran a hand through my hair. \u201cFalcons, spiders, rats..... my lady, how much truth do you reckon there is to these tales?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Erdene said steadily. \u201cI have heard tales of a jade-eyed witch who freed the Emperor of Ch\u2019in\u2019s daughter from a dragon\u2019s curse, brought a dead man back to life, and dazzled a thousand others into losing their memories. How much truth do you reckon there is to that tale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d I smiled ruefully. \u201cThe memories were offered freely. The curse wasn\u2019t the dragon\u2019s doing, and it was Master Lo Feng who restored life to the dead man.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cBao truly died?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBao truly died.\u201d</p><p>Her face was vulnerable. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have told you,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAnd I will say again, I apologize to you. I didn\u2019t know about you, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know.\u201d Erdene sniffled. \u201cStupid boy!\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>Through her tears, she summoned a faint smile. \u201cYou must love him very much. I thought I did, but I would never undertake such a quest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.....\u201d I glanced toward the south where Bao\u2019s distant diadh-anam guttered, still and always calling to mine. \u201cYou might if your bedamned destiny insisted on it.\u201d Rummaging in my satchel, I found the last item I was missing\u2014the crystal vial of Jehanne\u2019s perfume, her parting gift to me. Tilting it, I could see that a bit of liquid remained. The cut facets caught the bright sunlight, refracting it into tiny rainbows. My heart ached anew at the loss of her. \u201cAnd where last I called home, nothing but grief awaits me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty, that bottle,\u201d Erdene offered in a soft tone. \u201cAnd the scent smells so very, very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does.\u201d I put it away, back in the satchel. \u201cThank you, my lady. You didn\u2019t have to do this. I am grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I busied myself repacking everything. \u201cBut I am grateful nonetheless. Is there more you can tell me about this menagerie of enemies and allies I face?\u201d</p><p>Erdene shook her head. \u201cNothing useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be going, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to cross the desert?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I blinked at her. \u201cDesert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Moirin.\u201d She gave me an impatient look. \u201cBeneath the shadow of the Abode of the Gods, no rain falls. It is all desert. Do you know the route to the caravanserai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>She sighed, scraping a patch of overgrazed earth clear. \u201cI will draw you a map. Fix it in your mind, and do not wander into the desert alone, or you will die before you reach the mountains.\u201d</p><p>We knelt and leaned our heads together over the map Erdene sketched in the dirt. She laid out the route clearly, describing and indicating landmarks, and I did my best to fix it in my memory.</p><p>\u201cYou describe it well,\u201d I said when she had finished.</p><p>Erdene straightened and rested her hands on her thighs. \u201cI studied the map with Bao before he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aided him?\u201d It surprised me.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked away. \u201cI was angry at him, but what my father did was wrong. And I suppose.....\u201d She gave a little shrug. \u201cYou belong together, you and Bao. No matter how much it hurts to admit it, it is true. For whatever purpose, the gods have joined you. When you came, I saw a fierce passion in him I had never seen before. He loves you, not me.\u201d A wry smile curved her lips. \u201cAs you see, I am no thief, to keep what does not truly belong to me. I would rather know Bao was happy with you than miserable with me.\u201d She looked back at me. \u201cI did not know my father had sent you to Vralia, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWas it terrible there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I couldn\u2019t read her expression. \u201cTerrible in its own way. I was lucky to escape alive. If it would please you to know that I suffered, I did.\u201d I glanced at the map. \u201cAlthough I suspect there is more suffering in store for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t please me.\u201d Bowing her head, Erdene fidgeted with the sash wrapped around her long coat. \u201cOnce upon a time I thought it would, but it doesn\u2019t. What you said to me before about not being ashamed of love and desire..... Before all this happened, before my father betrayed you..... it helped. And it helped to know you had once loved a man who did not love you in return, too. It made me feel less of a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I do not think you are a fool at all, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her head, she smiled a crooked smile. \u201cEven though I still love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially so,\u201d I said firmly. Getting to my feet, I extended my hand to her. \u201cIt takes courage to love.\u201d</p><p>Erdene took my hand and rose. Her gaze was clear and earnest. \u201cI don\u2019t want Bao to die, Moirin. You\u2019ll do your best to find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promised.</p><p>Surprising me again, she gave me a hard, fierce hug. I returned the embrace, wrapping my arms around her small, stalwart figure. Short as she was, the top of her head barely came to my chin.</p><p>And I understood why she had kept my things as a reminder of Bao. We shared a connection to him. This was as close as I would get to my stubborn peasant-boy for a long, long time.</p><p>And I had a long, long way to go.</p><p>With a sigh, I released her. \u201cUnless you have more wisdom to impart, I should be going.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, no more.\u201d</p><p>I bent and kissed her cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay all your gods be with you, Moirin,\u201d Erdene said soberly. \u201cI fear you will need them.\u201d</p><p>So did I.</p><p>FORTY-EIGHT</p><p>For once, my impulsiveness had not led me astray. Without Erdene\u2019s directions, it was very possible I would have wandered into the desert, underestimating its rigors, and found myself trapped there. Wary of the Great Khan\u2019s enmity, I\u2019d become accustomed to avoiding people. I felt safer alone, especially since I had discovered the secret of fixing anchor-stones to conceal my campsite beneath the twilight while I slept.</p><p>But when at last I reached the far verges of the southern steppe, my first glimpse of the stony, barren expanse of the empty desert that lay beyond the grasslands convinced me that Erdene was right.</p><p>I turned eastward, riding along the edge of the barren desert, following my memory of the map that Bao\u2019s abandoned Tatar bride had sketched in the dirt.</p><p>Erdene had guided me well; I had been right to trust her.</p><p>So it was that many days after our encounter, I found myself amidst a sprawling caravanserai on the outskirts of the desert, where traders from Ch\u2019in, the Tatar territory, Bhodistan, and even Khebbel-im-Akkad bartered and traded, arranging for passage in a babble of competing tongues.</p><p>As used as I\u2019d become to solitude, it intimidated me; and too, there was the lingering fear that someone loyal to the Khan would recognize and betray me. There weren\u2019t many women among the caravans, and my green eyes and half-D\u2019Angeline features marked me. I thought of summoning the twilight to hide me while I took the measure of the place, but it was difficult to navigate through dense crowds unseen. And, too, it would only be delaying the inevitable. So I made camp some distance from the vast city of tents and gers, and entered it warily on horseback.</p><p>People, so many people! And there were milling horses, and tall camels with two humps on their backs, an animal I\u2019d only ever seen before in a royal menagerie. Scents from scores of cook fires filled the air, and there was a steady stream of folk watering animals and filling skins and barrels at the river that seeped sluggishly into the barren desert.</p><p>I had to own, it was all a bit overwhelming; and now that I\u2019d seen the desert, the task ahead of me seemed more daunting than ever. There was a part of me that yearned to turn tail and flee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was possible. I wasn\u2019t far from the Ch\u2019in border. I still had the Imperial seal in my possession. I could travel east to the nearest gate in the Great Wall and present it, and all my difficulties would be over. To be sure, the Divine Emperor was a pragmatic fellow who thought of his country first. Having survived a civil war that could have torn his empire apart, I knew he would not risk sparking a fresh conflict by launching a quest into Tatar territory and beyond to retrieve one errant peasant-boy\u2014but he would see me safely home.</p><p>That much at least, he owed me.</p><p>All I had to do was abandon Bao.</p> <p>The Imperial army would grant me an escort to Shuntian. It would be a great pleasure to see Snow Tiger again. She was more than a friend, and she would understand the profound sense of loss I would feel better than anyone else in the world. And I had no doubt that for my services rendered to the Celestial Empire, her father, Emperor Zhu, would commission a greatship to take me home, carrying me thousands and thousands of leagues across the sea.</p><p>And, yes, Jehanne was gone; but at least in Terre d\u2019Ange I would be reunited with my lovely, gracious father.</p><p>And across the Straits, in Alba, my mother. My private, taciturn, much-beloved mother, who had sent her only child off to an unknown destiny. If I died in the desert or the mountains, she would never know what had become of me.</p><p>If I gave up, I would see her again. See her face alight with joy, hear the lilt in her voice as she called me by the old, familiar endearment in my birth-tongue, a tongue I\u2019d not heard spoken since I left.</p><p>I\u2019ve missed you so much, Moirin mine.</p> <p>Just the thought of it brought tears to my eyes\u2014and yet my diadh-anam flared in violent alarm.</p><p>Far, far to the south, its missing half flickered feebly.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t give up. As appealing I might find the notion in a moment of weakness, I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t turn away from the call of my diadh-anam. I couldn\u2019t leave Bao to suffer and die at the hands of this bedamned Falconer fellow and his Spider Queen.</p><p>So I gave myself a moment to wallow in self-pity; then I wiped my eyes and summoned my resolve.</p><p>Emerging from my reverie, I realized there was a Tatar boy some twelve years old staring at me with disturbing intensity, his dark eyes scrutinizing every detail of my person. When I returned his gaze, he turned around and raced away, dashing through the corridors of tents.</p><p>That didn\u2019t bode well.</p> <p>My thoughts were a jumbled mess. I glanced around, spotting the nearest encampment of Ch\u2019in traders, wondering if it would be wiser to flee, or to ask them to grant me sanctuary based on the Imperial medallion. Technically, I was still in Tatar territory, but this was land that had been often disputed and currently existed in a state of uneasy truce for the purposes of trade.</p><p>If I fled.....</p><p>I could summon the twilight and conceal my camp, but for how long? And how would I ever cross the desert if I did?</p><p>Torn between bad options, I hesitated too long. Quicker than I thought possible, the boy returned, tugging a much older Tatar man by the hand. Sighing inwardly, I unslung my bow and nocked an arrow. \u201cIf you mean to betray me to the Great Khan, I am warning you, I will go fighting!\u201d I said in a fierce voice.</p><p>Both the boy and the old man raised their empty hands in a peaceable gesture, shaking their heads hard. The old man clicked his tongue and made the \u201cHa, ha,\u201d sound the Tatars used to soothe animals.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d the boy said. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>I lowered the bow a fraction. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>The old man peered at me, his eyes rheumy. \u201cI do not see colors so well anymore, but my grandson says you have green eyes, as green as grass, and a blue-green jade bangle around your wrist. Some months ago, we escorted a rather desperate young man across the desert. He was looking for a young woman of your description.\u201d</p> <p>My heart gave a leap. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>They nodded. \u201cHe described her to every trader we passed,\u201d the boy said. \u201cNo one had seen her. But it sounded just like you. Was it? Are you looking for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The elderly Tatar rubbed his hands together. \u201cHe paid very well for a swift passage, the swiftest we could manage. Instead of coin, he paid with a tonic made from a dried root worth more than gold or gems. I was able to sell it at great profit, after I tried it myself to see how potent it was.\u201d A gleeful grin split his wrinkled face. \u201cMy wife was very surprised!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile a little in response. \u201cI believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have more?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. But I do have coin, and I am seeking passage across the desert, the swifter the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh.\u201d He looked disappointed.</p><p>The boy tugged at his sleeve. \u201cIt\u2019s for Bao, grandfather!\u201d There was a clear note of hero-worship in his voice. \u201cWe have to help her. She\u2019s Bao\u2019s Moirin! You are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he added, glancing at me.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I said ruefully. \u201cI suppose I am.\u201d</p><p>The old man sucked his teeth. \u201cEh, come along, then. If you\u2019re willing to put your bow away, I\u2019m willing to discuss the price of passage.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to betray you to the Great Khan!\u201d he said in an irritable tone. \u201cMy grandson says you wear the blue scarf of kinship, and I am offering you the hospitality of my roof. We\u2019re desert folk; we honor the sacred laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBatu\u2019s tribe, right?\u201d the boy asked, his eyes gleaming. \u201cI remember!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVachir\u2019s tribe,\u201d I said softly. \u201cBut you\u2019re right, I did wear a scarf given to me by Batu\u2019s wife. It was taken away from me in Vralia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVralia!\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBao was misled. The Great Khan sent us in opposite directions. And now I fear Bao is in trouble.\u201d</p><p>The boy caught his breath. \u201cThe Falconer and the Spider Queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know of them?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows!\u201d</p><p>The old man cuffed the boy\u2019s head without malice. \u201cEveryone knows tales,\u201d he said absentmindedly. \u201cNo one knows the truth. Well, child?\u201d He turned his rheumy gaze on me. \u201cAre you willing to trust my word, or do you doubt me?\u201d</p><p>I paused a moment longer, then returned the arrow to my quiver and slung my bow over my shoulder. \u201cNo, Grandfather. I do not doubt your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He sucked his teeth again in a meditative manner, eyeing me beneath wrinkled lids. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019ve none of the dried root to barter with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sure,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cPity,\u201d he said with regret. \u201cI should have saved more for myself.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-NINE</p><p>The old man\u2019s name was Unegen, which meant fox\u2014and he was indeed an old fox. The boy\u2019s name was Dash, which meant good luck.</p><p>It was appropriate.</p><p>It was a piece of luck that he had spotted me, a piece of luck that he recognized me from Bao\u2019s oft-repeated description. A piece of luck that he had developed a boy\u2019s hero-worshipping attachment to Bao and begged so strongly on my behalf.</p><p>The bargain we concluded wasn\u2019t a perfect one. I didn\u2019t have enough coin to purchase the sort of exclusive, swift escort Bao had bought with the aphrodisiac tonic of dried Camaeline snowdrop bulbs.</p><p>No, I would be travelling across the Tatar desert with a larger, slower caravan under Unegen\u2019s supervision, a group of northern mountain-folk called the Tufani who had concluded a successful trade and were returning home laden with Ch\u2019in silks.</p><p>Still, it would get me across the desert.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, you\u2019re on your own,\u201d Unegen warned me. \u201cJust like your young man. You\u2019ll need to find someone else to get you across the Path of Heaven\u2019s Spear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did Bao find?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Unegen shrugged. \u201cNot my concern.\u201d</p><p>So be it, I reckoned. I would deal with the next step when I came to it. For now I would cross the desert.</p><p>It was not a pleasant journey.</p><p>To spare the horses, we rode on tall camels, which also carried the bulk of the Tufani\u2019s cargo. That part I didn\u2019t mind once I grew accustomed to the strange, swaying gait of the camels. They weren\u2019t the friendliest creatures I\u2019d ever met, but I had a good rapport with animals, and mine carried me willingly enough.</p><p>But I was not a child of the desert, not by any means. I was a child of the woods and forest. So very, very little grew here, it made the grasslands of the steppe seem lush by comparison.</p><p>And it was dry, so dry.</p><p>During the day, a hot, dry wind blew endlessly, scouring the barren rock and coating everything with dust. If there is one memory that defines that harsh passage for me, it is the memory of dust. Dust in every fold of my clothing, dust in my hair, dust making my eyes gritty, the taste of dust on my tongue, gritting between my teeth.</p><p>Washing was seldom an option. There was no water to spare. The river we followed at the outset quickly vanished. From time to time, it would resurface, and when it did, it was cause for rejoicing. We would water our animals and replenish our stores, and wash the ever-present dust from our hands and faces, even though we\u2019d be coated anew within half an hour\u2019s time.</p><p>Mostly, though, when we came upon water, it was brackish little pools seeping to the surface. Sometimes it was fit for the camels to drink, for they were built to survive in the desert and had hardier systems than most creatures, but neither horses nor humans could stomach it. I tried washing in one once, and once only. The foul, brackish scent that clung to my skin wasn\u2019t worth a few dust-free minutes.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t entirely devoid of life. In places wild onion grew, and a kind of low scrub-grass. There were birds, little plovers that ran on long legs and hunted for insects on the desert floor.</p><p>My young companion, Dash, took great pleasure in telling me about a legendary worm that inhabited the desert, a bright red segmented creature that resembled a cow\u2019s intestine. He cheerfully informed me that it could grow up to five feet in length, and spat acid that would eat one\u2019s skin.</p><p>That had me in a state of trepidation for days. Even after Dash admitted that no one he knew had ever seen one of these fabled insects, I kept a wary eye out for the sight of anything creeping and scarlet.</p><p>As we travelled, I did my best to make use of the time and learn what I could about the Falconer, the Spider Queen, and the Lady of Rats.</p><p>The Tufani traders were my best source of information, and I found them a cheerful, friendly folk. During the day, it was too hot and dusty for conversation\u2014only Dash managed to find the energy to chatter\u2014but we spoke at night around campfires of dried camel-dung gathered along the way, gnawing on strips of dried meat and hard cheese, softening both with judicious sips of water.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Dorje, one of the traders who spoke fluent Tatar, nodded when I first inquired. \u201cThe Falconer in his eyrie, he is real. Ten years ago, he stole a great jewel from Tufan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of jewel?\u201d</p><p>Dorje smiled with sorrow. \u201cThe human kind. A young woman named Laysa who was born to a family of yak-herders. She was very beautiful, and so gentle that it seemed as though a light shone from her face. Everyone who saw her said she must be a reincarnation of a great saint, one of the Enlightened Ones come back to guide us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever see her?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cI saw her,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt was true. She had a grace that one cannot put into words. Surely, she was meant to accomplish much on the Path of Dharma. But the Falconer heard of her, and sent his messengers to fetch her. She refused to go, and her father and brothers said that they would fight anyone who tried to take her.\u201d</p><p>One of the other traders, following the conversation, drew a hand across his throat in a slitting gesture.</p><p>I winced. \u201cThey were killed?\u201d</p><p>Dorje nodded. \u201cOne of the Falconer\u2019s assassins came the next night, a dark-skinned southern Bhodistani warrior. He fought with a battle-axe in each hand. He killed all the men, and took Laysa away. No one has seen her since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe takes real jewels, too,\u201d the second trader offered. \u201cDid you hear of the famous Phoenix Stone?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cA ruby the size of my fist.\u201d He held out a clenched fist to illustrate. \u201cFlawless, with a heart of fire. It belonged to the Maharaja of Chodur, who gave it to his bride on their wedding night. When the Falconer\u2019s spider-wife heard of it, she wanted it. He sent his messengers to demand it. The Maharaja laughed, sent them away, and doubled his palace guard. The next morning.....\u201d He made another throat-slitting gesture. \u201cThe Maharaja and his bride were dead in their beds, and the Phoenix Stone was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may only be a traders\u2019 tale,\u201d Dorje said cautiously. \u201cWe do not know if it is true.\u201d</p><p>The other shrugged. \u201cWe do not know it is not. And there are others like it, too many for all to be lies.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cDoes he have a name, a real name, this Falconer? Where exactly does he live? What about his wife, the Spider Queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, he has a name,\u201d Dorje confirmed. \u201cTarik Khaga, the Raja of Kurugiri. That is the name of his eyrie, his stronghold in the mountains. It is south of Tufan, looming above the Path of Heaven\u2019s Spear. His Spider Queen wife.....\u201d He shrugged, too. \u201cShe is called Jagrati. It is a Bhodistani name. But no one knows where she came from, not for certain.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the name Jagrati spoken, one of the other Tufani traders ventured a comment in his own tongue. They conferred amongst themselves, and for the thousandth time in my life, I wished humankind didn\u2019t have so many bedamned languages. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPemba says he heard that the Spider Queen Jagrati was born to the lowest of the low among her people,\u201d Dorje said in a hushed whisper. \u201cShe is what the Bhodistani call an untouchable.\u201d</p><p>I was confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He studied me gravely. \u201cYou know nothing of Bhodistani society and religion?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt is all very complicated. Everyone is born into a caste that determines their role in life, based on the life they lived before this one. The priests are the highest. Second are the rulers and warriors, and merchants are third. Fourth come the workers, who toil to serve the higher castes. The lowest of the low, the untouchables, they do not even have a caste. They perform tasks that are unclean.\u201d</p> <p>The word unclean stirred an uneasy memory of the Patriarch and his creamy smile within my memories. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as handling corpses and gathering night-soil. Tasks so unclean that even the shadow of an untouchable can pollute one\u2019s food, so it must be discarded.\u201d Dorje stretched out his hands and regarded them. \u201cThat is not the belief of those of us who follow the Path of Dharma and Sakyamuni\u2019s teaching. But it is the belief in Bhodistan, where they worship many different gods.\u201d</p><p>It was enough to make my head spin.</p><p>Stone and sea, the folk of the world hold a great many peculiar beliefs! That night, I was glad when Unegen bade us in an irritable voice to cease our yammering, extinguish the coals, and take to our bedrolls.</p><p>And in the morning.....</p> <p>More desert.</p><p>More dust.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Lady of Rats?\u201d I asked Dorje on the second night into our journey. \u201cCan you put a name to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRats?\u201d he echoed in an inquiring tone.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI was told she is the Falconer\u2019s enemy. Tarik Khaga\u2019s enemy,\u201d I said in clarification. \u201cHe sought to acquire her, and her husband refused. He was killed by Khaga\u2019s assassins\u2014and yet she remains to defy him.\u201d</p><p>A heated discussion ensued among the Tufani.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dorje said at length. \u201cThere is such a woman, a widow. The Rani of Bhaktipur, who rules in the valley kingdom below the Falconer\u2019s eyrie. The Raja hid her away when the Falconer sent for her. The Falconer\u2019s assassins slew him, but they did not succeed in taking his widow.\u201d He shuddered a little. \u201cWhy, no one knows for sure, except that the men who guard her are also fiercely loyal. And there is a temple there, a very famous temple among the Bhodistani, where rats are worshipped as an aspect of one of their goddesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is true,\u201d I mused. \u201cRats.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cRats.\u201d</p><p>It was a long journey. Over the course of weeks, I must have heard a hundred tales of the Falconer and the Spider Queen, of his acquisitive nature, of her unholy wiles. Of the myriad assassins they employed, and the myriad ways in which they dispatched their targets. Dash listened to them with a boy\u2019s morbid delight, contributing details he had heard. Unegen shook his head in disapproval, but he held his tongue more often than not.</p><p>I tried to sort through it all and cling to what was real.</p><p>The Falconer was real; so be it. He had a name, Tarik Khaga. He lived in a place, a real place, called Kurugiri.</p><p>The Spider Queen.....</p><p>Well, at least she had one name. Jagrati. Where she came from and what mysterious thrall she wielded were much in debate.</p> <p>The fact that she did wield a mysterious thrall, wasn\u2019t.</p><p>FIFTY</p><p>Midway through the journey, I saw the mountain range on the horizon.</p><p>The Abode of the Gods.</p><p>It stretched east and west as far as the eye could see, but at first glance, I didn\u2019t think its snow-capped peaks seemed all that imposing. In a few days\u2019 journey, I thought, we would reach the base.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>It took us two more weeks of slogging across the barren desert, the mountains remaining tantalizingly distant. By the time we were travelling beneath their shadow, I was well and properly in awe of their scale.</p><p>I was also profoundly grateful that I hadn\u2019t had sufficient coin to book Unegen\u2019s caravan for an exclusive passage across the desert. I\u2019d grown fond of the good-natured Tufani traders, and Dorje had seen fit to take me under his wing. He promised me that I might travel with them through the first series of passes into the trade-city of Rasa in Tufan. There, he assured me, I would be able to find an escort to guide me through the Path of Heaven\u2019s Spear, to the distant valley kingdom of Bhaktipur.</p><p>The day we reached the base of the Abode of the Gods, we made camp beneath their looming presence. In Alba, the foothills alone would have been reckoned formidable mountains. I gazed beyond the foothills at the narrow crease of the first great pass, ascending sharply into the unknown heights. The late-afternoon sun drenched the eastern half of the pass in golden light, plunging the western half in stark shadow.</p><p>\u201cThis is where you left Bao?\u201d I asked Dash.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIn the morning, he set out alone, and Grandfather and I turned back to cross the desert.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow is Bao?\u201d</p><p>Dash knew I had a sense of Bao\u2019s presence. Over the course of the journey, there had been ample time for me to tell my half of our story, which the boy had been eager to hear. I consulted our diadh-anams. Mine burned strongly within me, a clean, blazing spark urging me into the dizzying heights.</p><p>Bao\u2019s was motionless and unchanged.</p><p>It was as it had been from the moment Aleksei had unlocked my chains\u2014dull, sullen, and guttering.</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d I said soberly.</p><p>Young Dash knitted his brows. \u201cThat\u2019s not good, is it? Moirin..... let me come with you. I can help. I\u2019m sure I can.\u201d</p><p>His grandfather\u2019s head jerked up in alarm.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. I settled for bowing gravely to Dash in the Ch\u2019in manner, hand clasped over fist. \u201cThank you, young hero. Your heart is wise and courageous beyond its years. But this task was set before me by the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, and I cannot allow you to risk yourself; nor can I risk depriving Grandfather Unegen of his pride and joy, the light of his heart.\u201d</p><p>The elderly Tatar grunted, relaxing.</p><p>Dash flushed, his cheeks reddening. \u201cBut I want to help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you have,\u201d I said gently. \u201cYou are my piece of good luck, Dash. You found me when I did not think I wanted to be found, and because of you, I have reached the mountains safely, with good companions to continue the journey. I will carry the hope of that moment forward with me, always.\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s just.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I knelt and hugged him. \u201cYou will find your own story, young hero. This is only a piece of it.\u201d</p><p>Dash returned my embrace, his wiry young arms flung tight around my shoulders, his face pressed against my neck. And there beneath the shadow of the Abode of the Gods, I could not help but think that Master Lo was right. All ways led to the Way. From one thing, all things arise.</p><p>Son, brother, lover, stranger..... it was all part of the same river of life.</p><p>My heart ached.</p><p>\u201cYou will find Bao?\u201d Dash\u2019s dark eyes searched mine. \u201cFind him and save him? He told me things and taught me\u2014oh so many things! I know it was only a short time, but he became as a brother to me, an older brother. I always wanted one. Promise me, Moirin! You\u2019ll save him, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I leaned my brow against his. \u201cI will do my best, little brother. Nothing is certain. I can promise no more.\u201d</p><p>Unegen coughed.</p><p>I kissed Dash on the cheek and stood. \u201cYes, Grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat and sleep,\u201d he said with rough gentleness. \u201cNo time for stories tonight. You will need all your strength tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. You will not find it easy in the heights where the air is thin.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head toward him. \u201cThank you. I will heed your advice.\u201d</p><p>The following day, I saddled my mare and loaded my pack-horse for the first time in weeks. The Tufani supervised the transfer of cargo to their own string of pack-horses. After all of us had checked our goods and supplies one last time, there was nothing left to do but say farewell.</p><p>Dash gave me one last hug, and so, to my surprise, did his grandfather. I was touched by the gesture, at least until the old fox reached around and gave my buttocks a firm squeeze, startling a squeak from me.</p><p>\u201cHeh.\u201d Unegen released me with a sly grin. \u201cA man wouldn\u2019t need dried root tonic with the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad man, Grandfather.\u201d</p><p>His grin only widened. \u201cI\u2019m not your grandfather, girl, and that memory will keep me warm at night come winter.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t mind, not really. There had been no malice in it, and if Unegen or any of the others had intended me harm along the way, they would have had ample chance to act on it. And it brought a moment of levity that made the parting easier.</p><p>All was in readiness.</p><p>On Dorje\u2019s word, our company set out to begin the long climb over the foothills. At the top of the first, I paused to look backward. Unegen and Dash led the caravan of camels across the desert plain. Already, they looked small and distant.</p><p>\u201cYou grew fond of the boy,\u201d Dorje observed.</p><p>\u201cAye, I did,\u201d I agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s just that my life seems to be filled with so many partings. It saddens me to think of how many good folk I\u2019ve met that I\u2019ll never see again.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over in the saddle and laid a hand on my shoulder. \u201cDo not let it sadden you, Moirin. You are blessed to have met so many worthy souls. It should gladden your heart to think on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve met my share of unworthy ones, too,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI do not doubt it.\u201d Dorje\u2019s expression was grave. \u201cBut I think the good ones outnumber the bad, do they not?\u201d</p><p>I thought about my experiences among the Tatars, and nodded. Despite the Great Khan\u2019s betrayal, I had found a great deal of kindness and generosity among his folk. \u201cYes.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cAnd you are surely numbered among the good ones, Dorje. I will be sorry to part from you, too.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back at me. \u201cEveryone loves a tale of great romance, but it is seldom that one gets to play a part in one. I am happy we can help you on your quest to find your young man.\u201d His expression turned grave again. \u201cWhat will you do if you find he is well and truly under the Spider Queen\u2019s thrall? Have you a plan?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>It was a worry I had pushed to the back of my thoughts. I had to survive the desert and the mountains before figuring out how to free Bao from the clutches of a sinister queen abiding in an impregnable fortress ruled by her equally sinister husband.</p><p>The na\u00efve, hopeful side of me wanted to believe that it would be easy, that all I had to do was find Bao, that once I did, the irresistible force of my diadh-anam calling to his would bring us together as simply and effortlessly as it had during the Tatar gathering that seemed so very, very long ago.</p><p>But since that time, I had been forced to confront my limitations. My diadh-anam was a symbol of living proof of the divine grace of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, of Her love for Her children, of the gifts She had given us.</p><p>And yet it was fragile and vulnerable, too.</p><p>As I had experienced all too vividly, it could be constrained by foreign magics. Never in my life had I felt more helpless than I had during my captivity in Vralia.</p><p>If it was magic that held Bao captive, it must be at least as powerful. More, mayhap. He was a skilled, clever fighter. I had no doubt that in my place, Bao would have found a way to escape his captors long before they crossed the mountains into Vralia, throttling them with his own chains.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t found a way to escape this.</p><p>By now I thought it unlikely that Bao was injured or ill, as I had first suspected. It had been too long. His condition would have improved or worsened, not remained in the same unchanging state for months.</p><p>Well and so, that was a good thing, wasn\u2019t it? My new friend Dorje would say so. I made myself believe it, pushing my worries aside once more. When the time came, I would find a way. For now, it was enough to concentrate on the journey.</p><p>Our small caravan descended the far side of the first foothill, and began ascending the second. Although I was glad to leave the desert, the terrain was still harsh and barren. Dorje assured me that there would be lakes and pastures along the way, pockets of green, growing life.</p><p>I hoped so.</p><p>On the first day in the mountains, we crossed three enormous foothills and made camp at the base of the third.</p><p>On the morrow, we would enter the first great pass. After tending to my horses, I sat and breathed the Five Styles, watching swift dusk fall over the tall peaks on either side of it, blue shadows turning to darkness.</p><p>Bao had set out on this path alone.</p><p>I wondered if he had been scared.</p><p>I was.</p><p>FIFTY-ONE</p><p>On the second day, we entered the first pass.</p><p>We climbed upward, ascending into the Abode of the Gods.</p><p>Upward.</p><p>Upward.</p><p>Upward.</p><p>And although I was riding, and my poor, laboring mare\u2014whom I had named Lady, for lack of a more creative inspiration\u2014was doing all the work, still, my breath came short as the air grew thin.</p><p>I felt pressure building behind my eyes, making my head ache fiercely. Betimes, my vision grew dark and spangled.</p><p>Stubbornly, I refused to succumb to it. I focused my gaze on Lady\u2019s bobbing ears and breathed the Breath of Wind\u2019s Sigh, calling it into the space behind my eyes, embracing the height and the thin air.</p><p>When I did, the pressure eased. Once again, I was indebted to Master Lo\u2019s teaching. The thought made me wistful, but it also served to increase my determination to find Bao and rescue him. It was unacceptable to think that Master Lo Feng had given his life to restore his magpie\u2019s in vain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Tufani were at ease in the mountains, bright-eyed and cheerful, reveling in the heights. Throughout the long, arduous climb, their spirits rose. All along the caravan, they called back and forth to one another in their own tongue, laughing and jesting.</p><p>I envied and admired them, forcing myself to concentrate. The path through the pass was steep and narrow. Sure-footed though she was, from time to time, Lady\u2019s hooves slipped and scrabbled on loose rocks. And I had my pack-horse, whom I called Flick, on a lead-line, and must not hurry him, letting him pick his way with equal care.</p><p>By the time we reached the path\u2019s summit, the sun was beginning to set\u2014or at least, so it seemed in the gorge, stark shadows settling over us.</p> <p>And then we did reach the summit.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I blinked, startled. A shallow descent led to a green, sun-gilded valley. There was a small lake nestled there as though within a cupped palm, its waters a startling turquoise hue. To the east and west of us, immense snow-capped peaks soared skyward with untouchable majesty.</p><p>I could not help but think of White Jade Mountain and the dragon. I thought that had been a vast peak, but these dwarfed it. And I understood, truly, why they called this range the Abode of the Gods. Surely nothing less than the gods themselves must dwell in those incredible heights.</p><p>Dorje smiled at my awe. \u201cNow you see, Moirin. These are sacred places.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to be told; I could feel it prickling against my skin. Even so, I smiled back at him. \u201cI do see. It\u2019s very, very beautiful here.\u201d</p> <p>We made camp in the valley beside the lake, turning the grateful horses loose to graze their fill. Once again, I watched dusk settle over the mountains. At this height, it was even more spectacular, vivid gold and ruddy pinks slowly giving way to shifting hues of blue and deep indigo darkening to pitch-black in the crevasses. I didn\u2019t think one could ever tire of the sight, and I found myself looking forward to dawn that I might see the entire process in reverse, the shadows retreating up the white-mantled glory of the peaks.</p><p>It was cold, though. Once the sun was altogether gone, I realized how much colder it was in the heights. And it was only going to get colder as winter drew nigh.</p><p>In my tent, I wrapped myself in my blanket and shivered myself to sleep. I would need warmer clothes and blankets if I was to survive this journey.</p><p>Come morning, the matter preyed on my thoughts. I would have to act swiftly in the trade-city of Rasa. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d get caught out by winter once more, and Dorje had warned me that the Path of Heaven\u2019s Spear would be impassable for months.</p><p>I thought it very possible that I might die of impatience if I were forced to delay my quest for months.</p><p>Dorje was confident that so long as we met no trouble along the way, we would arrive in Rasa in time for me to join one of the last Bhodistani trade caravans going south. What troubled me was the matter of payment.</p> <p>I\u2019d given well nigh the last of my coin to Unegen, and while I didn\u2019t think the old fox had cheated me, it meant that Erdene was right, and the last item of great value I had was the Imperial jade seal.</p><p>It was a precious gift, and one that spoke of the great trust that Emperor Zhu had placed in me. I felt profoundly guilty at the notion of bartering it, although I would do it if necessary. At the same time, I was unsure if it would be as valuable as I needed it to be to Bhodistani traders going in the opposite direction from Ch\u2019in. As an added difficulty, I would be facing a considerable language barrier.</p><p>As we made our way along the narrow trail, through gorges, along mountainsides, I weighed the matter, breathing the Breath of Wind\u2019s Sigh to clear my head of the aching dizziness that came with the thin air.</p><p>Toward the end of the day, our path intersected with one of the great rivers that carved its way through the Abode of the Gods. We made camp alongside the river in a broad, shallow gorge, pounding tent-stakes into the loose scree and anchoring them with heavier stones. While there was still light, I fetched my satchel and took stock of my possessions once more, sitting cross-legged before my tent, laying each item out on the square cloth embroidered with bamboo.</p><p>A handful of coins, no more than a pittance.</p><p>An ivory-hilted dagger.</p><p>The Imperial medallion.</p><p>Arigh\u2019s Tatar bow, superfluous now that I had my own yew-wood bow. The latter, I had no intentions of parting with. At some point, my survival might depend on it.</p> <p>The last three items were dear to my heart for different reasons, and I would hate to part with any of them\u2014but none of them would save my life.</p><p>A crystal bottle with a few drops of perfume.</p><p>My mother\u2019s signet ring.</p><p>Reluctantly, I worked the blue-green jade bangle loose from my wrist and added it to the array.</p><p>\u201cDorje?\u201d I called to him. \u201cWould you be willing to counsel me?\u201d</p><p>He came over cheerfully, squatting across from me. \u201cYes, of course. What is it?\u201d</p><p>I pointed. \u201cI\u2019ve almost no coin left to me. Along with passage to Bhaktipur, I will need warmer clothes and blankets. These are the items I have to trade, but I do not know how to value them.\u201d</p><p>Dorje clicked his tongue. \u201cYou should not trust a trader!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not trusting just any trader,\u201d I said steadily. \u201cI am trusting you. Will you not advise me?\u201d</p><p>He cast a shrewd eye over my belongings, reached out and touched Arigh\u2019s bow. \u201cThis you could easily trade for a blanket or clothing. It is the best Tatar workmanship, I can see. Such a bow is always of value and use.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, grateful.</p><p>\u201cThis, maybe also.\u201d He touched the dragon-hilted dagger. \u201cIt is very finely made. But you will not get full value for it. Or for this.\u201d He indicated the jade bangle. \u201cIt is of peerless quality, but no one values jade as much as the Ch\u2019in.\u201d</p><p>So such a bangle was enough to provide Bao\u2019s sister, Song, with a dowry, but not enough to buy me passage across the Abode of the Gods.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>Dorje examined the signet ring, its seal etched with the twinned insignia of House Courcel and the Black Boar of the Cullach Gorrym. \u201cI suspect this has value in your own country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is not wrought in a pleasing manner to my eye, and is worth no more than its weight in gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough?\u201d I said glumly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dorje picked up the crystal bottle, tilting it this way and that. Its facets flashed in the lowering light. I stifled a protest when he drew the tight stopper, sniffing at its contents. The scent of Jehanne\u2019s perfume brought a dreamy look to his face. \u201cDoes it possess some magical potency?\u201d he asked. \u201cLike the tonic Unegen spoke of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt just smells nice.\u201d</p><p>He replaced the stopper carefully and set the bottle down. \u201cI do not know, Moirin. It is very pretty, but I do not know what it is worth. Not passage through the Path of Heaven\u2019s Spear.\u201d</p><p>That left the Imperial medallion.</p><p>Dorje gave me an inquiring look as he plucked up the silk cord on which it was strung, studying the dangling medallion. \u201cIs this what I think it is?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He blew out his breath in a long, soft sigh. \u201cThis! Yes, to the right person, this would be worth a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have been told.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cDorje, it was given to me in trust by the Emperor of Ch\u2019in. I am reluctant to betray that trust, but I find myself with little choice. Although.....\u201d The memory of Unegen reaching around to squeeze my buttocks came to mind unbidden. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, I suppose,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cNaamah lay down with strangers in the gutters of Bhodistan to get coin that Blessed Elua might eat. There is no reason I could not do the same for Bao\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Dorje looked at me in horror. \u201cMoirin, you mustn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I shrugged with a nonchalance I didn\u2019t feel. It had seemed a much more romantic notion in tales than it did in the cold, gritty light of reality. I was no goddess whose very nature sanctified any union of her choosing, only a young mortal woman, tired and dirty and far from home. \u201cSurely it would be worth the cost of passage, and I would not need to betray the Emperor\u2019s trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d He shook his head in violent disapproval. \u201cThat is not acceptable.\u201d He rocked back on his heels, thinking. \u201cLet me confer with the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I watched him rise with alacrity and trot over the scree to discuss the matter with the other Tufani traders. Two of them nodded in eager agreement; the others appeared to accede with varying degrees of enthusiasm.</p><p>Dorje returned beaming, dropping into a careless squat. \u201cAs soon as we have been paid for delivering our goods in Rasa, we will buy the Imperial medallion from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d I stared at him.</p><p>He looked offended. \u201cYou said that you trusted me, Moirin! Why not? We would buy it from you in return for negotiating passage to Bhaktipur, and all that you require. Blankets and clothing and coin to spare. And I can promise you, it will not fall into the wrong hands.\u201d His voice took on an indignant tone. \u201cI will not let that happen, not ever. We may even use it ourselves. So. Is it a bargain you can accept?\u201d</p><p>I laughed with relief. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Dorje looked as relieved as I felt. \u201cShared journeys forge connections. You became as an older sister to the boy Dash, and you have become as a younger sister to me. I could not let you do such a thing.\u201d</p><p>I felt an obscure need to defend the notion. \u201cIt is a sacred calling among my father\u2019s people, you know.\u201d</p><p>Dorje raised his brows. \u201cAre you called to it now?\u201d</p><p>I paused, then shook my head. \u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI have been called to serve Naamah in different ways before. Not this way.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, satisfied. \u201cThen it is decided.\u201d</p><p>I gave him an impulsive hug. \u201cThank you, Dorje.\u201d</p><p>He extricated himself and patted my head in a tentative manner. \u201cYou are welcome, Moirin. I hope it will help you to remember that there are more good people than bad in the world.\u201d</p><p>I did, too.</p><p>FIFTY-TWO</p><p>Days later, we arrived at Rasa.</p><p>It had been a harsh, grueling journey and it ended in a city atop a wind-swept plateau, an arid, dizzying place of dun-colored rock and cutting winds, ringed about with snow-capped mountain peaks.</p><p>Even so, it was not without beauty.</p><p>I had come to love the thin air and the heights, the hardy cedar and poplar that grew beneath the treeline of the mountains, with their stubborn, insistent thoughts. I had come to admire the tough yaks and sheep that found pastures in the valleys where village folk tilled the rocky soil and planted barley.</p><p>I had grown fond, very fond, of Dorje and his fellow Tufani traders.</p><p>Even so, it was difficult to place my unstinting trust in them. And yet I did, praying silently to the Maghuin Dhonn Herself that it was not misguided.</p><p>While they concluded their bargaining, I stayed with Dorje\u2019s family\u2014his wife and two bright-eyed daughters, and also his elderly father. The houses in Rasa were two-story affairs, built that animals might shelter below, while humans lived on the second floor. The buildings were white with brightly colored trim, defiantly cheerful against the bleak landscape.</p><p>It was a holy place, I learned, and many followers of the Path of Dharma came here on pilgrimages. In Rasa, commerce and sanctity lived cheek by jowl, and it was strange to walk the streets and see shops selling all manner of goods, while colorful prayer flags fluttered overhead and pilgrims completed a circuit around the city, prostrating themselves every few steps.</p><p>Dorje\u2019s wife, Nyima, was a generous hostess, a sweet woman who was reduced to infectious giggles by my efforts to communicate with her. I let her daughters braid my hair in the Tufani style, weaving beads of coral and turquoise into the strands.</p><p>It took a day for Dorje\u2019s company to sort out their own business, and another day for him to see about arrangements for my journey.</p><p>And as it transpired, my trust wasn\u2019t misplaced, but it could only carry me so far. Dorje wasn\u2019t pleased with my options, and refused to finalize the arrangements before discussing it with me.</p><p>\u201cThere is only one caravan travelling to Bhodistan yet,\u201d he said unhappily. \u201cAnd I do not like the look of the caravan-master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he a bad reputation?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dorje shook his head. \u201cHe has the name of an honest trader. But he does not follow the Path of Dharma, and he has hard eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a great many folk in the world who do not follow the Path of Dharma,\u201d I said philosophically. \u201cMyself included. It does not make us bad people, Dorje.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI know this, Moirin. Still..... why not wait and pass the winter here? You will be my guest. Come spring, I will put together an expedition myself.\u201d</p><p>My diadh-anam flared in a protest so violent, I winced. \u201cI don\u2019t dare,\u201d I said softly. \u201cAs many lessons in patience as fate has taught me, I don\u2019t think this is one of them. Why don\u2019t you let me meet the fellow and decide for myself?\u201d</p><p>With reluctance, Dorje agreed.</p><p>I had to own, I didn\u2019t exactly like the look of the man myself, either. His name was Manil Datar, and he had the preening, satisfied look of a man who thought very well of himself. To be fair, he was a handsome enough fellow with a quick, flattering smile, but Dorje was right, it was a smile that did not reach his eyes. Also, he had doused himself with a heavy, musky scent I did not care for.</p><p>Still, he spoke courteously and seemed professional enough, assuring me through Dorje that it would be his pleasure to see me conducted to Bhaktipur, that he would take personal responsibility for my safety, and vouch for the good character of all his men. And he came to Tufan to trade for glands of a musk-deer that was used in the making of perfume, so I supposed perhaps the scent he wore was an advertisement for his trade. It wasn\u2019t his fault I didn\u2019t care for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And, too, I had touched on the thoughts of his animals, the horses and yaks penned at the inn where Manil Datar\u2019s company was lodged, and found them to be glad and contented, well fed and well cared for. As much as anything, that decided me. A man who was good to his animals could not be so bad after all.</p><p>\u201cI wish to do this, Dorje,\u201d I said firmly to him.</p><p>He sighed, and translated my agreement. Manil Datar smiled and placed his palms together in a Bhodistani salute, inclining his head and speaking.</p> <p>\u201cHe says it will be his pleasure to escort such a beautiful young woman through the most beautiful mountains in the world,\u201d Dorje said in a glum tone. \u201cAnd if you are interested, it will also be his pleasure to teach you to speak the Bhodistani tongue. No extra charge,\u201d he added. \u201cOnly for the pleasure of your company.\u201d</p><p>I pushed away any misgivings and returned the man\u2019s smile. \u201cThat\u2019s very kind. I would appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Dorje translated my words and Manil\u2019s reply. \u201cCome the day after tomorrow at sunrise and we will depart.\u201d</p><p>So it was decided.</p><p>I was glad to have it done. With Dorje\u2019s assistance, I acquired warmer attire, bartering Arigh\u2019s Tatar bow for a long coat and trousers of densely woven wool and a heavy sheepskin blanket.</p> <p>Already, I felt better; and considerably warmer.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, Moirin.\u201d Dorje smiled a little and brushed my braided hair with his fingertips. \u201cA green-eyed Tufani girl. Who would ever have thought of such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, I sneezed. The coral and turquoise beads woven into my hair shook and rattled against one another. \u201cBlame your daughters,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd remind me to return all their pretty trinkets before I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d He shook his head in refusal. \u201cThose were a gift.\u201d He touched his chest, where the Imperial jade medallion lay hidden beneath his own woolen coat. \u201cI am their father. I will buy them more beads.\u201d He paused, his expression earnest. \u201cThere is one thing I would ask of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Dorje nodded. \u201cCome to the temple with me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd ask for Sakyamuni\u2019s blessing. I know it is not your path, but I will feel better for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would be my honor,\u201d I said truthfully.</p><p>The temple of Sakyamuni the Enlightened One in Rasa was like and unlike temples I had seen in Ch\u2019in. It was a pagoda, but built on a sturdier scale, built to endure against the harsh elements. In the courtyard outside, there were great, gilded bronze urns that rotated on tall spindles. Dorje told me that there were prayers written inside them, that with each turn of the urn, it sent a prayer up to Heaven. I had seen pilgrims carrying smaller versions, spinning them as they prayed.</p><p>\u201cTurn them, Moirin. All of them.\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>They were surprisingly heavy, although they turned smoothly. One by one, I spun each urn, placing my hands on their etched surfaces and pushing.</p><p>\u201cMaghuin Dhonn, forgive me,\u201d I murmured. \u201cNaamah, too. But I am alone in a strange place. I will accept the aid of any god willing to offer it.\u201d</p><p>The urns turned, rattling.</p><p>Prayers arose, fluttering.</p> <p>It felt so very real\u2014the prayers arising, the prayer-flags fluttering here in the Abode of the Gods. I gazed upward into the blue sky, my spirit soaring. Dorje\u2019s hands tugged at me.</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d he said. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>Inside the temple, it was smoky and dense, the air thick with incense. I stifled a cough, breathing shallowly. At Dorje\u2019s insistence, I put money in a coin-box to purchase a bundle of incense, lighting it and thrusting it into the ornate offering tray before the altar. The altar held an effigy of Sakyamuni, and a smaller effigy of a woman, both with expressions of profound peace on their faces.</p><p>\u201cGuanyin?\u201d I asked, indicating the female effigy. In Ch\u2019in, she was known as She Who Hears Our Prayers. Dorje shook his head.</p><p>\u201cTara,\u201d said a new voice, high and youthful. I glanced over to see a young monk\u2014a boy, really, scarce older than Dash, his head shaved, his slender figure draped in the crimson and saffron robes of his order.</p><p>Dorje bowed to him, and I followed suit. The boy bowed in response, addressing Dorje in his clear voice.</p><p>\u201cThis is Tashi Rinpoche.\u201d Dorje sounded awed and nervous. \u201cHe is one of the tulkus, Moirin. A great teacher who has been reborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a boy,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He licked his lips as though they had gone dry. \u201cBut he has lived many lives. He says he has a message for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>The boy monk smiled and approached me. Despite his youthful features, his wide-set eyes had an extraordinary depth. There was a gentle wisdom in them that reminded me of Master Lo, and too, a purity of faith and trust that reminded me of Aleksei, although they followed very different paths. He spoke at length, never removing his gaze from mine.</p><p>\u201cTashi Rinpoche says you are not wrong,\u201d Dorje murmured. \u201cTara and Guanyin are different names for the same soul, an Enlightened One who has been born many times since, always returning to help others. In her last incarnation, it was his privilege to serve as one of her earliest teachers, before the pupil surpassed the master. He says\u2014\u201d He broke off to question the boy.</p><p>I heard the word \u201cLaysa\u201d repeated several times. It tugged at a thread of memory, but I couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>\u201cLaysa,\u201d the young monk agreed, smiling like the sun.</p><p>Dorje licked his lips again. \u201cTashi Rinpoche says that when you find her incarnation and free her, be sure to tell her that he is here in Rasa waiting for her. He did not mean to be born younger than her this time, but now it all makes sense. She has lost ten years of her life. Although he is still a student himself in this lifetime, he is eager to be reunited with her and resume the studies of their past lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaysa.\u201d I repeated the name, bewildered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, Moirin?\u201d Dorje interrupted me. \u201cI told you about her when you first asked about the Falconer.\u201d</p><p>I remembered. \u201cThe yak-herder\u2019s daughter, the one who was taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d He gave me a happy smile. \u201cTashi Rinpoche says you are the one who must rescue her. Isn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel it.</p><p>It felt like a new burden of expectations settling onto my shoulders, heavy enough that I sank to my knees beneath the weight of it, burying my face in my hands. I hadn\u2019t given any thought to the other victims of the bedamned Falconer and his mysterious Spider Queen. All I wanted to do was find my stubborn peasant-boy, free him, and go home, wherever that was. It was more than enough responsibility to carry.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want any more.</p><p>Tashi Rinpoche was patting my arms and shoulders, trying to comfort me, speaking in a voice as clear as a mountain stream. I gazed up at him. He touched my cheeks, wiping away tears with slender fingers, smiling encouragingly at me.</p><p>\u201cHe says not to be afraid,\u201d Dorje said softly. \u201cHe says that although you are very young in this world, you have a great heart.\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>They say the gods use their chosen hard. Apparently, the gods are part of a vast conspiracy to share their chosen, too.</p><p>\u201cI will try,\u201d I said to the boy-monk. \u201cIf I can find a way, I will do it. But I beg you, do not depend on me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again, replying without waiting for a translation.</p><p>I glanced at Dorje. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Dorje looked grave. \u201cTashi Rinpoche says he is depending on you. That before your journey is done, many, many people will depend on you. And that it is still only beginning, Moirin. You have a long way yet to go, and many oceans to cross.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes briefly. \u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-THREE</p><p>I had a day of grace.</p><p>One day before I was scheduled to depart with Manil Datar\u2019s caravan, one day to spend as I wished.</p><p>Contrary to what one might expect, I spent it indoors. As much as I loved the wild places of the world, I\u2019d had a surfeit of them\u2014and there was more to come. I passed the day playing with Dorje and Nyima\u2019s daughters, indulging in the kind of revels I\u2019d never known as a young child.</p><p>I taught them the Tatar counting word-game I\u2019d learned from my young friend Sarangerel, and they taught me Tufani words in turn.</p><p>I let them unbraid and rebraid my hair, winding even more beads into the plaits.</p><p>We played at being animals\u2014placid, long-horned yaks, prancing ponies, stalking snow leopards, and even slow-pacing bears.</p><p>Nyima watched over us with an indulgent gaze.</p><p>Dorje shook his head. \u201cIs this the way great heroines are supposed to behave, Moirin?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I caught his youngest daughter around the waist, settling her on my lap. She nestled against me, content to toy with my braids. \u201cNot in the slightest. But I did not ask for this. And I cannot be otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would stay the winter,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>I hugged his daughter, mindful of the insistent call of my diadh-anam. \u201cI wish I could, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Come the following day, dawn came bright and clear. I\u2019d said my good-byes the night before. The girls had wailed, but they would forget me quickly enough. At such an age, children do. Nyima rose sleepily to brew salty yak-butter tea in the predawn light. I drank it down deep, grateful for its warmth.</p><p>Dorje escorted me to join the caravan, fussing over me all the while. \u201cYou have the purse I gave you?\u201d he asked for the third time.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dorje.\u201d I patted the folds of my long coat. \u201cSafely hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it is enough,\u201d he said in a worried tone. As he had promised, in addition to paying the fare Manil Datar had demanded, Dorje had given me coin he deemed sufficient for a lengthy stay in Bhaktipur. \u201cNone of us were certain what value to place on the Imperial medallion. I do not want to think we cheated you, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I am just grateful to know it will not be used in a way that betrays the Emperor\u2019s trust.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head vigorously. \u201cNo, I will not allow it!\u201d</p><p>We found the caravan assembling for departure, an array of men, horses, and heavily laden yaks, breath rising in frosty plumes in the clear dawn air. Manil Datar strode around briskly, making sure all was in readiness. He greeted me with a courteous smile and a Bhodistani salute, which I returned. The porters eyed me with open curiosity, which earned one of them a casual cuff from Datar.</p><p>\u201cI do not like the way they look at you, Moirin,\u201d Dorje fretted.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cMen do, Dorje. It looks as though Manil Datar runs his caravan with a firm hand.\u201d</p><p>He ignored me. \u201cLook at that fellow!\u201d With a subtle jerk of his chin, he indicated a hulking, broad-shouldered man with terrible scars disfiguring his face. \u201cSurely, he means no good.\u201d</p><p>The scarred fellow was tending carefully to a yak\u2019s pack-harness. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause the poor man was injured once?\u201d</p><p>Dorje sighed, exhaling a frosty cloud. \u201cI am being foolish, I know. If Tashi Rinpoche is not afraid for you, I should not be. But a monk is not a man with daughters. A man with daughters knows what it is to be afraid. And after seeing you playing with mine, I am afraid for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid for me, too,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I still have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He handed me a soft, cloth-wrapped bundle. \u201cTsampa,\u201d he said, referring to a roasted barley-grain mixed with lumps of butter that was a Tufani staple. \u201cNyima packed it for you in case Manil Datar does not feed you well enough. It is enough to last a few days.\u201d He smiled ruefully. \u201cFor a trader\u2019s wife, she does not understand the distances between places very well.\u201d</p><p>I tucked it in my pack. \u201cThank her for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>And then Manil Datar gave a sharp whistle and a gesture, indicating that we were ready to depart. He beckoned to me with a pleasant smile, indicating that I should ride beside him. Before I mounted, I gave Dorje a warm hug. \u201cThank you, my friend. Whenever I need to remember there are good people in the world, you and your family are among those I will surely recall.\u201d</p><p>He returned my embrace. \u201cBe safe, Moirin. I hope you find your young man, and if fate wills it, our Laysa, too.\u201d</p><p>And with that, I was off once more.</p><p>Although the journey would grow more arduous in the days to come, the road leading southward out of Rasa was easily wide enough for two to ride abreast. True to his word, Manil Datar set about teaching me to speak Bhodistani, pointing at objects and naming them in his native tongue, making me repeat the words until I got them right. Horse, yak, saddle. Eyes, ears, nose, mouth. Sky, mountain, path. I had learned a bit of Tufani, which he spoke fluently, and it made the process easier.</p><p>I was grateful for his kindness, and he seemed pleased to offer it, although truth be told, given my preferences, I would rather have ridden alone, left to my own thoughts. The encounter with the boy monk Tashi Rinpoche had unsettled me.</p><p>When I had set out from Shuntian a year ago, my quest had seemed a simple one. All I wanted to do was cross the steppe and find Bao. And although I\u2019d vastly underestimated the rigors of a Tatar winter, in a way, it had been that simple.</p><p>Now.....</p><p>Now I felt like a pair of dice, swept up and shaken in a cup, cast on the gaming table over and over, the stakes growing higher each time.</p><p>It seemed like it never ended.</p><p>The quest I had undertaken in Ch\u2019in to free the princess and the dragon should have been enough for anyone\u2019s lifetime. But oh, no! Not for Moirin. The Great Khan had betrayed me, the gods had scooped me up and tossed me back onto the gaming table, sending me to Vralia, where the Patriarch of Riva dreamed of destiny, dreamed of a Yeshuite empire built on bloodshed and loathing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had put an end to his dream.</p><p>I had armed my sweet boy Aleksei with the courage of his convictions that he might continue the fight against his uncle\u2019s vile legacy, raising a voice in favor of love, compassion, and understanding, altering the course of his world.</p><p>And yet it wasn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>No, now I must be shaken and rattled and tossed once more, hurled back into the fray, pitted against this legendary Falconer and his bedamned Spider Queen with her unknown charms that held grown men in thrall. And it was not enough that I find the missing half of my soul, no. A boy-monk with kind, gentle, ancient eyes was depending on me to rescue the reincarnation of one of the Enlightened Ones.</p><p>And that, he had informed me, was only the beginning of my journey.</p><p>I had further oceans to cross.</p><p>It was a considerable weight to carry, a considerable weight to place on the shoulders of a young woman who had grown up in a cave in the Alban wilderness. And I felt very, very alone beneath my burden.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that I failed to recognize the aid I\u2019d found along the way. I did. And I was grateful to all of them: to kindhearted Batu and Checheg, to poor Valentina and my sweet Aleksei, to steady Vachir and his wife, Arigh, to stormy Erdene, to my young friend Dash, to gentle Dorje and Nyima.</p> <p>And yet.....</p><p>Again and again, the dice were cast. Swept up on the tide of my fate, I left them behind and carried on alone.</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d</p><p>I realized that Manil Datar had spoken my name several times over, and blinked at him. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were far away,\u201d he said in Tufani, and then repeated it in Bhodistani, slowly and carefully. \u201cYou were far away.\u201d</p><p>I echoed it back to him, memorizing the words. \u201cYes. I was far away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Leaning over in the saddle, he stroked my braided locks, setting the coral and turquoise beads to rattling.</p><p>Lacking words, I shrugged. \u201cFar.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips brushed my cheek. \u201cDo not go so far.\u201d</p><p>I felt a tickle of alarm at the base of my spine. I made myself smile at him. \u201cNot so far, no. I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>Manil Datar smiled back at me, a smile that did not reach his eyes. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-FOUR</p><p>I did not like Manil Datar.</p><p>It was not that he wasn\u2019t a good caravan-master. He was. He was as solicitous of me as he had promised. When we made camp, he ensured that my tent was erected securely, that I had ample food to eat and my mounts were provisioned and watered. He listened to his porters, who knew the terrain better than he did. He insisted that they escort me on foot through the worst passes, through the narrowest defiles, where all of us stretched our ears, listening for the fearful sound of ice cracking, portending an avalanche of snow and rock.</p> <p>It happened more than once.</p><p>The scarred fellow who had disturbed Dorje seemed to have the keenest senses. Twice, he called for a halt moments before an unholy cascade broke loose from the mountains, barring our path.</p><p>While the porters dug us out, Manil Datar further instructed me in the Bhodistani tongue.</p><p>Snow, ice, avalanche.</p><p>Coat, hat, mittens.</p><p>Even though I did not like him, I listened and learned, repeating words back to him. In Vralia, the Patriarch had kept me ignorant and unable to communicate. I never wanted to be that helpless again.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, we crept our way across the Abode of the Gods. Beneath the ever-present shadow of mountain peaks, we scaled heights where little grew save tough juniper shrubs. I learned to string simple sentences together in Bhodistani. We descended into forested valleys where cedar, blue pine, and larch grew with hardy exuberance, and Manil Datar began teaching me more abstract terms. We traversed narrow paths clinging to the side of a mountain gorge above fierce, rushing rivers. We crossed unexpected meadows, where we sometimes encountered nomads pasturing their yaks.</p><p>It was in one of the meadows that Manil Datar revealed his true colors.</p><p>Between Dorje\u2019s distrust and my own unease, I\u2019d never fully trusted the man\u2014all the more so when I realized that it was largely due to the scarred porter, whose name I had learned was Sanjiv, that the caravan\u2019s animals were so content and well tended. But I had passed many days in Manil Datar\u2019s company, and although he took the liberty of touching my hand or my cheek from time to time, he offered no further impropriety.</p><p>That changed in the meadow.</p><p>I was asleep in my tent, swaddled in woolen blankets with the heavy sheepskin atop them. I was awakened by an additional weight pressing on me, a hand clamped hard over my mouth, and a sharp edge against my throat.</p><p>A jolt of terror ran through me as I lurched from deep sleep to full wakefulness. Dim lantern light and the musky scent of perfume filled the tent. Manil Datar\u2019s face hovered inches above mine.</p><p>\u201cMoirin,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt is time.\u201d I struggled ineffectually, but he had me pinned beneath my blankets. He leaned harder on the knife against my throat. \u201cBe still. I will not hurt you if you are good. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I blinked in agreement, too terrified to move.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The knife\u2019s pressure eased a fraction. Datar smiled at me as pleasantly as though we were discussing the day\u2019s journey. \u201cI wanted to wait until you understood. Some things are worth waiting for. I have heard stories of the bed-arts of D\u2019Angeline women. I want you to show them to me. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I blinked again.</p><p>Manil Datar nodded in approval. \u201cIf you are good, you will be mine, and mine only. If you are bad.....\u201d He withdrew the knife from my throat, tracing a line along my cheek with the sharp tip. \u201cI will cut your face worse than Sanjiv\u2019s, and give you to the men to share. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered, my heart thudding in my chest like a trapped thing.</p><p>His unsmiling eyes bored into mine. \u201cYou will be good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his weight off me, tugged away the sheepskin, untangled the woolen blankets, pulling me to my knees. With one hand, he opened his long coat and unlaced his thick, lined breeches. Taking my hand, he guided it to his erect phallus. With another smile that did not reach his eyes, he gestured with the dagger and uttered one of the first words he had taught me. \u201cMouth.\u201d</p><p>I felt sick.</p><p>The point of the dagger prodded a spot beneath my ear. \u201cMouth, Moirin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow,\u201d I murmured, stroking the length of his shaft, feeling it throb in my hand. \u201cSlow is best, yes?\u201d</p><p>Datar\u2019s breath quickened, his lids growing heavy. \u201cAll right, yes. Slow.\u201d</p><p>Sick and horrified, I stroked him, watching his face beneath my lashes. When I cupped his heavy ballocks and began to lower my head, his eyes fluttered shut for an instant.</p><p>It was all I needed\u2014a second without his gaze on me. Quicker than thought, faster than I\u2019d ever done in my life, I summoned the twilight and spun it around me, taking a half-step into the spirit world.</p><p>Manil Datar uttered an involuntary cry, dropping the dagger.</p><p>Exactly what he was feeling, I couldn\u2019t say, only that it was unpleasant and unnerving. Bao had said it was like being touched by a ghost. Fury ran hot in my veins, and I tightened my grip on Datar\u2019s ballocks with grim satisfaction, feeling them shrivel and attempt to retreat into his body, his erection flagging. With my other hand, I picked up the dagger he had dropped, setting the point beneath his chin.</p><p>Datar stared frantically into the empty air before him, his eyes wide and terrified.</p><p>\u201cYou will not do this to me, Manil Datar,\u201d I said to him in a hard voice, willing him to hear. \u201cNot tonight, not ever. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>He blinked in assent.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I shoved the knife a little. I didn\u2019t know if it would cut him while I was in the twilight and he wasn\u2019t, but whatever he felt, it made him raise his chin higher. I gave his shrinking ballocks a hard squeeze. \u201cNever touch me again, or these.....\u201d I didn\u2019t know the word, so I squeezed them again. \u201cNo more. I make a curse. You will not be a man. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>His throat worked as he tried to swallow. \u201cYes,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I lowered the dagger and released my death-grip on his ballocks. Manil Datar drew a ragged breath. \u201cNow go, and do not trouble me again.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t scramble out of my tent fast enough, clutching his coat closed with one hand, holding up his unlaced breeches with the other.</p><p>Once Datar had gone, I began shaking, and couldn\u2019t stop. I clung to my grip on the twilight and wrapped my blankets around myself, wrapped my arms around my knees, and rocked.</p><p>My tent stank of his musky, cloying perfume.</p><p>I could still feel his phallus throbbing and twitching against my palm, still hear his voice saying, Mouth, Moirin.</p><p>Ah, gods.</p><p>Being a heroine was a very lonely affair.</p><p>In the end, I released the twilight and dozed fitfully that night, waking from time to time in a start of terror. Manil Datar did not return, but in the morning I found that the mood in the camp had changed considerably.</p><p>No one would meet my eyes.</p><p>No one brought me food to break my fast; no one saw to watering my mounts. No one aided me in striking my tent and loading my gear, all the little niceties to which I had grown accustomed, all the things that had made the caravan function with swift efficiency.</p><p>I heard one word murmured, over and over: dakini.</p><p>I did not need Manil Datar to translate it for me.</p><p>Witch.</p><p>Well, and so. Better that they should fear me than not. The memory of Datar\u2019s knife tracing a line along my cheek was vivid in my mind. And at least it did not seem that the caravan meant to abandon me altogether. A trader\u2019s bond was only as good as his word, and Manil Datar was not yet willing to break his.</p><p>So I dined on the tsampa that Nyima had packed for me, kneading roasted barley and butter together in the Tufani manner and popping balls of it into my mouth. I trudged across the meadow with the iron cooking-pot Aleksei had bought in Vralia to fill it from the waterskins the porters\u2019 yaks carried that I might water my horses, since I did not have a bucket of my own.</p><p>My saddle-horse, Lady, guzzled down a potful at one go, gazing mournfully at me with a dripping muzzle when it was empty.</p><p>Her mate Flick, my pack-horse, looked on eagerly.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cMore, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d a voice said behind me. I turned to see the scarred porter, Sanjiv, a brimming leather bucket full of water in either hand. He ducked his head, embarrassed. \u201cFor your horses, Lady Dakini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Sanjiv nodded without looking at me. \u201cThey should not suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cThey should not.\u201d</p><p>In silent accord, we watched my horses drink their fill. \u201cHorses are good,\u201d Sanjiv offered after a time. \u201cYaks, too.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey like you,\u201d he said shyly.</p><p>\u201cI like them, too.\u201d Curious, I looked at his face full on in the daylight, studying the raking scars that lacerated it, dragging his nose sideways and skewing his upper lip. Despite the disfigurement, his eyes were dark and soft, with long lashes. \u201cWho hurt you, Sanjiv? Who did this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d he said simply. \u201cIt was a snow leopard. He was hungry. I was trying to protect my yaks. It is not his fault he made me ugly.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI do not think you are ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He met my eyes for the first time, tentative and fearful.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-FIVE</p><p>Without Sanjiv\u2019s kindness, I would not have survived the journey.</p><p>For the first couple of days after Manil Datar\u2019s assault, I thought mayhap I could manage. Grueling though it was, I was accustomed to hard work and surviving on my own. Datar didn\u2019t appear inclined to deny me the share of provisions to which I was entitled; he simply ceased to ensure that any aid was given to me.</p><p>No one offered me food, but after I ran out of tsampa, no one attempted to stop me when I filled a plate of rice and lentils from the cooking-pot\u2014only glanced at me sidelong and muttered under their breath. And Sanjiv took it upon himself to help care for my horses, which was a tremendous help.</p><p>And then I got sick.</p><p>I\u2019d always been blessed with a healthy constitution, but it failed me in the mountains. I was already worn down by prolonged travel, worn down by my never-ending destiny. After Datar\u2019s assault, I had trouble sleeping, constantly waking in a start of terror. And, too, the atmosphere of suspicion and hostility in the caravan took its toll on me.</p><p>It began with a headache and a scratchiness in the back of my throat. By the second day, it hurt to swallow. My joints ached, and I suspected I was feverish.</p><p>By the third day, I was sure of it.</p><p>Manil Datar knew it, too. He came upon me struggling to hoist Lady\u2019s saddle in place on the morning of the fourth day. Giving me a tight smile, he addressed me for the first time since he\u2019d fled my tent. \u201cYou are sick, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. My limbs felt weak, and it took all my concentration to lift the saddle.</p><p>\u201cThe caravan cannot wait,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you cannot continue, I will give back part of your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said shortly. If I could not continue, winter would come and I would die in the mountains. Both of us knew it.</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Datar assessed the extent of my weakness. \u201cMaybe I can help..... for a price.\u201d</p><p>I met his gaze. I could not conceal myself in the twilight with him looking at me, but I could still call it. With an effort, I did. Seeing the air around me begin to sparkle with unexpected brightness, he paled and took a step backward. \u201cNo,\u201d I said again. \u201cNo trouble, or I make a curse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a hollow threat, but Manil Datar didn\u2019t know it\u2014and what I had done before scared him enough that he left me alone.</p><p>Even so, I was in trouble. Every little thing was a tremendous effort, even sitting upright in the saddle. My vision was blurred, and I had to struggle to focus. By the time we made camp that evening alongside a river, I felt as weak as a newborn kitten. My throat was raw and swollen, and it was excruciating to swallow. I couldn\u2019t even think about water, let alone food. I managed to get Lady unsaddled and unload Flick\u2019s packs, and then I sat helpless before the jumbled mess of my tent, unable to summon the energy to erect it.</p><p>Sanjiv came trudging over with his buckets of water. \u201cWhy do you not put up your tent, Lady Dakini?\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes briefly. \u201cTired.\u201d</p><p>He set down the buckets and squatted before me. \u201cTired or sick?\u201d As gently as he tended his yaks, he touched my brow and frowned. \u201cSick, I think.\u201d</p><p>My pack-horse Flick wandered over to confer, thrusting his head between us. I reached up wearily to scratch the hinge of his jaw, and he snorted into my hair.</p><p>It decided the matter for Sanjiv. \u201cI will put up your tent,\u201d he said in a firm voice. \u201cI will take care of you, Lady Dakini. You are good to animals and they like you, so I do not think you should suffer.\u201d</p><p>I gazed at his disfigured face with profound gratitude. \u201cThank you, Sanjiv.\u201d</p> <p>A good deal of what transpired in the days that followed is vague in my memory, a series of impressions merging into one another, all drenched in a feverish haze. Having appointed himself my guardian, Sanjiv took his role with the utmost seriousness. He struck my tent in the mornings, saddled and packed my horses, helped hoist my aching body into the saddle. In the evenings, he unsaddled and unpacked them, tended and watered them. He set up my tent and spread my blankets. All of this he managed, and his other duties, too.</p><p>He brought me food\u2014and for a period of days when I could not bear to swallow at all, snow. I held lumps of it in my mouth, letting it melt and trickle down my throat, soothing the incessant pain.</p><p>No one spoke against his actions, not even Manil Datar. Between his skill with animals and his uncanny ability to hear an avalanche before it broke, my scarred friend Sanjiv was a lucky talisman, and the other porters regarded him with superstitious awe.</p><p>My fever waxed and waned.</p><p>On the bad days, my vision was doubled and I could barely cling to the saddle, sweating in the cold air, shivering violently as my sweat turned to ice on my skin. There were a few days when I thought I might die, and the thought didn\u2019t trouble me if it meant I could rest at last.</p><p>On the good days, when I felt more lucid and was able to string two thoughts together, I wondered if mayhap I was wrong after all, and Bao was suffering from a lingering illness. To be sure, mine was doggedly persistent. But when I consulted my diadh-anam, it was bright and unwavering within me, undeterred by my body\u2019s profound misery.</p> <p>Bao\u2019s.....</p><p>Bao\u2019s was unchanged, but I was growing closer to it. Closer and closer, his always calling to mine.</p><p>It kept me going, day after day.</p><p>On the cusp of this tantalizing nearness, the first deadly storm of early winter struck us. Manil Datar was minded to push on throughout the day in an effort to outpace it, but for a mercy, he listened to Sanjiv, and we broke early to make camp in a gorge where an outcropping of rock provided a natural windbreak.</p><p>The storm raged for over a full twenty-four hours, winds howling with unrelenting force, the heavens dropping an unholy amount of snow on us. I spent the time huddled in my tent, dozing fitfully. For once, I wasn\u2019t fearful of Manil Datar\u2014even he wouldn\u2019t attempt to assault me in this tempest\u2014but I was afraid my tent would collapse and suffocate me. And I daresay there was a good chance it would have if Sanjiv hadn\u2019t twice waded through the gathering drifts to dig me out, bringing a waterskin filled with hot, buttery tea. How and where he had managed a fire in that gale, I couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><p>The second time, even with my feverish eyes, I could see he looked weary enough to collapse himself, and he was shivering with effort and cold.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d I croaked. \u201cDon\u2019t go back. Unless you are afraid to take sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sanjiv shook his head and accepted my offer, crawling into my tent and sealing the flap behind him. \u201cI am born here. I will not get the mountain-sickness.\u201d</p> <p>I shared my blankets and my sheepskin with him. Almost instantly, he fell into a deep, exhausted sleep, his back turned to me. I curled against his back, and for the first time in more days than I could count, I slept soundly.</p><p>Somewhere in the small hours of the morning, the storm blew itself out. I awoke to stillness.</p><p>Sanjiv was asleep. I gazed at him in the faint, dull light that filtered through the tent\u2019s worn seams. Above the raking scars that disfigured his features, dragging them sideways, his long lashes broke like waves below his smooth lids, as lovely and innocent as a boy\u2019s. I wondered at a world that produced such a simple, kindhearted soul alongside a Manil Datar, a sweet boy like my Aleksei alongside a Pyotr Rostov.</p><p>And yet when Sanjiv awoke, he flinched away from me.</p><p>I smiled wryly. \u201cIt is well. Do not fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady Dakini!\u201d he said breathlessly, scrambling to leave my tent and return to his duties.</p><p>Outside, the world was transformed, buried beneath a thick blanket of white snow. Overhead, the sky was a remorseless blue, and the sun shone blindingly bright on the white snow, forcing us to squint and shield our eyes.</p><p>Despite it all, I felt a little bit better. A full day\u2019s rest and a sound night\u2019s sleep had done me a world of good. Once the porters floundered through the snow, took stock of the damage, restored our camp to order, and kindled a proper cook fire, I managed to eat a full bowl of rice and lentils, managed to swallow without wincing.</p><p>Leaving the gorge was a long, hard slog. The porters and the yaks went first to break a trail, wading through chest-high snow. The rest of us followed in their wake, our mounts struggling in the churned snow.</p><p>Bao\u2019s diadh-anam called to mine.</p><p>Close.</p><p>So close.</p><p>Closer and closer with every step Lady took as she labored her way up the path out of the gorge, close enough that it was like a drumbeat inside me. But I had to be careful; I had to concentrate. I felt better, yes, but I was not well. If I moved my head too quickly, a wave of dizziness came over me.</p><p>I breathed the Five Styles, concentrating.</p><p>Once we passed the treeline, the path was clearer, windswept. Upward and upward we clambered, scaling the long ascent. I concentrated on Lady\u2019s bobbing head, on her pricked-forward ears. When we gained the summit on the second day after the storm, a new vista unfurled before us\u2014and my diadh-anam gave a clarion call I could not ignore.</p><p>I drew rein, staring.</p><p>The Path of Heaven\u2019s Spear had led us along the shoulder of a low mountain peak. Now it would lead us downward, down a long, long descent. In the distance, I could see forests, and more greenery beyond them, a promise of a warmer, gentler clime.</p><p>But opposite us, a higher peak towered.</p><p>To be sure, I had seen higher; snow-capped peaks wreathed in mist. But those had been the Abode of the Gods, and no one human had dared set foot there, let alone dwell there. This, this was different.</p><p>I forced my gaze to focus. Hidden in the high peaks and crags was a man-made structure, towers and crenellations challenging the sky. Humans dwelled there. The steep slope that led to the eyrie was a complex labyrinth of fissures and moraines, unnavigable to the eye at a distance, and doubtless even more confusing at close range. I remembered picking our way through the Stone Forest in Ch\u2019in, and how we would have been hopelessly lost without the dragon\u2019s guidance. This looked much, much worse\u2014and infinitely more dangerous.</p><p>Nonetheless, my diadh-anam blazed in exultation.</p><p>\u201cBao!\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true,\u201d a neutral voice remarked. Manil Datar had come alongside me without my realizing it. When I reached for the twilight in unthinking panic, he raised one hand in a peaceable gesture. \u201cDo not curse me. I mean no harm. You are god-touched. I did not know, or I would not have taken you as a passenger.\u201d</p><p>I was confused. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt is bad business when gods fight.\u201d He jerked his chin at the distant peak. \u201cKurugiri, eh?\u201d</p><p>I echoed the word. \u201cKurugiri.\u201d</p><p>Manil Datar glanced at me sidelong. \u201cYou mean to pit your magic against hers, Lady Dakini?\u201d He made the term a subtle insult. \u201cAgainst the Spider Queen Jagrati?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, too. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>His mouth hardened. \u201cBad luck for you. You have some tricks, yes. She has powerful magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of her?\u201d I asked him. I didn\u2019t want to be beholden to the man, but all knowledge was worth having.</p><p>Datar gestured. \u201cShe comes from the south, far south. She has stolen a great treasure there, and come to the one place where no one dares take it from her. With this treasure, she has bewitched the Falconer into marrying her even though it is forbidden, bewitched the men who serve him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this treasure?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his voice. \u201cIt is the kaalahiira that Lord Shiva made from the ashes of Kamadeva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is kaalahiira and kamadeva?\u201d I knew Lord Shiva was one of the many gods of Bhodistan, but I didn\u2019t know the other words.</p><p>Manil Datar gave me a disgusted look. \u201cYou do not know the story? How can your gods send someone so ignorant?\u201d</p><p>I touched his sleeve. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>He snorted, but he relented. \u201cKamadeva is the god of desire. When he disturbed Lord Shiva at his meditation, Lord Shiva burned him to ashes with his third eye. When Lord Shiva heard the grieving of Kamadeva\u2019s widow, Rati, and learned that Kamadeva was trying to awaken him to fight against a demon, he squeezed the ashes, so.\u201d He made a fist. \u201cTo make a hiiraka, the gem-stone that shines like ice. Only it was black because of the ashes, so it is called a kaalahiira.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA diamond,\u201d I murmured to myself. \u201cA black diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes desire come, very strong desire.\u201d Datar pointed toward the peak of Kurugiri. \u201cSo. The Falconer rules his nest, but the Spider Queen rules him.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou are beautiful, yes, but no match for the kaalahiira of Kamadeva.\u201d</p><p>To be sure, I didn\u2019t feel like it in my current state. \u201cHow did Jagrati steal it?\u201d</p><p>Manil Datar turned his head and spat. \u201cShe was nobody, a no-caste nothing, a collector of night-soil. One night, she profaned the temple where the kaalahiira was kept and took it. I do not know how.\u201d</p><p>Shivering beneath the bright sun, I stared at the stronghold. It was a harsh place, and I couldn\u2019t imagine much grew there. \u201cHow do they live up there?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI do not know. The Falconer demands tribute for the services of his assassins.\u201d He pointed again. \u201cYou cannot see it from so far, but there is a great pot that hangs on a chain from that plateau. People who wish to hire his falcons to kill someone put messages and tributes in it. So.\u201d He gave me a mirthless smile. \u201cDo you wish to go to Kurugiri? I will show you the way. You can send the Falconer a message or try your luck in his maze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shivered again. If I were a great heroine from the days of yore like Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay, that was likely exactly what I would do; but I was too scared and miserable to attempt it on my own. \u201cI will go to Bhaktipur to ask the Rani for help.\u201d</p><p>Datar raised his brows. \u201cIn eleven years, she has not found a way to defeat the Falconer and the Spider Queen. I do not see why one sickly dakini will change anything.\u201d</p><p>A coughing fit took me, loose phlegm rattling in my chest. I doubled over in the saddle, swallowing hard against the pain in my throat when the fit ended. \u201cWell,\u201d I said in a hoarse voice. \u201cWe will see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d There was a rare note of genuine curiosity in Manil Datar\u2019s voice. \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>I touched my aching chest, where my diadh-anam called futilely to Bao\u2019s\u2014so near, and yet so far. \u201cSomeone I love is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad luck for him,\u201d Datar said wryly. \u201cOr maybe not. Maybe he is happy there.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, setting off another wave of dizziness, steadied myself against the pommel, and sneezed. \u201cNo. He\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Manil Datar nudged his mount, moving away from me. \u201cBad luck for both of you,\u201d he said over his shoulder. \u201cCome, we are losing time.\u201d</p><p>Rounding the shoulder of the mountain, we began the long, perilous process of making our descent. By the end of the day, we were back below the treeline and the peak of Kurugiri was behind us. In our camp, I gazed at its silhouette surrounded by a nimbus of gold and crimson, the heights catching the light of the setting sun long after shadows had settled on the long, low slope we travelled.</p><p>\u201cI will find a way, Bao,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-SIX</p><p>Sanjiv had called my ailment the mountain-sickness, and I\u2019d hoped that as we left the mountains, I\u2019d leave my sickness behind.</p><p>Not so.</p><p>It had sunk its claws too deep into me to let go that easily. Downward and downward we proceeded, travelling on a steep decline toward the valley that held the tiny kingdom of Bhaktipur. My eardrums strained and popped. Over and over, I swallowed against the pressure, even though it still hurt to swallow.</p><p>The pockets of snow dwindled.</p><p>The air grew thick and moist, and it seemed my head thickened with it. I could no longer breathe the Five Styles, forced to breathe through my mouth only.</p><p>If not for my illness and the persistent yearning of my diadh-anam, I would have been glad. We were venturing into inhabited territory, and after the rigors of the mountains, I was pleased to see stone houses with thatched roofs, fields of reddish soil planted with sorghum and millet, farmers working in the fields. For once in my life, I\u2019d had a surfeit of wilderness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As we worked our way downward, spruces and cedars gave way to more exotic flora, plants and trees I\u2019d only seen growing in the glass pavilion in Terre d\u2019Ange: poinsettias, oleander, towering ferns. There were forests of rhododendrons growing taller than I ever imagined they could. When they were in bloom, it must be a spectacular sight. Even on the verge of winter, the sense of lush greenery was overwhelming after the stark rigors of the mountains. There were unfamiliar gnarled trees with roots that crawled like great serpents above the ground, trees with thoughts as slow and ancient as any I\u2019d encountered save Elua\u2019s Oak.</p><p>Birds with bright plumage flashed amid the branches, and agile little monkeys with ancient wise-man\u2019s faces chattered at us.</p><p>After so long in the heights, the kingdom of Bhaktipur seemed like a fairy-tale place, a charming city nestled in a green valley. I gazed around in wonder as we entered the narrow, bustling streets. Here and there, cows wandered untended, seemingly free to roam the city. The architecture was a mix of pagoda-style buildings familiar from Ch\u2019in, and domes, arches, and minarets I guessed was a more traditional Bhodistani style. Folk clad in brightly colored garb made way for our caravan as we pushed through the crowded streets. We arrived at midday, and it was warm enough that I was sweltering in my thick woolen Tufani attire.</p> <p>In a square, Manil Datar called a halt. \u201cHere, our path divides, Moirin,\u201d he said, pointing south toward the far end of the valley where the mountain range rose anew. \u201cWe are continuing onward. You.....\u201d He gestured around, smiling with grim satisfaction. \u201cYou are in Bhaktipur. The debt between us is finished.\u201d</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>Sanjiv accepted my thanks with a shy smile, ducking his head and glancing at me sidelong. \u201cTake care of your horses, Lady Dakini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promised.</p><p>No one else acknowledged me. Manil Datar gave the order to continue, and the caravan began filing through the city, bound for the far reaches of the Abode of the Gods.</p> <p>Except for Sanjiv, I wasn\u2019t sorry to see them go; and yet once more I found myself alone and friendless in a strange place, this time with my head aching and fever addling my wits. I fingered the purse of coin that Dorje had given me, hoping it was enough to purchase lodgings as he had promised.</p><p>All I had to do was find them. Belatedly, I realized that my limited Bhodistani vocabulary did not include a word for an inn.</p><p>Dismounting, I addressed the first person to smile at me, a slender young woman carrying a live chicken under one arm. \u201cHello,\u201d I said politely. \u201cDo you know where is a place and food for money?\u201d</p><p>She nodded cheerfully and gave me directions in a dialect that differed slightly from the tongue Manil Datar had taught me. I echoed them back to her haltingly, while she nodded encouragingly.</p><p>When I had finished, she touched my face with slim fingers, her expression wondering. \u201cYou come from where?\u201d</p><p>I pointed westward. \u201cFar, very far. Many seas.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed to impress her. For my part, I was grateful to find the folk in Bhaktipur friendly and helpful, and my first encounter a productive one. I hoped it boded well for my time here. Right now, all I wanted to do was find the inn she had described, stable my mounts, then wash weeks of travel-dirt from my skin, fall into a bed, and sleep for days.</p><p>Alas, either the young woman had misunderstood my question, or I\u2019d misunderstood her directions. When I followed the course she had indicated along the narrow, winding streets, I found myself before a building that was unmistakably a temple of some sort\u2014and outside the temple doors, a trio of men assaulting a young girl in rough-spun clothing.</p><p>Even as I approached, they dragged her away from the temple, thrusting her roughly against a low wall. She cried out in fear and pain, dropping a rag bundle from which a tattered bunch of dried marigolds spilled, scattering gold and saffron petals. No one else on the street did anything to intervene.</p><p>A cold anger rose in me.</p><p>I unslung my bow without thinking, nocking an arrow. The swift motion made my head swim, and when I shook it in an effort to clear it, I made it worse. \u201cLet her go!\u201d I called in a tight, fierce voice.</p><p>Turning, the men backed away from the girl and raised their hands. The girl dropped to a squat, tears on her cheeks, and attempted to gather the fallen flowers.</p><p>\u201cYou do not understand,\u201d one of the men said in a sullen tone. \u201cShe tried to enter the temple.\u201d</p><p>There was a ringing in my head like the sound of bells, and I had to concentrate not to see two of him. \u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>The man gestured aggressively toward the girl, who flinched. \u201cShe is nobody! An untouchable!\u201d</p><p>I focused on him, training the arrow. \u201cI do not care. Let her go!\u201d</p><p>The sound of ringing bells grew louder. Gazing past me, the men\u2019s expressions changed. All three of them bowed their heads, pressed their palms together, and touched their fingers to their brows. The girl pressed her forehead to the ground.</p><p>\u201cSo! What is this trouble that passes here?\u201d asked a new voice, a woman\u2019s voice, musical and lilting.</p><p>Nudging my mount with my knees, I turned slightly and beheld the Rani of Bhaktipur emerging from a palanquin. I knew at a glance it could not have been anyone else. A coterie of guards surrounded her. She was draped in an intricate garment of bright orange silk embroidered with bands of gold, vivid against her warm amber skin. There was an ornament of gold filigree twined in her black hair, a sparkling jewel hanging on her smooth forehead. Bangles jingled on her wrists, and anklets with tiny bells rang as she stepped forth onto a strip of silk cloth that two of her guards laid on the street so that her bare feet might not be sullied.</p><p>Meeting my gaze, she raised her brows in surprise, and smiled with remarkable sweetness\u2014and I fell a little bit in love with her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t only that she was beautiful, although she was. Though she was younger than I had expected, having been a widow for eleven years, there was a sense of profound gravity and kindness that radiated from her. She stood poised on the street, her hands clasped before her in an unfamiliar gesture, two middle fingers steepled. It was oddly calming.</p><p>\u201cThis one, highness,\u201d the man who had spoken to me pointed at the girl, squatting with her arms wrapped around her knees, head bowed over the marigolds in her lap. \u201cThis nobody sought to enter the temple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true, little one?\u201d the Rani asked in her musical voice. \u201cYou may speak.\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded without looking up. \u201cMy mother is very sick. I thought.....\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t finish the sentence. \u201cYou wanted to make an offering for her,\u201d the Rani said gently.</p><p>The girl nodded again.</p><p>I sneezed violently, barely managing to ease my drawn bowstring in time. The Rani\u2019s dark, lustrous gaze flicked back to me, another smile curving her full lips. \u201cAnd what do you say, young goddess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know what the girl did, highness,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cBut these men were hurting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d The Rani\u2019s graceful hands shifted into a different pose, middle fingers yet steepled, index fingers and thumbs bent to form the shape of a heart. She stood in thought, and all of us waited patiently for her to speak. \u201cYou know you must not enter the temple, little one,\u201d she said at length to the girl. \u201cEach of us must obey our own kharma, and it is as true for me as it is for you. But tell me, what is your mother\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVarnu,\u201d the girl whispered.</p><p>\u201cVarnu.\u201d The Rani repeated it. \u201cI will see that an offering is made for your mother, Varnu. Is it well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, great highness!\u201d The girl looked up with a dazzling smile, then bowed her head three times, touching it to the ground. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d Leaping to her feet, she dashed away down the street, scattering dried marigold petals in her wake.</p><p>\u201cHighness\u2014\u201d one of the men began in a protesting voice.</p><p>She unclasped her hands and raised one, palm outward. It silenced him. \u201cDo I need to remind you of honor? You have a duty to the less fortunate, and it is not to offer violence and harm, no.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Humbled, he looked down, as did his fellows. \u201cYes, highness. Please, forgive us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d The Rani lowered her hand. \u201cGo, and be grateful that you were prevented from doing harm.\u201d</p><p>They went, looking for all the world chastened and grateful to be spared the consequences of their own actions. I thought it was a rare gift to be able to move men\u2019s hearts with such grace and dignity.</p><p>The Rani beckoned to one of her guards and spoke to him in a low tone. I caught the word Varnu, the girl\u2019s mother\u2019s name. The man bowed and touched his steepled fingers to his brow, then hurried off to do her bidding.</p><p>\u201cSo, young goddess.\u201d She turned her attention back to me, curiosity and a spark of lively humor in her gaze, a smile hovering on her lips. \u201cWho are you, where do you come from, and what in the world are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at her. \u201cIt is a long story, highness. I am Moirin mac Fainche of the Maghuin Dhonn. And if you are the Rani of Bhaktipur, also known as the Lady of Rats, I am here looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lady of Rats!\u201d She laughed, a sound like bells chiming. \u201cYes, I suppose so. And you are looking for me?\u201d Her hands shifted into a contemplative pose I\u2019d seen in effigies of the Enlightened Ones, cupped before her, thumbs folded over one another. As her bright eyes studied me, I fought unsuccessfully to contain another sneeze, and wished that I didn\u2019t feel quite so feverish, dirty, and miserable. \u201cWell,\u201d the Rani said in a thoughtful tone. \u201cThen I suppose I\u2019d better take you home with me, Moirin mac Fainche, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please!\u201d I agreed fervently.</p><p>FIFTY-SEVEN</p><p>Never, ever in my life had I been so glad to be ensconced in a man-made structure.</p><p>I followed the Rani\u2019s palanquin to her palace in a daze, unable to believe my good fortune. For the first time in longer than I could remember, I felt that mayhap the gods were smiling on me after all.</p><p>Behind the high walls that warded it, the palace was a charming affair built in the Bhodistani style. Dismounting from her palanquin, the Rani gave orders that my horses were to be stabled and tended, and my belongings brought to a suite of rooms. Then she reached up to touch my brow with cool fingers.</p><p>\u201cAnd for you, I think, a physician.\u201d A little furrow formed between her gracefully arched brows. \u201cEven goddesses take sick in mortal form.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNo goddess, highness. But if it is not too much to ask, I would like a bath first.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, steepling her fingers in a thoughtful pose. \u201cD\u2019Angeline, yes?\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened. Since leaving Vralia, I\u2019d felt myself utterly isolated from my roots. \u201cYou know of D\u2019Angelines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d The Rani laughed her chiming laugh. \u201cNot here, no. But in Galanka, when I was a girl, yes.\u201d Her eyes sparkled, and she patted my cheek. \u201cYou will have your bath, and I will have my physician. After, you will rest. Later you will tell me your story.\u201d</p><p>I had my bath, and it was better than medicine. The Bhodistani did not believe in submerging themselves to bathe, but the Rani sent a pair of young attendants who ladled bucket after bucket of hot water over me, sluicing away weeks of accumulated dirt and dried sweat. They washed and scrubbed every inch of me with gentle thoroughness, and undertook the painstaking process of undoing the matted braids Dorje and Nyima\u2019s daughters had plaited in my locks, easing the coral and turquoise beads out of my hair, and untangling every knotted strand before combing and washing it. The steam helped clear my head, and a profound sense of lassitude suffused my aching body. I thought about Luba scouring me with lye soap and cold water, chopping off my tangled hair with her shears, and murmured a prayer of gratitude to any gods who were listening.</p><p>Afterward, they rubbed warm, scented oil into my skin and gave me clean sleeping attire to wear: a pair of loose-fitting breeches and a long tunic of sheer white linen. When they had finished with me, the Rani came with her physician. She listened gravely as he examined me and prescribed a great deal of rest, and a diet of fresh fruits and grains, yoghurt, and spoonfuls of honey.</p><p>I was almost too tired to eat anything by the time he left, my eyelids heavy and drooping. Although I was feeling better than I had at my worst, I\u2019d pushed myself so hard for so long, my mind, body, and spirit were utterly exhausted.</p><p>And it was such a vast and unspeakable relief to be taken care of, I could have wept.</p><p>\u201cEat, young goddess,\u201d the Rani coaxed me. \u201cA little honey if nothing else. Then you may sleep.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed, and found that the honey coated and soothed my sore throat. \u201cYou are very kind, highness.\u201d</p><p>She smiled in such a way that her cheeks dimpled. \u201cI am very curious.\u201d She laid her hand on my brow. \u201cBetter, I think. Now sleep and heal, so I may hear your story.\u201d</p><p>Feeling as though I were falling down a long, dark well, I caught her hand and kissed it. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019Angeline, indeed.\u201d There was a note of amusement in her voice. She stroked my cheek. \u201cSleep, young one. You are safe here.\u201d</p><p>You are safe here.</p><p>The words followed me down into the darkness, followed me into my dreams, a lifeline promising me safe harbor. I dreamed the journey across the Abode of the Gods over and over again, reliving the endless trek, Manil Datar\u2019s unsmiling eyes, the feel of his phallus throbbing in my hand as the point of his dagger probed a tender spot below my ear, the enduring suspicion and hostility of the caravan. I dreamed of rockslides and avalanches, paths crumbling beneath my mount\u2019s hooves, of buffeting winds and unrelenting snowfall. Mountain peaks rising above the mist, the treacherous labyrinth that meandered down the slopes of Kurugiri. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bao, trapped there.</p><p>The Spider Queen, Jagrati. In my dreams, she had a narrow face with elongated jaws, long, segmented limbs made of a chitinous substance, and her faceted eyes gleamed like black diamonds.</p><p>Her husband, the Falconer Tarik Khaga, watched in approval, his eyes set narrowly over a beaked nose.</p> <p>I whimpered in my sleep.</p><p>You are safe here.</p><p>I saw the Rani in my dreams, placing herself between me and the Spider Queen and the Falconer, her face calm and her hands raised in a warding gesture.</p><p>I awoke, knew myself safe, and slept anew.</p><p>All in all, I slept for the better part of two days. I was sicker than I had realized, and my body needed to sweat out the last of the sickness. I was vaguely aware that the Rani\u2019s attendants cared for me solicitously, sponging my fevered skin with cool water, changing my bed-linens, and dressing me in clean clothing.</p> <p>On the third day, I awoke clear-headed and ravenous. Essaying an experimental cough, I found that my lungs were clear. Swallowing, I found that it did not hurt, but only made my empty stomach grumble.</p><p>I was better.</p><p>\u201cAh, good!\u201d Rousing herself from a pile of cushions, the Rani of Bhaktipur clapped her hands together with girlish pleasure, her dark eyes sleepy. \u201cYou are hungry, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I admitted, touched by her presence. \u201cYou watched over me, highness? All this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all this time,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly some of it. I think your dreams were troubled, were they not?\u201d She made a gesture with her hands I could not interpret. \u201cNow you will rise and dress, and we shall have a feast, eh? And you will tell me your story, Moirin mac Fainche.\u201d</p><p>She left, and the young attendants returned to help me bathe anew and dress myself. I was glad of their assistance, for Bhodistani daytime attire was unexpectedly difficult. There was an undershirt and skirt of fine linen, and that I understood well enough, but the overgarment was an endless swathe of shimmering mustard-yellow and green silk that bewildered me. Giggling, the girls demonstrated the complicated process of wrapping, pleating, and draping the cloth, pinning it in place so that it hung gracefully.</p> <p>When they were done, I felt more myself than I had since I\u2019d left Shuntian. As a girl growing up in Alba, I\u2019d had no use for finery, but that had changed in Terre d\u2019Ange. I\u2019d come to value opulence, and it was a pleasure to feel luxurious fabrics against my skin.</p><p>And, too, I was happy to see the Rani smile in appreciation when I was escorted into the dining room to join her.</p><p>\u201cAh, see!\u201d she said lightly. \u201cI have made you beautiful after the manner of my people. It suits you. I always wanted a daughter to dress.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows at her. \u201cI do not think you are old enough to be my mother, highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The Rani laughed, rising to the sound of bells tinkling around her ankles. \u201cWell, then, we shall let Ravindra decide if he wishes for a sister, for I see him beyond the door.\u201d She beckoned. \u201cCome, my son, join us.\u201d</p><p>A slender boy some ten years of age entered the room, clad in breeches and a long tunic of maroon trimmed with blue and gold. I hadn\u2019t known there was a son, but I could see his mother\u2019s gravity in him, unleavened by her gentle mirth. He stooped and laid his hands on the tops of her bare feet in greeting, which I later learned was a sign of respect the Bhodistani showed to their elders\u2014although sons did not always honor their mothers thusly.</p> <p>When he straightened, I pressed my palms together and bowed to him. \u201cWell met, young highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Ravindra gave me a long, startled look, then glanced at his mother. \u201cYes, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a sister then, eh?\u201d she said to me, her eyes dancing. \u201cCome, come, sit. We have many hours to eat and talk.\u201d</p><p>Dish after dish was brought to the table, and it was all I could do to pace myself and eat with decorum, famished as I was. There were the lentils and rice I\u2019d eaten a great deal of in Manil Datar\u2019s caravan, only seasoned with exquisite spices and served with cooked greens and many other vegetables. There was a spicy chicken stew, rounds of flatbread, and a wide array of a condiment called achar, tangy pickled fruits and vegetables. In keeping with the physician\u2019s advice, there was all manner of fresh fruit\u2014oranges and pears, mangos and bananas. After the mountains, it was an incredible bounty.</p><p>In between bites, I spun out my story.</p><p>For a mercy, I didn\u2019t have to lay out the whole complicated length of it. The traders who crossed the Abode of the Gods carrying tales of the Falconer and his Spider Queen, and the Lady of Rats, also carried tales in the opposite direction. At the first mention of Ch\u2019in, the Rani let out a startled sound.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Her eyes went round, her gaze shifting from mine to the bangle on my wrist, and back. \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s jade-eyed dakini!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the tale?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The Rani\u2019s expression turned somber, and she regarded me differently, less lightly. \u201cI wish to hear it from you, but that, I think, will wait. What brings you here, looking for me?\u201d</p><p>I explained about Bao\u2019s death and the Maghuin Dhonn Herself and my divided diadh-anam, struggling more than usual to do so in a scarce-familiar tongue. Mother and son listened attentively, hands resting on their knees, thumbs and forefingers touching in identical poses. For a boy of ten, Ravindra was uncommonly grave. I told them how I had set out after Bao and wintered among the Tatars, only to find him wed to the Great Khan\u2019s youngest daughter.</p><p>For the first time since I had mentioned Ch\u2019in, the Rani\u2019s sparkling smile returned. \u201cBad boy, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd yet.....\u201d</p><p>Her gaze softened. \u201cYou love him.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and told the rest of the tale. How the Great Khan had betrayed me to the Vralians, and sent Bao on a quest in the opposite direction, one that had led him into the lair of the Falconer and the Spider Queen. How I had learned of it from the Khan\u2019s daughter, whose advice had led me here.</p><p>When I finished, mother and son exchanged a glance, both of them looking troubled.</p><p>\u201cI wish.....\u201d Ravindra said in a plaintive tone.</p><p>\u201cI know, little prince.\u201d The Rani tilted her head. \u201cIt is late. Go, go meet with your tutor. I will speak to Moirin, and we will speak more, later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama-ji.\u201d He went obediently.</p><p>A sense of foreboding brushed over me, light as a feather, and just as subtly barbed. I had found sanctuary in this place, but nothing else. \u201cYou cannot help, can you, highness?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cAmrita,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou may call me by my name, please.\u201d There was a world of sorrow in her dark, lustrous eyes. \u201cI am sorry, Moirin. I would like to help you very much indeed, you and your bad boy, this Bao of whom you speak. It is only.....\u201d She spread her hands, and there was nothing in the gesture but helplessness. \u201cI do not know how. Tarik Khaga had my husband slain. Believe me, if I could have rid the world of the Falconer and his unholy bride, I would have done so by now.\u201d</p><p>It was exactly as Manil Datar had said.</p><p>I frowned, thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the paths up the mountain to Kurugiri. It is a maze, yes, but there are only so many ways. Why not.....?\u201d I didn\u2019t know the word for blockade. \u201cPut men there so no one can come or go? Would they not starve, and.....?\u201d I didn\u2019t know the word for surrender, either. \u201cDo as you say?\u201d</p><p>The Rani Amrita shook her head gently, the filigreed gem on her brow swaying. \u201cYou cannot see it from below, but there is a valley in Kurugiri. Not so green and good as Bhaktipur, no. It is higher, much higher. But enough grows there that they would not starve, and they raise yaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they do as they wish?\u201d I asked, frustrated. \u201cTake what they wish? Who they wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said simply. \u201cHere and there, the falcon takes a few lambs. Such is the cost of living. The shepherd dare not abandon his flock to the wolves in order to seek the falcon\u2019s lair; and I am the shepherd here. I am sorry, but I have no aid to give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he not take you?\u201d I flushed. \u201cForgive me, highness. That is not a nice question. But he wanted you. I try to understand, only. He killed your husband. And you are still very beautiful. How did it go?\u201d</p><p>Amrita was silent a moment. \u201cThere is a hidden room in the palace,\u201d she said presently. \u201cA hidden room with a hidden passage. My lord Chakresh Sukhyhim, who was my husband, knew the risks of bringing a young bride to this place. He hid me, and hid me well, choosing to face the assassins himself. Alas, his men were unable to protect him. Afterward.....\u201d Her shoulders rose and fell. \u201cI was widowed and with child. That is displeasing to Tarik Khaga, and he no longer wanted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said.</p><p>We gazed at one another.</p><p>\u201cAre you really a dakini?\u201d the Rani Amrita inquired.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cClose your eyes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed.</p><p>I looked at her because it pleased me to do so, because she was beautiful, and I liked beauty. I tried to guess her age. Twenty-seven, maybe twenty-eight. Maybe younger, even. She had wed young, I thought.</p><p>I breathed the twilight deep into my lungs, took it deep into myself. I blew it out around her, around us both, as soft as a kiss.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Her eyelashes fluttered alert, her face filled with wonder. \u201cYou can do this?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt is a gift of my people, meant for hiding. Here, no one else can see us.\u201d I sighed. \u201cIf I knew the path, I could go to Kurugiri unseen. I suppose I\u2019ll have to try,\u201d I added reluctantly. The prospect filled me with dread, but I couldn\u2019t see any other way.</p><p>The Rani frowned. \u201cIt would please me if you would stay for a time, Moirin. Many have sought the path to Kurugiri, and many have died trying. None have found it. You have been very sick; and the gods must have sent you to me for a reason. Wait, and grow stronger. Let us go to the temples and make offerings. Perhaps your purpose here will become clear.\u201d She searched my face, her dark eyes touched with silvery luster in the twilight. \u201cWill you do this for me?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to, oh so very much.</p><p>Bracing myself for the inevitable flare of alarm from my diadh-anam, I opened my mouth to refuse with regret.</p><p>My diadh-anam was silent.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said gratefully. \u201cYes, my lady. I will stay.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-EIGHT</p><p>It was the first true respite I\u2019d known since Aleksei and I had escaped to Udinsk.</p><p>Now, as then, I knew it was only temporary. Kurugiri and its deadly maze were waiting for me; Tarik Khaga and his bedamned Spider Queen were waiting for me; to the best of my knowledge, Bao continued to languish under her spell, ensorceled by the Black Diamond of Kamadeva.</p><p>Or not; mayhap Manil Datar was right, and my stubborn peasant-boy was happy in her thrall.</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe it, but nor did I believe Bao was in imminent danger at this point. So I was more than grateful to accept this respite, and pray that the gods revealed their will.</p><p>I offered prayers of my own to the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, and to Blessed Elua and his Companions, and most especially to Naamah.</p><p>I went with the Rani Amrita to make offerings to her gods.</p><p>There were temples to Sakyamuni the Enlightened One in Bhaktipur, but like most of her folk, my lady Amrita worshipped the gods of Bhodistan, of which there were a bewildering array further complicated by the fact that many of them existed in multiple incarnations. I have to own, I never did get all of them straight in my head.</p><p>\u201cIt does not matter, Moirin,\u201d Amrita said kindly. \u201cOnly that you open your heart to them.\u201d</p><p>I tried.</p><p>We went first to the temple of the goddess Durga to whom rats were sacred. She was the patron-goddess of Amrita\u2019s husband\u2019s family, who were descended from one of her incarnations. Rats had aided the goddess in a battle against a demon that took the form of a buffalo, nipping and harrying its heels as they fought. One of Durga\u2019s later incarnations decreed that the spirits of her descendants would not go into the keeping of the god of the dead, but be housed in rats before being reborn.</p><p>It was very confusing.</p><p>I liked the temple, though. It made me glad to see hundreds of rats swarming over the marble floors, bright-eyed, glossy, and well fed, tame and friendly. There were tiny secret passages throughout the walls, so they darted and scurried about, emerging from unexpected nooks and crannies. The rats flocked to Amrita, scuttling around her ankles in a moving carpet of fur. When she stooped to place an offering tray of grain on the floor, a stream of rats poured over her hands as though to caress her, for which I did not blame them in the least.</p><p>\u201cSo you see, Moirin!\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cThe Lady of Rats.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at her. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>We made an offering to the goddess herself, who was depicted as a beautiful warrior woman seated on a tiger. I thought of my warrior princess Snow Tiger, and hoped it was a good omen.</p><p>Over the course of days, we made offerings at more temples than I could remember: Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, who I understood formed a great triad that created the beginning, middle, and end of the world. Krishna the lover, generous Lakshmi, and fierce Kali with her out-thrust tongue and her necklace of skulls; and others I could not recall. There were gods and goddesses dancing, meditating, resting on great serpents. Hanuman, who was a monkey, which quite delighted me. Blue-skinned gods, black-skinned goddesses, many with a multitude of arms. It was all very strange, though beautiful in an unfamiliar way.</p><p>There was even one god, Ganesha, who had the head of an elephant on a man\u2019s body. When I asked Amrita why in the world it was so, she laughed and said there were different stories, and that it had never occurred to her to wonder which was true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you think it odd?\u201d she asked, teasing me. \u201cYou liked Hanuman. And you worship a bear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but not a woman with a bear\u2019s head!\u201d I protested.</p><p>We journeyed through the streets in Amrita\u2019s palanquin, carried by strapping fellows and surrounded by a contingent of devoted guards bearing armloads of flowers and offering goods. Everywhere we went, the folk of Bhaktipur greeted their Rani with joyful bows, and it was clear to me that she was much beloved. One thing troubled me, though.</p> <p>The untouchables, the no-castes.</p><p>I came to recognize them quickly by the way they took care to avoid all contact with others, by the way they moved swiftly out of our path to ensure their shadows should not pollute the Rani\u2019s palanquin. As we made our rounds with our abundant offerings, receiving the blessing of temple priests, I found myself thinking about the no-caste girl who had wished to make an offering for her sick mother, clutching her precious armful of tattered marigolds.</p><p>On the way back to the palace, I asked Amrita why the girl wasn\u2019t allowed to enter the temple.</p><p>\u201cBecause she is unclean, her presence would profane it,\u201d she said in her lilting voice. \u201cOnly those born to the four castes are allowed to enter the temples, or to listen to the teaching of the priests and receive their blessing.\u201d</p><p>It shocked me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause that is their kharma, Moirin,\u201d Amrita said patiently. \u201cAll of us must obey our kharma. It is the way the world is ordered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not born to any caste,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cThat is not true.\u201d She touched my arm. \u201cYou are descended from royalty in your own country. You and I, we are the same caste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap, but.....\u201d I struggled to frame my thoughts. \u201cTo deny anyone their gods is cruel.\u201d</p><p>Amrita raised her graceful brows. \u201cDo your gods give themselves to everyone? Your bear-goddess and your Elua and Naamah and the others?\u201d</p><p>I began to utter an indignant yes, but the word faltered in my mouth. I fell silent, thinking. Among the Maghuin Dhonn, not everyone who passed through the stone doorway was accepted as one of Her own children. Where did those who were rejected turn? What gods took them in, claimed them for their own? Offered them the solace of faith? I didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>Blessed Elua and his Companions turned no one away, not so far as I knew. And yet..... I did not recall ever hearing of anyone not of D\u2019Angeline blood worshipping the gods of Terre d\u2019Ange.</p><p>The bright lady stirred in my thoughts, reminding me of blessings bestowed; but when I thought on it further, I had to acknowledge that the Emperor of Ch\u2019in\u2019s daughter and the nephew of the Patriarch of Riva met my lady Amrita\u2019s definition of caste.</p><p>It made me unsure.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said at length. \u201cMaybe not. Yet it seems unfair, this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to us, young one.\u201d Amrita touched my arm again, stroking it gently. \u201cThe gods take a longer view, one that spans many lifetimes. The wheel of rebirth turns, and we carry our kharma with us, life after life. None of us can escape it. And who are you to argue against accepting your kharma?\u201d She gave me a sweet, rueful smile. \u201cIt seems to me that your gods have set you a very difficult fate, and you have accepted it, no matter how unfair it is to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but.....\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes were inquiring. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>I touched my chest. \u201cWe are different, we of the Maghuin Dhonn. She Herself, She gave us a spark to follow. A thing to guide us. Even so, we make mistakes.\u201d I shook my head, frustrated. \u201cIn Vralia, I saw. Sometimes men with a hunger for power try to shape the gods to fit their ideas. Priests, even. Maybe it happens here, too.\u201d</p> <p>Amrita was quiet for a long while, the palanquin jogging beneath us. \u201cThat is a grave thought, Moirin,\u201d she said eventually.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I agreed. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>She met my gaze, fearless and steady. \u201cI will think on it.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-NINE</p><p>Offerings.</p><p>So many offered, so many made! I did my best to obey my lady Amrita\u2019s advice and keep my heart open, waiting for the guidance of the gods\u2014hers or mine.</p><p>Other than the constant shadow of foreboding, it was a pleasant time. I liked visiting the temples. Although the issue of the untouchables continued to trouble me, I liked Bhaktipur and its folk.</p><p>I continued to be a little bit in love with Amrita; and I grew passing fond of her son, Ravindra, too. He was such a somber, polite young lad, more like a miniature adult than a child. At times it made me smile, but he had the keen wits to match his demeanor, and when he spoke, I took care to listen. It was understood that when Ravindra turned sixteen, his mother would relinquish the throne that had been his father\u2019s to him, and the boy took his impending duty seriously, immersing himself in his studies.</p><p>It was the custom of mother and son to converse over a game of chess after the evening meal, and it pleased them to have me join them.</p><p>It pleased me, too. The Bhodistani chess set they used was a gorgeous thing, with ornate pieces carved of ivory. I especially liked the knights, which were elephants with ruby eyes and tiny riders.</p><p>I liked to watch Amrita and Ravindra concentrate, heads bent over the black-and-white marble board. Betimes it made me think of old tales, of how Prince Imriel had disguised himself with magic and wooed his Princess Sidonie with games of chess when she was under Carthage\u2019s spell and did not know herself. It was a tale with a glad ending, which made me hopeful.</p><p>Betimes it made me think of my lady Jehanne, which was poignant and bittersweet. If she had lived, she would have been Amrita\u2019s age by now, I thought. It grieved me to think that Jehanne\u2019s daughter would grow up without ever knowing her enchanting, vexing mother.</p><p>\u201cWhy such a sad look tonight, Moirin?\u201d Amrita inquired the first time it happened, noticing my melancholy. They had finished their game, Ravindra had departed for bed, and we were enjoying cups of tea spiced with cardamom and sweetened with honey. \u201cAre you worried that the gods have not spoken to you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. So long as my diadh-anam remained quiet and Bao\u2019s was unchanged, I was not worried\u2014or at least no more than I had been. \u201cThinking of the past, only.\u201d I had not told her the whole of my history. \u201cIn Terre d\u2019Ange, I served as Queen Jehanne\u2019s companion. When I left, she was with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, very good!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>I smiled with sorrow. \u201cYes and no, my lady. I learned in Vralia that my lady Jehanne died in childbirth. Watching you and Ravindra.....\u201d I shrugged. \u201cIt makes me sad. Glad for you, but sad for Jehanne and her daughter, who will never know her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Compassion flooded her features. \u201cI am sorry, very sorry.\u201d Sipping her tea, Amrita studied me. \u201cI think you loved her very much, this queen,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI know something of D\u2019Angelines and their customs, and your face is much the same as when you speak of your young man Bao.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Amrita cocked her head. \u201cDo I remind you of her?\u201d</p><p>It startled a soft laugh out of me. \u201cYou? No, my lady. Jehanne..... she was not always nice, not always kind.\u201d In the City of Elua, they took wagers on how long Jehanne would go without making a chambermaid cry. I couldn\u2019t even imagine the Rani uttering a cruel word, let alone giving in to the notorious bouts of temper to which Jehanne had been prone. \u201cI think it may have been different after the babe was born, though,\u201d I added. \u201cAnd it makes me sad that I will never see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no secret wisdom that comes with motherhood,\u201d Amrita said ruefully. \u201cI never felt more alone and lost than when Ravindra was born.\u201d</p><p>She had been sixteen, I knew now; they wed young in Bhodistani countries. Sixteen, a young widow, and a new mother, far from her childhood home, forced to assume rule of a tiny kingdom that lay beneath the shadow of Kurugiri.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been very, very hard,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She made an eloquent gesture. \u201cBut it was my kharma. Elsewhere in Bhodistan, it would have been worse. I would have been expected to follow my husband into death. However, he forbade it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am very glad.\u201d I shuddered inwardly at the revelation, and inhaled the fragrant steam rising from my tea. \u201cDid you love him?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cRavindra\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord Chakresh?\u201d Amrita was silent a moment. \u201cI honored him. He was a good man, gentle and brave. A good husband, and he would have been a good father. In a way, I wish he had not been so brave, insisting on facing Khaga\u2019s assassins, for he might have lived if he had not. I miss him. But I do not think I felt what is written on your face when you speak of those you love.\u201d She gave me a faint smile. \u201cPerhaps sometimes it is the flaws that make us fall in love, eh? Like your bad boy and your queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I acknowledged. \u201cAlthough they both had good hearts. Jehanne..... I do not think being a mother was some magic that would change her. It was time, that was all. Already, before the child, she was changing, letting herself be kinder and wiser. And Bao.....\u201d I thought of the vast streak of impossible romanticism that lay beneath his seemingly careless exterior, and smiled. \u201cOh, he is not such a bad boy, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d A troubled expression settled over her lovely face. \u201cMoirin..... I do not know what is truth and what is only a tale. But it is said that Kamadeva\u2019s diamond cannot compel false desire.\u201d</p><p>A shudder ran the length of my spine. \u201cAre you saying Bao is a willing victim?\u201d</p><p>Amrita tipped her head back and forth, and made an ambiguous gesture with one hand. \u201cNo. Willing, no. He crossed the Abode of the Gods in search of you, a journey as difficult as your own. Since he does not come to you, it must be that his will is not his own. But Jagrati could not bind him to her with Kamadeva\u2019s diamond if there were not a spark of true desire present.\u201d</p><p>I glanced unerringly in the direction of Kurugiri, where Bao\u2019s diadh-anam was a dull, guttering spark. \u201cIs she beautiful, this Jagrati?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not seen her,\u201d Amrita admitted. \u201cBut the tales say so. Beautiful and terrible at once, like Kali dancing.\u201d</p><p>The image of the goddess Kali I had seen surfaced in my memory, her tongue thrust out in a frenzy as she danced, wearing a necklace of human skulls and a girdle of severed arms around her waist.</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>Bao had died\u2014died, and lived. There was a shimmering darkness that hung over him that had not been there before. Mayhap such a terrible beauty spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Moirin!\u201d Amrita said with dismay, reaching out to stroke my arm. \u201cI did not mean to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know.\u201d I raised her hand to my lips and kissed it. \u201cBetter to know, yes? There are many kinds of desire, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at me, but she was smiling again, which pleased me. \u201cYou are a little bit of a bad girl, I think.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at her. \u201cI am a child of Naamah\u2019s line, and desire is my birthright. I do not need a god\u2019s ashes to make it so. I hold it sacred. It is my path. I am enough of a D\u2019Angeline that I am not afraid to fight for love. I am not afraid to acknowledge it where I find it, including in your person, highness. And when it comes to Bao, I am not afraid to match desire for desire with the Spider Queen.\u201d</p><p>Amrita\u2019s gaze lingered on mine, caring and worried. \u201cIs that wise, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, my lady. I hope so. But so long as the gods remain silent, who can say?\u201d</p><p>Ten days later, the gods broke their silence; or at least the mortal agents by which they made their will known surfaced. I found out why my diadh-anam had been content to allow me to linger in Bhaktipur.</p><p>The Falconer sent for me.</p><p>I would have expected high drama, a clever assassin armed to the teeth and filled with dire threats. But no, the messenger was an utterly unprepossessing fellow, not remarkable in any way in the slightest, save his utter lack of fear at being sent to deliver such a message. The assassin, I suppose, came later.</p><p>The Rani Amrita granted him an audience, sending for both her son, Ravindra, and me to attend it.</p><p>We heard him out.</p><p>\u201cIt has come to the attention of his majesty Tarik Khaga that the Rani of Bhaktipur gives shelter to a foreign dakini of surpassing beauty and power,\u201d the fellow droned, rocking back on his heels, his gaze raking over me with unabashed appreciation. \u201cHe demands that you send her to him immediately.\u201d</p><p>The Rani raised her brows. \u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>The messenger smiled, his upper lip curling to show his teeth. \u201cI believe your highness knows the price of refusing such a request.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Amrita, but she silenced me with a slight shake of her head. \u201cWe will take counsel, and give you our reply within a day.\u201d She raised her right hand, palm outward, and there was enough quiet strength and power in the gesture that the Falconer\u2019s messenger took an involuntary step backward. I had come to learn the meaning of some of these ritual gestures, and this one symbolized her lack of fear, and her protection of me. \u201cGo, and return tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The fellow pressed his palms together and bowed. \u201cI will do so, highness.\u201d He hesitated, his gaze shifting from me to her to Ravindra. \u201cDo not do anything foolish, highness,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe boy has already lost his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d the Rani repeated.</p><p>Once he had left, we met to discuss the matter. My heart was beating fast and my chest felt too tight.</p><p>Kurugiri.</p><p>It was the opportunity I had sought, and yet..... I was scared. In the old tales, Ph\u00e8dre n\u00f3 Delaunay had entered a terrible kingdom of death and despair to rescue the missing prince, giving herself over to the kingdom\u2019s dark ruler. Now that the moment was upon me, I wasn\u2019t sure I had the same courage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSit and breathe, Moirin,\u201d Amrita said gently. \u201cCalm your thoughts.\u201d She pressed the tips of her fingers and thumbs together in a ritual gesture intended to aid in focus and concentration, and Ravindra emulated her, his young face graver than usual. \u201cCome, let us all think.\u201d</p><p>I took the thinking-pose, too, and forced myself to cycle through the Five Styles of Breathing.</p><p>It helped settle my nerves, but it brought no insights. \u201cI have to go with him, my lady,\u201d I said. \u201cI cannot let Tarik Khaga send his falcons after you. I will go with him, find the path to Kurugiri, find Bao. It must be what the gods intend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what your bear-goddess says to you?\u201d Amrita inquired.</p><p>Frowning, I consulted my diadh-anam. It was flickering with eagerness, like coals blown into fresh flame, but it was not flaring with certainty. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there must be another way,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cAnd I would very much like to find it.\u201d</p><p>Ravindra, who was now idly pushing pieces around the chessboard, was silent.</p><p>A thought came to me, so simple and logical that I didn\u2019t know why it hadn\u2019t come to me right away. \u201cNo matter what we say, the messenger has to bring our reply back to Kurugiri, does he not? I could call the twilight and follow him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey know about your magic, Moirin,\u201d Ravindra said without looking up from the chessboard. \u201cHe knew you are a dakini. It is likely that your Bao has told them everything about you.\u201d</p><p>I winced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He gave me an apologetic glance. \u201cBut I think we must assume this is a trap.\u201d</p><p>Amrita stroked her son\u2019s hair. \u201cWise boy. I think so, too. And I am not going to let you walk into it, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am not going to let the Falconer send assassins after you, highness!\u201d I said in frustration. \u201cI could not live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not your choice!\u201d There was a sharp note in her musical voice I had never heard before.</p> <p>I spread my hands. \u201cDo you intend to lock me away? Unless you do, I will go. The gods have sent a sign. What else am I to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a game to them, I think,\u201d Ravindra said in a clear, precise voice, one slim finger touching the carved figure of the black king. \u201cThe Falconer and his Spider Queen. They sit atop their mountain, controlling the board with their pawns and knights. This was the opening gambit. What we must do is neither accept nor reject it, but offer a gambit of our own.\u201d</p><p>Now my diadh-anam flared\u2014and I knew.</p><p>\u201cA trade,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMe for Bao.\u201d</p><p>Ravindra nodded in approval. \u201cThat is a very good gambit, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Amrita shook her head. \u201cNo, I do not like it, not at all. What if Tarik Khaga accepts it?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cWell, then..... I go to Kurugiri and bide my time until I can escape. Sooner or later, I will find a way. After all, I am a dakini.\u201d</p><p>She looked unhappy. \u201cYes, and you are also a young woman of whom I have grown fond. You will suffer there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo not worry, Mama-ji,\u201d Ravindra said in a soothing tone. \u201cHe will not accept the trade.\u201d His hovering finger moved from the black king to the black queen. \u201cJagrati will not let him.\u201d He picked up the piece and moved it, setting her in play. \u201cThe interesting thing will be seeing their countermove.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him. \u201cYou will make quite a ruler one day, young highness.\u201d</p><p>He smiled modestly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>SIXTY</p><p>The Falconer\u2019s messenger returned the following day, and the Rani Amrita delivered our reply to him.</p><p>\u201cI can say neither yes nor no to your master,\u201d she said to him, her hands folded, middle fingers steepled. It was the ritual gesture I had seen her make the first day we met in the street outside the temple, one I now knew was meant to calm conflict. \u201cAs you noted, Moirin mac Fainche is a foreigner, and no subject of mine to compel.\u201d</p><p>The fellow opened his mouth to protest.</p><p>\u201cHowever!\u201d Amrita raised her right hand in the pose of fearlessness. \u201cShe offers a trade. There is a young Ch\u2019in man named Bao in your master\u2019s service. He is the beloved of the dakini Moirin. If Tarik Khaga frees him, she will go willingly to Kurugiri.\u201d She smiled. \u201cA touching sacrifice, do you not think?\u201d</p><p>The messenger scowled and stared at his feet. \u201cI do not know if that is an acceptable answer, highness.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cNonetheless, it is my reply. Go, and tell him.\u201d</p><p>He went; and we waited.</p><p>I hated waiting, the hard lesson of patience that it seemed I was fated to learn over and over.</p><p>And yet..... I had learned it. And I had endured enough to be grateful that if I must be patient and wait, I was very, very fortunate to do so in this very pleasant valley kingdom, the guest of this kind and gracious ruler with her clever, thoughtful son who was wise beyond his years.</p><p>Days passed.</p><p>No one could say for a surety how long it would take. With Manil Datar\u2019s caravan, I\u2019d made the descent from the peak opposite Kurugiri in two days; but the region was deep in winter\u2019s grip by now. Amrita assured me that the route to Kurugiri was at a low enough altitude that it would not become impassable for months on end, unlike other places in the Abode of the Gods. Still, it could be blocked for days if there were snow-storms.</p><p>And no one knew how long it took to ascend the slope itself, navigating the secret path through the torturous maze.</p><p>So we waited.</p><p>We traded tales. I told the whole long story of helping to rescue the Emperor\u2019s daughter and the dragon, and ending a civil war in Ch\u2019in. My lady Amrita and Ravindra listened to it wide-eyed, both of them clapping excitedly at the good parts.</p><p>She told me about growing up in the coastal Bhodistani city of Galanka, where her family enjoyed great prestige. Her noble father had been the liaison to the D\u2019Angeline embassy, which was how she had come to know my own father\u2019s folk before she was pledged in marriage to the Raja of a tiny valley kingdom far, far away to the north. Amrita was the eldest daughter in a large, sprawling family, and her voice grew wistful when she spoke of them.</p><p>\u201cWill you ever return there, do you think?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said simply, her gaze settling on Ravindra. \u201cMy kharma is here.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, understanding.</p><p>Amrita taught me more of the mudras, the ritual hand gestures that focused the mind\u2019s thoughts and the body\u2019s energies, tapping into the vast harmonies of the world. It was not unlike the meditation Master Lo had taught me, and yet I could not begin to achieve Amrita\u2019s fluid grace, nor the sense of power that emanated from her slender hands when she took a pose. As clever as he was, not even young Ravindra could come close to matching his mother\u2019s grace and power.</p><p>Still, I tried.</p><p>And in turn, I taught them both the Five Styles of Breathing. It was not an unfamiliar discipline, for there were similar teachings in Bhodistan. Even so, both of them found the rhythms difficult to master.</p><p>I found myself missing Bao.</p><p>It was foolish, in a way; I missed him all the time, the yearning of my diadh-anam as persistent and constant as a sore tooth. But trying to teach Amrita and Ravindra reminded me of how it had all begun.</p><p>Bao and I sitting cross-legged, our knees brushing, listening to Master Lo\u2019s tutelage aboard the greatship.</p><p>We had gone from reluctant companions to comfortable ones, bonded by our long journey together and our mutual respect for Master Lo, then drifted sideways into genuine affection. I missed that familiarity and comfort. I missed his cheerful boasting. I even missed his teasing.</p><p>All of which made it that much harder when the Falconer\u2019s messenger returned to deliver Tarik Khaga\u2019s reply to our gambit.</p><p>Once again, the Rani granted him an audience with Ravindra and me in attendance, and once again, we heard him out. It was a brief reply.</p><p>\u201cHis majesty Tarik Khaga offered to release the young man Bao from his service,\u201d the fellow announced. \u201cBao declined his offer. He refuses to go. There will be no trade.\u201d He gave a thin smile. \u201cHis majesty\u2019s demand stands as issued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d the Rani Amrita said in acknowledgment. \u201cGo, and return in a day. You shall have our response.\u201d</p><p>And once again, we retired to take counsel.</p><p>Although I hadn\u2019t really expected a happier outcome, still, it was disheartening. Amrita rubbed the back of my neck, consoling me while Ravindra pored over the chessboard. \u201cBao\u2019s will is not his own, Moirin. You know this to be true, for he would have already found a way to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just.....\u201d I sighed. \u201cIf I could just see him, talk to him..... surely it would be enough to break the spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is what we will demand, then,\u201d Ravindra said calmly, moving a white pawn. \u201cWe will refute the Falconer\u2019s claim as a lie, and demand that he send Bao to Bhaktipur so Moirin may hear him refuse his freedom in his own words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he will agree?\u201d I asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ravindra advanced a black pawn. \u201cI think Tarik Khaga will invite you to Kurugiri to hear Bao\u2019s response in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Amrita reached down to advance a second white pawn. \u201cAnd we will propose a meeting of both parties on neutral ground, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere both of us will seek to trick and betray the other,\u201d Ravindra agreed. \u201cAnd that will be very interesting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, jewel of my heart, but you will not be there to see it,\u201d his mother said in a firm tone. \u201cIf it even comes to pass. You are trusting a great deal to the belief that Tarik Khaga and his queen will play this game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama-ji. I am.\u201d He steepled his fingers in the thinking-pose. \u201cBut the Falconer\u2019s men could not find you when they tried, thanks to the hidden room. That failure will be on his mind, and I do not think he is a man who likes to fail. And also remember, since they know of Moirin\u2019s magic, it is likely that they know she can make herself unseen, and very impossible to find and abduct on hostile ground. So I think yes, they will play the game and hope to trick us.\u201d</p><p>Amrita studied the board. \u201cSo, young chess-master! You have thought out a strategy two moves ahead of our opponent. Knowing you, I suspect there is at least one more.\u201d With one finger, she nudged a third white pawn into play, raising her brows at her son. \u201cWhat is the third?\u201d</p><p>Ravindra smiled. \u201cAn ambush. Only we must plan it now, before it is a possibility in their minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, my young lord.....\u201d I shook my head. The thought of either of them coming to harm made me feel ill. \u201cThis is growing too difficult and too dangerous. I cannot ask you to take such risks. Better I should go to Kurugiri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d mother and son said in unison, exchanging a glance.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>Amrita sighed. \u201cIt is not only for you, dear one, nor for your young man. I said before that the shepherd dare not abandon his flock to hunt the falcon. But what you have given us here.....\u201d She made a gesture I didn\u2019t know. \u201cIt is a chance to lure the falcon into a trap, and I think it is a chance I cannot ignore. Perhaps this is what the gods intended in sending you here.\u201d Her face was very serious. \u201cWhat does your bear-goddess say?\u201d</p><p>My diadh-anam shone like a beacon, and I could not lie about it. \u201cIt seems She agrees,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cTarik Khaga had my father killed, Moirin,\u201d Ravindra said in a subdued tone. \u201cAnd many other people, too. Will you not let us try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I said reluctantly, fearful at the thought of risking them. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>The following day, the Rani Amrita delivered our response to the Falconer\u2019s messenger, her demeanor calm and dignified.</p><p>\u201cI fear the dakini Moirin mac Fainche does not believe your master\u2019s words,\u201d she said in a vaguely apologetic tone. \u201cShe requests that his majesty Tarik Khaga send the young man Bao to Bhaktipur that he might deliver his refusal in person. Only then will she accept this edict that there may be no trade.\u201d Amrita gave a slight, helpless shrug. \u201cForgive me. As I said before, the dakini Moirin is not mine to command.\u201d</p><p>The messenger pursed his lips and glanced at me.</p><p>Summoning my mother\u2019s best glare, I folded my arms and glowered at him under my lashes. As an added measure, I called the twilight. Although I could not vanish into it with his gaze on me, I felt it sparkle around me.</p><p>The Falconer\u2019s messenger turned pale, his throat working as he swallowed nervously. For the first time in four encounters, he was a bit afraid.</p><p>I was glad.</p><p>He bowed to Amrita, palms pressed together. \u201cI will convey your message and return with a reply, highness.\u201d</p><p>SIXTY-ONE</p><p>Waiting, waiting, and more waiting.</p><p>Gods, I hated it!</p><p>My lady Amrita was not idle. Guided by her preternaturally clever son\u2019s counsel, she met with the commander of the Royal Guard, which was the nearest thing to an army that Bhaktipur had. Together, they chose a spot in neutral territory suitable for an ambush, a plateau above the valley of Bhaktipur, but below the peaks of Kurugiri. It had enough open space to inspire trust, but there were copses of spruce trees that would hide a mounted battalion with a bit of creative effort.</p><p>A battalion of fifty skilled riders and archers was dispatched, hurrying to make camp and conceal it before the possibility of such an action might arise in our opponents\u2019 minds. It was important to remain three steps ahead of them.</p><p>We waited.</p><p>On the advice of the commander of her guard, we confined ourselves to the palace grounds, and Amrita and her son abandoned their sleeping-quarters to pass their nights in the hidden room her husband had commissioned before he dared to wed a beautiful, young bride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had to own, it was a clever design. Young Ravindra must have inherited his head for strategy from his father. The steep, narrow stair that led to the hidden room was concealed behind an elaborately embroidered wall-hanging depicting the goddess Durga on her tiger. Nothing about the architecture of the palace suggested it was there.</p><p>The room itself was small, but not unpleasant. It even had a balcony that looked out onto an interior courtyard garden with a fountain at the center, filled with growing plants, and birds and monkeys, too. Amrita invited me to join them, but I refused, feeling I\u2019d already imposed more than enough on their lives.</p><p>I tried setting ward-stones around my room as I had learned to do travelling across the Tatar steppe, but the charm didn\u2019t work in a man-made dwelling. At least my own balcony was high and inaccessible; and clever Ravindra came up with the idea of stringing bells to the outer door of my own sleeping-chamber, so that if anyone were to succeed in forcing the lock, the clamor would awaken me before they entered, and I might summon the twilight.</p> <p>In a week\u2019s time, the Falconer\u2019s messenger returned with the expected reply, delivering it with relish.</p><p>\u201cHis majesty Tarik Khaga agrees that the dakini Moirin is entitled to hear Bao\u2019s refusal from his own lips,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cHis majesty invites her to accompany me to Kurugiri as his honored guest.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, the Falconer\u2019s messenger reckoned this was a counterstroke of masterful strategy on the part of the forces of Kurugiri. The Rani Amrita furrowed her brow and looked troubled, letting him believe she was at a loss for a response. \u201cAs ever, it is the dakini Moirin\u2019s choice,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cAgain, we will take counsel. Go, and come back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He bowed, and went.</p><p>There was no need to take counsel this time. Our plans were set. Amrita would have liked to use the day to make another round of temple offerings, but her commander of the guard, a handsome fellow named Hasan Dar, was adamant about not venturing beyond the palace walls.</p> <p>\u201cTarik Khaga may tire of this game you play with him, highness,\u201d he said earnestly to her. \u201cFor all we know, he already has, and his assassins lie in wait. There are too many people in the streets, and it is too difficult to protect you. Please, take no risks. Make your offerings at the household altar. The gods will understand.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Amrita agreed; and we heaped the household altar high with garlands of dried flowers, offerings of food and incense.</p><p>A day later, the Falconer\u2019s messenger returned, and Amrita delivered our final edict to him, a surprisingly stern note in her musical voice.</p><p>\u201cGiven your master\u2019s history, the dakini Moirin does not believe this offer is made in good faith,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I agree with her. So! We refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d the messenger began.</p><p>Once again, my lady Amrita raised her right hand in the pose of fearlessness, silencing him. \u201cI offer a compromise. I propose a meeting of both parties on neutral ground. Do you know the plateau beneath the Sleeping Calf Rock?\u201d she inquired.</p> <p>He nodded warily.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d She gave a brisk nod in reply. \u201cLet us meet there, your master and I. The dakini Moirin will accompany me, and your master will bring this young man Bao. No weapons on either side. Each of us will be escorted by no more than ten unarmed guards. At a distance of five hundred paces, we will each exchange a guardsman to verify that both parties have honored these terms. Do I make myself understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, highness.\u201d The messenger licked his lips. \u201cWhat do you expect this meeting to accomplish?\u201d</p><p>I answered for her. \u201cI expect to persuade Bao to leave your master\u2019s service. If he does, I will honor my word and offer myself in his place.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid sideways toward me. \u201cAnd if you fail?\u201d</p><p>I called the twilight, wrapping its subtle dazzle around me. \u201cI will not fail.\u201d</p><p>The Falconer\u2019s messenger looked away.</p><p>\u201cI am weary of this game,\u201d the Rani Amrita announced. \u201cNo more demands, no more offers. I will await your master on the plateau in one week\u2019s time. Go, and tell Tarik Khaga the Falconer that that is my final word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, highness.\u201d He bowed to her. \u201cI will do so.\u201d</p><p>Five days later, we set out for the plateau.</p><p>I was sick with unease. It seemed a good plan, but it was a dangerous one, too. With our hidden battalion, we would outnumber Tarik Khaga\u2019s men six to one; but the battalion would have some distance to cross once the signal was given, and Khaga\u2019s men were likely to be skilled assassins, one and all. Hasan Dar and the nine guards he had chosen to escort us were exceptional warriors, trained to fight with any weapon or none, but they were not assassins. And I had learned during my time in Bhaktipur that the Falconer was not the first to hold that dubious title, oh, no.</p><p>No, it was a hereditary mantle. For many generations, there had been a Falconer in Kurugiri, amassing years of knowledge of deadly killing arts. Until the advent of Jagrati the Spider Queen, none had killed save for hire.</p><p>This Falconer, Tarik Khaga, was different. Worse. He killed on a whim\u2014his, or his Spider Queen\u2019s.</p><p>It was a surety that his men would have weapons hidden on them\u2014subtle weapons, garrotes and throwing knives, mayhap poisoned darts like the one with which Black Sleeve had killed Bao.</p><p>I was afraid for myself, but the insistent blaze of my diadh-anam told me I had to go. More so, I was very afraid for the Rani Amrita, and I wished very, very much that she would not undertake this venture.</p><p>\u201cI have to go, Moirin,\u201d she said calmly when I sought to dissuade her. \u201cIt is clear now that the gods sent you to me. It is my kharma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not see why you must risk yourself personally!\u201d I said in frustration. \u201cThere is no sense in it.\u201d</p><p>Amrita was silent a moment. \u201cI felt the same when my lord Chakresh insisted on facing the Falconer\u2019s assassins with his men,\u201d she said presently. \u201cHe insisted it was a matter of honor and duty. Now that the same choice is upon me, I understand.\u201d She laid a hand on my arm. \u201cPlease, do not quarrel with me, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I acceded.</p><p>It was an auspicious day when we set out, clear and bright. The Rani Amrita bade farewell to her son in private and for the first time, I saw Ravindra as a child in truth. His narrow shoulders shook as he embraced his mother and wept, his tears dampening the cloth of her sari. She held him close, kissing the top of his head.</p><p>\u201cBe brave, jewel of my heart,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI will draw strength from your courage.\u201d</p><p>Ravindra straightened. \u201cI will do my best, Mama-ji.\u201d</p><p>We made our way through the streets of Bhaktipur in a splendid procession, surrounded by a hundred guards and dozens of attendants. Only ten guardsmen would accompany us to the plateau, but Hasan Dar meant to take no chances until it was necessary, especially in the crowded streets of the city.</p><p>I rode beside Amrita in her palanquin. Folks pressed as close as the guards would allow, tossing flowers and calling out blessings. Others begged the Rani not to go, echoing my sentiment. They didn\u2019t know about the ambush, of course, but they knew she meant to meet with the Falconer, and they were afraid for her.</p><p>When the outskirts of the city gave way to orchards and farmland, we abandoned the palanquin for horses and set out across the valley. Despite my pervasive fear, I was glad to be in a green, living place once more, and no longer cooped up behind the palace walls. I breathed the Breath of Trees Growing, willing my nerves to be calm.</p><p>An hour into our journey, I felt a shift occur that made me catch my breath, my diadh-anam flaring sharply inside me. Amrita glanced at me with concern. \u201cWhat is it, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBao,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s moving, coming closer.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou can tell this?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cNot over very vast distances, but this is near enough that I feel it. He\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>Amrita smiled. \u201cThen that is very good news, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Although I could sense it drawing closer, Bao\u2019s diadh-anam didn\u2019t quicken with eagerness like mine did. It was as sickly and guttering as it had been for all those long months since I\u2019d first sensed it in Vralia. I had been certain, so certain, that once we were together, no thrall could hold him. Now I wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>All throughout the day, pace by pace, I felt the distance between us lessen. I wanted to be joyful at the prospect, but I was too anxious.</p><p>By the end of the day, we had ascended into the foothills at the northern end of the valley of Bhaktipur. The warm lowland temperatures vanished quickly. Solicitous attendants brought long coats of padded, embroidered silk for Amrita and me to wear. We made camp in a meadow, where they erected tents of brightly colored silk, striped and merry. It was a festive scene, but the mood was somber. On the morrow, only twelve of us would continue\u2014the Rani and I, and Hasan Dar and his nine handpicked guards.</p><p>Although I had no appetite, I tried to force myself to eat, reckoning I needed my strength. In contrast, Amrita ate more heartily than I\u2019d ever seen her.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying, Moirin,\u201d she said, pressing a bit of flatbread with curried lamb and tangy achar on me. \u201cWhatever will happen tomorrow, will happen. It does no good to worry about it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo young to be carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders!\u201d Amrita teased me gently, coaxing a reluctant smile from me. \u201cI think you have been doing just that for far too long, young goddess,\u201d she added in a more serious tone. \u201cBut you are not alone here. I am with you, and Hasan Dar and his men will protect your life as my own.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened, and tears stung my eyes. \u201cThank you, my lady Amrita.\u201d</p><p>I was grateful, so very grateful to her; and yet I wished she were a thousand miles away, because if any harm befell this kind, beautiful, and brave Rani whom I had grown so quickly to love, I would spend the rest of my life regretting it.</p><p>I prayed it would not.</p><p>SIXTY-TWO</p><p>On the morrow, our reduced company of twelve set out for the plateau. Hasan Dar and his men left their swords behind, carrying only small knives concealed within their sashed belts. It was assumed that the Falconer\u2019s men would do the same, and worse.</p><p>I wished I had my bow, but it would have been impossible to hide.</p><p>Our path grew steeper as we climbed higher, and the air began to grow thinner. I felt dizzy at the lack, dizzy with the memory of mountain-sickness and fever, dizzy with the bright clamor of my diadh-anam, growing more and more insistent with each hour that passed.</p><p>Bao\u2019s name echoed in my thoughts like a drumbeat, over and over.</p><p>My aching heart felt too big for my chest, like it might burst its confines and shatter my bones.</p><p>I breathed the Breath of Earth\u2019s Pulse, grounding myself. Remembering Master Lo\u2019s teaching, I let one thought rise from another, trying not to chase them and drive myself mad with worry. I concentrated on the path, on the bobbing ears of my saddle-horse Lady, well rested and restored from her ordeal in the Abode of the Gods.</p><p>By late morning, we spotted the peak known as Sleeping Calf Rock, a jutting outcropping of stone shaped for all the world like a yak calf lying in slumber, its head stretched out and its legs folded beneath its body.</p><p>An hour later, we gained the plateau that lay beneath it. To all appearances, it was empty, an expanse of grassy meadow with a thick copse of spruce trees on the southwestern verge. I couldn\u2019t help but glance in that direction. Assuming our battalion of fifty archers was concealed within the dense copse, they were well hidden.</p><p>Gods, I hoped they were there.</p><p>Hasan Dar had a silver pipe that gave a shrill whistle on a chain around his neck. When he blew it, it would be the signal for our archers to emerge. He had argued in favor of doing so the instant the Falconer Tarik Khaga and his men were in range, ambushing them without bothering to parley with them.</p><p>The Rani Amrita had refused. \u201cAll this has come about because of Moirin and her young man,\u201d she had said firmly in her musical voice. \u201cI fear if we do not give her the chance to save him, we defy the will of the gods.\u201d</p><p>Now, I shivered, praying that the gods did indeed intend for me to free my stubborn peasant-boy from this mess. I pushed away the memory of the boy-monk in Rasa bidding me to rescue the tulku Laysa. I could only bear so many burdens at once.</p><p>We took a position in the open meadow some hundred paces beyond the copse where our archers were hidden. Hasan Dar bowed to the Rani from his saddle, his palms pressed together, his eyes watchful and grave. \u201cWe are here, highness. All is in readiness. It awaits only to see if the Falconer takes our bait.\u201d</p><p>Amrita gave me an inquiring glance.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThey are coming; or at least Bao is coming, and I doubt he is coming alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>In my mind, I measured the dwindling distance between Bao\u2019s diadh-anam and mine against the distance that had separated us before this journey. \u201cNot long,\u201d I said. \u201cLess than two hours, I think.\u201d</p><p>The sun crept across the sky; and we waited. The shadow cast by Sleeping Calf Rock shifted, obscuring the path toward the further mountains and Kurugiri.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Bao was coming. I could feel it, step by step. The nearer he got, the easier it was to gauge. My diadh-anam sang inside me, while his did not sing at all. Still, I felt it. When I knew he was almost upon us, I flung out my arm and pointed. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>One man on horseback rounded the curve beneath the outcropping, emerging from the shadows. He paused, surveying the plateau, then turned back and beckoned. Others followed, riding into sunlight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even at a distance, I spotted Bao among them. I knew him by the way he sat his mount, by the lean, tight-knit grace of his figure, by the faint shimmer of darkness that hung around him ever since his rebirth. It was stronger in the twilight, but even in daylight, I could see it. I wished I could see his face. The men spread out, forming a line, and advanced at a measured pace.</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three.....\u201d Hasan Dar squinted, counting. \u201cHuh. Twelve, I make it. One more than allowed by our terms.\u201d He gestured to his second in command. \u201cPradeep, go!\u201d</p><p>The guardsman Pradeep clapped heels to his mount, sprinting across the meadow. On the far side, the Falconer\u2019s party halted to confer. In short order, one of their men rode forward to fulfill the exchange.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t Bao. I wished it had been; I wished we could have grabbed him and fled, summoning the archers to ward our retreat. But no, it was some southern Bhodistani fellow with thick brows, a hard mouth, and a sword-belt with two empty scabbards. He scanned our company with a shrewd gaze, then gave a sharp nod, wheeled, and retreated, passing our returning guardsman Pradeep on the way.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Hasan Dar raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cThey have honored the terms, commander,\u201d Pradeep said breathlessly, leaning on his pommel. \u201cNo visible weapons. And their twelfth person..... it is not an extra guard. It is Jagrati the Spider Queen herself.\u201d</p><p>A chill crawled over my skin. That had not been part of our plan; but Pradeep was right, it was not a violation of the terms, either. It had simply not occurred to any of us that the Spider Queen would leave the safehold of Kurugiri.</p><p>Hasan Dar gave the Rani an inquiring look. She frowned, then nodded in assent. Her commander raised one arm, beckoning the Falconer\u2019s company forward.</p> <p>Once again, they began to advance.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, the distance between us narrowed; and I felt my awareness narrowing, too. I tried to fight it, and couldn\u2019t. I was at the mercy of my diadh-anam, and nothing else in the world existed for it save its missing half. My vision dwindled to a tunnel, and at the end of the tunnel was Bao.</p><p>Closer and closer he rode, until I could make out his face. His gaze was fixed on me as surely as mine was on him..... and there was nothing, nothing at all glad or joyful in it. Instead, his expression was fixed with a mix of fury and anguish, his dark eyes glittering with something that looked very much like hatred.</p><p>It struck me like a blow, hard enough that I wrenched my gaze away, breathing slowly and shivering. My vision expanded again; now it was my heart that contracted painfully, thudding in my chest.</p><p>The company reached us and drew rein a few paces away. There were ten men including Bao, each looking more deadly than the next. Mountain-folk, southern Bhodistani..... others I didn\u2019t know, Akkadian, mayhap. There was even a fellow with reddish hair and grey eyes.</p><p>Tarik Khaga, the Falconer of Kurugiri, had deep-set eyes and a strong prow of a nose, black hair streaked with iron-grey. He looked to be somewhere in his fifties, a muscular fellow with the beginning of a slight paunch that didn\u2019t make him look any less dangerous.</p> <p>Jagrati.</p><p>I stole a glance at the Spider Queen. Her face was gaunt and striking, dark-skinned, high cheekbones with hollows beneath them, but not so terrible a beauty as I had expected. The rest of her was draped in a black cloak fastened high around her throat.</p><p>The Rani Amrita broke the silence. \u201cGreetings, my lord Khaga,\u201d she said, pressing her hands together, her voice clear and sincere. \u201cI thank you for consenting to this meeting. Shall we unhorse ourselves and speak as civilized folk?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicked briefly to Jagrati, who gave an almost imperceptible nod. \u201cAs you wish, little Rani,\u201d he said in a dismissive tone.</p><p>Both parties dismounted. It would give our mounted archers waiting in ambush a few more seconds of time to close the distance between us; still, I felt uneasy. I kept glancing at Bao, and away from the seething hatred in his gaze. He didn\u2019t even look like himself. With the ban on weapons, his ever-present bamboo staff was missing. The unruly shock of his black hair had grown longer, caught and tamed by a clasp at the nape of his neck, and there were gold hoops in his earlobes.</p><p>\u201cSo, my lord\u2014\u201d the Rani began.</p><p>The Falconer cut her off with a gesture. \u201cYou shall have what you came for.\u201d He beckoned. \u201cBao!\u201d</p><p>Like his master, Bao looked to Jagrati for assurance; and she nodded at him, too, her expression softening briefly. For a second, he looked grateful; and then the mask of hatred returned to his face as he moved toward me.</p> <p>\u201cBao, please.....\u201d My voice shook as I took a step forward. My diadh-anam roiled and blazed in anguish.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d His voice cracked like a whip. \u201cWhoever you are, whatever you are, I want no part of you or whatever sick game you play! Do you understand? Go, and leave me to the service of my lord and lady Khaga!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBao, it\u2019s me! Moirin!\u201d I touched my chest, my heart aching. \u201cHow can you not know me?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, nostrils flaring. I could feel the heat of his fury rolling off him, the hot-metal forge smell of his skin. His pupils were too wide, his eyes fever-bright and wild. \u201cBecause Moirin mac Fainche died almost a year ago!\u201d he shouted at me, his hands clenching and unclenching. \u201cDo you think I did not feel it? Whatever foul spirit has stolen her face, stolen the very spark of her soul, I want nothing to do with it!\u201d</p><p>Tears blurred my eyes. \u201cBao, it\u2019s me! I wasn\u2019t killed, I was bound by magic! That\u2019s why you couldn\u2019t sense me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bao shook his head. \u201cNo, that is the lie the Great Khan told me, and I will not believe it twice. In Kurugiri, I learned the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t!\u201d I cried in frustration. \u201cThe lord and lady of Kurugiri never had anything to do with it! It was Vralian priests who took me prisoner, using Yeshuite magic! Chains, like the one the Circle of Shalomon tried to use to bind the demon-spirit they summoned, the one you and Master Lo helped me banish. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Bao hesitated, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThe Great Khan told you a lie to send you in the opposite direction,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBut I am here now.\u201d</p><p>His diadh-anam flickered.</p><p>\u201cYou feel it!\u201d I said. \u201cYou do, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no, I\u2019m afraid that is not an acceptable outcome,\u201d another voice said\u2014a woman\u2019s voice soft and sibilant, with a faint rasp like silk drawn over a whetstone. \u201cThis has gone on long enough, I think.\u201d</p><p>Bao glanced at Jagrati, who smiled tenderly at him.</p><p>He smiled back at her, relieved and certain once more.</p><p>And then the Spider Queen smiled at me, her long-fingered hands reaching up to undo the clasp of her cloak. It fell away, revealing the collar of gold filigree that adorned her long, slender throat, an immense black diamond set in the middle of it, filled with glowing hues that shifted like embers.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>She was as terrible and beautiful as Kali dancing, terrifying and compelling. She was tall, taller than me, taller than most women, with long limbs that moved with angular grace. I stood frozen as Ja\u2014grati drifted toward me, still smiling. Despite the stark beauty of her hollow-cheeked face, she had very full lips....</p><p>..... and Kamadeva\u2019s diamond.</p><p>It glowed, filled with dark fire, pulsing in time with the beating of her blood. It was made from the ashes of the Bhodistani god of desire, and it called to Naamah\u2019s gift within me, setting it to rise in an endless spiral, filling my limbs with languor, sapping my will.</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell Hasan Dar to sound his whistle, to call the archers from their ambush. No words came.</p><p>Even if they had, Hasan Dar and his men were gaping, transfixed.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true.\u201d Jagrati\u2019s fingertips stroked my face, and I leaned into her touch, helpless to resist the urge. She pitched her voice low, for my ears only, fond and amused. \u201cI thought you might respond to it. Bao has told me so very, very much about you, Moirin. I think perhaps we are not so different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I asked mindlessly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She drew a line from my temple to the corner of my lips. \u201cYour goddess Naamah, when she journeyed in Bhodistan, she made no distinctions when she lay down with strangers. Any caste, or no-caste. No one was untouchable to her. It was only desire that mattered. Desire that made a thing sacred. You understand this, yes? Or else you would not have let yourself love a bastard peasant-boy without so much as a family name.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me, then.\u201d Jagrati\u2019s smile widened, showing perfect white teeth. \u201cPerhaps in Kurugiri, you may convince Bao that you did not die. I did not mean to lie to him at first; it is only that I thought it must be so, that the Great Khan must have killed you. I did my best to help him through his grief, wrongly though I guessed. So, will you come?\u201d</p><p>Unsure, I glanced sideways at the Falconer.</p><p>\u201cOh, do not trouble yourself with my husband.\u201d Her fingers were firm on my chin, turning me back to face her. Kamadeva\u2019s diamond and Naamah\u2019s gifts pulsed between us. \u201cHe does as I will. I am content to allow him his pleasures while I take my own with others, but he will not trouble you if I do not wish it.\u201d The Spider Queen leaned forward and kissed me, her tongue flickering against mine. \u201cSo, Moirin, will you come?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The word was on my lips.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Amrita\u2019s musical voice called out behind me. She tugged me away with surprising strength, wedging herself deftly between Jagrati and me, her graceful hands raised and crossed before her in an unfamiliar mudra. Power and conviction radiated from her small figure. \u201cI will not allow it!\u201d</p><p>Jagrati recoiled with a fierce expression of distaste that turned her striking face ugly. \u201cWho will stop me, little Rani?\u201d she asked with a sneer. \u201cYour men?\u201d She gestured at them, every last one transfixed by Kamadeva\u2019s diamond. \u201cI do not think so. Your pet dakini?\u201d She shook her head slowly, a sensual smile returning to her lips. \u201cShe is eager to say yes to me. It may prove quite interesting.\u201d</p><p>Desire pounded in my veins, merging confusingly with the insistent call of my diadh-anam. I forced myself to stare at the back of Amrita\u2019s head, clenching my teeth to keep the word \u201cyes\u201d from escaping.</p><p>\u201cNonetheless, I forbid it,\u201d Amrita said firmly. \u201cThat is a sacred object you profane, Jagrati.\u201d Her hands shifted into the soothing mudra that stilled conflict. \u201cIt is not too late for you to obey your kharma,\u201d she said in a softer tone. \u201cGive Kamadeva\u2019s diamond to me, and I will see it restored to the temple.\u201d</p><p>The Spider Queen laughed, a sound like silk tearing; and there was dark humor in it, and hatred and loathing, too. It made my skin prickle, and the blood run cold in my veins.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do not think so, little Rani,\u201d she said in that low silken rasp. \u201cI know your kind, daughter of privilege! You are so very, very concerned with the kharma of the less fortunate, so long as it means we will always be there to tan your leather, bury your dead, and haul away your night-soil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not choose the way the world is ordered,\u201d my lady Amrita murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you are content to live in it,\u201d Jagrati observed. \u201cYou command us to carry away the shit squeezed stinking from your bowels, and then claim we are unclean because of it, as though it were never a part of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe priests\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spit on the priests!\u201d Jagrati spat on the ground. \u201cI spit on the gods, too! I have chosen my own destiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are only dooming yourself, Jagrati,\u201d Amrita said in a sorrowful voice.</p><p>\u201cAh, no.\u201d Her predatory smile returned. \u201cI am taking quite a few others with me. Now, I shall take your oh so pretty dakini, and perhaps a few of your men, too. Your captain\u2019s a handsome fellow.\u201d She beckoned to Hasan Dar. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward obediently, the silver pipe around his neck glinting in the afternoon sunlight.</p><p>The pipe that would summon our ambush.....</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move. The best I could manage was a faint, broken whisper. \u201cThe pipe! My lady Amrita..... blow the pipe.\u201d</p><p>She moved without hesitation to intercept Hasan Dar, raising one hand in a gesture that halted him in his tracks. He blinked in perplexity, but he didn\u2019t protest when Amrita reached for the pipe and blew a long, shrill blast on it.</p><p>Shouts came from the copse behind us. I prayed silently that Kamadeva\u2019s diamond wasn\u2019t powerful enough to transfix fifty men charging on horseback all at once.</p><p>It seemed it wasn\u2019t, for Jagrati hissed with fury, her stark face transformed into ugliness once more.</p><p>The Falconer stirred like a man waking from a dream. \u201cAmbush!\u201d he shouted. \u201cRide!\u201d He cast a scathing glance at Amrita as he scrambled into the saddle, jerking his mount\u2019s head around. \u201cYou will pay for this, little Rani.\u201d</p><p>She smiled grimly. \u201cYou had better ride fast, Falcon King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBao!\u201d I called his name in a choked voice. \u201cDon\u2019t go, please!\u201d</p><p>He looked briefly at me, and I felt his diadh-anam flicker again; but then Jagrati leaned over in the saddle and spoke to him, and he turned away from me.</p><p>They fled before the onslaught of our archers, who came thundering out of hiding, sweeping across the meadow, parting to pass us by. I held my breath, fearful for Bao, unsure whether to pray for success or failure.</p><p>Beneath the shadow of Sleeping Calf Rock, at the base of the path that led higher into the mountains, two of the Falconer\u2019s men turned back, sowing confusion in the ranks of their pursuers. The air was filled with the twang of bowstrings and the hum of arrows in flight, and sparkling with the glint of throwing daggers and other hidden weapons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hasan Dar shook himself, dropping to one knee before the Rani and lowering his head. \u201cMy lady, forgive me,\u201d he said in a hoarse voice. \u201cI failed you.\u201d</p><p>Amrita laid one hand on his head. \u201cNot yet, my friend. Go after them, I beg you, and see this finished. Your men will look after me. And.....\u201d She glanced at me. \u201cTry not to kill the young man from Ch\u2019in, please.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and sprang to his feet, striding toward his mount.</p> <p>I shivered. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She caught my hand and squeezed it, her dark, lustrous gaze searching my face. \u201cAre you all right, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>SIXTY-THREE</p><p>We passed the night in the hidden encampment in the spruce copse.</p> <p>I was a wreck.</p><p>It had all gone wrong, so very wrong. It had been a good plan, but it was a plan largely conceived by a ten-year-old boy who had not taken into account the possibility that Kamadeva\u2019s diamond would be set in play, rendering ten grown men and one highly susceptible daughter of Naamah\u2019s line vulnerable to desire.</p><p>Desire that would not go away.</p><p>Ah, gods! It was all entangled and complicated, my diadh-anam and Naamah\u2019s gifts warring against one another, my heart\u2019s yearning for Bao and the unholy wanting that Kamadeva\u2019s diamond had loosed in me doing battle. It gripped me like a fever.</p><p>Jagrati.</p><p>Her face swam before me in my dreams, gaunt, high-boned, and compelling. Although I did not trust her for an instant, some of the things she had said rang true to me. It was a cruel, unfair world that had given shape to her hatred.</p> <p>Bao.</p><p>My heart ached.</p><p>I had come close, so very close, to reaching him. Now, again and again, I reached for him, reached for his diadh-anam, willing that faint flicker of uncertainty to kindle into a blaze, wherein he knew me once more. But although I sensed he was alive, I couldn\u2019t feel him clearly anymore. When I tried, Jagrati\u2019s face arose in my thoughts, mocking me. I would have said \u201cyes\u201d to her without a second thought, without a thought in my mind at all. She had taken what I believed was my strength, and turned it against me. I\u2019d thought I could pit my diadh-anam and Naamah\u2019s gifts against the lure of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond and win.</p><p>I\u2019d thought to do battle for Bao.</p><p>Instead, I was at war with myself.</p><p>\u201cHush, young goddess.\u201d Amrita stroked my hair, my head pillowed on her lap. \u201cIt is not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cNone of us expected it.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed. \u201cNo, but at least you were not vulnerable to it. And it is probably best if you do not touch me so, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went still. \u201cIt troubles you still?\u201d</p><p>The incessant pulse of desire beat in my veins, timed to the flickering glow trapped in Kamadeva\u2019s diamond. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Amrita shifted gently away from me. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>In the morning, Hasan Dar and our company of archers returned, grim-faced and defeated. Once again, he knelt before the Rani and bowed his head in abject apology. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, highness, but I have failed you in truth. We killed several of their men, but Tarik Khaga and his cursed Queen escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no! How?\u201d Amrita looked dismayed.</p><p>\u201cThey had weapons and armor cached along the path. One of their men held a narrow pass long enough for them to cause a rockslide above it,\u201d he said dully. \u201cIt must have been rigged to fall beforehand. We worked through the night to clear it, but by the time we succeeded, they were long gone.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cYour young man was with them. I do not think he was injured.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, grateful for the confirmation. I wasn\u2019t sure I could trust my desire-snarled diadh-anam at the moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d The Rani Amrita\u2019s slender shoulders slumped. I wished I dared to comfort her, but I was barely managing to contain the maelstrom of desire raging inside me. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go home,\u201d Hasan Dar said in a grim voice. \u201cAnd brace ourselves for assassins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not your fault.\u201d He turned his weary gaze toward me. \u201cAll of us thought the attempt worth making, and all but one of us failed in the face of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond. If her highness had not been with us, you and I would be on our way to Kurugiri, Lady Moirin.\u201d He shivered. \u201cWillingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t let you talk me out of coming, then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Amrita observed with a faint spark of her usual good humor.</p><p>With an effort, I summoned a smile for her. \u201cYou were heroic, my lady. Truly.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI was fortunate. Kamadeva\u2019s diamond cannot compel false desire.\u201d</p><p>It was a somber procession that made the journey back to the meadow where we had made camp the first night. We had lost five men in the effort, hewn down by the Falconer\u2019s assassins. I was afraid to ask if Bao had killed any of them, but in the end, I had to know.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Hasan Dar said in a tired tone. \u201cHe was guarding that cursed Jagrati with some sort of fighting-staff. It must have been hidden in their caches.\u201d He rubbed at his face. \u201cHe\u2019s good, that one. I\u2019ve never seen a man quick enough to bat arrows out of thin air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that would be Bao,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Our somber procession met a somber welcome in the base camp, news of our failure spreading quickly. Hasan Dar posted every man he could spare around the perimeter, wary of assassins. Everyone not on guard slept fitfully that night, though perhaps none more so than I did.</p><p>The desire hadn\u2019t faded.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem to have taken anyone else the same way, and I did not know whether it was because Jagrati had targeted me specifically, touched me and kissed me, staking a claim on me; or if it was because of Naamah\u2019s gift, sparked into unrelenting flame by the shifting fires of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond. I only knew that it racked me mercilessly, filling me with wanting, until I literally shook with it.</p><p>\u201cMoirin.....\u201d Amrita sounded miserable. \u201cI do not like to see you suffer. Is there nothing I can do?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at her, wrapping my arms around my knees. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The following day, we returned to Bhaktipur. There was no tossing of flowers, no calling out of blessings. Folk in the street were silent and downcast, whispering to one another, whispering of death and cunning, skilled assassins on the way. I felt the skin between my shoulder blades grow tight and itching.</p><p>In the palace, Ravindra wept with relief to find his mother alive and well, and wept with remorse that his plan had failed us.</p><p>\u201cDo not blame yourself, young chess-master.\u201d His mother hugged him tight. \u201cIt was a very good plan. We shall just have to continue sleeping in the hidden room for a time, you and I.\u201d</p><p>Ravindra gazed at me, eyes damp between tear-spiked lashes. \u201cI am sorry about your Bao, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>My diadh-anam gave a painful flare, setting off another wave of desire, making me shudder to the bone. \u201cSo am I, young highness.\u201d</p><p>After we had bathed and eaten, and Ravindra had been sent away to sleep in the hidden room, Amrita insisted on sending for her physician to attend to me in my quarters, despite my protests that it would do no good. He felt at my brow and took my pulse, examined my tongue, and prescribed a diet of cooling foods.</p><p>\u201cYoghurt, cucumber, and mint,\u201d the physician said, papering over uncertainty with a decisive tone. \u201cYes, this will help!\u201d</p><p>Out of courtesy, I waited until he was gone to laugh in despair. \u201cYoghurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Moirin!\u201d Amrita put her arms around me, worried and concerned. \u201cOnly try it, will you not?\u201d</p><p>I buried my face in the crook of her neck. She smelled good, like flowers and spices\u2014not as intoxicating as my lady Jehanne, but close. I kissed her throat, opened my mouth and tasted her warm skin with my tongue.</p><p>And I hadn\u2019t the faintest idea I was doing it until I felt her stiffen in shock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d I jerked away from her, hiding my face in my hands. \u201cAmrita, I told you not to touch me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I minded, actually.\u201d There was a surprisingly pragmatic note in her musical voice. \u201cIt felt rather nice. After all, the role of the sainted widow can be a lonely one.\u201d Her hands tugged at mine, lowering them. Reluctantly, I lifted my head and met her dark, lustrous gaze. A little silence came between us. \u201cWould it help?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>Like a shower of golden sparks, her words and their meaning fell drifting through my awareness.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Amrita smiled at me. \u201cYou will have to show me what to do, Moirin, for I confess, I have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d I whispered, cupping her face in my hands and kissing her. I felt her lips soften and part beneath mine.</p><p>The bright lady smiled, setting loose a flurry of doves.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Amrita sounded surprised. \u201cWell, that is different.\u201d</p><p>I sat back on my heels. \u201cDoes it displease you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled at me beneath her lashes. \u201cNot at all, actually. Show me more, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>Gold; she was like gold, something pure and shining in the midst of this mess. And like an alchemist\u2019s magic, her kindness transmuted the base metal of the desire that racked me into something golden and pure. I undressed her reverently until she was clad in nothing but bangles and tinkling anklets, kissing every inch of amber skin I uncovered, until she shivered and wrapped her arms around me, murmuring my name. I knew it was compassion, and not desire, that lay behind her offer, but that didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t please her\u2014and that alone would have been enough for me. But it was in Amrita\u2019s nature to be generous, and she did her best to return the gift of pleasure that I showered on her.</p><p>Bit by bit, the terrible, searing need drained away from me. Afterward, I couldn\u2019t find enough words to thank her.</p><p>\u201cI am not sure it is necessary, dear one.\u201d She laughed her chiming laugh. \u201cYou have considerable skill in your art.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI take considerable pleasure in it.\u201d</p><p>Amrita stretched languorously. \u201cThat cursed Jagrati was right about one thing. It was certainly interesting. You are a veritable poet of desire, Moirin.\u201d She gave me a serious look. \u201cDo you feel better now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d I kissed the graceful curve of her bare shoulder, gleaming in the lamplight. There were still a thousand fears and worries pressing me, but in this moment, Amrita\u2019s presence held them at bay. \u201cIf there is room in the world for love, there is room for hope. Although mayhap you will have to be more fearful of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond now,\u201d I teased her.</p><p>\u201cDo not even think it!\u201d She tapped my lips in reproach. \u201cI could never have done this if I did not care for you, Moirin. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I caught her hand and kissed that, too. \u201cI know the difference between kindness and genuine desire, my lady. And I am very, very grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Amrita said humorously. \u201cYou do not need to demonstrate it again. I am a little worn out by your gratitude.\u201d She fell silent, thinking. Sensing her mood shift, I kept my own silence. \u201cI think perhaps Jagrati may have said more than one true thing,\u201d she said presently. \u201cWhat she said about the way the world treats those unfortunate ones born outside of a caste..... they were harsh words, but they have stayed with me.\u201d She glanced at me. \u201cI have not forgotten what you said about ambitious men attempting to shape the gods to serve their own ends. And I do not think you would disagree with what Jagrati said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t. But that does not give her the right to become a monster, treating the lives of others as playthings to be stolen or destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it tells us something about how the monster was made,\u201d Amrita said. \u201cAnd perhaps we must take some responsibility for it.\u201d She frowned a little. \u201cThere was a sadhu in Galanka when I was a girl, a holy man who had renounced all things of the world, who refused to shun the untouchables. I wonder if he is still there, and if there are others like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeshua ben Yosef went among folk you would reckon unclean and tended to them,\u201d I offered. It was one of the things Aleksei had taught me. \u201cLepers, beggars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did your D\u2019Angeline gods when they passed through Bhodistan. I remember my father discussing it with an ambassador, for he sent me away when he caught me listening.\u201d She sat upright and began winding her hair into a knot. \u201cI have been thinking, trying to make sense of our failure, Moirin. Five men slain, and for nothing! I was certain that the gods sent you to me for a reason\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I, my lady,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I am so very sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d Amrita touched my lips again, gently this time. \u201cLet me finish, young goddess. I was also certain that I knew the reason, that it was to rid the world of the Falconer and his Spider Queen. But perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps that was not it at all, and Jagrati\u2019s harsh words were part of the message I was meant to hear. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I gazed at her beautiful face, my heart feeling very full. \u201cMy lady Amrita, I cannot say. I only know for sure that if I were a Bhodistani god with a message of compassion to deliver, I could choose no one better in the world than you to hear it. However.....\u201d I glanced toward the balcony, and saw that it was fully dark outside. \u201cThere is still the matter of the Falconer\u2019s assassins, and I think it would be best if you went to the hidden room now, and we talk more in the morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou will be all right?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI have Ravindra\u2019s bells to warn me, and the twilight to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Amrita smiled. \u201cI hope your sleep is peaceful.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled back at her. \u201cI daresay it will be.\u201d</p><p>For a mercy, it was. After I had helped Amrita dress and seen her safely into the custody of her guardsmen, I returned to my bed, which smelled of flowers, spices, and love-making. The bright lady was pleased, and so was I. I didn\u2019t think Amrita understood how great a gift she had given me. It wasn\u2019t just that she had quenched the fire of yearning that Kamadeva\u2019s diamond had ignited in me. I was Naamah\u2019s child, and I needed love and aye, pleasure, almost as much as food and water.</p><p>Until tonight, I hadn\u2019t known how starved I was.</p><p>Tomorrow, I thought, I would consult my diadh-anam and pray to every god I knew that I could figure out what to do about Bao, the bedamned Jagrati, and Kamadeva\u2019s bedamned diamond.</p><p>Tonight, I would sleep and be grateful for the profound gift I had been given.</p> <p>And so I did, deep and dreamless, wrapped in the lingering grace of Naamah\u2019s approval..... until I awoke in the small hours of the night with my diadh-anam blazing like wildfire, and a shadowy figure in the bedchamber with me, the length of a staff strapped across its back.</p><p>I sat up and stared. \u201cBao?\u201d</p><p>SIXTY-FOUR</p><p>Shh!\u201d In the space of a heartbeat, the shadowy figure crossed the room and fell upon me, pinning me to the bed and clamping one callused hand over my mouth, setting the point of a dagger at my throat.</p><p>Bao.</p><p>It was Bao.</p> <p>I stared up at him, scared and bewildered. I should have known. I should have felt him coming; but my awareness had been too entangled, first by Kamadeva\u2019s diamond, then by Amrita\u2019s loving kindness and Naamah\u2019s grace.</p><p>\u201cI need to know!\u201d Bao hissed at me, his eyes wild and shimmering, his expression desperate. \u201cWho are you? What are you? Why are you here?\u201d He prodded the hollow of my throat with the tip of his dagger. \u201cWhat happened to Moirin?\u201d</p><p>I tried to reply, but his hand muffled my words.</p><p>Realizing it, he frowned. \u201cPromise you won\u2019t scream?\u201d The dagger prodded me again in warning.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Bao removed his hand from my mouth. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, and then another. \u201cGods bedamned, Bao!\u201d I hissed back at him. \u201cIt\u2019s me! And if you will not believe the proof of your eyes and the proof of my diadh-anam inside you, I do not know what else to say! I\u2019ve spent the last year of my life following you halfway around the world, while you\u2019ve been marrying Tatar princesses whose fathers betrayed us both, and falling under the spell of the bedamned Spider Queen, and do you know what? I\u2019m very, very tired of it, you stupid, stubborn boy!\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cMoirin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Bao stood, swaying a little. \u201cHow.....?\u201d</p><p>I sat up and kindled a lamp. \u201cI told you, it was the Vralian priests. They had chains that bound my magic. It took me a long time to escape.\u201d</p><p>His throat worked. \u201cI thought.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said softly. \u201cBut it was a lie. It was always a lie. I\u2019m here. It\u2019s me. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Bao glanced around, still swaying; and I realized there was something wrong with him beyond the influence of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond. He blinked at me again. \u201cMoirin, why does it smell of sex in here?\u201d</p><p>And then he collapsed, sparing me the need for a reply.</p><p>Much of what passed immediately afterward is blurred in my memory. I know I went to the door of my bedchamber, rattling Ravindra\u2019s warning bells and summoning guards. The palace roused quickly, already on high alert. A pair of guards shifted Bao from the floor of my chamber into my bed.</p><p>He was weak, sweating, and racked with tremors.</p><p>Nonetheless, Hasan Dar insisted on questioning him. \u201cDid you come as one of Tarik Khaga\u2019s assassins?\u201d he asked in a hard voice. \u201cDid you come to kill her highness the Rani Amrita Sukhyhim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bao shook his head, lolling it from side to side. \u201cNo, I said I would, but it was a lie. I do not wish your Rani or anyone else dead. I only wanted to find out about Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you gain entrance to the palace and Lady Moirin\u2019s chambers?\u201d Hasan Dar demanded.</p><p>\u201cVaulted the wall.\u201d Bao made a listless gesture in the direction of my balcony. \u201cClimbed a tree in the garden, tied a rope, swung, and jumped there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe trained as an acrobat for many years,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Bao nodded, closing his eyes and shuddering. It must have taken almost all of his flagging strength to accomplish the feat.</p><p>I could feel his diadh-anam inside him, and it was stronger and clearer than it had been, calling to mine. Whatever ailed him, it was an affliction of the body, not the spirit. I felt at his brow. Despite the sheen of sweat, his skin didn\u2019t feel fever-hot. \u201cAre you ill?\u201d I asked him. \u201cIs it the mountain-sickness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gave another lolling shake of his head. \u201cOpium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpium causes this?\u201d I was unsure. \u201cWhy were you smoking opium?\u201d</p><p>Bao opened his eyes and grimaced at me. \u201cTo dull the pain of thinking you were dead, Moirin! They grow it in Kurugiri; it\u2019s everywhere. But I stopped after seeing you in the meadow, because I had to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Hasan Dar caught Bao by the front of his tunic, yanking him partially upright. \u201cIf that\u2019s what ails you, you\u2019ll live,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to die for a few days, but you\u2019ll live. Tell me, are there other assassins coming?\u201d He gave Bao a shake. \u201cTell me everything you know!\u201d</p><p>I winced, but I couldn\u2019t blame him. My lady Amrita\u2019s life was at stake, and mayhap Ravindra\u2019s, too. \u201cPlease, tell him anything that might help, Bao,\u201d I said. \u201cTrust me, you definitely don\u2019t want the Rani Amrita\u2019s death on your conscience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you and royal ladies?\u201d he complained, squinting at me. I had the urge to shake him myself, but Hasan Dar did it for me. \u201cAll right, all right! One moment! It is not urgent yet.\u201d Bao gestured feebly toward the north. \u201cThey will wait a few days until they\u2019re sure I failed, then they will send another. Not one you expect. Divyesh Patel is his name, and he will come by day. His weapon is poison.\u201d</p><p>Hasan Dar lowered him. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Bao managed to nod. \u201cPut a guard on your stores now. Alert your kitchen staff. Don\u2019t let them admit any strangers, don\u2019t let them serve any food or drink that hasn\u2019t been under lock and key. Sooner or later, Divyesh will approach one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will do better than that!\u201d Hasan Dar looked thunderous. \u201cI will personally taste every dish that is prepared for their highnesses until this poisoner is caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, my friend.\u201d Amrita had entered the room unannounced, attended by several more guards. She looked ashen, but resolved. \u201cI brought this danger on myself, and I will not allow you to risk yourself. I will taste my own dishes, and Ravindra\u2019s, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighness\u2014\u201d her commander protested.</p><p>She raised one hand, silencing him. Reluctantly, he acquiesced with a bow. She frowned at Bao. \u201cIt is the opium-sickness that ails him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he says,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Amrita glanced sidelong at me, raising her brows. \u201cI take it you did not sense his presence as he approached this time.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. Kamadeva\u2019s diamond, and..... well.\u201d I could not say aloud that the overwhelming relief of Naamah\u2019s grace had distracted me even from the approach of my own divided diadh-anam, but it had. \u201cNo, my lady, I did not.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quirked. \u201cI will send for the physician, eh? Perhaps there is something that may help your Bao through the worst of the pangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be good,\u201d Bao said through gritted teeth, shivering violently. \u201cThank you, highness.\u201d</p><p>Roused from sleep, the bleary-eyed physician came to examine Bao and confirmed it was opium-sickness. \u201cVery little will help, I fear,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cGive him peppermint tea to soothe his stomach when the vomiting begins. Beyond that.....\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYour system must cleanse itself, young man. How long has it been since last you took opium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days,\u201d Bao muttered. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>The physician patted his shoulder helpfully. \u201cExpect to feel like dying for a few more, then. But it will pass.\u201d</p><p>After ordering a second bed brought into my chamber, as well as clean linen and sleeping attire for Bao, who was sweating through his woolen tunic and breeches, the Rani Amrita returned to the hidden room with her escort of guards.</p><p>She took me aside, first. \u201cI must admit, I feel a bit foolish, Moirin,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIf you had known your Bao was coming, I would not have made the offer I did, nor would you have accepted it, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I am glad I did not know,\u201d I said honestly.</p><p>\u201cYou do not mean that!\u201d Amrita admonished me. I smiled at her. She tilted her head and reconsidered, flushing slightly, not entirely displeased. \u201cOr..... perhaps you do, eh?\u201d</p><p>I touched her cheek and stroked it gently, letting my fingertips linger against her skin. \u201cOut of the kindness of your heart, you gave me a very great gift, my lady, and Naamah\u2019s blessing is on you because of it. I hope you are not sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot sorry, no.\u201d</p><p>I smiled again. \u201cWell, then. Nor am I.\u201d</p><p>This time, Amrita smiled back at me, looking tired and worn and beautiful. \u201cYou are more than a little bit of a bad girl, Moirin. Go and tend to your bad boy. I think you must deserve one another.\u201d</p><p>When she had gone, I turned back to find Bao regarding me with half-lidded eyes, dark crescents glinting in the lamplight. \u201cHa!\u201d he said. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>I pointed a finger at him. \u201cYou do not have leave for blame, my stubborn boy. You let Jagrati make you her toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw it. Only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly my lady Amrita refused to allow it.\u201d I knelt on the bed beside him, tugging at his sweat-sodden tunic. \u201cSo. If nothing else, we have established that I have far better taste in royal ladies than you do. Although I must say, your wife Erdene still loves you, and she proved helpful in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d Bao smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I tugged harder, to no avail. \u201cLift your arms, won\u2019t you? Else I\u2019ll have to summon Hasan Dar to aid me.\u201d</p><p>Bao shifted obligingly and lifted his arms, and at last I was able to ease his soaked tunic over his head, removing it.</p><p>I caught my breath.</p><p>There were new markings on his corded forearms\u2014fresh, stark, and unfamiliar. Vivid black tattoos inked onto his skin in a complicated zig-zag pattern that forked like lightning, each turning marked with a symbol in a strange alphabet. Remembering old tales, I wondered if they were part of some charm or spell that further bound him to the Spider Queen.</p><p>I traced the pattern. \u201cBao? What is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He glanced at his forearms. \u201cOh, that.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt is the path through the maze to Kurugiri, Moirin.\u201d He lifted his right arm a fraction. \u201cThis way is up.\u201d He let it fall, and lifted the left. \u201cAnd this is down.\u201d An involuntary shudder racked him. \u201cDo you think it will be helpful?\u201d</p><p>I kissed him, reckoning it was best done before the vomiting began. My diadh-anam sang happily within me, reunited with its missing half.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cOh, yes!\u201d</p><p>SIXTY-FIVE</p><p>Bao was miserable for days.</p><p>He trembled and shook, racked by bone-deep pains. He tossed and turned and sweated, unable to find ease, unable to sleep. There was vomiting and worse, as though his body sought to expel every foreign substance within it along with the dregs of the opium he had smoked for months.</p><p>It was perhaps the most spectacularly unromantic lovers\u2019 reunion in the annals of history.</p><p>Still, he had done something no one else had ever done. He had walked away from the Spider Queen and Kamadeva\u2019s diamond of his own will, breaking the spell that bound him to her.</p><p>And he had brought the secret of the path to Kurugiri with him.</p><p>Hasan Dar was cautiously elated. The entire palace remained on high alert, watching for the Falconer\u2019s elusive poisoner. Guards in civilian clothes were posted over every storeroom, watched over every well, accompanied the Rani\u2019s cooks to the market. Meanwhile, the commander took counsel with the Rani and her clever son, trying to forge a plan that would take advantage of the maze\u2019s key.</p><p>Bao\u2019s presence was kept a secret that we might not alert our enemies to his betrayal. Let Tarik Khaga and Jagrati think he had failed, that he had been captured or slain, and the nature of his tattoos remained a mystery.</p><p>In between bouts of agony, Bao told Hasan Dar everything he knew about Kurugiri\u2019s vulnerabilities.</p><p>Some of the news was good. Due to the stronghold\u2019s apparent unassailability, the Falconer didn\u2019t maintain anything like an army, relying instead on his impenetrable maze and over a dozen skilled assassins.</p><p>The bad news was that the path was narrow and twisting, filled with switchbacks and blinds in which assassins could lurk alone or in pairs and defend the path against an oncoming army. Superior numbers would prevail in the end, but gaining the peak would come at a steep cost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And the Spider Queen and Kamadeva\u2019s diamond awaited at the top, a danger not to be underestimated a second time.</p><p>Throughout his ordeal, I tended to Bao and did my best to ease his suffering. The Rani\u2019s physician was right, nothing really helped, but at least I could change his sweat-soaked linens and clothing, give him peppermint tea to drink, and see that his chamberpot was exchanged for a clean one\u2014the cursed Jagrati\u2019s harsh words on the matter of human ordure ringing in my ears as the latter task was accomplished.</p><p>My lady Amrita was right. I did not disagree with what Jagrati had said. The stench of ordure could be washed away. It was foul deeds that made a person unclean.</p> <p>Amrita visited several times a day, bringing Ravindra with her that he might witness Bao\u2019s suffering and appreciate it as a cautionary tale, lest opium tempt him one day. I was not entirely sure it worked, for despite Bao\u2019s obvious misery, Ravindra was more interested in and awed by his feat of swinging from the branch of a sprawling banyan tree in the garden to gain my balcony.</p><p>\u201cThat was a very long leap, Bao-ji,\u201d he said with respect.</p><p>\u201cHeh.\u201d Bao flashed a grin at him, the first one I\u2019d seen from him since he arrived. \u201cI know, highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you afraid of falling?\u201d Ravindra inquired.</p><p>Bao scoffed. \u201cI never fall.\u201d</p> <p>Amrita shook her head in mild despair. \u201cI fear he is not such a very good influence, your bad boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I ruffled Bao\u2019s damp hair. \u201cBut he seldom boasts in vain.\u201d</p><p>Despite her gentle teasing, it was clear that Amrita too was kindly disposed toward Bao, solicitous of his suffering, and grateful for the warning and incredibly valuable information he brought.</p><p>Bao liked her, too. \u201cBetter be careful, Moirin,\u201d he murmured after their first visit. \u201cYour White Queen, she will be jealous of that one.\u201d</p><p>I winced in unexpected pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He searched my face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, was that cruel to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I dipped a clean cloth in a basin of cool water, wiping the sweat from his forehead. \u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d The words brought a lump to my throat, but I forced them out anyway. \u201cI learned in Vralia that Jehanne died giving birth to a daughter.\u201d</p><p>He caught his breath in a sharp hiss. \u201cOh, Moirin! I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my thanks. \u201cYou always liked her, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Bao smiled a little. \u201cShe did whatever pleased her, and never apologized for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Jagrati?\u201d I asked carefully.</p><p>His face clouded. \u201cI do not want to talk about her yet. After all, you haven\u2019t told me half of what happened to you in Vralia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor will I, until you\u2019re recovered.\u201d I wrung out the cloth. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not like her,\u201d Bao said after a time. \u201cYour Jehanne, she was not angry at the world. There was no hatred in her, only much passion. Also, she saved you from that conceited Lord Lion Mane,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd she gave much honor to Master Lo. So yes, I liked her, and I am very sorry she is gone.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to ask him more about Jagrati, but it would wait until he was ready. And I had not told him the whole truth about Vralia yet, because I was afraid it would send him into a fury that would delay his recovery. My stubborn peasant-boy and I had a great deal to talk about.</p><p>For now I was just glad to have him back.</p><p>On the fourth day after Bao\u2019s arrival, two things happened\u2014both of them good, for once. The first was that the worst of the opium-sickness seemed to have passed, leaving Bao weary and drawn, but no longer racked with pains or afflicted by sweating, nausea, and worse.</p><p>I was grateful.</p><p>The second thing was that Hasan Dar\u2019s disguised guards had caught the poisoner Divyesh Patel.</p><p>Thanks to Bao\u2019s advice, they had been on the lookout for any strangers selling edible goods in the markets of Bhaktipur\u2014and that was exactly what they found. One slight, nondescript, unprepossessing fellow who approached the Rani\u2019s kitchen staff with an enticing offer of fresh-caught river fish, plump and gleaming.</p><p>The Rani\u2019s staff dickered.</p><p>The slight fellow smiled when they came to accord, handing over his fish.</p><p>I daresay it took him by surprise when Hasan Dar\u2019s guards seized him, discreetly pushing up his sleeves to look for the tell-tale markings of tattoos on his forearms. By all accounts, Divyesh Patel did not fight or protest when they hustled him away. He was an assassin, not a warrior, and poison was his weapon.</p><p>My lady Amrita asked Bao to confirm his identity, and although he was a bit shaky on his feet, he did.</p><p>The little poisoner paled when he saw him in the throne room. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Bao agreed.</p><p>Divyesh Patel was indignant. \u201cYou betrayed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bao said softly. \u201cI traded a lie for the truth.\u201d He glanced at the Rani Amrita and her son, Ravindra. \u201cThere are two kinds of men in Kurugiri, highnesses. Those who sought to serve with their killing arts, and those caught in her web through no fault of their own. This one.....\u201d He gestured at the poisoner. \u201cHe is one of the former.\u201d</p><p>Amrita twined and steepled her fingers in a complex mudra, one that inspired trust. \u201cIs that true?\u201d she asked the fellow gently. \u201cI beg of you, do not fear to answer. No one is beyond redemption.\u201d</p><p>The little poisoner coughed, bending over double and bringing his fist to his mouth. Bao swore and spun into action, his staff a blur as it swept in a horizontal arc. Something went flying and clattered on the floor. Bao\u2019s staff caught Divyesh Patel behind the knees, upending him. Before anyone else had a chance to react, he had the butt of his staff poised to crush the assassin\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat.....?\u201d Amrita was on her feet, her voice trembling slightly. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d I moved quickly to her side and she took my arm, her nails digging into my skin in an effort to maintain her composure. With her free arm, she held Ravindra close to her side.</p><p>\u201cPoison dart, I believe,\u201d Hasan Dar said grimly, holding up the object that had gone flying, a hollow tube.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods!\u201d She shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to kill this one?\u201d Bao inquired.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The Rani\u2019s commander gestured to his guards to form a protective line between Amrita and the assassin. \u201cNot until I\u2019ve had a chance to question him at length.\u201d</p><p>Pinned beneath Bao\u2019s staff, Divyesh Patel flailed suddenly, his hands scrabbling at his throat. Bao swore again and gave him a sharp jab in the chest, but it was too late. The assassin hadn\u2019t been trying to escape. There was a pin-prick of blood on the side of his throat, and a tiny needle jutted from a ring on his right forefinger.</p><p>He\u2019d taken his own life.</p><p>Whatever it was, the poison acted quickly. The fellow jerked once, then stiffened. A little froth came to his lips, and his eyes rolled back in his head.</p><p>\u201cIs he..... dead?\u201d Ravindra whispered.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Bao prodded the corpse with his staff, then glanced at Hasan Dar. \u201cBetter you cut his throat and make sure. He knows lots of poisons, this one. Maybe even one that makes it only look like he\u2019s dead.\u201d He leaned on his staff and exhaled hard, grinning wearily. \u201cLot of action for my first day out of bed.\u201d</p><p>Ravindra gazed at him with shining eyes. \u201cI think you just saved my mother\u2019s life, Bao-ji!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you did,\u201d Amrita agreed. Releasing my arm, she approached Bao and took his left hand in both of hers, pressing it warmly. \u201cThank you very much indeed for your swift and courageous action.\u201d</p><p>Under her lustrous regard, my incorrigible peasant-boy actually blushed. \u201cYou are welcome, highness.\u201d He shuffled his feet. \u201cI hate poisoners. One of them killed me, you know. And..... I fear you are only in danger because of Moirin and me. So I will do anything I can to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am grateful for it,\u201d she said gravely, pressing his hand once more.</p><p>His blush deepened.</p><p>I raised my brows and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bao scowled at me. \u201cDon\u2019t smirk at me, Moirin. We have a lot of work to do if we\u2019re going to figure out how to save the Rani and her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my hero,\u201d I said. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>SIXTY-SIX</p><p>Around and around we went, trying to conceive of a plan that would get us up the path to Kurugiri without sustaining untenable losses, and deal with the problem of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond at the top.</p><p>Hasan Dar, Amrita, and Ravindra hadn\u2019t had any success, the latter chastened and made uncertain by the failure of his first plan.</p><p>Bao\u2019s knowledge was helpful, but it didn\u2019t eliminate the obstacles facing us. I listened as he discussed the treacherous path with Hasan Dar, sketching out the likeliest places for assassins to lay in waiting on a map based on his tattoos.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that they will always have the higher ground,\u201d he said. \u201cSee, here, here, and here. We will always be coming around blind corners, where they can pick us off one by one.\u201d</p><p>I thought of an offer I had made Snow Tiger once when we faced an ambush\u2014and a warning my mother had given me. \u201cUnless they can\u2019t see us,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Bao gave me a sharp look. \u201cYour twilight.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, Moirin. I will not risk you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not like it either,\u201d Amrita said unhappily.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she talking about?\u201d Hasan Dar asked, bewildered.</p><p>It was easier to show him than explain. I had them close their eyes and summoned the twilight, wrapping it around Bao and me, then letting it fade before their open eyes. Ravindra and Hasan Dar stared in awe; the Rani Amrita, who had seen me call the twilight before, just looked worried.</p><p>\u201cAnd you could kill a man thus concealed?\u201d her commander asked. \u201cOr Bao could?\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s words echoed in my thoughts. It is a grave gift and one never to be used lightly. Only to sustain life. Do you ever use it for sport or any idle cause, it will be stripped from you.</p><p>Snow Tiger\u2019s, too, her voice gentle and firm as she refused my offer. What you suggest is dishonorable.</p><p>But when I glanced at Amrita\u2019s beautiful, worried face and her son\u2019s thin, clever one, I knew I was willing to take the risk. \u201cI could. I cannot speak for Bao.\u201d</p><p>Bao frowned, fidgeting with the bands of steel that reinforced his bamboo fighting-staff. \u201cI would have no trouble killing those men who serve them willingly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are assassins who kill by stealth, and it is fitting that they should die thus. But I would not like to kill those who were trapped as I was.\u201d</p><p>In the end, it remained a moot point, for we could devise no plan for dealing with Kamadeva\u2019s diamond.</p><p>\u201cI could accompany you,\u201d Amrita said quietly. \u201cI am not affected by it, at least not with Jagrati wielding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Four voices spoke in emphatic unison.</p><p>Bao reckoned we had a few more days\u2019 grace before the Falconer and the Spider Queen decided that Divyesh Patel had failed and sent a new assassin in his place. After our initial attempts at group strategy failed, Bao suggested in private that he and I go alone. Since my diadh-anam had been twinned, I could hold him in the twilight as easily as myself. If I could hold it long enough, the two of us alone could approach Kurugiri without ever being seen, without alerting the Falconer\u2019s assassins.</p><p>\u201cWe could steal Kamadeva\u2019s diamond rather than take it by force,\u201d he mused, stroking my hair.</p><p>Lying in his arms, I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t trust myself around it. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bao admitted. \u201cHere, with you..... yes. I walked away from it once. But.....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Jagrati got me to betray myself utterly, Bao?\u201d I shuddered. \u201cWhat if she sent me against my lady Amrita and her son? I can summon the twilight. I know where the hidden room is located.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are rather deadly with a bow,\u201d he added. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d He toyed with my hair, which had grown out well below my shoulders, but was still much shorter than it had been. \u201cWhy did you cut it, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d</p><p>His brows furrowed. \u201cWhose was it?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, I told Bao the whole of what had befallen me after the Great Khan\u2019s betrayal\u2014the journey and the whole long, awful ordeal in Vralia, the chafing chains that bound my spirit as surely as my flesh, the Patriarch and his incessant demands that I confess the litany of my sins, Luba and her shears, cold water, and lye, the endless scrubbing of the temple floor, my knees aching, the ever-present threat of being stoned to death.</p><p>I wept.</p><p>Bao held me. \u201cI could kill them ten times over for that!\u201d he said fiercely, his breath warm against my temple. \u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sniffled and laughed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t ever want to go back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you escape?\u201d</p><p>I told him about Valentina and Aleksei, although not the part about Aleksei and Naamah\u2019s blessing.</p><p>Bao suspected it anyway, regarding me with a wry look. \u201cI swear, Moirin, you fall in love as easily as other people fall out of a boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>None too gently, I tugged on a hank of his longish hair. \u201cWhy did you let it grow? I thought it gave enemies a handhold in combat.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away. I withdrew a little, propping myself on one elbow and watching his face, watching Bao decide whether or not he was ready to talk about his time in Kurugiri. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe liked it that way,\u201d he said eventually.</p><p>\u201cJagrati?\u201d I asked softly. Bao nodded, a muscle in his jaw twitching. \u201cWas it terrible there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said after another long silence. \u201cOr maybe it was. I don\u2019t know how to talk about it. I was in a terrible place inside myself while I was there, thinking you were dead, thinking I had only myself to blame for it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt was a strange place. So much opulence, so much stolen treasure, hidden away in a stark fortress. Between her spell and the opium, it seems like a fever-dream now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you get there?\u201d I wanted to keep him talking.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cauldron that hangs on a chain and a winch from a plateau above the trail,\u201d Bao said. \u201cI heard about it during my journey there. I petitioned Tarik Khaga to take me into his service. A day later, someone came to blindfold me and lead me through the maze. I thought.....\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cThere is a kind of honor among thieves and thugs when it comes to the rules of combat. I thought perhaps there was among assassins, too. When I was granted an audience, I said I had come to claim you. I offered to fight any man among them for the right to take you away with me.\u201d He gave me a sidelong look. \u201cStupid plan, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than none,\u201d I said. \u201cSo Jagrati ensorceled you instead?\u201d</p><p>Bao shook his head. \u201cNot right away, no. My story, our story..... it wasn\u2019t what she expected. It intrigued her. She\u2019s the one who rules Kurugiri, you know. Not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI saw.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo.\u201d He blew out his breath. \u201cNo one had ever attempted to rescue someone they had taken before. She thought it was a piece of irony that the only living soul to do so had come on a fool\u2019s errand. She wanted me to know it. She let me search to my heart\u2019s content, questioning anyone I liked. She even gave me access to the harem. And there was no trace of you anywhere. By the end of the first day, I knew it must be true. The Great Khan had killed you, and sent me away in vain.\u201d</p><p>I stroked Bao\u2019s arm, not knowing what to say.</p><p>He glanced at the vivid zig-zag markings on his skin. \u201cThen she unveiled Kamadeva\u2019s diamond. I didn\u2019t even care by that time. I was drowning in despair. Might as well drown in false desire and opium instead. And there were fights there, lots of fights. It suited my mood. I\u2019d lost Master Lo, and then I\u2019d lost you. The only two people I ever truly loved. I\u2019d died a hero, and wasted the life that was given back to me on stupid choices. Running away from you, marrying Erdene. I didn\u2019t care if I got killed again.\u201d</p><p>I took a long, deep breath. \u201cI am very, very glad that you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Bao fell quiet once more.</p><p>I waited a while before prompting him. \u201cSo the Falconer\u2019s assassins quarrel amongst themselves?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d The muscle in his jaw twitched again. \u201cSometimes Jagrati would choose a favorite and keep him for days on end. Other times, she liked for us to fight for the honor of her favors. To the death, if she was in a foul mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say about that, either.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019d been there when I felt something change,\u201d Bao mused, touching his chest. \u201cYou, your spark was back, only it was all tangled with opium dreams and the spell of that cursed diamond, and I didn\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI felt the same way the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand, then.\u201d He looked relieved. \u201cJagrati does not like to lose what is hers. I do not know if she suspected the truth, but she set out to convince me that it must be a lie of some foul magic. And..... I believed it. Because I was so very sure you were dead, and it had been so very long.\u201d Bao shook his head. \u201cWhen I died, even though it was only minutes or hours, it seemed to me that days passed in Fengdu, in the spirit world. You had been gone for months. Whatever had come back, it couldn\u2019t be Moirin. The other day in the meadow, I would gladly have killed the thing wearing your face.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cAnd I am very, very glad that you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Bao shuddered, too. \u201cSo am I. I am quite sure it would have driven me mad. But..... then I began to doubt.\u201d He touched his chest again. \u201cYour spark, I\u2019d felt it calling to mine in the meadow. I had to know the truth. And the rest, you know.\u201d He turned to regard me, a rare vulnerability behind his eyes. \u201cDo you hate me for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cOf course not! You crossed the Abode of the Gods to find me, you dared the Falcon in his eyrie and the Spider Queen in her lair. It wasn\u2019t your fault it was all a lie. As for the rest.....\u201d I smiled ruefully. \u201cYou saw how vulnerable I was to Kamadeva\u2019s diamond. How can I blame you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d Bao smiled a little. \u201cDesire. It is a particular weakness of yours, Moirin.\u201d He laid one hand on my cheek, cupping it. \u201cAnd a particular strength, too.\u201d</p><p>I leaned upward to kiss his lips in reply, softly, lightly. It felt like enough for now. Enough to feel his diadh-anam entwine blissfully with mine. Naamah\u2019s gift did not often counsel patience, but in these days, it did. The shadow of the Spider Queen lay between us, and there was too much yet to be done.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Bao cleared his throat. \u201cShall we speak of your royal lady? I must admit, I\u2019d rather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d I said to him.</p><p>The acerbic glint returned to his eyes, familiar and welcome. \u201cIt seems I\u2019ve heard those words before. Only this time, there isn\u2019t a dragon to blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I traced my finger down the strong column of his throat, letting my fingertip rest in the hollow, feeling the sturdy beat of his pulse. \u201cBut there is a diamond, which left me much disturbed; and my lady Amrita does not like to see anyone suffer. Out of the goodness of her heart, she has shown me many kindnesses.\u201d I kissed him again. \u201cThat was one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rani must care for you very much to have endured such a hardship,\u201d Bao said in a grave tone.</p><p>I thumped his chest with the heel of my hand. \u201cYou are insufferable!\u201d</p><p>He laughed; and I could not help but be glad, dizzyingly glad, that despite everything that had happened, despite everything that had befallen us, despite the dangers and challenges we yet faced, laughter endured.</p><p>I had a feeling there would be precious little of it in the days to come.</p><p>SIXTY-SEVEN</p><p>I was right.</p><p>The next gambit from Kurugiri came sooner than expected, and it drove any thought of laughter or levity far, far from anyone\u2019s mind.</p><p>We were in another interminable counsel session in which no progress was made and everyone was miserable and frustrated. The problem of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond remained. Our young strategist Ravindra pushed chess pieces fruitlessly around the board. Hasan Dar pored over the maps he had drawn based on Bao\u2019s information\u2014a fairly detailed map of the path and an outline of the fortress itself. Having exhausted his stores of knowledge, Bao had little left to offer. Amrita was quiet and worried, and I daresay I was much the same.</p><p>For a brief moment, it was almost a relief when one of the guardsmen interrupted the meeting.</p><p>\u201cHasan-ji,\u201d he said tentatively to his commander. \u201cYou said to report anything strange?\u201d</p><p>The commander\u2019s handsome head came up. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the night-soil collectors,\u201d the guard said in an apologetic tone. \u201cThe bucket-men. I am quite sure six came at dawn, but it seems to me only five have departed.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt has been some time now.\u201d</p><p>Bao tensed. \u201cThat is not good,\u201d he said quietly to Hasan Dar. \u201cIt is how Jagrati stole Kamadeva\u2019s diamond from the temple in the first place. It is a ploy any man serving her might use. Usually you pay no attention to those you deem beneath notice. One is now loose in the palace.\u201d</p><p>Hasan Dar swore and pounded the table with his fist, jarring Ravindra\u2019s chess pieces out of place. \u201cIn broad light of day again! Damn them. Go.\u201d He pointed at Bao. \u201cTake the Rani and her son and your dakini to the hidden room.\u201d His voice turned grim. \u201cGuard them well while we search. You seem to have a knack for it.\u201d</p><p>Bao inclined his head, no words of assent needed. We fled, Hasan Dar uttering curt orders behind us.</p><p>The concealed doorway to the hidden room was located on a landing between the first and second floors of the palace. At night, it was guarded discreetly from above and below. During the day, it was guarded not at all, the better to protect its secret. Since he had saved my lady Amrita from the poisoner, Bao had been entrusted with the secret of the hidden room. Other than Bao and me, only the guards and the Rani\u2019s most trusted attendants knew of its existence.</p><p>Even so, I felt the space between my shoulder blades itch and tingle at the thought of an assassin loose in the palace.</p><p>Bao drew back the tapestry of the goddess Durga riding a tiger, throwing open the hidden doorway. \u201cGo quick! Hurry, hurry!\u201d</p><p>Amrita went first, towing a stumbling Ravindra behind her. I followed them into the steep, narrow stairway. Behind me, Bao closed the door and shot the bolt, following close on my heels. I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Safe, I thought.</p><p>This time I was wrong.</p><p>In the forest, in the green, wild spaces I knew so well, I might have sensed the fellow awaiting us, sensed his presence, sensed his intention. Not here, where my senses were confounded by thick marble and man-made space. Trapped in the stairwell, I couldn\u2019t even see.</p><p>All I heard was my lady Amrita\u2019s gasp as the assassin fell on her. One gasp, quickly choked.</p><p>Ahead of me, Ravindra.</p><p>Acting on panicked instinct, I drew a deep breath into my lungs, summoning the twilight with it. I blew it out, wrapping it around the boy and myself.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Ravindra even noticed. Without hesitation, the boy gave a piercing shout and flung himself against the man attempting to garrote his mother, a cord wrapped tight around her throat and throttling her. Ravindra sank his teeth into the assassin\u2019s hand, biting him hard and deep.</p><p>Bao had said it felt like being touched by a ghost. I could not imagine what it felt like to be bitten by one.</p><p>The assassin howled, dropping his garrote and glancing around in terror.</p><p>Scrambling out of the stairwell, I expanded my cloak of twilight and swirled it around Amrita, and the assassin released her with an involuntary hiss.</p><p>\u201cMoirin!\u201d Bao shouted behind me. \u201cGet them out of the way, get them safe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, come, come!\u201d I whispered urgently, tugging them both to the farthest corner of the small room. Ravindra was trembling with a mix of fear and fury, and Amrita with shock, touching her abraded throat. I wrapped my arms around them both, praying I could keep them safe in the twilight, praying Bao could protect us all. In the twilight, I could actually sense the presence of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond in the distance as though it were another kind of diadh-anam, a god\u2019s bright spirit turned to malevolent purpose.</p><p>Bao sidled warily into the room, his staff held in a defensive pose; and that alone told me his opponent was good.</p><p>\u201cTraitor!\u201d The fellow spat on the ground. He had regained his composure in remarkable time. \u201cI should have killed you in Kurugiri.\u201d His hands snatched at his belt, and in the blink of an eye, he had throwing knives fanned like playing cards in his left hand, and one poised to throw in his right. The blades twinkled like stars in the twilight. He bared his teeth in a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll enjoy doing it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Bao feinted at him.</p><p>A flurry of glittering blades flew from the assassin\u2019s hands, one after another, quicker than the eye could follow. Bao\u2019s staff whirled, making the air whistle, and then he hurled himself sideways out of the knives\u2019 path in a horizontal spinning move that didn\u2019t seem humanly possible, landing with his battle-grin in place.</p><p>\u201cGot more?\u201d he asked insolently.</p><p>Unfortunately, the assassin did. He flicked a blade low, forcing Bao to parry it awkwardly, and then flicked another blade high at his unguarded face.</p><p>Amrita gave a low cry of dismay, and I tightened my arms around her and her son, fearing for all of us.</p><p>But Bao was already in motion, flinging himself backward onto the floor and rolling in a somersault. Instead of coming up into a fighting stance, he stayed in a low crouch, his staff sweeping along the floor to strike hard at the assassin\u2019s ankles while another flurry of blades flew harmlessly over his head to clatter against the wall.</p><p>The blow didn\u2019t knock the fellow off his feet, but it staggered him; and in a heartbeat, Bao was up. The fellow caught himself before Bao could strike, a lone throwing knife held up in warning.</p><p>\u201cHeh.\u201d Bao\u2019s grin widened. \u201cLast one, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d The assassin\u2019s hand went to his belt again, scattering a handful of bright, sharp objects on the floor.</p><p>Bao glanced down and swore, then glanced up in time to jerk out of the way of the last blade as it flew through the air. For a moment, the men regarded each other. I didn\u2019t know what history lay between them, and I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to. \u201cYou\u2019re done,\u201d Bao said simply, shifting his staff into an offensive pose.</p><p>Without a word, the assassin turned and dashed for the balcony.</p><p>And the purpose of the objects he\u2019d thrown came clear as Bao went after him. They were shaped like a child\u2019s jack-toys, only larger, with long, wickedly sharp tines, forcing Bao to kick them out of the way or suffer a punctured foot. They didn\u2019t delay him long, but it was enough time for the fellow to gain the balcony and vault over it. In the garden far below, monkeys shrieked and chattered. Bao peered over the railing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it safe?\u201d I asked him, my voice shaking a little.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bao sounded subdued. I released the twilight, the daylit world returning in a rush. \u201cBest your highnesses do not look, though. It isn\u2019t pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d Ravindra asked fiercely.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Bao nodded. \u201cThis time, I am very certain, young highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gods!\u201d My lady Amrita\u2019s lovely voice was hoarse from her near-garroting, and there were tears in it. \u201cWe were supposed to be safe here! How did he find this room?\u201d Tears spilled from her eyes, streaking her face. \u201cI cannot believe any of my people would betray us willingly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama-ji, don\u2019t cry!\u201d Ravindra whispered, stroking her arm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they did, highness.\u201d Bao\u2019s tone was as gentle as I\u2019d ever heard it. \u201cNot willingly, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She met his sympathetic gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s worse, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cThat one\u2019s name was Zoka. If he has another, I never heard it. He was a bad man, highness, one of the worst. He liked to hurt people. I am afraid he may have hurt one of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no!\u201d The sorrow in Amrita\u2019s voice made my heart ache.</p><p>To everyone\u2019s sorrow, Bao was right.</p><p>Hasan Dar\u2019s guards found Zoka\u2019s victim in a linen storeroom in the servants\u2019 quarters. She was one of the Rani\u2019s trusted attendants, a sweet girl named Sameera who took pride in her hair-dressing skills and often sang as she worked. She couldn\u2019t have been much more than sixteen years old.</p><p>She was dead, garroted, the flesh of her slender throat swollen around the ligature mark.</p><p>And young Sameera had been tortured before she died. On her left hand, only her thumb and forefinger remained. The other three were bloody stumps with ragged bits of bone protruding from the fresh wounds. Three delicate severed fingers lay scattered on the floor of the storeroom.</p> <p>Although Hasan Dar begged Amrita not to look, she insisted on it. She looked for a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cPoor child,\u201d she murmured, stooping to touch the girl\u2019s maimed hand. \u201cYou tried to protect me, didn\u2019t you? You held out as long as you could.\u201d Raising the girl\u2019s hand to her lips, she kissed it. \u201cSurely, you will be reborn a warrior, my little brave heart.\u201d</p><p>I wiped tears from my eyes.</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>In the silence, the Rani Amrita stood. Twice in recent days, she had been frightened, badly frightened. Twice, she had nearly been killed.</p><p>Now she was angry.</p><p>I would not have thought my lovely, laughing lady Amrita could be terrible in her anger; but she was. There was a vein of dignity and quiet strength that ran deep beneath her kindness and charm, and this deed had tapped it.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Her voice rang, and her dark eyes flashed. \u201cThis is unacceptable. I will not remain a prisoner in my own palace, starting at shadows. I will not allow my people to be tortured and killed for their loyalty. No more fear, no more suffering. Enough. I do not care if we have not found the perfect plan. We are going to Kurugiri. I am going to Kurugiri. Once and for all, we will put an end to this!\u201d</p> <p>Ravindra swallowed hard, but he did not protest.</p><p>No one did.</p><p>I glanced at Bao, leaning on his staff. He nodded at me, promising whatever aid was required.</p><p>I glanced at Ravindra, thinking how I had flung the twilight around him.</p><p>I thought about Jagrati and Kamadeva\u2019s diamond, and how I had been able to sense them in the twilight.</p><p>I thought about how Amrita had placed herself between me and Jagrati in the meadow, her hands raised in a warding mudra, holding the Spider Queen herself at bay.</p><p>\u201cMy lady Amrita,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI think I know how to take Kamadeva\u2019s diamond out of play.\u201d</p><p>Filled with fierce determination, Amrita turned her lustrous gaze on me. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>SIXTY-EIGHT</p><p>No one loved the plan, and our young chess-master Ravindra liked it least of all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous, Mama-ji!\u201d he said in an unwontedly frightened tone. \u201cWhat if Moirin.....\u201d He made a helpless gesture. \u201cFalls victim again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I murmured. \u201cNot this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t,\u201d Amrita said with conviction. \u201cNot with Bao-ji at her side, not with me there. I will not allow it.\u201d</p><p>Bao met my gaze. \u201cIf we\u2019re to survive the maze, it will require your magic after all, Moirin\u2014even before we reach Kurugiri. There\u2019s no other way. We\u2019ll have to kill in stealth, you and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said steadily. \u201cAnd there is no honor in it. But I do believe that the stakes are high enough that the Maghuin Dhonn Herself will forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Ravindra\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, young highness,\u201d I said honestly to him. \u201cVery little in life is certain. But I am quite sure that if we navigate the maze, I can find Jagrati and encompass her in the twilight, rendering her and Kamadeva\u2019s diamond invisible for a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA time,\u201d he echoed.</p><p>\u201cA time is long enough for us to secure the fortress,\u201d Hasan Dar said in a pragmatic voice. \u201cThat is all we need. Once it is done, there will be too many of us for her to contend with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we have gained entrance to the fortress, she will make her stand in a smaller place.\u201d Bao pointed at the drawing of Kurugiri\u2019s layout. \u201cHere in the throne room is my guess. We will not be able to fit more than a score of men in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many can she control at once?\u201d Hasan Dar inquired. \u201cCan she force them to turn on their fellows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bao admitted. \u201cOnly that the compulsion to do her bidding is powerful, but it can be overridden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove.\u201d Bao glanced at me, eyes crinkling in a smile of rare sweetness. \u201cIt is a force strong enough that it allowed me to walk away from her. It allowed the Rani to protect Moirin. Kamadeva\u2019s diamond commands a powerful desire, but there is no love in Jagrati, only rage and hatred. So. I suggest you meditate on those you love, commander, and advise your men to do the same, whether it be their wives and sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, priests and mentors, or their love for and loyalty to the Rani Amrita herself. Love, and love alone, is the force that will allow you to resist.\u201d</p><p>It was not a speech anyone would have expected Bao to make, me included. Hasan Dar inclined his head in surprised respect. \u201cI will do that, Bao-ji.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Bao returned his attention to the map. \u201cIf I may make one more suggestion, I would advise dividing your men into two companies. Jagrati will have Lord Khaga and every last man standing guarding her.\u201d He tapped the map. \u201cThe harem will be unguarded.\u201d</p><p>The commander followed his thoughts. \u201cSo if everything else goes wrong, we can still rescue those poor unfortunates.\u201d</p><p>Bao nodded. \u201cJagrati allows Lord Khaga his harem as a sop to his pride, a place he can go to prove his manhood when she denies him to dally with his assassins. Whatever else happens, we should plan to free the harem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCounting the children?\u201d Bao frowned in thought. \u201cTwenty-five or thirty, perhaps. I do not know for sure. I was only allowed there once to search for Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are children in that place?\u201d Amrita asked in horror.</p><p>\u201cYes, highness.\u201d Bao was silent a moment. \u201cI do not think they were treated cruelly, at least not as children. The Falconer finds them distasteful, and avoids them. Even a woman bearing a child is repulsive to him.\u201d His mouth tightened. \u201cI heard it said that in the harem, it was every woman\u2019s goal to conceive a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, perplexed.</p><p>He looked askance at me. \u201cIf a woman bears him a son, the Falconer would not return to her bed. And she would not have to worry about a daughter growing up and being forced to share his.\u201d</p><p>My stomach churned. \u201cAnd you said it wasn\u2019t terrible there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in a very dark place within myself, Moirin,\u201d Bao said quietly. \u201cThe hatred that Jagrati carries within her, it is like a sickness. I am still learning to live in brightness again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not your fault, Bao-ji!\u201d Ravindra said with indignant loyalty, his narrow hands forming a mudra of reassurance. \u201cThe gods always test the strongest heroes, the ones they love best in the world. Surely you passed!\u201d</p><p>Bao smiled at him with genuine affection. \u201cYou are quite the hero yourself, young highness, rushing to protect your mother as you did! It would have gone far worse for me if you hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Ravindra flushed with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>Thus for better or worse, our plan was established. It would take some days to assemble a sufficient force and arrange for supplies and other necessities, such as a battering ram that would have to be carried through the winding maze on foot.</p><p>In the meantime, we lived in fear.</p><p>Hasan Dar insisted that the Rani and her son continue to sleep in the hidden room. It made sense, for although the assassin Zoka had tortured the secret out of poor Sameera, he had taken it to his death.</p><p>Still, I could not blame either of them for being reluctant to return there.</p><p>\u201cWould it help if Moirin and I stayed with you?\u201d Bao offered. \u201cI am sure it is against protocol, but.....\u201d</p><p>My lady Amrita fingered her bruised throat. \u201cYes,\u201d she said gratefully. \u201cIt would help very much, thank you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think there was room in the small space for another bed. \u201cWe can put a pallet of blankets on the floor between you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better!\u201d Ravindra clapped his hands together with glee. \u201cBao-ji can share my bed, and Moirin can share yours, Mama-ji. It will be as though we were a large family, like your family in Galanka, eh?\u201d The notion delighted him. \u201cYes, I will pretend Bao is my older brother, and you will pretend Moirin is your little sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d I began diplomatically.</p><p>\u201cWould that make you happy, jewel of my heart?\u201d Amrita asked her son. He nodded. She summoned a weary smile. \u201cThen if Moirin and Bao do not mind, we shall do so, and have a game of pretending.\u201d</p><p>Bao made a show of weighing the matter. \u201cDo you snore, young highness?\u201d he asked in a serious tone. \u201cBecause I cannot abide snoring. Do you steal the blankets at night? Because I do not like to be cold.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, Ravindra shook his head. \u201cNo, older brother! I promise, I do not do either thing.\u201d</p><p>Amrita touched my hand. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her. \u201cWhat do you think, my lady?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a sidelong glance, a hint of her familiar, amused sparkle returning to her eyes. \u201cI think I am very glad to see my son happy in the midst of this nightmare. I think your bad boy has a very large heart.\u201d She caught my hand and squeezed it fondly. \u201cAnd I think you do not mind at all, little sister.\u201d</p><p>Of course I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Even so, my nerves were strung tight that evening as Bao and I ascended the narrow stairway to the hidden room to ensure it was safe, both of us wrapped in the twilight. The memory of the assassin Zoka\u2019s attack was fresh in my mind. Bao searched every corner, peered under the beds, over the balcony, his staff at the ready. Not until he nodded at me did I kindle the lamps and release the twilight, the bright-burning wicks turning from cool silver to flickering gold.</p><p>Safe; we were safe.</p><p>This time it was true.</p><p>It was a little bit funny, a little bit awkward, and altogether sweet as we turned our backs on one another to change into sleeping attire. The beds creaked as we climbed into them, a comforting, homely sound.</p><p>I was careful not to touch my lady Amrita, not wanting to presume on her affection.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be foolish, Moirin,\u201d she chided me, laying her head on my shoulder. \u201cAll of us need all the comfort we can find. I am glad you are here.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, I held her. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes glimmered at me, and she put her lips close to my ear. \u201cListen to our boys.\u201d</p><p>Ravindra was telling Bao a tale about one of his favorite Bhodistani heroes, the great archer and warrior Arjuna, who was reluctant to do battle because of the many deaths it would cause. \u201cBut Lord Krishna convinced him it was his duty to protect his people,\u201d he said in a solemn tone. \u201cI think that is why my mother has decided she must go to Kurugiri. Do you think you could convince her to let me come, Bao-ji? You said I was a great help today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were, little brother,\u201d Bao said soothingly. \u201cBut you have a different responsibility. You must remain here with your tutor to remind us all what we are fighting for.\u201d</p><p>Ravindra sighed. \u201cBecause I am too young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very brave, but you are not a warrior yet.\u201d Bao tickled him. \u201cFor example, warriors do not giggle.\u201d</p><p>It was a boy\u2019s laughter, helpless and unfettered, reminding me once more to be grateful that even in the midst of fear and darkness, love and laughter could survive. Amrita smiled quietly in the dim moonlight spilling from the balcony, her thoughts echoing mine. \u201cI think your Bao is good for my Ravindra,\u201d she murmured. \u201cMy son is such a serious boy. It is good to hear him laugh, especially during such a dreadful time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your Ravindra is good for my Bao,\u201d I said softly in reply. \u201cHe is helping him learn to live in brightness again.\u201d</p><p>Amrita shivered against me. \u201cI pray to all the gods that we are given the chance to do so,\u201d she said in a low voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought of Sameera\u2019s severed fingers lying on the storeroom floor, of the shifting fires of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond, and Jagrati\u2019s terrible beauty; and I shivered, too. I held Amrita closer, breathing in the flowers-and-spice scent of her skin, and kissed her hair.</p><p>If I failed her in Kurugiri, I would never, ever forgive myself.</p><p>\u201cI pray so, too, my lady,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI pray so, too.\u201d</p> <p>SIXTY-NINE</p><p>Three days later, we departed for Kurugiri.</p><p>Although he had wept at their first parting, this time Ravindra was dry-eyed and grave, every inch the solemn young prince once more. The gravity of the situation had become all too real to him, and I think he understood that if his mother didn\u2019t return, he would be called upon to rule their people in a time of fear. He stooped to touch our feet in a gesture of respect, and embraced us all in turn.</p><p>\u201cYou will do your best to keep my mother safe, Bao-ji?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI will, highness.\u201d Bao pressed his palms together and bowed. \u201cMoirin will, too,\u201d he added. \u201cShe is as skilled an archer as your Arjuna, you know.\u201d</p> <p>It won the faintest of smiles from the boy. \u201cAlthough I do not believe it, it is good to hear anyway.\u201d</p><p>Last of all, Ravindra embraced his mother. Amrita held him tenderly, whispering in his ear. When she turned away, there were tears in her eyes.</p><p>I closed mine, whispering a soft prayer to the Maghuin Dhonn Herself to grant me strength.</p><p>I would need a very great deal of it.</p><p>Once more, we set out in procession through the streets of Bhaktipur. This time the mood was altogether somber. We were riding to war, not to a parley. There was no hidden gambit to give us the upper hand. So much of our plan hinged on my ability to summon the twilight and hold it for a very long time, to use it to kill with stealth in the deadly maze, praying all the while that the Maghuin Dhonn Herself did not withdraw Her gift from me for using it thusly. If She did, I would be useless when we reached Kurugiri.</p><p>My lady Amrita had teased me once about carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, and today it felt like it.</p> <p>Folk in the street bowed as we passed, low and deep. Some went to their knees, pressing their brows to the ground. Many of them had been afraid for their much-loved Rani the first time.</p><p>This time, all of them were.</p><p>Beside me, Bao breathed the Five Styles as he rode, his expression at once fierce and calm. His diadh-anam burned as bright and clear as a bonfire within him, calling to mine. I took heart from it. Surely, if the Maghuin Dhonn Herself disapproved of what we meant to do, Her spark would not shine so brightly.</p><p>Although we hadn\u2019t done anything yet.</p><p>Retracing our steps, we made camp in the same meadow the first evening. I could not help but remember the last time we had been there, all of us defeated and dispirited in the wake of our failure, and me racked with unholy desire, shuddering to the marrow of my bones with it, Jagrati\u2019s predatory face swimming before my eyes.</p><p>I was afraid of her, and afraid of myself, too.</p><p>In the privacy of the tent I shared with my lady Amrita and Bao, I prayed to Naamah, begging her to have mercy on her errant daughter, begging her to let me keep her gift a blessing, and not a curse.</p><p>\u201cI have tried to use it well, brightest of ladies,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI know I have not always been wise or strong, but I have always tried. I am still trying. Please, help me.\u201d</p> <p>In response, I had a sense of Naamah\u2019s grace enveloping me like a cloak, filled with warmth and love and desire; but there was regret in it, too. Her gift was a double-edged sword that cut both ways. Not even she could make it otherwise.</p><p>But there was another offer the bright lady Naamah could make, and I felt it, words rising through my consciousness like bubbles from the eddies of a clear-running stream, each one perfect and glistening.</p><p>One by one, the words were strung together to form a single, terrifying query, spoken as clearly to me as Naamah had ever spoken through me.</p><p>Do you wish me to take it from you?</p><p>I caught my breath, my skin prickling with awe. Tears stung my eyes; and whether they were tears of terror or relief, I couldn\u2019t have said. There was sorrow and curiosity behind the offer, but it was genuine.</p><p>Naamah could withdraw her gift from me.</p><p>My heart ached at the thought, and my diadh-anam flared in alarm. The Maghuin Dhonn Herself did not wish it so.</p><p>Neither did I.</p><p>I gazed at Bao, at his familiar face with its high, wide cheekbones, dark eyes glittering above them. And at my lovely lady Amrita, who gazed back at me with worried perplexity. I thought about all the people in my life I had loved and desired, from my lost Cillian slain too soon to my sweet boy Aleksei\u2014and all that lay between them. Even the ill-advised but compelling Raphael de Mereliot with his healer\u2019s hands, and, of course, my beautiful, mercurial lady Jehanne. My valiant princess Snow Tiger, trusting me enough to reveal an unexpected playful streak that had delighted me so.</p><p>I could not betray those memories. And for whatever reason Naamah had seen fit to grant her gift to a child of the Maghuin Dhonn when she called my father to my mother, there must be some purpose in it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cNo. Please, do not take it away from me, goddess.\u201d</p><p>Naamah did not. I felt her presence fade, leaving her gift intact.</p><p>I sighed with profound relief.</p><p>\u201cMoirin, who in the world were you talking to?\u201d Bao inquired.</p><p>\u201cNaamah,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cI think..... I think she offered to take her gift away from me. And I refused.\u201d I swallowed hard. \u201cI hope that was not a very bad mistake.\u201d</p><p>Bao came over and put his strong arms around me, holding me hard. I leaned against him, feeling the steady beat of his heart, the bright flame of his diadh-anam entwining with mine. \u201cMoirin without her eternal and perplexing desires would not be Moirin,\u201d he whispered against my hair. \u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too,\u201d Amrita said firmly. \u201cIt is never wise to refuse a true gift of the gods. Moirin..... do your gods often speak to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I searched for words, and found there weren\u2019t any big enough. All I could do was clear my throat. \u201cNo, my lady. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little. \u201cStill, you are quite special to them, I think. I knew it the moment I saw you protecting that girl in the street. You were shaking with fever and you could barely sit up straight in the saddle, but you were not going to let those men harm her. And as sick as you were, you still looked like you\u2019d stepped out of an ancient tale from when gods and goddesses roamed the earth.\u201d</p><p>It made me smile, too. \u201cYou are very kind, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Amrita laid one hand on Bao\u2019s shoulder and leaned in to kiss my cheek. \u201cAnd you are very frightened, dear one. But you are stronger than you know. You will be strong enough to face Jagrati, I am sure of it.\u201d</p><p>I prayed she was right.</p><p>All of us slept uneasily that night, the camp on high alert, ringed about with anxious sentries. Bao positioned himself before the flap of the tent and passed the night in a restless doze. Twice, there were shouts in the night that brought him to his feet, his staff at the ready, while I reached desperately for the twilight, flinging it around myself and Amrita. But they were false alarms sounded by our uneasy guards.</p><p>There was no attack. Kurugiri, it seemed, had gone on the defensive.</p><p>The next day, we passed through the meadow where we had held our parley. As a precaution, Hasan Dar sent a company of scouts ahead to sweep through the spruce copse where our ambush had hidden, but it was empty. We filed past the Sleeping Calf Rock and began to ascend higher into the mountains, the air growing thinner and colder, pockets of snow in the windswept crags.</p><p>I breathed the Breath of Embers Glowing to warm myself, and the Breath of Earth\u2019s Pulse to center myself, letting my awareness expand as we navigated the narrow paths. I didn\u2019t sense anyone ahead of us, but I wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>That night, we made camp on an arid plateau where the ground was so hard it took all the men\u2019s strength to pound the tent-pegs in place. Amrita was shivering in the cold, her teeth chattering. Although she didn\u2019t utter a word of complaint, she was unused to such hardship. Beneath thick woolen blankets, I did my best to warm her while Bao slept stretched before the tent-flap.</p><p>On the following day, we reached the base of Kurugiri.</p><p>The mountain seemed taller and more foreboding than I remembered, jutting into the icy blue sky. The southern face of it was sheer; indeed, only the eastern face with its complicated labyrinth was scalable. We worked our way toward it, feeling the shadow of Kurugiri looming over us. From this perspective, the fortress itself wasn\u2019t even visible, but every one of us knew it was there.</p><p>Dusk was falling by the time we passed the hanging cauldron of petition on its endless chain and reached the entrance to the maze, shadows slanting over the fissured slope. There must have been almost a dozen potential paths emerging from the maze, but Bao went unerringly toward the fifth one we encountered.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He pointed to a faint mark etched into the stone, as high as a man could reach, then pushed up his right sleeve. The same intricate symbol of curlicues and strokes was tattooed above the crook of his elbow, beginning the zig-zag path. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>Hasan Dar nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to camp here as best we can,\u201d he said. \u201cSet out at dawn. You\u2019re sure it can be climbed in a day?\u201d</p><p>Bao leaned on his staff. \u201cI\u2019m sure it can be done, yes. Whether or not we can do it is another matter. Depends on what we find in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure of it,\u201d Amrita said in a decisive tone, shivering. \u201cAnything to get out of this cold!\u201d</p><p>It made the guards smile, which I daresay was her intention; and it was the last cause anyone had to smile, for it was a truly miserable night. Due to the rocky terrain, we were unable to erect the tents and had to sleep in the open air, and it was perishing cold. But even worse was the menacing maze stretching above us, filled with possible assassins who might slip through under cover of night. Not wanting to take any chances, Hasan Dar posted sentries along every egress.</p><p>Although they were brave and loyal fellows, it was a frightening duty; and the mountain seemed like a living thing in the darkness, determined to heighten our fears. Every time a pebble shifted, someone raised an alarm. All of us slept fitfully, Bao and I with my lady Amrita between us, sharing our warmth with her, feeling horribly exposed and vulnerable all throughout the night.</p><p>Still, there was no attack.</p><p>Kurugiri was waiting.</p><p>In the dim light of predawn, I felt tired and bleary-eyed, and not at all heroic. Gazing at the deep, narrow channels etched into the mountainside, I reminded myself that I had done such a thing before in the Stone Forest.</p><p>But that had been a gentle, lovely place compared to this stark maze, and we had been able to draw our enemies away. We had had myriad paths to choose from, and a dragon to guide us.</p><p>Here, there was only one path that would not lead us astray, and we would be trapped within its confines with assassins waiting for us.</p><p>While Hasan Dar ordered his men into line, I sat cross-legged and breathed the cycle of the Five Styles. Bao sat beside me and did the same, his knee brushing against mine. I expanded my senses and drew strength from earth\u2019s pulse, from trees growing, from the memory of ocean\u2019s rolling waves, from embers glowing, and the wind\u2019s sigh.</p><p>I thought about Master Lo Feng, who had taught us both. What Master Lo had taught me had made me stronger and wiser, better able to focus the gift of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, using it as it was meant to be used.</p><p>I felt his loss keenly, and wished he were here to counsel us, to tell me that I had done the right thing in refusing Naamah\u2019s offer.</p><p>Too soon, all was in readiness. Bao and I would take the lead, a handful of guards behind us, followed by the fellows carrying the battering ram. Hasan Dar had placed the Rani in the middle of the line lest we find ourselves ambushed from behind, and he would guard her himself, commanding from the center. Every man under his command had a copy of the map we had drawn based on Bao\u2019s tattooed arms.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Hasan Dar asked, his handsome face taut with apprehension.</p><p>Bao\u2019s gaze slid sideways toward me, his staff held loosely in his hands. \u201cMoirin?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and stood. \u201cAye, I\u2019m ready.\u201d I strode toward my mount Lady, and swung myself astride.</p><p>Bao followed suit, thrusting his bamboo staff through a thong strapped across his back. I checked my yew-wood bow and quiver, testing the draw before slinging it over my shoulder. I glanced behind us, seeing the long line of guards, the Rani Amrita looking small and cold and determined in their midst. Faint streaks of pink were emerging on the eastern horizon, making the scudding clouds blush.</p><p>I looked at Bao, my stubborn, irrepressible peasant-boy with the vast heart. \u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He flashed his battle-grin at me. \u201cI love you, too, Moirin,\u201d he said, adding a familiar warning. \u201cSo try not to get yourself killed, huh?\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at him. \u201cYou, too. Once was enough.\u201d</p><p>At my word, Hasan Dar ordered his men to avert their gazes so that I might summon the twilight to hide us from all eyes. I took another deep breath and called it, wrapping it around Bao and me.</p><p>The world turned soft and silver-dim. Behind us, there were cries of wonder at finding us vanished. In the distant heights, I felt the flicker of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond calling to me.</p><p>I ignored it, focusing on the path before us. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTY</p><p>The path was so narrow we were forced to ride single file, and its walls were steep and high. I\u2019d never felt so claustrophobic in a natural place before, painfully aware of the fact that we were trapped here, that if I lost my grip on the twilight, Bao and I would be the first targets. With a hundred men behind us, there was no chance of escape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bao took the lead, consulting the tattoo on his right arm, matching symbols at every fork of the path.</p><p>Every path not taken made my skin tingle, for there could be assassins lurking within them, waiting to fall on our company from the side. It was unlikely, since they could do the most damage obstructing the path before us, but it was possible. And I had to keep my awareness focused on the path ahead. I couldn\u2019t afford to spread myself too thin.</p><p>According to Bao, there had been seventeen men in Jagrati\u2019s thrall, and all but two were highly trained killers.</p> <p>Five had been killed during their escape from the meadow, and Bao had left. The poisoner and the fellow lurking in the Rani\u2019s hidden room were dead.</p><p>That left nine men, plus the Falconer himself. When I counted the numbers, it seemed a ridiculous few to inspire such fear..... but in the maze, at the forefront of our small army, it didn\u2019t seem foolish at all.</p><p>Left, then right, then left, and left again. All the turns made me feel disoriented and dizzy. I shook my head, concentrating. The call of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond grew stronger as we climbed, the rich hues of its dark fire beckoning to Naamah\u2019s gift within me, seeking to beckon me out of the twilight.</p><p>Behind us was the clatter of hoofbeats, the jingle and creak of gear and weapons, the sounds of men breathing hard and swearing as they attempted to wrestle a battering ram through the narrow, twisting path.</p><p>I wished they would all be quiet.</p> <p>We had been climbing for over an hour when I sensed the first living presence other than our own on the mountain, at a point where the path ahead of us widened around a sharp bend to the right.</p><p>\u201cBao, hold,\u201d I said softly, and he drew rein, waiting. Glancing behind me, I willed Hasan Dar\u2019s second in command to hear me. \u201cPradeep, hold and wait.\u201d</p><p>He nodded fearfully, and whether it was due to the threat of assassins, or hearing my disembodied voice, I couldn\u2019t say. But he did as we had agreed, signalling silently to the army to wait.</p><p>There was no time to hesitate. The killer ahead of us would have heard our company approaching. If Bao and I delayed, he might move to investigate. Firming my grip on the twilight, I joined Bao and we rode around the bend.</p><p>The assassin was an archer, and he had chosen his spot well. He had gone to one knee at the far end of a straight, wide stretch of path, and he had an arrow nocked and drawn. There was a tray of sand before him from which the shafts of another score of arrows bristled, points thrust into the sand, ready at hand.</p><p>Remembering how quickly the man in the Rani\u2019s chamber had thrown a flurry of knives, I shivered. I didn\u2019t doubt that this fellow was just as quick, just as deadly.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the good ones or bad ones?\u201d I asked Bao.</p><p>\u201cBad,\u201d he murmured. \u201cDo you want me to take him, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s on me, either way.\u201d I nocked an arrow and drew, my hands shaking a little.</p><p>I had killed men twice before, but only in the heat of battle. This was murder, plain and simple. Even if the fellow would gladly have done the same to me given the opportunity, it was still murder. He had no idea I was there. His face was calm and silvery in the twilight, utterly focused. It reminded me a bit of the Tatar archer Vachir\u2019s quiet, steady confidence, which made it all the harder.</p><p>My diadh-anam was quiet within me, neither warning nor encouraging. The Maghuin Dhonn Herself would give me no guidance in this matter. The choice was mine to make, the risk of losing Her favor mine to take.</p><p>This, I thought, was truly an unclean deed that would leave a stain on my soul. But thinking of my lady Amrita raising poor, dead Sameera\u2019s maimed hand to her lips and kissing it, thinking of Ravindra\u2019s grave face as he bade his mother farewell, I knew it was a darkness I was willing to accept.</p><p>\u201cMake sure it\u2019s a clean kill,\u201d Bao said quietly, reading the decision on my face. \u201cHe\u2019ll start shooting blind if you don\u2019t take him in one.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cGet as close to the wall as you can. He\u2019s likely to loose his bowstring when he\u2019s struck.\u201d</p> <p>Kneeing our mounts, we plastered ourselves as close to the walls as we could.</p><p>Breathing deeply and willing my hands to steadiness, I shot the fellow.</p><p>It was quick, so quick! There was the thrumming sound of my bowstring as I loosed it, the thump of the arrow piercing the assassin\u2019s chest indistinguishable from the second twang as his nerveless fingers loosed his own string, the hornet-buzz of an arrow speeding between Bao and me to shatter against the wall of the path.</p><p>I lost my grip on the twilight for a heartbeat. The killer\u2019s puzzled eyes met mine; then his gaze went to the feathered haft protruding from his chest. He toppled slowly sideways. And then my diadh-anam pulsed within me and I gasped, reclaiming the twilight.</p><p>The archer was dead.</p><p>And the Maghuin Dhonn Herself had not forsaken me. It seemed I had guessed rightly, and the stakes were indeed high enough to call for desperate measures.</p><p>Bao dismounted and went to confirm that the killer was well and truly dead, then lugged his body as far out of the way as possible. I sat atop my mare Lady, breathing hard and shaking, fighting against a surge of nausea, feeling at once sick at heart and horribly grateful that my diadh-anam yet shone within me.</p><p>\u201cIt was well done, Moirin,\u201d Bao said when he returned, swinging himself back into the saddle. \u201cA better death than that one deserved.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cLet\u2019s just keep going.\u201d</p><p>We alerted Pradeep and resumed our torturous climb, zigging and zagging our way up the mountain to Kurugiri. Bao consulted his tattoo and scanned the walls for symbols; behind us, Pradeep and the others consulted their maps and did the same, following our invisible progress through the endless labyrinth.</p><p>Left, right, right; left. Again and again and again.</p><p>I felt the darkness of my deed settle into me, and accepted it. I wondered if the great magician Berlik had felt the same way when he had broken his oath and slain the Cruithne princess and her unborn child to save our people.</p><p>The gods use their chosen hard.</p><p>It was true.</p><p>It was mid-day when I sensed a second living presence in the maze ahead of us, and called softly to Bao, ordering a second halt.</p><p>This time, the path was too narrow to admit us both on horseback. Bao and I dismounted, stealing around the corner together on foot. He caught his breath in a hiss at the sight of the man awaiting us.</p><p>My throat tightened. \u201cOne of the good ones?\u201d I asked unnecessarily. This fellow was young, younger than Bao, with delicate features. His face was filled with transcendent determination, but even I could see that he held the long pike he wielded in a tentative, inexpert grip.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Bao glanced at me. \u201cSudhakar. I used to try to protect him.\u201d</p><p>My diadh-anam flickered. \u201cWe can\u2019t just kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sighed. \u201cLet him see us.\u201d</p><p>I released the twilight.</p><p>The boy yelped with alarm at the sudden sight of us, his eyes stretched wide. I nocked an arrow and trained it on him. He leveled his long pike, swinging the tip back and forth between us in an agony of indecision.</p><p>\u201cSudhakar, it\u2019s me,\u201d Bao said in a soothing tone, his staff tucked under one arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fight, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur lady wills it!\u201d His voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cOur lady wills a great many things, none of them good,\u201d Bao said calmly. \u201cThink, Sudhakar. She\u2019s not here now. Kamadeva\u2019s diamond is not here.\u201d He tapped his chest. \u201cLook into your heart. You don\u2019t want to do this. Lay down your weapon and surrender, and we will take care of you, good care of you. The Rani of Bhaktipur is a good lady, a very good lady. I promise, you will be safe among us.\u201d</p><p>The boy hesitated, and I thought for a moment that Bao had reached him, but I was wrong. Jagrati and Kamadeva\u2019s diamond might not be here, but they were not far enough away, either.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d young Sudhakar cried in a high-pitched voice, shaking his head frantically. \u201cNo, no, no! I am loyal to her!\u201d</p><p>Pike leveled, he charged at Bao.</p><p>Despite the narrow confines, Bao spun out of his way with effortless grace, his staff lashing out to connect with the back of the boy\u2019s head as he passed. Sudhakar fell forward and measured his length on the rocky path, lying motionless.</p><p>I winced. \u201cDead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnconscious.\u201d Bao rolled the boy over, testing his pulse. \u201cBroken nose, chipped front teeth. He\u2019ll live if we let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him,\u201d I said.</p><p>Bao nodded and called for Pradeep, who procured a long length of sturdy rope from somewhere in our supply train. Together, they trussed the boy Sudhakar securely and dragged him into one of the blind alleys. Gods willing, we would retrieve him on our return journey.</p><p>\u201cTwo down,\u201d I said. \u201cSeven to go, plus the Falconer. Do you suppose there are more in the maze ahead of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bao said soberly. \u201cAt least one. They wouldn\u2019t have left a half-trained lad like Sudhakar as the last line of defense in here.\u201d</p><p>He was right.</p><p>For two more hours, we climbed uneventfully, the call of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond growing ever stronger. I struggled to ignore it, struggled to maintain my hold on the twilight, trying not to think about the offer Naamah had made to me, trying not to let myself get distracted by the fear that I had chosen unwisely. Nearing yet another hairpin turn, I barely sensed the presence ahead of us in time to order Pradeep to halt.</p><p>It was narrow, very narrow. Once again, Bao and I dismounted and went to investigate on foot, me with an arrow nocked.</p><p>As strained and mentally weary as I was, I couldn\u2019t make sense of the vision before me. For the space of a few seconds, I thought I was seeing one of Bhodistan\u2019s strange gods with two heads and four arms.</p><p>Then it resolved into the image of two men crowded into the narrow space together. One gestured silently to the other, who cupped his hands together. The first man put his foot in the other\u2019s cupped hands, and the other tossed him upward with a powerful heave. The fellow soared into the air, catching the ledge of the steep wall and pulling himself to his feet.</p><p>Behind us, shouts of alarm came as the assassin appeared above us; and I lost my grip on the twilight.</p><p>The fellow before us gave a hoarse cry of surprise, plucking a pair of short-handled battle-axes from his belt.</p><p>Bao shouldered past me. \u201cThe Rani, Moirin!\u201d he shouted. \u201cGet the other one! He\u2019s after Amrita!\u201d</p><p>I whirled and took aim, but the fellow was already in motion, racing along the top of the deep crevasse, sure-footed and swift. He had a row of silver quoits like razor-edged bangles along one arm, plucking them free with his other hand and hurling them with deadly force as he ran. Cries of agony arose in his wake.</p><p>I shot at him and missed; and by the time I had a second arrow nocked, he was around the hairpin turn, the high walls blocking him from me. With fifty men between me and my lady Amrita, there was nothing further I could do to protect her.</p><p>Sick with fear, I turned back, only to find Bao faring poorly in his battle.</p><p>Like the archer, the axe-man had picked his spot well. The path was too narrow here for Bao to wield his long bamboo staff effectively, forcing him to parry with awkward diagonal moves, essaying cautious jabs and retreating step by step.</p><p>And step by step, the assassin advanced, the narrow space suited to his short-handled weapons, which he wielded with fearful ease, describing complex patterns in the air as they crossed and uncrossed, spun and slashed. A death\u2019s-head grin stretched his lips from his teeth, and there was a manic gleam in his eyes.</p><p>Although I had an arrow nocked, with Bao between us, I couldn\u2019t shoot the fellow, either.</p><p>\u201cMoirin!\u201d Bao yelled. \u201cCall your magic!\u201d</p><p>There was too much shouting, too much fear, too much chaos altogether. I tried and found I couldn\u2019t do it, couldn\u2019t summon the concentration.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d I yelled back at him, furious and helpless. In a surge of desperate inspiration, I switched to the Shuntian scholars\u2019 tongue. \u201cBao, when I count to three, duck!\u201d</p><p>He gave a sharp nod.</p><p>I counted. \u201cOne..... two..... three!\u201d</p><p>Bao dropped like a stone into a deep crouch, ducking his head and raising his staff at a steep angle above it in a last effort to ward off the descending battle-axes. The assassin\u2019s eyes shone.</p><p>Aiming high, I loosed my bow.</p><p>The arrow caught the fellow in the throat, piercing it clean through. He staggered backward, the battle-axes falling forgotten from his hands, which rose to feel at the feathered shaft. His face softened into that bewildered look that comes when death takes a man unaware, and he sat down hard on the trail, his breath gurgling wetly in his throat.</p><p>Once again, I swallowed against a rising tide of bile.</p><p>Bao was on his feet, bending over the fellow. I looked away as he ripped the arrow free from his throat.</p><p>The sound the man made as he died was dreadful.</p><p>Bao met my gaze. \u201cThe Rani?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Word travelled up and down the long, twisting line of our company. One man was dead, and a half dozen more seriously injured. The Rani Amrita was alive and safe. Hasan Dar had protected her with his own body, throwing himself from the saddle. He had suffered a grievous injury in the process, one of the razor-edged quoits lodged between his ribs.</p><p>He might live\u2014or not.</p><p>The second assassin was dead, brought down at last by our own archers. Four down altogether; five left to go, plus the Falconer.</p><p>Kurugiri was still awaiting us.</p><p>\u201cMoirin.\u201d Bao touched my arm. \u201cCan you continue?\u201d</p><p>I gazed at the corpse of the axe-wielding assassin, remembering a story the trader Dorje had told me. \u201cI think I\u2019ve heard of this one, or at least one like him,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI think he stole a Tufani yak-herder\u2019s daughter and slaughtered her family. Does that tale sound familiar to you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d I remembered the weight of the prayer-urns as I turned them outside the temple of Sakyamuni in Rasa, the light touch of the boy-monk\u2019s slender fingers on my tear-stained cheeks as he sought to comfort me, the dense, fragrant scent of incense all around us. His face blurred in my memory with Ravindra\u2019s, with the boy Dash from the caravan; his fingers blurred in memory with the image of my lady Amrita\u2019s graceful hands forming a mudra, with Sameera\u2019s severed fingers discarded on the storeroom floor.</p><p>Kamadeva\u2019s diamond sang to me.</p> <p>I shook my head, willing it clear.

So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine!\u201d I took a deep breath, drawing the twilight into my lungs, spinning it softly around us both, finding new reserves of strength. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Bao kissed me. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTY-ONE</p><p>Hours later, we gained the summit.</p><p>There had been no further assassins awaiting us in the maze, and none awaited us atop the peak of Kurugiri. Only the fortress itself, stark, solid, and forbidding.</p> <p>One by one by one, members of our company straggled out of the narrow paths\u2014or at least most of us. One dead, another half dozen injured, Hasan Dar among them. We had been forced to leave them behind, swaddled in blankets against the cold.</p><p>I dismounted and found my lady Amrita surrounded by anxious guards, and embraced her with relief. \u201cYou\u2019re well?\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cWell enough, young goddess. Hasan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI pray he survives.\u201d</p><p>Amrita laid one ice-cold hand against my cheek, shuddering uncontrollably in the thin air. \u201cLet us make an end to this, shall we?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin has agreed to wed me if we survive,\u201d Bao informed her.</p><p>Despite everything, it made her smile, made her tired, lustrous eyes sparkle with gladness. \u201cWell, then, we shall have to make sure of it, eh? All this effort and sacrifice must not be made in vain.\u201d</p> <p>The sun was beginning to sink low in the west, streaking the horizon in tones of gold and saffron. The snow-topped mountain peaks glowed. In the valleys and deep crevasses, the shadows of night were already gathering. Taking the place of his injured commander, Pradeep rallied his troops, assigning them their duties.</p><p>The men who had worked so hard to carry the battering ram up the twisting maze gave way gratefully to a fresh crew of guards. The new men wrapped the ropes that bound it around their hands, taking firm stances. On a count of three, they surged forward, swinging the bronze-capped ram.</p><p>The sound boomed and echoed over the peaks; but the tall wooden doors held.</p><p>\u201cAgain!\u201d Pradeep called.</p><p>Again and again, they assailed the entrance, until the doors began to bow inward, the bar that held them shut straining. At last, the bar gave way altogether with a creaking, splintery groan, and the doors crashed open. The fellows manning the battering ram backed away hastily, but no one emerged. Although the place seemed almost deserted, the flicker of lamplight within its walls told us otherwise.</p><p>Somewhere in the depths of Kurugiri, Kamadeva\u2019s diamond called to me.</p><p>Cloaked in the twilight, Bao and I made a careful survey of the entryway and found it empty. \u201cCan you sense them?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work as well in man-made places. But I know where Kamadeva\u2019s diamond is.\u201d I pointed. \u201cThat way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe throne room,\u201d Bao said with satisfaction. \u201cI was right.\u201d</p><p>My skin was beginning to feel warm, the call of the diamond like a caress. \u201cWhere are all the others? Surely there must be servants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiding,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cAnd like as not praying we succeed.\u201d</p><p>We returned to report to Pradeep that the way was clear, and our apprehensive company filed through the doors.</p><p>The plan was to have had Hasan Dar and two dozen of his best fighters lead the attack on the Falconer and his assassins, while Pradeep led the rest in rescuing the women and children of the harem. In Hasan Dar\u2019s absence, Bao volunteered to lead the attack on the throne room, and Pradeep readily agreed to let him, not even bothering to hide his relief.</p><p>With that, our company divided.</p><p>Making our way through the empty fortress was a frightening process, all of us jumping at shadows. Even though I held myself and my lady Amrita wrapped in the twilight, I was tense and fearful. Bao was right, Kurugiri was a strange place. The architecture was plain and utilitarian, but everywhere, opulence gleamed. There were gilded braziers and lamps that burned silvery in the twilight, gorgeous woven hangings on every wall, the spoils of generations\u2019 worth of tribute\u2014and later, outright theft.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like it, not one bit. Every wilderness-born instinct I possessed was telling me to turn and flee, that this was a bad man-made place made by bad men. And at the same time, Kamadeva\u2019s diamond was setting my blood to beating hard in my veins, setting Naamah\u2019s gift stirring in me. For once, it didn\u2019t feel like a flock of doves taking flight. Ravens, mayhap\u2014ravens with sharp-edged wings and cruel beaks, ready to pick me apart.</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d Amrita took my hand in concern.</p><p>It helped, and I squeezed hers in reply. \u201cWe are close, my lady. Very close.\u201d</p><p>Outside another set of tall doors, Bao gestured silently for everyone to halt. \u201cIs she here, Moirin?\u201d he asked in a low tone.</p><p>I stared at the doors. I could almost see Kamadeva\u2019s diamond through them, nestled below the hollow of Jagrati\u2019s long throat. \u201cYes. Oh, yes.\u201d</p><p>Bao laid one hand on the latch. \u201cThere is no lock on these doors. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, then nodded; then remembered Bao couldn\u2019t see me. Releasing Amrita\u2019s hand, I unslung my bow from my shoulder and nocked an arrow. \u201cAre you ready, my lady Amrita?\u201d</p><p>Her face was resolute. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are ready,\u201d I informed Bao.</p><p>He turned the latch, shoved the door open with the butt-end of his staff, and jumped backward, cat-quick, his staff at the ready. The door swung inward silently, revealing the throne room.</p><p>And Kamadeva\u2019s diamond.</p><p>Now I could see it glimmering on the far side of the room; and for a moment, it and Jagrati were all I could see. The strikingly gaunt, high-boned face that had haunted my thoughts, her dark skin gleaming in the twilight. The diamond pulsing at her throat, beating in time with her blood, beating in time with my blood. Even in the twilight, the black diamond made from a god\u2019s ashes glowed with dark, shifting, blood-red fire.</p><p>I took an involuntary step forward, lowering my bow.</p><p>\u201cNo, Moirin!\u201d Deftly, Amrita slipped past me, turning her back on the Spider Queen and raising her hands in a mudra to focus the will. \u201cBe strong, dear one!\u201d</p><p>No one could hear us in the twilight unless we willed it. I met her gaze and nodded, lifting my bow once more. \u201cAye, my lady.\u201d</p><p>It was strange, so very strange, stealing into the throne room, coming upon that unholy tableau unseen. They were waiting for us, they were all waiting for us, gazing fixedly at the open doorway. There was one throne and Jagrati sat in it, her long fingers curled into armrests carved in the shape of roaring tigers. Four men were arrayed before her with weapons drawn, the Falconer Tarik Khaga among them.</p><p>Two others lurked on either side of the doorway, bristling with more weapons. We were close enough that I could hear them breathing.</p><p>\u201cBao?\u201d I called, willing him to hear me. \u201cAssassins waiting to ambush you on both sides of the door.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I hoped he had heard me.</p><p>Small and fearless, my lady Amrita advanced through the twilight, past the lurking killers, all the way to the foot of the throne. I followed her.</p><p>It took every ounce of concentration I had to expand the twilight and spin it around Jagrati, but I did it.</p><p>Her head jerked up in surprise as the world dimmed around her, her face contorting with fury. \u201cYou! What have you done?\u201d</p><p>Behind me, there was shouting. Later, I would learn that Bao had indeed heard my warning, had come through the doorway in a low, diving somersault that took him past the lurking killers and came up fighting, the others crowding behind him.</p><p>Now, all I knew was that the battle was engaged, Tarik Khaga and his deadly falcons rushing to join it.</p><p>I wanted to look, but I couldn\u2019t. I looked past the Spider Queen instead, keeping my arrow trained in her general direction. \u201cNo one but the Rani Amrita and I can see you, Jagrati. Give Kamadeva\u2019s diamond to her, or I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>A low sound, a sound at once soft and harsh. I felt it in the pit of my belly. Ravens fluttering. \u201cNo,\u201d Jagrati said fondly in her silken rasp of a voice. \u201cNo, my oh so pretty dakini, I do not think so.\u201d She rose from the throne, moving with that angular grace, Kamadeva\u2019s diamond glowing at her throat. \u201cCome, put down your bow, young Moirin. Do not threaten me. It is not who you are. You were made for pleasure, not killing.\u201d</p><p>It was true; so true! With a sigh of relief, I lowered my bow.</p><p>Jagrati smiled. \u201cWell done, child! Now release your magic.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to obey her.</p><p>\u201cMoirin, no!\u201d Amrita\u2019s voice rang out. She positioned herself deftly between us, her hands rising in a warding mudra. \u201cDo not listen to her; do not look at her! Look at me, and hold fast to all you love!\u201d</p><p>I raised my bow, blinking hard.</p><p>I held the twilight.</p><p>Jagrati hissed through her teeth, pacing with ferocious elegance. \u201cLittle Rani,\u201d she said in a guttural purr. \u201cDo you know, you are everything I hate in this world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world has not been kind to you,\u201d my lady Amrita said steadily, her hands unwavering. \u201cAnd I am sorry for it. I listened to the words you said before, and I will seek to be mindful of them in pursuit of the truth. But that does not excuse your cruelty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPious mush-mouthed creature!\u201d Jagrati reached for her, then recoiled with another hiss. \u201cLook at you.\u201d Her voice dripped with contempt. \u201cSo brave, little daughter of the warrior caste; so proud to be doing her duty, so sanctimonious in her self-righteousness.\u201d</p><p>It made me angry.</p><p>\u201cMy lady Amrita is none of those things save brave, Jagrati,\u201d I said fiercely. \u201cDo not project your own darkness on her.\u201d</p><p>Jagrati\u2019s glittering gaze settled on me, bringing the full force of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond to bear. My blood thundered in my ears, throbbed in my veins. I had never been afflicted with a taste for life\u2019s sharper pleasures, but that was before I had committed murder and taken darkness onto my own spirit. Now I sensed the absolution to be found in accepting punishment, in abasement and humiliation.</p><p>I was flushed and hot, aching between my thighs, beginning to shudder with the force of it. My yew-wood bow trembled in my hands. Kamadeva\u2019s diamond glowed like dark embers, like a blood-red sun setting, promising razor-edged pleasures. Jagrati\u2019s full lips curved in a smile. I wanted her to kiss me again, wanted her to touch me with those cruel, long-fingered hands, wanted her to hurt me. I wanted her to whisper foul things to me in that rasping, silken voice, compelling me to obey her, forcing me into unclean acts. Anything.</p><p>No.</p><p>No, I didn\u2019t. Because Amrita stood between us, and I would not let any harm come to my kind and lovely Rani. Because Bao fought behind me, and I could feel the force of his diadh-anam burning bright and clear.</p><p>I would not let Jagrati and Kamadeva\u2019s diamond turn Naamah\u2019s gift into a curse. I clung to memories of brightness, memories of love. Mayhap Bao was right, and I did fall in love as easily as other people fall out of a boat; but I loved in earnest. Well, and so? I did but obey Blessed Elua\u2019s precept, love as thou wilt.</p><p>Elua.</p><p>I had prayed to Naamah for aid, but the bright lady could not protect me from my own desires, even desire without love.</p><p>But mayhap Elua could.</p><p>\u201cBlessed Elua,\u201d I whispered in D\u2019Angeline. \u201cIn the name of everyone I have ever loved, I beg you to aid me.\u201d</p><p>Golden warmth flooded me, dispelling the darkness. The desire didn\u2019t vanish, but it grew bearable. The shudders that racked me began to lessen, and I was able to steady my hands on the bow.</p><p>Anger suffused Jagrati\u2019s face as she felt her influence waning. \u201cWhat are you doing, dakini? What new spell do you speak?\u201d She forced herself to calmness, coaxing again with her slithering rasp of a voice. \u201cCome, Moirin. Do you not wish to please me? All I am asking is a small thing. Release your magic.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Behind me, the clashing, clamoring sounds of battle were beginning to dwindle. There were low sounds of agony, men groaning and whimpering with pain. If we had won, it would come at a price. Jagrati\u2019s gaze slid past me. I wondered what she saw.</p><p>\u201cBao?\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh!\u201d he grunted in reply, and I heard the sound of a blade clattering against his steel-wrapped bamboo staff. \u201cAlmost done, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I kept my arrow trained on Jagrati, and although the Spider Queen of Kurugiri was as beautiful and terrible as Kali dancing, and Kamadeva\u2019s diamond shone around her throat and sang to me, there was only rage and hatred in her. I could not love her. Like my lady Amrita, I pitied her; and I saw her hate me for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a final clash behind me, then a heavy thud and two sharp thumps, followed by Bao\u2019s soft \u201cHeh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cGive the diamond to the Rani Amrita.\u201d</p><p>Jagrati\u2019s narrow nostrils flared. \u201cCome and take it, little Rani,\u201d she said to Amrita. \u201cCome, unfasten it with your own hands, daughter of privilege! Or do you fear to be polluted by the touch of my skin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Jagrati.\u201d My lady Amrita lowered her hands, her voice grave. She took a step forward. \u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>For the third time in two encounters, Jagrati recoiled violently from the Rani. Her hands went to the nape of her neck, working frantically at a clasp. Loosing the collar of gold filigree that held Kamadeva\u2019s black diamond, she hurled it at Amrita\u2019s feet. \u201cTake it, then, damn you! Take it!\u201d</p><p>Bowing her head, Amrita stooped to retrieve the necklace.....</p><p>..... and everything changed.</p><p>SEVENTY-TWO</p> <p>The stone floor of the throne room of Kurugiri was hard beneath my knees, evoking a distant memory of scrubbing tiles in the temple of Riva.</p><p>Thinking it was odd that she seemed so tall, I gazed upward at my lady Amrita.</p><p>Upward? Yes, upward.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I realized that I\u2019d released the twilight and gone to my knees without thinking when Amrita picked up the necklace with Kamadeva\u2019s diamond in it. My yew-wood bow and arrow lay on the floor before me like an offering.</p><p>I was not alone.</p><p>Everyone, everyone in the throne room capable of kneeling was doing so\u2014save for the Spider Queen Jagrati. And even as I thought it, Jagrati swayed on her feet, then crumpled helplessly to her knees, huddling there.</p> <p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d My lady Amrita sounded forlorn and confused, the collar of gold filigree dangling from one hand, Kamadeva\u2019s diamond flickering in its setting. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s happening, eh?\u201d</p><p>Unable to help myself, I touched my brow to the cool flagstones. The uncertainty in her voice made my heart ache. I wanted to comfort her, to pleasure her, to assuage her every fear. For now, all I could do was reply honestly. \u201cYou hold Kamadeva\u2019s diamond and all its power, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d Amrita asked in wonder. \u201cI do, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>My Rani was beautiful and terrible with it\u2014but not like Kali dancing, no. Like a goddess, but a kinder, gentler one. The goddess Durga on her tiger, perhaps, her face filled with radiant light and fierce compassion.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>She gazed around the throne room, taking in the cost of our endeavor. The Falconer Tarik Khaga sprawled on his back, his mouth agape. Dead. He was dead; his five remaining assassins were dead. Over a dozen of her best guards were dead or dying, and it would have been worse had it not been for Bao, kneeling with his staff across his lap, gazing at her in a worshipful manner.</p><p>Amrita touched her slender fingers to her lips. \u201cOh, gods!\u201d</p><p>I bent and touched my brow to the floor again. \u201cYou did what was needful, highness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>I bowed low again. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d There was a fierce note in my Rani\u2019s musical voice, and her hands tugged at my shoulders. \u201cNo, no, no. Moirin, look at me. Talk to me, dear one. The gods sent you to me. Counsel me.\u201d Hope lit her eyes. \u201cIs there some higher purpose in this? Am I meant to use Kamadeva\u2019s diamond to change the world to a kinder place?\u201d</p><p>Fighting the urge to kneel, I sat on my heels and gazed at her.</p><p>Stone and sea! She was lovely, so lovely. Even as Kamadeva\u2019s diamond had taken all that was dark and twisted and rage-filled within Jagrati and turned it into the stuff of bitter yearning, it took all of my lady Amrita\u2019s warm, laughing, golden kindness and turned it into something far, far more powerful.</p><p>A future unspooled before my eyes.....</p><p>She would be a queen such as this part of the world had never seen before: great and powerful in her compassion, terrible in her disappointment, moving men and women alike in a desire to please her, compelling love along with desire. Her influence would spread far and wide, her wisdom praised to the heavens.</p><p>But it would not last.</p><p>Ravindra\u2019s clever, narrow face swam before my eyes, the collar fixed around his throat. He would do his best to keep his mother\u2019s legacy alive; but he had been granted power, too much power.</p><p>His sons would fight and squabble. In the end, Kamadeva\u2019s diamond would bring nothing but bloodshed and war.</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady Amrita,\u201d I said with profound sorrow. \u201cI do not believe so. It is too dangerous a tool to be wielded by mortal hands; and I do not believe you can change the world through magic. Not a change that is true, not a change that lasts.\u201d</p><p>Amrita gazed at the black diamond in her hand for a long, long time. \u201cI believe you are right,\u201d she said at last. \u201cIt belongs in the temple from which it was taken.\u201d She glanced at me, regret in her eyes. \u201cYou are wise for one so young, Moirin. Will you take it and conceal it for now? Kamadeva\u2019s ashes should be at home with your gifts.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cI will try, my lady.\u201d</p><p>It was an effort to rise in her shining presence, but I made myself do it. I found a leather pouch on the belt of one of the slain assassins and untied it, dumping out a couple of unfamiliar throwing weapons. Silently, I held the open pouch out to Amrita, averting my eyes from the glorious light in her face. I heard the sound of gold filigree clinking softly, felt the pouch grow heavier, and pulled the thongs tight.....</p><p>..... and everything changed again.</p><p>Amrita sighed, a faint sound of loss. I braced myself for the influence of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond, wondering if I would become as terrible and beautiful as Naamah in all her splendor, wondering what in the world I would do if that happened; but it didn\u2019t. I felt the diamond singing softly to me, a song like a caress, but so long as I chose not to wield it, it seemed it was enough to conceal it.</p><p>I stole a glance at Amrita. She looked herself again\u2014lovely, but ordinary and mortal. She met my eyes and gave me a rueful little smile. \u201cI can still try to change the world, can\u2019t I, Moirin? Or at least my little corner of it?\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at her. \u201cYes, my lady. You can and will.\u201d</p><p>The spell of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond broken, the reality of our situation reasserted itself. Grown men stumbled to their feet, dazed, checking themselves for injuries. Others lay moaning and bleeding on the floor.</p><p>For a mercy, Bao took charge effortlessly, ordering the living to tend to the wounded, applying compresses and tourniquets, stanching the bleeding of myriad injuries. Although he was no physician, having been Master Lo\u2019s apprentice for many years, he knew a fair bit; and I knew enough to help him.</p><p>Over a dozen dead..... ah, gods!</p><p>I had seen worse, far worse, in Ch\u2019in; but Ch\u2019in was a vast empire, and the scale of that conflict almost unimaginable. Bhaktipur was a tiny kingdom, and the impact of the deaths that had occurred within this small throne room hit hard. I knew at least half the fallen by name, and all of them by sight.</p><p>In the midst of it all, Jagrati knelt huddled on the floor, her hands wrapped around her head, her body shivering.</p><p>We ignored her, worked around her, until there was nothing left to be done and it was impossible to ignore her any longer.</p><p>Bao nodded at her, his face tense. \u201cWhat will you, highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Amrita said uncertainly. \u201cShe is harmless now. But she has done great harm. I suppose..... I suppose.....\u201d She shrugged helplessly. \u201cWe must take her with us, eh? Let the laws of justice decide her punishment.\u201d</p><p>I stooped and touched Jagrati\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>She uncoiled like a serpent, catching my hand in a hard grip and rising, her glittering gaze fixed on mine as she hauled me to my feet.</p><p>Memories, bitter memories, unfolded behind her eyes. Even without Kamadeva\u2019s diamond, Jagrati\u2019s gaunt, angular beauty was compelling. From a very early age, men had found it so, a great many men. They had used her hard, used her cruelly, taking her against the walls of alleys, over and over again, stealing away shame-faced and satisfied. There had been no recourse, no one to protect her. Until the day she had stolen Kamadeva\u2019s diamond, she had been a helpless victim.</p><p>I caught my breath, seeing too much.</p><p>Jagrati gave me a tight smile. \u201cYou see things, don\u2019t you, oh so pretty dakini?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntouchable.\u201d She released my hand, regarding her own, dark creases in her pale palm. \u201cThat is what they call us.\u201d Her gaze flicked toward Amrita. \u201cThat is what you call us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am coming to believe otherwise,\u201d Amrita murmured.</p><p>\u201cUntouchable,\u201d Jagrati repeated, a catch in her throat. She laid her palm against my cheek and I let her, my pity giving way to genuine sympathy. \u201cAnd yet it never seemed to matter when no one was watching. Men were happy enough to touch me when it suited them, so long as no one saw it. It is a man\u2019s world. Men make the rules, and men decide when it is acceptable to break them. Even your precious Rani is only waiting for her son to grow old enough to take her place.\u201d She took her hand away, her expression hardening. \u201cBut I made a difference. Here, I carved out my own place. Here in Kurugiri, I ruled. I made the choices.\u201d She glanced at Bao. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He gave her an inscrutable bow, his staff tucked under one arm. \u201cYes, my dark lady. You most certainly did.\u201d</p><p>Another bitter smile twisted her lips. \u201cYou have an uncommon streak of willfulness. I should have cut my losses when your Moirin returned from the dead. But you..... you were one of my favorites, Bao. I didn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not yours to keep,\u201d he said in a flat tone. \u201cNone of us were. And yet look around, my lady.\u201d He gestured. \u201cYou have lost everything.\u201d</p><p>Jagrati raised her voice to a hoarse, rasping shout. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know it?\u201d The words echoed off the walls, falling into a thick silence. No one answered. She glanced around the chamber, taking in the sight of the dead and wounded with no visible emotion on her face. \u201cIs this how you mean to make the world a better place, little Rani?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jagrati,\u201d Amrita said quietly. \u201cThis is what you forced me to do, you and Lord Khaga. I take responsibility for the choice, and for the deaths of my brave men. I will not take responsibility for your sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noble.\u201d Jagrati\u2019s lip curled again. \u201cDo you know, little Rani, that the untouchables of Bhaktipur live in squalor on the outskirts of the city, tending to their dung-heaps? They are pathetically grateful to you for seeing to it that they have a well that draws clean water, since they are not allowed to use the public wells or fountains. And yet twice I had promising young lads taken to serve me, and there was no outcry, for there was nowhere for their families to turn, no one to protect them.\u201d</p><p>Amrita\u2019s brows rose. \u201cAnd you are proud of this?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI treated them as human beings, not living filth. I gave them better lives than they would have had otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou treated them as living playthings, Jagrati,\u201d Bao said. \u201cWas it a better life for those who died fighting for the honor of sharing your bed?\u201d</p><p>Jagrati laughed her dark tearing-silk laugh. \u201cAt least they died fighting for something they believed worth dying for, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieving a thing does not make it true.\u201d Bao shrugged. \u201cYou are not the only one in the world to have suffered, lady. The world can be cruel, even to men. I was sold into bondage when I was scarce more than a babe. I know what it is like to be used badly. I have not let it poison my heart.\u201d</p><p>She met his eyes. \u201cBut you have been fortunate in the companions life has given you, have you not?\u201d</p><p>Bao glanced at me, and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cHow lucky for you.\u201d Jagrati gave him her bitter smile. \u201cThe peasant-boy found a noble mentor, grew up to be a hero, and won the hand of the fair maiden.\u201d She clasped one hand over the other fist as though she meant to bow to him in the Ch\u2019in manner. \u201cThe only luck I found, I made myself. All my old life gave me was the stink of human shit and cruelty.\u201d She looked sidelong at Amrita. \u201cForgive me if I am not willing to return to a world where I must grovel when you pass lest my shadow soil your pure flesh, where I can only dream of the honor of touching your perfect feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagrati\u2014\u201d my lady Amrita began.</p><p>The Spider Queen\u2019s long-fingered hands tightened, driving her fist into her palm. \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>There were jeweled rings on almost all her fingers, gleaming in the lamplight, and belatedly I remembered the poisoner and his ring with the hidden needle. But even if anyone had been minded to stop Jagrati, it was already too late. Her tall, angular body jerked and stiffened, and she fell gracelessly, a little foam rising to her lips.</p><p>The Spider Queen of Kurugiri was dead.</p><p>SEVENTY-THREE</p><p>It was a long, difficult night.</p><p>There was a great deal of work to be done, little of it pleasant. But at least it began on an auspicious note as Pradeep came to report that the harem had been secured without any difficulty. The churlish messenger had been the only one to resist, and he was dead.</p><p>The Rani insisted on visiting it straightaway. It was crowded with women and children, and dozens of additional servants who had taken shelter there. None of them seemed to have been harmed in an obvious way, but they greeted us with profound gratitude, many of them weeping with joy and relief, overwhelmed at being rescued from captivity in Kurugiri.</p><p>I watched my lady Amrita go among them, talking to the women and some nine or ten children of varying ages, assuring them that they were safe and would be well cared for. It made me smile for what felt like the first time in years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One of the women caught my eye and returned my smile. She had Tufani features, and her smile was as gentle and radiant as dawn breaking through mist. I remembered the boy-monk in Rasa giving me a message for the yak-herder\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cAre you Laysa?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There was a little girl who looked to be five or six pressed against her side, and Laysa stroked her hair. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI met a young monk in Rasa, a..... a tulku.\u201d I dredged the word from memory. \u201cTashi Rinpoche. He said he was one of your teachers in your last lifetime together, and that it puzzled him that he was born younger than you this time. But now it makes sense, for you have lost ten years of your life. He is waiting in Rasa to teach you again.\u201d</p><p>Her radiant smile widened. \u201cThat is very good news!\u201d She kissed her daughter\u2019s brow. \u201cIs it not, my little Kamala, my little lotus?\u201d The girl nodded warily, staring at me. Her mother whispered something in her ear, making her giggle and hide her face. \u201cShe was frightened by your green eyes,\u201d Laysa said. \u201cI told her it is because you are a magical deva sent to look after us. Now she is shy.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened.</p><p>It seemed impossible that such goodness could endure and blossom in this cruel place. The world had been unkind to Laysa, mayhap not as unkind as it had been to Jagrati, but near enough. Her family had been slaughtered, and she had been forced to endure servitude in the Falconer\u2019s harem. The thought of Tarik Khaga with his hawk-nose and muscular paunch heaving and grunting atop her sickened me.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten her with child; and she loved the child. A child she had been compelled to raise in fear that one day her daughter would be forced into an incestuous union with her own cursed father.</p> <p>And still, there was joy and kindness in her smile.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you weeping, deva?\u201d Laysa inquired, hugging her daughter. \u201cToday is not a day for sorrow!\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her through my tears. \u201cJoy and sorrow both, I fear. Today has come at a cost. But I am honored to meet you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Her expression turned grave. \u201cI am sorry for your losses. I will pray for them, and for you.\u201d She regarded me with compassion. \u201cYour journey is a long one, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Laysa shook her head. \u201cI mean the journey that yet lies ahead of you.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed.</p><p>Her smile returned. \u201cDo not fear, deva. You have a very great heart, and your gods love you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin?\u201d Bao appeared at my side, sliding an arm around my waist. \u201cYou have that look on your face. Who are you falling in love with now? Some new royal lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I leaned against him, grateful for his strength. \u201cA yak-herder\u2019s daughter who is the reincarnation of one of the Enlightened Ones on the Path of Dharma. This is Laysa, and she says I have a long journey ahead of me yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Laysa said helpfully. \u201cA great ocean yet to cross.\u201d</p><p>Bao tightened his arm around me and kissed my temple, and I felt the flicker of his diadh-anam entwined with mine. \u201cGood thing you don\u2019t have to cross it alone, huh?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cA very good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you,\u201d Laysa said to Bao. \u201cYou came here looking for a green-eyed woman. Where did you find her after all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cShe found me.\u201d</p><p>That was the best part of the night. The rest of it was a nightmare of complicated logistics. We had dead and injured men within the fortress of Kurugiri, and injured men left in the winding paths of the maze where they might freeze to death. Living men who required food and rest to tend to the others. Horses left to stray outside the fortress, also requiring tending, food, and rest.</p><p>Bao shone.</p><p>He procured torches and led the expedition back into the maze to retrieve the wounded armed with blankets to serve as makeshift slings. Two of our men had not survived, but Bao\u2019s party was able to rescue four others including Hasan Dar, as well as the young lad Sudhakar, bewildered and confused at the death of Jagrati and the loss of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond\u2019s influence.</p><p>\u201cWho is our new mistress, Bao?\u201d Sudhakar asked uncertainly, glancing from me to Amrita. His broken nose had swollen and his eyes were beginning to blacken. \u201cHow are we meant to serve her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rani Amrita is your new mistress,\u201d Bao said in an absent tone, examining Hasan Dar. \u201cAnd you are meant to serve her by making yourself useful. Bring me all the bandages and medicines you can find. A basin of water and soap. And a sewing kit, and shears, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bao.\u201d The young man trotted away with alacrity.</p><p>When the fellow returned with the requested supplies, Bao cut Hasan\u2019s tunic away from the deadly round quoit that protruded from it. Despite his efforts to be gentle, the commander gave a stifled groan.</p><p>Amrita winced in sympathy. \u201cWill he live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, my lady.\u201d Bao pressed his ear to Hasan\u2019s back, listening. \u201cHis lungs are clear, so that is good.\u201d He met my eyes, looking worried. \u201cI wish Master Lo were here. Or even your damned Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your best, Master Lo\u2019s magpie,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThere are others waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need your help to sop the blood. And maybe others to hold him still. It\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d A thought came to him. \u201cSudhakar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFetch a pipe and a lamp. And opium, lots of opium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bao!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very obedient,\u201d I observed as he trotted off again.</p><p>\u201cHe was trained to be,\u201d Bao said in a flat voice.</p><p>When Sudhakar returned a second time, Bao filled the bowl of the long, slender pipe with sticky brown poppy resin, coaxing Hasan Dar to lean on one elbow and take the mouth-piece of the pipe between his lips. He then held the oil lamp beneath the bowl until a sweet-smelling smoke arose. Hasan Dar sucked gratefully on the pipe, while Bao watched with an expression somewhere between hunger and envy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d I warned him. \u201cI am not nursing you through that twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a wife yet, and already you nag,\u201d he retorted, drawing a pained chuckle from Hasan.</p><p>The opium took effect quickly. Seeing the commander\u2019s limbs relax, Bao nodded in satisfaction and beckoned to Sudhakar. \u201cTake the pipe, and see that it\u2019s given to anyone who wants it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bao!\u201d</p><p>The quoit was lodged in Hasan Dar\u2019s ribcage, closer to his back than his front, three or four inches protruding and the rest sunk deep into his flesh. After washing his hands, Bao gave it a cautious tug, wary of the razor-sharp outer edge. Hasan hissed between gritted teeth, but the thing didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI think it struck bone,\u201d Bao muttered. He glanced around. \u201cAre any of the household servants here?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cPradeep has them busy.\u201d He was in charge of rounding up food and bedding, not to mention a hundred horses left to stray.</p><p>\u201cSudhakar!\u201d Bao called. \u201cA change of plan. Do you know where his lordship keeps his hunting gear?\u201d The lad came hurrying back, nodding. \u201cGood. Fetch me a falconer\u2019s glove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bao!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Falconer really was a falconer?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not know that,\u201d Amrita remarked. She looked pale and anxious. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help, Bao?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you sew?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The Rani turned even paler. \u201cYes, but.....\u201d Her gaze skated over the quoit sticking out of Hasan Dar\u2019s side, and her expression turned determined. \u201cYes, I can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, my lady,\u201d Bao apologized. \u201cI did not mean for you to sew the commander\u2019s wound.\u201d He nodded at the sewing kit, which contained curved needles and sturdy, waxed thread. \u201cBut if you could thread a needle for me, it would be a great help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Kneeling gracefully, Amrita bent to the task, glad to be of use, her hands calm and steady.</p><p>I rubbed Hasan Dar\u2019s back in a circular motion and breathed the Breath of Ocean\u2019s Rolling Waves, the most calming of all the Five Styles. His breathing slowed to match mine, the jutting edge of the quoit rising and falling, glinting in the lamplight.</p><p>Sudhakar returned with a falconer\u2019s glove, a thick padded affair made of tough leather. Bao donned it, flexing his fingers.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked the commander, who gave a dreamy grunt of assent. Bao took hold of the steel quoit and gave it a sharp yank.</p><p>Strong as he was, it still took three yanks to free it; and there was a sharp, cracking sound as the quoit came loose, along with a hoarse cry from Hasan Dar. The wound gaped, a white shard of bone jutting out of it, blood pulsing over the commander\u2019s skin. Bao swore, tossed the quoit aside, and stripped off the glove, plucking out the bone-shard and probing the wound for others, extracting two smaller splinters with his bare hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clean,\u201d he said breathlessly. \u201cMy lady? Moirin?\u201d</p><p>I blotted the wound with clean bandages, while Amrita silently handed Bao the threaded needle.</p><p>Bao sewed.</p><p>I swabbed.</p><p>When it was done, a ragged line of stitches sealed the wound shut, the flesh seeping a little. After uncorking and sniffing different unguents and ointments, Bao chose one to slather on the wound. Together, we worked to bandage it, wrapping clean cloths around Hasan Dar\u2019s torso.</p><p>\u201cSo this is what war is like,\u201d our lady Amrita said in a low tone. \u201cIt is a very terrible thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is, my lady.\u201d Bao swiped his forearm over his brow, which was damp with sweat, then settled onto his heels. \u201cAll right.\u201d He plunged his hands into the basin of clean water, soaping and washing them as Master Lo had taught him to do. \u201cSudhakar! Tell me, who is next?\u201d</p><p>SEVENTY-FOUR</p><p>I lost count.</p><p>I do not know how many wounds I helped Bao stitch that night, how many broken bones I helped him set.</p><p>Many.</p><p>At one point, I asked him why there was no physician in the household, when surely there must have been regular injuries.</p><p>\u201cLord Khaga tended to them himself,\u201d he said, surprising me. \u201cAs did his father, and his grandfather before him. He took pride in his skill.\u201d Bao shrugged. \u201cPeople are complicated, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>There was a rebellion on the part of the Rani\u2019s guards when Bao suggested the uninjured men should transport the bodies of the dead outdoors, where the cold would preserve them from decay.</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, that is a pariah\u2019s work, Bao-ji,\u201d Pradeep said to him, shuddering. \u201cNot a warrior\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Bao narrowed his eyes at the fellow. \u201cWe are speaking of men who fought and died bravely. Those of us who survived owe them a debt of honor. Their bodies should be tended to with dignity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do it, Bao,\u201d young Sudhakar volunteered, even though he was unsteady on his feet and his nose resembled a squashed turnip. \u201cOr at least I will try. I do not mind. I was born a no one, a no-caste.\u201d</p><p>An injured guard smoking opium from a pipe Sudhakar had prepared and handed to him coughed and lowered the pipe.</p><p>The Rani Amrita raised her hand in the mudra of fearlessness, stilling the room. \u201cBao is correct,\u201d she announced. \u201cA debt of honor is owed to the dead, and we will see that each and every one is transported safely home and given a proper funeral\u2014even our enemies, in the hope that they will find a greater peace in the next life. However....\u201d She gave Bao an apologetic glance. \u201cI fear there are predators in the mountains, are there not? Leopards and such?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, highness. I hadn\u2019t thought of it, but yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not have the bodies of our dead dishonored by animals,\u201d Amrita said firmly. \u201cSo. For now, let them abide. Only know, we will be returning them to Bhaktipur; and it will be our honor to do so.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her hand.</p><p>In the silence that followed, the guard with the pipe let out a little sigh, returning the mouth-piece to his lips and beckoning to Sudhakar to hold the lamp for him.</p><p>I smiled at Amrita, who smiled wearily back at me. \u201cI think that is how you change the world, my lady,\u201d I said to her. \u201cOne small step at a time.\u201d</p><p>After many long hours, at last there was nothing urgent left to be done. Everywhere, injured and uninjured men slept on the stone floors of Kurugiri, rolled in blankets. Although she could have had her choice of either Jagrati\u2019s or Tarik Khaga\u2019s chambers, the Rani chose instead to sleep in the harem. Lest he need my assistance, I stayed with Bao in the banquet hall where he had tended to the majority of the injured.</p><p>\u201cYou were very brave today, Moirin,\u201d Bao mumbled, already half-asleep, his arm around my waist and his hand resting over the hard lump of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond stashed deep within a pocket of my coat. \u201cFacing Jagrati and that cursed thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it if you hadn\u2019t been there,\u201d I said. \u201cYou and Amrita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He yawned. \u201cBut you did do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were beyond brave, my hero.\u201d I raised his hand to my lips and kissed his battle-scarred knuckles. \u201cAnd not only for fighting boldly. You were a healer today, Bao. Many men may owe their lives to you. Master Lo Feng would be so very, very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>A soft snore answered me. Resolving to tell him again in the morning, I fell into an exhausted sleep.</p><p>In the morning, the task before us seemed even more daunting, the scope of it revealed in the harsh light of day. There were over a score of corpses to be transported down the winding mountain path, over a score of women and children in the harem to be escorted to safety, plus dozens more servants. There were over a dozen men too badly injured to be moved yet; and one more had died in the night while we slept. There were farmers and herders in the valley nestled to the northwest of the fortress yet to be consulted. There was the question of what to do with the spoils of war, the gilded trappings and fine tapestries that adorned the fortress, the coffers of jewels found in Jagrati\u2019s chambers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was the question of Kurugiri itself, and who, if anyone, should lay claim to it. By right of inheritance, it should pass to the Falconer\u2019s eldest son\u2014but none of his harem-born offspring wanted it. By right of conquest, it belonged to the Rani.</p><p>\u201cI do not want it!\u201d Amrita said, dismay in her musical voice. \u201cIt seems a cruel gift to inflict on anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let it stand empty and crumble over time back into the mountain,\u201d Bao suggested. \u201cOr give it to the valley-folk if they want it.\u201d</p> <p>They didn\u2019t.</p><p>The Rani sent an embassy led by Pradeep to address the farmers and herders in the valley. He returned to report that the folk he had talked to were pleased to know that the Falconer and the Spider Queen were no more, but that Kurugiri had a name as a cursed place, and that they would be well content to let it stand empty and live their lives in peace without being forced to tithe the lion\u2019s share of their crops and herds to the fortress.</p><p>\u201cThey are happy to grow barley and poppies and raise yaks, highness,\u201d Pradeep said with a shrug. \u201cI cannot blame them.\u201d</p><p>So it was decided; Kurugiri would be abandoned and left to stand empty, a stark reminder of the cruelty and self-absorption that could be bred in a place that combined deadly power and isolation.</p><p>After conferring with Hasan Dar, mercifully alive and surprisingly lucid, the Rani Amrita concluded that a swift messenger should be sent to Bhaktipur to let Ravindra know we had triumphed, requesting the aid of those guards left to ensure his safety. Meanwhile, the bulk of our guards would follow on a slower mission, escorting the Rani and members of the harem, and transporting the dead back to Bhaktipur.</p> <p>Bao and I would remain to tend to the wounded, assisted by members of the household staff. We would also see that a full inventory of Kurugiri\u2019s goods was conducted. Stolen treasures that could be identified, like the fist-sized ruby called the Phoenix Stone that the Tufani trader Dorje had spoken of so long ago, would be returned in time to their rightful owners. The rest would be sold, and the proceeds divided among the victims of Kurugiri.</p><p>\u201cI do not like leaving you in this place, Moirin,\u201d Amrita fretted. \u201cI would prefer to know you were home safely in Bhaktipur!\u201d</p><p>I touched her warm, smooth cheek. \u201cI know. But the danger is over, and I will be safe with Bao, my lady. For whatever reason, the gods have seen fit to join us together. Having spent the last year of my life following him to the far ends of the earth, I\u2019m not leaving him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you a long time ago that you would fall in love with me,\u201d Bao said with obnoxious good cheer, leaning on his staff. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I glanced sidelong at him. \u201cYes, O insufferable one.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled.</p> <p>My lady Amrita shook her head, her lustrous eyes shining at us. \u201cI will see you wed, the two of you. You most definitely deserve each other, eh?\u201d</p><p>We gathered the dead.</p><p>It was a long, arduous process. Limbs had stiffened in the rigor of death, and it was difficult to wind linen sheets around them. Men swore, wrestling with corpses, repenting of their harsh words only when Amrita reproached them for it.</p><p>No one wanted to touch Jagrati, so Bao and I tended to her.</p><p>Even in death, she had a terrible beauty: gaunt-faced, her sunken cheeks collapsed to the bone. I wiped the dried flecks of froth from her lips, sensing Kamadeva\u2019s diamond in my pocket singing to me. Her dead skin was ashen, but it seemed to me that her spirit lingered. Hungry for vengeance against the world that had harmed her\u2014but somewhere beneath it, I thought Jagrati hungered for acceptance, too. I remembered how she had recoiled from Amrita, and it seemed to me that it was more than the strength of the Rani\u2019s warding mudra at work there. It was due to a lifetime of Jagrati being taught that her touch was unclean and polluting. She\u2019d had no problem taking her vengeance on men, no problem touching me, a foreigner and Kamadeva\u2019s victim.</p><p>It was different with the Rani Amrita. She may have been all that Jagrati had despised, but the habits of a lifetime had overridden her hatred.</p><p>I pitied the Spider Queen, mayhap more than I ought to. When Bao asked quietly if we should remove the rings and bangles that adorned her fingers and wrists, I shook my head. \u201cLet her keep them,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s more stolen treasure than anyone needs within the walls of this bedamned place. Let her take the baubles she died wearing to the afterlife with her. Maybe it will ease her angry spirit.\u201d</p><p>Bao looked relieved. \u201cGood.\u201d</p> <p>Together, we wound Jagrati into a shroud; and both of us were relieved to have it done.</p><p>There was a blend of joy and sorrow in the procession that departed from Kurugiri when the work of gathering the dead was finished. Sorrow for the losses incurred, joy at the innocent victims liberated, the women and children of the harem who still looked happy and dazed at their good fortune. Only the tulku Laysa appeared serene and unsurprised, but nonetheless glad and grateful.</p><p>Amrita hugged me close in farewell, tears in her eyes. \u201cPromise me you will be well, Moirin! I do hate leaving you here.\u201d</p><p>I returned her embrace, kissing her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s only for a little while, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long, even so.\u201d She laughed ruefully, wiping her eyes. \u201cWe must have known one another in a different life, eh? Or else how could you have become so dear to me so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin does,\u201d Bao informed her. I gave him a sharp look, and he grinned at me. \u201cWhat? You do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Amrita agreed. \u201cSo, my bad boy Bao! You will keep her safe for all of us, eh?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his palms together and bowed to the Rani. \u201cI have determined it is my life\u2019s work, highness.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>Bao snuck a glance at me, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cHe only pretends to jest,\u201d Amrita observed, her hands forming a mudra. \u201cBut I will hold you to your promise, Bao-ji. And I will remind you that it is Moirin who came here to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>He sobered. \u201cI do not forget it, highness. I will not ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is well, then.\u201d Amrita\u2019s radiant smile returned, her irrepressible laughter chiming like golden bells. \u201cAnd I shall have great fun planning your wedding!\u201d</p><p>Together, Bao and I watched the Rani Amrita and her procession depart, entering the long, winding labyrinth, men on foot and men on horseback, some riding double with women or children behind them in the saddle, some carrying terrible burdens, escorting the joyful living with care, carrying the lamented dead with dignity and honor\u2014and the unlamented dead, too.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>Bao kissed me, his lips lingering on mine. \u201cThe Rani was right, Moirin. I was not jesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I stroked the nape of his neck, feeling the strong sinew drawn tight beneath his skin. Naamah\u2019s gift stirred in me, and Kamadeva\u2019s diamond sang to it; but it was not right yet. Not here, not now. \u201cShall we go count some jewels?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTY-FIVE</p><p>Taking inventory of Kurugiri\u2019s treasures was a prodigious task. The coffers in Jagrati\u2019s private chambers alone revealed untold wealth.</p><p>\u201cStone and sea!\u201d I plucked out an impossibly long strand of pearls the size of quail eggs, each one perfectly spherical and uniform in shape, shimmering with an iridescent pinkish hue. \u201cHow would someone even wear such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooped three times around the neck, Moirin,\u201d Bao said briefly. \u201cSudhakar, make a note. One strand of pearls, three arm-lengths long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bao!\u201d the young man said eagerly, adding in an apologetic tone, \u201cOnly, I cannot write.\u201d</p><p>We found someone who could, since Bao could write only in Ch\u2019in characters, and I could write only in the Western alphabet, neither of which the Bhodistani could read.</p><p>One by one, we catalogued the pieces in Jagrati\u2019s coffers.</p><p>A gold filigree hairpiece set with emeralds, another set with sapphires and seed pearls.</p><p>An ornamental dagger with three large emeralds forming the hilt, sheathed in a golden scabbard encrusted with diamonds.</p><p>Countless gold and silver bangles and anklets.</p><p>A collar wrought of rubies and diamonds crafted in the shape of glittering flowers with blood-red centers.</p><p>Rings set with every manner of gemstone.</p><p>Gaudy and elaborate brooches dripping with jewels.</p><p>On and on it went, an endless and dazzling array. We found the famous Phoenix Stone, the immense ruby for which the Maharaja of Chodur and his bride had been slain, tucked away in the corner of a coffer and forgotten.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just jewelry, either. There were shelves of jewel-bright miniature paintings on ivory panels depicting warriors riding to battle on the backs of elephants, hunters on horseback cornering a tiger, opulent scenes of court life. There were the gilded lamps and braziers, many of the former encrusted with gems. There were decorative vessels carved from ivory and carnelian. We found an entire trunk of gilded bronze votive figures depicting the Bhodistani pantheon in intricate detail.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Jagrati want these stolen for her?\u201d I asked in bewilderment, holding a many-armed statue of the goddess Durga. \u201cShe claimed to hate the gods.\u201d</p><p>Bao glanced at it. \u201cI don\u2019t think this was all her doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a fair bit of treasure already here. Lord Khaga let her claim what she wished, and when she tired of it, he got her more.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt would be like her to claim images of gods and hide them away. Having been denied access to them all her life, it would please her to deny them to others. I never knew what was in that trunk,\u201d he added. \u201cI never saw her open it.\u201d</p><p>It reminded me in an unpleasant way that Bao must have spent a great deal of time in this bedchamber. He had been one of her favorites.</p><p>Seeing the thought on my face, he looked away. \u201cLet\u2019s just keep going, huh?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOne gilded statue of Durga with.....\u201d I counted. \u201cEighteen arms,\u201d I said to Govind, the elderly steward who was recording the inventory for us.</p><p>After we had finished with Jagrati\u2019s hoard, there was the rest of the fortress to catalogue. Mostly its valuable furnishings consisted of furniture and wall-hangings, but there was an extensive set of gold serving-ware inlaid with precious stones that took a long time. There were still the injured men to tend to, which delayed the process, although happily, the wounded were progressing well.</p><p>Altogether, the inventory took days, and when we were done, I didn\u2019t care if I never saw another piece of jewelry or treasure again.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Bao smiled a little when I announced it. \u201cA good thing, since I don\u2019t have any money to keep you in gold and jewels.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cOr any money at all, really. I don\u2019t have much to offer you, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have yourself, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d I hesitated, unconsciously fingering the awkward lump of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond in my pocket. \u201cBut..... Bao, do you think Jagrati\u2019s shadow is always going to be between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He ran a hand over his hair, which he\u2019d cropped into its former unruly shock before leaving Bhaktipur\u2014although the gold hoops remained in his earlobes. I hadn\u2019t asked why. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. But being here.....\u201d He shuddered. \u201cThere are too many memories. When we go, I mean to leave them behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take them from you,\u201d I offered quietly. \u201cIf you wished it.\u201d</p><p>After only the briefest of pauses, Bao shook his head. \u201cGood men died to remove Jagrati and Lord Khaga from this world. To rid myself of those memories would dishonor their sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cFunny, that\u2019s very much what Snow Tiger said when I made her the same offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer bridegroom\u2019s death?\u201d he asked in a hushed tone. I nodded. \u201cNo, she wouldn\u2019t dishonor his memory, would she? Not our Noble Princess.\u201d Bao met my eyes. \u201cI did not suffer anything so terrible as that here in Kurugiri. I am not proud of the things I did, or the man I was here, but since I found the strength to walk away when I needed it, on some level, I must have chosen this. So I will keep my memories, and learn to grow stronger from them. I did not murder anyone, if you are wondering,\u201d he added. \u201cI did not become an assassin, a killer of innocents.\u201d</p><p>I had been wondering, but I didn\u2019t let him know it. \u201cYou would not have let that happen,\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>Bao\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cI like to think it is true. But in truth, I was never ordered to do so.\u201d</p><p>I took his hand, lacing my fingers through his. \u201cBao..... there is a wellspring of relentless pride and nobility hidden in you. No matter how much you try to suppress it, it bubbles to the surface. That is why you did not become a killer of innocents. It is why you did your best to protect someone like poor Sudhakar; and why you walked away from your life as a prince of thugs to become Master Lo\u2019s magpie.\u201d I squeezed his hand, hard. \u201cAnd it is one of the reasons I love you.\u201d</p><p>Averting his head, Bao gazed at our entwined fingers; then gave me a glinting look under his lashes. \u201cWhat are the other reasons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me laugh,\u201d I said promptly. He scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s true! And it\u2019s worth more than you reckon. In Vralia, it helped keep me sane. I imagined you counseling me when the Patriarch was demanding my endless confession, especially when it came to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d he asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cYou said, \u2018Tell the stunted old pervert whatever he wants to hear, Moirin, and I will bash his head in when I have a chance.\u2019\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd then you grew indignant because Pyotr Rostov did not press for details about your prowess in bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat does sound like me,\u201d Bao admitted.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRemember on the greatship?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cYou said you were afraid my destiny would swallow you whole. Gods, Bao! I\u2019m afraid of my own destiny. It\u2019s been a hard one thus far, and if the tulku is right, it\u2019s far from over. But at every crossroad, you\u2019ve never hesitated. Not once.\u201d</p><p>His hand stirred in mine. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I left you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThat was a different kind of crossroad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I freed my hand from his, laying one hand on his hard, firm chest and one on my own, feeling our shared diadh-anam twine and flicker. \u201cThis destiny, Master Lo laid upon us both. You had to find your own way to accept it, and I think I needed the time and distance to be certain of my own feelings, too. And..... I don\u2019t know, Bao. Mayhap the gods prompted him to do so. It has led us to bad places, dark places. Riva. Kurugiri. Even so, good things have come of it. I do believe what we have done serves the greater good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe no-castes,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe untouchables.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Bao\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cWe\u2019re not done here yet, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Two days later, the second company of guards arrived from Bhaktipur, and we set about organizing the last exodus from the fortress. All in all, there were fourteen wounded men to transport, along with several dozen servants, and the bulk of the treasure we had inventoried, saving only for the larger pieces of furniture.</p><p>Half of the injured had recovered to the point where they could sit a horse; the other half would require litters, which the new guards had brought.</p> <p>Bao\u2019s greatest concern was the cold. Hampered by the slow pace necessitated by navigating the awkward litters down the winding path without jarring the wounded, there was little chance we could manage the descent in a single day. Once night fell, we\u2019d be trapped in the maze, the temperature plummeting. It would be a hardship for all of us, but it could take a deadly toll on the wounded men.</p><p>\u201cCould we keep going by torchlight?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cBetter to rest and conserve chi energy. The cold will sap it and weaken them. I wish we had more blankets.\u201d</p><p>I remembered how Bao and I had slept with the Rani between us at the foot of the mountain, sharing our warmth with her. \u201cTell them to huddle up,\u201d I suggested. \u201cAssign two healthy fellows to every injured man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cIt will be funny to see grown men curled up together like puppies in a litter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not funny when it was me and Amrita,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bao grinned. \u201cThat would have been quite pleasant if it were not for the freezing cold and the sentries giving false alarms all night long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are two very large \u2018ifs,\u2019 my magpie,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I cannot argue the point.\u201d</p> <p>The following morning, we began our descent; and it was every bit as halting and torturous a process as I had imagined. Bao took the lead, with me behind him. Behind me was Hasan Dar, who insisted on riding against Bao\u2019s counsel. I could hear the breath hiss through his teeth at every jolting step as we rounded the hairpin turns.</p><p>The long train of guards, servants, litters, and pack-horses stretched behind us, abandoning the mostly empty shell of the fortress.</p><p>I would be glad to see the last of Kurugiri.</p><p>We made it a good two-thirds of the way down the mountain before the light began to fade in the sky above us and shadows settled into the deep crevasses of the maze, making it impossible to read the symbols etched on the walls.</p><p>Bao called a halt. Some of the men had laughed self-consciously when he had ordered them earlier to huddle up come nightfall, pairing two each with an injured fellow. None of them laughed now as the day\u2019s meager warmth fled.</p><p>It was an awkward business, made all the more so by the fact that our mounts were trapped in the labyrinth with us. Bao hobbled his lead mount, which was all that was needful; the path was too narrow for another horse to pass. My mare Lady gave me a mournful look, sensing no food or water in the offing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, brave heart.\u201d I stroked her muzzle. \u201cIt was too difficult to arrange in the maze. Tomorrow, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Bao squeezed past his mount to join me, and together we slipped past Lady to assist Hasan Dar, who dismounted with difficulty, his legs trembling.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I so cursed weak?\u201d he asked in a fierce tone.</p><p>\u201cBecause you lost a great deal of blood and nearly died, commander,\u201d Bao said in a matter-of-fact tone. \u201cAnd the latter is still a possibility.\u201d He spread a blanket on the stony floor of the path. \u201cRest, and eat if you can. Moirin and I will share our warmth with you, and hopefully the horses will not trample us in our sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cHorses have more sense than that.\u201d</p><p>There were skins of water for the humans, and the roasted barley-grains mixed with yak-butter that was a staple in the mountains, reminding me of the trader Dorje and his kind wife Nyima, who had prepared a packet of the stuff for me. I rolled it into a ball, coaxing Hasan Dar to eat when he protested that he was too tired and not hungry anyway.</p><p>By the time the last traces of red had vanished from the sky, the cold intensified. Any heat lingering in the stone beneath us was gone. It was cold and hard, leaching the warmth from our flesh. Hasan Dar began to shiver violently. Bao and I pressed close against him, two blankets over us, taking turns breathing the Breath of Embers Glowing.</p><p>It was a very, very long night.</p><p>In the morning, the commander was feverish, his brow shining and damp in the cold air. \u201cForgive me, Bao-ji,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not sure I have the strength to ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to!\u201d Bao scowled at him. \u201cNow you have no choice.\u201d He cupped his hands together. \u201cCome, I will help you into the saddle. We\u2019ll tie you in place. Moirin, there is rope in my packs.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed past Lady to retrieve it, and together Bao and I lashed Hasan Dar into his saddle.</p><p>Off we set once more, trailing guards and servants and the spoils of war, the Rani\u2019s commander lurching in the saddle behind us.</p><p>It is not a journey I would care to repeat, ever.</p><p>But we succeeded in emerging from the maze by midday, our company spreading out around the base of the mountain. Although the wounded were groaning in their litters, all had survived. Relief suffused Bao\u2019s features.</p><p>\u201cWe should keep going,\u201d I murmured to him when the last stragglers stumbled out of the maze. \u201cWe need to reach that plateau before night if we want to make a proper camp\u2014and I think we do.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, gazing upward. \u201cOne moment.\u201d</p><p>From this vantage point, the stone fortress was hidden; but it was there. Kurugiri. The spirits of generations of rulers styling themselves the Falconer haunted it, sending assassins to do their bidding. The vengeful spirit of the Spider Queen haunted it: the dark lady Jagrati, despising the world and speaking bitter truth to it.</p><p>I watched Bao.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt is done. I am done with this place, forever.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTY-SIX</p><p>After Kurugiri, we got Hasan Dar into a litter, where he tossed and turned, restless with fever.</p><p>We made camp on the arid plateau, which seemed a paradise after sleeping on the mountainside. Tents were pitched against the worst of the cold, pegs pounded into the hard earth. Supplies were shared, our mounts fed and watered, albeit in a miserly fashion.</p><p>Bao examined Hasan Dar\u2019s wound and found it red and inflamed, flesh swelling around the stitches. \u201cStupid man,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI told you not to ride. Did you think I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about?\u201d</p><p>The commander\u2019s reply was incoherent.</p><p>\u201cListen to me!\u201d Bao slapped his cheek lightly. \u201cThe Rani Amrita needs you; her son, Ravindra, needs you. If they are going to change the world, they need a strong arm beside them. So stay with us, huh?\u201d</p><p>Hasan Dar shivered. \u201cI will try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry harder,\u201d Bao said ruthlessly.</p><p>For a mercy, Hasan was the only one of the injured to have taken a serious turn for the worse. The others would endure.</p><p>\u201cPride,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt will be his downfall if he does not survive. Take it to heart, my magpie.\u201d</p><p>Bao gave me a sidelong look. \u201cIs that a warning, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shrugged, too tired to argue. \u201cI don\u2019t know, mayhap it is. I only know you would have insisted on the same in his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayhap,\u201d Bao mused. \u201cI will think on it.\u201d</p><p>Downward.</p><p>The air thickened and grew richer the next day, as we wound our way out of the heights, wound our way toward the meadow that lay beneath the Sleeping Calf Rock. I watched gladness settle onto the faces of the servants of Kurugiri. And two days later, as we descended into the fairy-tale valley of Bhaktipur with its warm air and lush, verdant growth, that gladness gave way to wonder.</p><p>\u201cIs this real?\u201d the steward Govind asked in awe.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d I smiled at his expression. \u201cAnd the Rani Amrita has promised that all of you will be well cared for here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long!\u201d Sudhakar breathed. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten how lovely it was. Only I wonder.....\u201d His brows furrowed. \u201cHow shall I live here?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought about the implications of this homecoming for him. Sudhakar was one of the no-caste lads that Jagrati had taken from the untouchable camp outside the city, the only one to have survived. Leaning over in the saddle, I laid my hand over his. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sudhakar. The Rani will take care of you, too.\u201d</p><p>Sudhakar flinched away from my touch and didn\u2019t respond. In my mind, I heard the soft, tearing rasp of Jagrati\u2019s laughter. The habits of a lifetime died hard.</p><p>That and Hasan Dar\u2019s deteriorating condition were the two shadows that lay over our return to Bhaktipur. Our procession was spotted making its way along the valley, and by the time we reached the outskirts of the city, there was a royal reception awaiting us with Pradeep and a company of guards, and the Rani Amrita herself standing before her palanquin, glowing in a purple sari embroidered with gold, Ravindra resplendent beside her in a saffron tunic and loose breeches, a purple turban on his head.</p><p>Both of them were smiling so brightly, it made my heart ache.</p><p>Bao and I dismounted to approach on foot. When we were yet a few paces away, Amrita laughed and ran forward, flinging her arms around my neck and kissing me. \u201cOh, Moirin! I am so glad you\u2019re here. I hated leaving you in that place.\u201d She glanced around, past Bao and Ravindra exchanging bows and grinning at one another. \u201cIs everyone here? Is everyone safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is here,\u201d I said. \u201cBut Hasan Dar is very ill, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no!\u201d Spotting his litter, Amrita hurried over and dropped to her knees beside it. Pradeep hurried after her with a length of silk for her to kneel on, but she ignored it, reaching into the litter to take Hasan\u2019s hand. \u201cNo, no, my friend,\u201d she chided him. \u201cThis is no good! You must get well.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids cracked open and a faint smile lifted his parched lips. \u201cNow that you have commanded it, I\u2019m sure I shall, highness.\u201d</p><p>Amrita rose. \u201cLet us make haste to the palace,\u201d she said to Pradeep. \u201cDid you tell the physician to meet us in the barracks?\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cI did, highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She gave a brisk nod, then turned to address the servants of Kurugiri. \u201cIf you wish, places for all of you will be found in my household. I find we are quite shorthanded since taking in the Falconer\u2019s harem.\u201d</p><p>All save one of them looked profoundly relieved. I don\u2019t think they had let themselves believe until that moment.</p><p>Only Sudhakar was not gazing at the Rani with gratitude. He was not gazing at the Rani at all, but kneeling and touching his brow to the ground. \u201cHighness?\u201d he asked in a muffled voice. \u201cYou know what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Amrita said firmly. \u201cYou are the young man who assisted Bao-ji tirelessly in tending to my injured warriors. You are the young man who offered to tend to the dead with honor.\u201d Stooping, she put her hand on his shoulder and gave it a little shake. \u201cAnd there is a place in my household for you, too. Perhaps you would like to be my physician\u2019s apprentice, eh?\u201d</p><p>A great shudder racked him, and he gave a single hoarse sob. The Rani straightened. Sudhakar knelt upright, gazing at her lovely face. She smiled at him. Bowing his head once more, he reached out with trembling hands and touched her bare feet in respect and gratitude. \u201cThank you, highness,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>In my mind, Jagrati\u2019s dark laughter fell silent.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Amrita patted his head. \u201cOnly let us hurry, shall we? For Hasan Dar\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Sudhakar leapt to his feet, his face shining. \u201cYes, highness!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really possible to hurry through the crowded, narrow streets of Bhaktipur, especially with hundreds of folk turned out to observe the royal procession and the last of the returning heroes, but we did our best. When they saw the litters and the injured men within them, the Bhaktipuri people called out blessings, laying garlands of dried flowers on them. By the time we reached the palace, Hasan Dar was half-buried beneath a carpet of blossoms.</p><p>One by one, the wounded guards were transported by their bearers into the barracks. Amrita gazed after them, worried.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll be all right, Bao-ji?\u201d Ravindra asked. \u201cAll of them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am worried about Hasan Dar, young highness,\u201d Bao said honestly. \u201cBut he is strong, and a fighter.\u201d He smiled at Ravindra. \u201cAnd your mother has ordered him to get well. I know he wishes to obey her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama-ji said you saved many lives,\u201d Ravindra said in a respectful tone.</p><p>\u201cI tried.\u201d Bao stretched out his hands, regarding them. \u201cMy mentor Master Lo could have done better, much better. But I did my best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is all anyone can do,\u201d Ravindra said with dignity, his small face very serious beneath his purple turban. \u201cI think you did very well indeed.\u201d</p><p>Amrita gave me a sparkling sidelong glance, and I smiled back at her, thinking that these two were truly very good for one another. \u201cCome!\u201d She clapped her hands together. \u201cLet us leave the horses to the stablehands and the treasure to the porters, and get everyone inside. You must all be very tired and hungry after your journey.\u201d</p><p>To be sure, I was.</p><p>It was a relief, a blessed relief, to be back in this place where I had found sanctuary after a long ordeal; and with the shadow of the threat of Kurugiri\u2019s assassins lifted, it truly was a place of sanctuary once more.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how Amrita went about settling her expanded staff within her expanded household, and I didn\u2019t care. It was enough for now to know that she did. I trusted my golden Rani to keep her word.</p> <p>In the chamber I shared with Bao, I removed the pouch containing the necklace with Kamadeva\u2019s diamond from my pocket. It weighed heavy in my hand, singing softly to me. Although I\u2019d thought myself jaded on treasure, this was no mortal gem. I had the urge to open the pouch and look at it once more, to gaze on the dark, shifting embers at the black diamond\u2019s core. In Kurugiri and on the journey, there had been no time to think about it.</p><p>Now I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how it would look around my neck, what I would be like wielding it.</p><p>\u201cTempted, Moirin?\u201d Bao was watching me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I set the pouch down quickly on a dressing table. \u201cJust..... wondering. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>He came over to me. \u201cYou wonder what you would be like?\u201d I nodded. Bao touched my cheek with his fingertips. \u201cYou would be desirable beyond bearing,\u201d he said soberly. \u201cYou already incite powerful desire. Were you to don Kamadeva\u2019s diamond, I think no one would be able to resist you, for the diamond would reflect your own considerable passions back at them. Men would walk through fire for the chance to touch your skin\u2014and women, too. Men would gladly fight to the death for your favor without being asked. I daresay you couldn\u2019t stop them from doing it. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I said. \u201cOf course not.\u201d And it was true, almost entirely true; but there was a tiny piece of me that said otherwise. The vanity and pride that was wounded by the fact that I had wanted Raphael de Mereliot more than he had wanted me; by the fact that I\u2019d failed to seduce Aleksei in Vralia; even the fact that my lady Amrita had only offered herself to me out of compassion.</p> <p>But I could envision the Maghuin Dhonn Herself turning away from me in reproach, Her eyes filled with immense sorrow and regret.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI will ask the Rani for a coffer with a strong lock, and I will put Kamadeva\u2019s diamond in it and throw away the key. Let the priests worry about opening it when it is returned to the temple.\u201d</p><p>Bao smiled. \u201cI think that is wise. Such powerful objects are dangerous to mere mortals, even ones with the blood of the goddess of desire running in their veins.\u201d</p><p>I put my arms around his neck. \u201cDesirable beyond bearing, hmm?\u201d</p><p>He nodded gravely, arms circling my waist. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him. \u201cI would like to have a bath, and a very large meal, and then I would like to sleep in a warm bed, possibly for two days straight through. After that, I would very much like to hear more about these strong desires I incite. Does that sound reasonable to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Moirin.\u201d Bao\u2019s dark eyes glinted, and he bent his head to return my kiss. \u201cVery, very reasonable.\u201d</p><p>His diadh-anam flickered against mine, gentle as a caress. Kamadeva\u2019s diamond sang in its pouch, and somewhere the bright lady smiled.</p> <p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d I said with relief.</p><p>SEVENTY-SEVEN</p><p>A s it was, it took only a single night\u2019s sleep to restore me to a semblance of normalcy; and we awoke to good news.</p><p>\u201cHasan Dar\u2019s fever broke in the night,\u201d the Rani Amrita informed us at the breakfast table, her face beaming. \u201cHis wound needs to drain yet, but the physician thinks he will recover fully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased to hear it, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The light in her face faded a bit. \u201cThere have been far too many deaths already, eh?\u201d</p><p>Bao heaped his plate with eggs cooked with vegetables and spices, warm flatbread, and savory fried lentil-cakes filled with pickled achar. \u201cWhat of the others, highness?\u201d</p><p>It brought back her vibrant smile. \u201cWell, all are healing well!\u201d</p><p>While we ate, Amrita and Ravindra told us what had transpired in our absence. It had caused a great scandal that Pradeep and the guards had transported the bodies of the fallen to the temple of funeral pyres, both their highnesses accompanying them. Although the Rani had not made a formal announcement rescinding the policy of treating no-caste persons as untouchable, the rumor was circulating, and opinion was divided.</p><p>\u201cI have been taking counsel with priests,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them are quite horrified at the prospect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not all of them,\u201d Ravindra added. \u201cMy tutor is of the priestly caste, and he and I have been studying the sacred Vedas.\u201d He inclined his head to me. \u201cI think you may be right, Moirin-ji.\u201d</p><p>I bit into a sweet, fried dumpling and swallowed. \u201cHow so, highness?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the oldest of the Vedas, there is no mention of no-castes,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cOnly the four castes. And in some places, one might almost infer that it is possible for someone born to one caste to rise to another through study, and worship, and clean and proper living. I would not dare to make such a claim, but my tutor thinks it is possible. So. That is why I think you may be right, and sometimes men have put words in the mouths of the gods, shaping the world to their liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been speaking with Laysa, too,\u201d Amrita said, steepling her fingers in a mudra of contemplation. \u201cShe tells me that Sakyamuni the Enlightened One rejected the notion of caste when he founded the Path of Dharma.\u201d She smiled in wonderment. \u201cAlthough she has no formal religious training yet in this lifetime, she has carried great wisdom with her into this incarnation. She tells me she remembers hearing the Enlightened One himself speak about this matter many lifetimes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you think to do the same, my lady?\u201d I asked her. \u201cReject the notion of caste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The Rani Amrita shook her head, eardrops tinkling softly. \u201cIt is the way our world is ordered, dear one, and that is clear in the Vedas. But I am very interested in this notion that caste is not rigid and fixed, that the challenge of one\u2019s kharma is not only to obey and endure one\u2019s fate, but to transcend it. And I am interested in finding ways to help people do so, especially the less fortunate ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart a school,\u201d Bao said around a mouthful of eggs. I raised my brows at him. He swallowed hastily and wiped his mouth. \u201cForgive me, highness. But if you wish to lift people up, the best way is to teach them. Before I met Master Lo Feng, I knew nothing but an acrobat\u2019s tricks and stick-fighting. He taught me to read and write, mathematics, enough of a physician\u2019s trade to make myself useful. He taught me the path of the Way, taught me to think and reason and meditate, to focus my mind and will. I became a different person because of what Master Lo taught me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach them,\u201d Amrita echoed.</p><p>Bao nodded. \u201cFrom that one thing, ten thousand things will arise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this notion,\u201d the Rani said decisively, and Ravindra nodded in agreement. \u201cOnly..... I think I shall wait until Hasan Dar is recovered to announce any sweeping changes, eh? Pradeep is a good man, but not as strong-willed and courageous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think there will be trouble, my lady?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat folk will protest and resist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome will,\u201d she said soberly. \u201cIt is inevitable. Both priests on high, angry at having their authority undermined, and low-caste workers, resentful at having to share their ranking with folk they despise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are minded to do this?\u201d Bao asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Amrita\u2019s lovely face was set and grave. \u201cI am. The gods sent three women all bearing the same message to me. First Moirin, then Jagrati, and now the tulku Laysa. I cannot turn a deaf ear to them.\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cMaybe when men fail to heed them, the gods turn at last to women, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took them long enough,\u201d I observed.</p><p>Amrita shook her head at me in mild reproach. \u201cThe time of gods is not like the time of mortals, dear one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d I ate another of the sweet, fried dumplings. \u201cSo are Laysa and her daughter staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Only through the winter. When the high passes are clear, I will send them to Rasa with an escort. The others are staying,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I smiled. \u201cSo you\u2019re keeping the harem.\u201d</p><p>My lady Amrita laughed and flushed the slightest bit, narrowing her lustrous eyes at me. \u201cI am not keeping the harem, Moirin. They could not return home after what they have endured, for their families would reckon them disgraced. I have offered them sanctuary here, and they have accepted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Mama-ji keep a harem?\u201d Ravindra asked in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cMoirin was only teasing,\u201d Bao informed him.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He continued to look puzzled.</p><p>\u201cIt is a grown-up kind of teasing, jewel of my heart,\u201d Amrita said to him. \u201cA very D\u2019Angeline kind of teasing.\u201d</p><p>Ravindra shrugged his narrow shoulders. \u201cAnyway, it is very nice. It\u2019s almost as though we have the big family you always missed, isn\u2019t it, Mama-ji?\u201d he asked. She nodded. \u201cWould you like to come see?\u201d he inquired. \u201cWe have opened a whole row of chambers along the lower level of the garden that have been closed for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like that very much, young highness,\u201d I said.</p><p>After breaking our fast, we strolled in the great central courtyard garden. Although it was warm in the sunlight, there were no flowers blossoming in the winter months, but it was lush and green nonetheless, filled with towering rhododendrons that would be spectacular in bloom, and the immense banyan trees with their gnarled roots. Monkeys leapt and chattered in their branches, and birds with emerald, scarlet, and blue plumage flitted from tree to tree like living jewels.</p><p>And beneath them, children laughed and chased one another, watched by indulgent mothers. Chamber doors that had been sealed for years for lack of inhabitants opened onto patios where the women of the Falconer\u2019s harem sat and sipped tea or the spiced yoghurt drink called lassi, chatting with one another while keeping half an eye on the playing children.</p><p>The women greeted the Rani Amrita with glad smiles and deep bows, palms pressed together.</p><p>The young Prince Ravindra was hailed with bows and happy shouts, especially from the older boys, who quickly swarmed him and Bao, all yelling at once. It was obvious that Bao\u2019s fighting prowess had been the topic of much conversation, but only Ravindra had seen him in action.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Bao cupped his ear. \u201cSurely, you don\u2019t think his highness exaggerates!\u201d He scoffed, freeing the bamboo staff lashed across his back with a quick twist. \u201cStand back and watch.\u201d</p><p>Bao put on a show for them, fighting an imaginary opponent\u2014ten imaginary opponents. He whirled like a dervish, the staff spinning in his hands until it was as blurred as a dragonfly\u2019s wings. He crouched low, his staff sweeping the grass. He leapt high, lashing out with both feet in opposite directions and his staff in a third. He hurled his body in the sideways spinning kick parallel to the ground that seemed to defy the laws of nature. Bao vaulted and somersaulted, turned handsprings and backsprings, sending his staff soaring high into the air and catching it upon landing upright once more.</p><p>The children shrieked with delight, raising a deafening cacophony that made me smile and wince at once.</p><p>The women clapped for him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite something, your bad boy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Amrita took my arm, smiling. \u201cMoirin, would you consider staying here, you and Bao? It would please me very much if you made Bhaktipur your home.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, not wanting to refuse outright, a part of me not wanting to refuse at all.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d She squeezed my arm. \u201cRavindra dotes on him, eh? Your bad boy makes my serious boy smile. And you.....\u201d She searched my face, shook her head and laughed her chiming laugh. \u201cYou are a little bit of a great many things to me, young goddess, and I do not know how to name the sum of its parts. I only know that I am very, very fond of you, and I would rather not lose you.\u201d</p><p>Since Bao and I had been reunited here, I had not consulted our shared diadh-anam. Now I did. It whispered the same message it had at our first reunion in the Tatar encampment a year ago. And it was not urgent, but it was persistent.</p><p>West, it called to us. Westward.</p><p>Somewhere, oceans beckoned.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t, Amrita,\u201d I whispered, tears in my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t. I wish I could, because whatever home means to me anymore, it is so very far away. If I could call any other place home, it would be this place with you and Bao and Ravindra in it. But I can\u2019t. The gods are not finished with me. And..... and I miss my mother, too.\u201d I sniffled. \u201cI hate to think of her never knowing what became of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Moirin!\u201d Amrita fussed over me, wiping my tears away with the draped hem of her sari. \u201cOf course you do. Forgive me, I did not mean to make this harder for you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her through my tears. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt was a kindness. And I am always grateful for your kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Unexpectedly, Amrita kissed my lips, sweetly and gently. \u201cYes, I know. I have not forgotten. Your demonstration of gratitude was very memorable. Will your gods let you stay a while, at least? Until spring comes? It will be much easier to travel then. I would be grateful for your aid in changing the world, Moirin. And I have promised to see you and your Bao wed. I would like to see it done when all the flowers are in bloom.\u201d</p><p>My diadh-anam did not speak against it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said gratefully. \u201cWe will stay until spring.\u201d</p><p>Bao fetched up alongside us, sweat glistening on his brown skin. \u201cI am too old for such acrobatics,\u201d he announced. \u201cIt makes my bones ache. Moirin, why are you crying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause we will have to leave this place,\u201d I said.</p><p>He frowned and glanced unerringly toward the west. \u201cNot yet, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I rubbed my face. \u201cBut it makes me sad to think on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Bao stroked my back. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to make the most of our time here, all right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat we will.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTY-EIGHT</p> <p>Alone in the bedchamber with Bao that night, I found myself feeling suddenly and unwontedly shy for the first time since..... ever.</p><p>It had been so long since we\u2019d been intimate, and so much had happened to us both. He had survived Kurugiri and Jagrati\u2019s favoritism. I had been the instrument of Naamah\u2019s blessing, and the near-victim of Kamadeva\u2019s diamond. As much as I wanted this, I didn\u2019t know how to be an ordinary, mortal lover anymore.</p><p>Bao sensed my uncertainty. \u201cDo you want to wait until after we\u2019re wed?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can if you can. I have great strength of will, you know,\u201d he added, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I took his hand, traced the creases on his callused palm. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just.....\u201d I shrugged, lacking words. \u201cI feel strange. Unlike myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Bao tugged me close to him. I slid my arms around his waist, pressing my palms against his back, burying my face against his shoulder. He held me and breathed the Breath of Earth\u2019s Pulse, one hand sliding through my hair, lifting it and letting it fall, a motion rhythmic and soothing, as though he were petting a cat. \u201cDo you know why I was unkind to you when we first met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you hated Raphael de Mereliot,\u201d I said in a muffled voice. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think I was deserving of Master Lo\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>He laughed deep in his chest. \u201cTrue. But there was another reason. I did not like D\u2019Angelines very much. They think so highly of themselves, of their beauty.\u201d His fingers slid through my hair, rising and falling. \u201cMaybe it would have been different if I\u2019d let myself get to know some of them. Too proud, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably didn\u2019t encourage it,\u201d I murmured.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bao agreed. \u201cBut I did not find them all so beautiful, either. To a Ch\u2019in eye, it is a hard, sharp beauty, deadly as a blade. You..... you were different. You looked like them and unlike them all at once, a more subtle blade, exotic to them, but a blend of the familiar and the strange to me.\u201d He lifted my face, stroked my cheekbones with his thumbs. \u201cYou wanted me to speak of desire, Moirin? You were the most desirable woman I\u2019ve ever seen, and I resented you for it. Foolish, but true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He kissed me softly, and I felt Naamah\u2019s gift stirring at last. Doves\u2014the wings fluttering in my belly were doves, not ravens. \u201cIf I were a poet, I would write poems of praise to your golden skin and ebony hair and green, green eyes,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cBut I am not a poet, Moirin. Only a peasant-boy risen high above his station.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened. \u201cNo, you are a great deal more than that, my magpie.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked. \u201cOh, aye?\u201d he asked, mimicking my inflection. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d I wound my arms around his neck and kissed his lips. The feeling of strangeness had fled. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>Bao\u2019s eyes gleamed in the lamplight.</p><p>The bright lady smiled.</p><p>It was slow and gentle and glorious. Cupping my face, Bao kissed me until I was dizzy with pleasure, his tongue delving into my mouth, teasing my own. Our flickering diadh-anams entwined in a private celebration, echoing the dance of our bodies. Liquid heat uncoiled in the pit of my belly, spreading languorously to my limbs. With careful reverence, he unpinned my sari, unwinding its complicated folds, kissing the skin he unveiled. The hollow of my throat, my collarbones.</p><p>Sinking to his knees before me, Bao traced patterns on my taut skin with the tip of his tongue, probing my navel and making me giggle breathlessly. He tugged down my fine linen underskirt, his deft tongue parting my nether-lips and darting between them.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I caught my breath, sinking my hands into his hair. My knees felt weak. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do that, I cannot keep my feet.\u201d</p><p>He rose gracefully, his hands catching the hem of my cropped undershirt and easing it over my head, caressing my aching breasts in the process. \u201cLie down on the bed.\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>Bao gazed at me, hot-eyed and infinitely patient. After all, my boasting boy did have great strength of will. He stripped off his tunic, revealing a sculpted brown torso corded with lean muscle. He shucked his loose breeches, his tight flanks rippling, more lean muscle on his thighs and calves. Ah, gods! He had a gorgeous body, the most beautiful I\u2019d ever seen on a man. His erect phallus was drawn as tight as a bowstring, curving toward his flat belly, the swollen head as dark and ripe as a plum.</p><p>As he slid into bed, I reached for him.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Bao shifted, straddling my body and pinning my arms. \u201cI need to relearn you. Every part of you.\u201d He smiled down at me with rare sweetness. \u201cIt is part of learning to live in brightness, Moirin. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cStone and sea! No!\u201d</p><p>So many times, with so many lovers, it seemed I had been in charge, in control. Naamah\u2019s child, taking as much or more delight in bestowing pleasure as receiving it. It was a relief to surrender for once, to let Bao take the reins.</p><p>We kissed and kissed, until I thought I would melt. He worked his way down my body, laying a trail of kisses along my throat.</p><p>He suckled my nipples, hard. I groaned, my back arching.</p><p>He pressed kisses against the soles of my feet, the backs of my knees. He parted my thighs, kissing them. \u201cThis, here.\u201d His tongue teased the place where my thigh met my groin. His voice was thick. \u201cI would write an ode to it.\u201d</p><p>I made a wordless sound.</p><p>His mouth moved higher, tasting me, his tongue exploring my depths and retreating to flutter against Naamah\u2019s Pearl. Pleasure broke in waves over me, my hips rising involuntarily to meet his mouth. He did not stop for a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cAre you sufficiently reeducated?\u201d I asked breathlessly when he finally did. \u201cBecause I feel very, very thoroughly relearned.\u201d</p><p>Bao grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a good start, anyway.\u201d Effortlessly, he turned me in his arms, pulling me atop him. \u201cNow I want to watch you.\u201d</p><p>Kneeling astride his waist, I leaned down to kiss him, tasting my juices on his lips, my hair falling to curtain both our faces. The tips of my nipples brushed his chest in a tantalizing manner. I bit his throat softly, sucking on the warm, smooth flesh. I kissed the hard, sleek planes of his chest, bit and sucked lightly on his small, flat nipples until he groaned, his hands clutching hard at my hips.</p><p>Only then did I sit up, rising a little on my knees and taking his phallus in my hand. It was warm and throbbing, the thin skin velvety-soft. Bao watched me, his eyes gleaming beneath heavy lids as I fitted the swollen head between my slick nether-lips. I sank down on him slowly, letting him fill me inch by delicious inch\u2014and our shared diadh-anams merged in a silent starburst. I had forgotten how profoundly intense the sensation was, startling us both into a moment of stillness.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll ever get used to it?\u201d Bao whispered in awe.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cMayhap if we try often enough.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, the glittering intensity faded, and I began to move again, moving my hips in a small circular motion, reveling in the feeling of his shaft deep inside me, filling me, its angle changing subtly as I moved; of his strong fingers digging into my hips, encouraging me. Gasping with pleasure, I came again.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Bao murmured. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><p>When I caught my breath once more, I leaned forward a bit to brace my hands on his chest and changed to a different motion, rising and sinking along the length of his phallus, creating a glorious friction that pleased us both. Finally, Bao\u2019s formidable strength of will began to crumble. With a low growl that echoed in the pit of my belly, he rolled us both over once more, his shaft still buried inside me.</p><p>He rocked between my thighs, propped on his forearms and watching my face. I closed my eyes, drinking in the sensation of being filled and emptied, rising to meet his thrusts until the waves built and built again, breaking over and over, my yielding flesh convulsing in honey-sweet spasms around his hardness, my ankles hooked around his buttocks.</p><p>It was good, so very good.</p><p>And it was good in a different way when Bao gave himself utterly over to his own desire at last, his breath coming in hard pants, his hips thrusting hard and fast, driving me to yet another climax as I felt his phallus tighten and swell within me. He gave another low growl, shuddering and coming, his chin grinding into my neck.</p><p>In the aftermath of love, his face was soft and vulnerable. I lay propped against his bare chest, stroking the unruly hair out of his dark eyes, wondering what he was thinking. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>Bao laughed. \u201cHappy?\u201d He trailed the fingers of one hand along the curve of my spine, making me shiver a little. \u201cI think that is a small word for what I am feeling, Moirin. Are you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d I said simply. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should always be happy.\u201d He flattened his palm against the small of my back. \u201cI do not tell you often enough that I love you. I am not good with pretty words and flattery. But when I hold you in my arms, I feel as though I hold everything that is good and bright in the world.\u201d</p><p>My eyes stung.</p><p>\u201cNo tears, Moirin!\u201d Bao said in alarm. \u201cI am not good with tears, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are happy tears,\u201d I assured him, stretching to kiss him. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, that\u2019s all. Even though you\u2019ve been right here.\u201d</p><p>He returned my kiss. \u201cI have missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>It was enough.</p><p>Happy, sated, and languorous with pleasure in every part of my body, I drifted into sleep wrapped contentedly in Bao\u2019s arms, one leg flung over his, my head pillowed on his shoulder, breathing in the familiar hot-forge scent of his skin. My diadh-anam burned brightly alongside his. We were together at last, every shadow between us banished.</p><p>I slept, and dreamed.</p><p>I dreamed of Jehanne.</p><p>In my dream, she came to me clothed in the attire she had worn on the Longest Night\u2014the costume of the Winter Queen, a collar of snow-white ermine framing her exquisite face, her silver-gilt hair piled in a high coronet. In my dream, Jehanne was alive, her blue-grey eyes sparkling at me.</p><p>\u201cI have missed you, my beautiful girl,\u201d she said to me. \u201cHave you missed me, too?\u201d</p><p>I could not lie to Jehanne. \u201cYes. Oh, yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sweet witchling,\u201d my dream-Jehanne said fondly, sliding one hand around the nape of my neck. \u201cMy lovely Moirin, my gorgeous savage. Preparing to wed, even!\u201d She gazed deep into my eyes. \u201cI do not begrudge you your pretty ruffian, my beautiful girl. Only promise me it will change nothing between us.\u201d</p><p>I paused, enveloped by her intoxicating scent. \u201cBut this is not real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d my dream-Jehanne asked, toying with the tendrils of hair at the back of my neck. \u201cI am here with you now.\u201d Her sparkling eyes widened, searching my face. \u201cWould you truly say no to me, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to answer her. A part of me knew I was dreaming, knew I was lying asleep in Bao\u2019s arms; and I did not want to betray him before I\u2019d even wed him, even in my dreams. \u201cWhy are you haunting me, Jehanne?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you angry at me for leaving you? Angry I was not there when.....?\u201d I couldn\u2019t say the words, and a part of me hoped that my dream-Jehanne would deny the entire thing, would tell me that her death was a cruel lie told me by the Patriarch to break me down and weaken me.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. Instead she pulled away from me, looking hurt. \u201cIf that is what you think, mayhap I should leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I couldn\u2019t bear to lose even a dream-Jehanne. I caught her hand. \u201cNo, please. Stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t say no to me?\u201d Jehanne asked, smiling. \u201cI beg you, don\u2019t make me pout, Moirin! It\u2019s tiresome, and it never worked very well on you anyway.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>Still smiling, Jehanne regarded me beneath her lashes with those star-bright eyes. My heart ached with loss and yearning, and I knew that even though none of this was real, there was no way I could ever say no to her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I touched her cheek, her skin as fine as silk. \u201cNo, Jehanne. I will not say no to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her expression softened. \u201cI only want to know you haven\u2019t forgotten me, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, feeling the sting of tears in my eyes once more. \u201cNot in ten times a thousand years, my lady. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jehanne whispered, and kissed me, first with infinite tenderness, and then with all the sweetness of desire, her tongue darting past my lips, the scent of night-blooming flowers and her all around us. Ah, gods! I had missed her so very much, and I wanted her so very badly. Sighing with pleasure, I unfastened the brooch on her ermine-collared cloak and let it fall to the ground, laying the graceful white lines of her throat and shoulders bare so I might kiss them, taste her silken skin\u2014</p> <p>And I awoke with a jolt in darkness.</p><p>My heart contracted painfully in my chest, a profound sense of loss growing so acute that an involuntary cry escaped me.</p><p>Startled out of a sound sleep, Bao scrambled wildly out of bed, reaching for his staff. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked fiercely. \u201cMoirin! What?\u201d</p><p>An unreasoning wave of panic overcame me, words spilling out of my mouth. \u201cBao, I can\u2019t marry you! I can\u2019t! I\u2019m not..... I\u2019m not a wife-type person! I love you, I do, but I can\u2019t promise to love you and you alone for the rest of my life! That\u2019s like..... like asking me to love autumn, but not spring and summer! Or trees, but not flowers!\u201d</p><p>Having determined we were in no immediate danger, Bao kindled a lamp and gazed at me with sleepy bewilderment. \u201cTrees? Flowers? What in the world are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou! Me! Us! Marriage!\u201d I shook my head frantically. \u201cI can\u2019t do it, Bao! I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry! I may be many things, but I\u2019m not an oath-breaker!\u201d</p><p>He knelt on the bed and took my shoulders in his hands. \u201cMoirin, calm down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d Bao gave me a gentle shake. \u201cCalm down and breathe, you crazy woman, and tell me what this is about.\u201d</p><p>It helped. I forced myself to breathe slowly, my thudding heart and racing pulse easing. \u201cI dreamed of Jehanne.\u201d</p><p>He looked confused. \u201cWas it a bad dream?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I flushed. \u201cNot exactly. She wanted me to promise my marriage changed nothing between us. And..... I did. I promised I would never say no to her. I..... um, very much began to say yes instead.\u201d</p><p>Bao\u2019s expression turned grave. \u201cIt was only a dream, Moirin. I know you loved her, and a part of your heart will always be hers. But your Jehanne is no longer with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Tears spilled from my eyes, and I wiped impatiently at them. \u201cBut I wanted her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoirin,\u201d Bao interrupted me. \u201cI am not stupid, you know. I know you. I do not suppose I\u2019m wedding some dull merchant\u2019s daughter. I do not expect you to become a respectable matron. I am not asking you to swear any oath you cannot keep.\u201d He shrugged, sitting on his heels and laying his hands on his thighs. \u201cFor whatever reason, the gods have joined us together, and I cannot imagine living without you. Can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I murmured. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d He smiled a little. \u201cTomorrow, a dragon may decide to claim you as his mate. Or maybe your goddess Naamah will decide you need to seduce some spineless Yeshuite boy for his own good. I know this; and I am not afraid. It does not lessen what we are together, you and I. And since the gods have seen fit to join us, it is my thought that we should ask their blessing on our union. Is that so terrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cI will not press you if you do not wish it,\u201d Bao said. \u201cOnly know I do not expect you to be anyone but who you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that is enough?\u201d I asked uncertainly.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou crossed the Abode of the Gods and rescued me from the Spider Queen, Moirin. Yes. It is more than enough.\u201d</p><p>My panic faded. \u201cAleksei was not spineless, you know,\u201d I said to him. \u201cHe was a gentle soul, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Bao scoffed. \u201cOh, please! His mother had to convince him to free you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was very tall, with very broad shoulders,\u201d I added. \u201cAnd eyes the color of rain-washed flowers the name of which I only know in Alban.\u201d</p><p>He smiled complacently at me. \u201cNow you are only trying to make me jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not working very well, is it?\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bao shook his head, the gold hoops in his earlobes glinting. \u201cBecause your spineless Yeshuite boy is a thousand leagues away, and I am here. If I were going to be jealous, I would begin with our beautiful Rani, who is much closer and a much greater threat.\u201d He gave me another complacent smile. \u201cLucky for me, she does not share your unusual passions. Or at least not much, anyway. She is very fond of you.\u201d</p><p>I gazed at Bao, at his still-sleepy face, unexpectedly beautiful. At the tousled shock of his hair, his corded forearms braced against his thighs, the stark zig-zag pattern of tattoos running down them. \u201cSo you still want to wed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and touched one of the gold hoops in his ears. \u201cWhy did you keep them? As a reminder of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagrati?\u201d Bao stretched out his arms, regarding his tattoos. \u201cNo. I already have a reminder that cannot be removed.\u201d Reaching up, he fingered one thick hoop. \u201cThese, I couldn\u2019t figure out how to unfasten.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>This time, it was a healing laughter; and mayhap the laughter in my dream had been, too. Love as thou wilt, Blessed Elua had bade his people\u2014my father\u2019s people, and my people, too. I was a child of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, and a daughter of Naamah, too. I had loved, and loved well.</p><p>Jehanne; always Jehanne. But so many others, too. Last and always, my great-hearted bad boy Bao, gazing at me with a quizzical look.</p><p>\u201cDo you hate them?\u201d he asked, touching his earlobes. \u201cI will rip them out if you do.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cLet them stay. Now that I know, I do not mind.\u201d</p><p>Leaning over, Bao blew out the lamp. \u201cThen let us sleep, Moirin, and be at peace with each other.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTY-NINE</p><p>Once Hasan Dar was on his feet again, the Rani Amrita began to implement a plan of change.</p><p>She made a round of the temples, performing the offering rituals and prayers as we had done when I first arrived, only this time, she also announced her intention at each temple to revoke the unwritten laws regarding the untouchables within a month\u2019s time.</p><p>Although they had been forewarned, some of the priests were indeed horrified that she meant to go through with it.</p><p>\u201cYou would profane the temple with unclean persons?\u201d one grey-bearded fellow asked in shock. \u201cLet them lay hands on the Shiva Lingam itself?\u201d He shuddered. \u201cNo, no, no, highness! You are a woman, and not of the priestly caste. You do not understand what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ, brother.\u201d Ravindra\u2019s tutor, who was known as Guru-ji and whose beard was whiter than the priest\u2019s, addressed him politely. \u201cHer highness understands it very well, and I am in agreement that it is restoring a lost tradition. I will gladly sit with you and discuss the oldest of the Vedas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they are unclean!\u201d the priest protested, ignoring his offer. \u201cHighness, I beg you, do not do this thing!\u201d</p><p>Amrita\u2019s hands were posed in a mudra of respect, but her face was calm and determined, and Hasan Dar and her guards stood behind her, hands on their sword-hilts. \u201cForgive me, Baba, but I am doing it.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head in dismay. \u201cYou would seek to bend the will of the gods at the point of a sword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the Rani said firmly. \u201cBut it is my true belief that the gods have revealed their will to me, and I will see it enforced. I will allow no bloodshed, but anyone who refuses to honor my edict will be banished.\u201d</p><p>Not all of the priests were as resistant. The Rani Amrita had done what no ruler of Bhaktipur had accomplished in generations. She had defeated the Falconer of Kurugiri; and, too, she had retrieved Kamadeva\u2019s diamond from the Spider Queen Jagrati. Clearly, the gods favored her.</p><p>So it was that some priests listened to her, listened to Guru-ji\u2019s calm arguments and heeded them, while others continued to protest.</p><p>While they were fewer in number, the monks of the Path of Dharma supported her. Word of the tulku Laysa\u2019s presence at the palace had emerged, and a good many followers of the Path of Dharma made pilgrimages to visit her and speak with her. Laysa welcomed them all with grave pleasure, and they carried away tales of a profound grace and wisdom undiminished by her time in Kurugiri, lending further credence to the notion that the Rani was indeed a vessel of divine will.</p><p>Among the commonfolk, the mood continued to be varied. The warrior caste stood with the Rani Amrita and her son. The merchant caste was reluctantly accepting. It was the members of the lowest caste\u2014the servants, farmers, herders, and craftsmen\u2014who remained bitterly resentful at the rumors of coming change.</p><p>We were returning from the temple of Hanuman, the monkey-god who delighted me so, when a scrawny boy in the street darted past the guards to hurl a rotten onion at the Rani in her palanquin, striking her in the shoulder. It gave me a brief, sick reminder of the boys in Vralia who had thrown stones at me as I was escorted in chains to Riva.</p><p>Hasan Dar roared an order, but Bao was already in motion, racing after the fleeing figure.</p><p>\u201cOh, Moirin!\u201d There were unshed tears in Amrita\u2019s eyes. \u201cNone of my people has ever turned on me so!\u201d</p><p>I patted the damp spot on her sari, wiping away bits of onion-skin. \u201cChange comes hard, my lady,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThey are fearful of losing what humble status they possess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that is not what I am doing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I had to own, there were times when I wondered privately if I had done the right thing in counseling our lovely Rani not to wield Kamadeva\u2019s diamond. All of this would have been so much easier with the world falling at her feet. But then I remembered the vision of bloodshed that followed, and I set aside my doubts. \u201cYou must convince them otherwise, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou are right, dear one.\u201d</p><p>Bao returned in short order, hauling the boy in a head-lock beneath one arm, the boy struggling ineffectually against his grip. \u201cHere\u2019s your culprit, highness,\u201d he said in a cheerful tone. \u201cHe\u2019s a slippery one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I have him beaten?\u201d Hasan Dar asked grimly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Amrita raised one hand in the mudra of fearlessness and stepped from the palanquin, her composure restored. \u201cBao-ji, let the boy go. I would speak to him.\u201d</p><p>Bao shrugged and complied.</p><p>The lad glanced around wildly, and found himself surrounded by guards. He stared defiantly at the Rani. He couldn\u2019t have been more than thirteen or fourteen years old, and there was clay in his hair and under his nails.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name, young rebel?\u201d the Rani Amrita asked gently.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cDev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDev,\u201d she echoed. \u201cI think you must be a potter\u2019s son, eh? So tell me, young Dev, why are you so angry at me?\u201d</p><p>He knit his dark brows in a fierce scowl. \u201cYou would make us no better than them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Amrita inquired. \u201cBecause I mean to decree that there is no shame in attending to all aspects of life?\u201d</p><p>The boy Dev looked away from her and spat on the ground. \u201cI may be a potter\u2019s son, but I do not deal in shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not true,\u201d Amrita said in her musical voice. \u201cYou, young rebel Dev, you and I, and bold, swift Bao-ji who captured you so handily, and my lovely dakini Moirin, my handsome commander Hasan Dar, my son, Ravindra, the jewel of my heart..... each and every one of us are human and mortal.\u201d Her voice hardened, her words echoing Jagrati\u2019s. \u201cEach and every one of us deals with shit squeezed stinking from our bowels, only we choose not to acknowledge it, even though it is part of life\u2019s great cycle.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her, shocked by her words. Beyond the circle of guards, folk crowded close in an attempt to witness the exchange.</p><p>Amrita gestured to Hasan Dar. \u201cStand down, and let them hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighness.....\u201d he protested.</p><p>She raised her hand again, and he obeyed. The guards spread out, giving the spectators an opportunity to draw closer. Unobtrusively, Bao unslung his staff and took a defensive pose at the Rani\u2019s left shoulder. I stepped out of the palanquin and stood at her other side, ready to shield her at need.</p><p>A memory teased at my thoughts, the memory of Snow Tiger attempting in vain to calm the crowd who had come to rescue her, the dragon\u2019s voice whispering in my mind. Lend her your gift, he had said. Make a gateway.</p><p>It had worked then. Without pausing to wonder, I attempted it now, calling the twilight. Instead of breathing it out, I poured it into Amrita, my fingers brushing her bare arm.</p><p>The air around her brightened visibly, drawing soft gasps from the crowd. Amrita gave me a brief, perplexed glance, and I nodded at her in silent encouragement.</p><p>The Rani took a deep breath, steepling her fingers in the soothing mudra that eased conflict. \u201cListen, then, to what I say to this potter\u2019s son, for it holds true for each and every one of you.\u201d She gazed at the boy, and he flushed beneath her shining regard. \u201cYou are not lessened by this change, young one. Is your lot in life the worse because someone else is lifted out of misery?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo. The gods reward greatness of heart, not meanness of spirit. Do not seek to look at those below you and gloat. Look at those above you and aspire. I mean to build schools, good schools. If you wish to be a potter like your father, well and good. It is an honorable profession. If you wish to learn another trade, you may. You may become a merchant, or a builder of temples, or a soldier in my guard. I am placing your kharma in your own two hands. Is it truly a change you despise?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dev fell to his knees. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She touched his hair. \u201cSo do not throw any more rotten onions at me, eh?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The crowd let out a collective sigh, adoring her once more; and while their response was due in some small part to the sparkle of magic I\u2019d lent her, mostly it was due to Amrita herself, her courage and her unfailing kindness.</p><p>The Rani Amrita smiled at the crowd. \u201cI thank you for your patience, and for listening.\u201d Pressing her palms together, she bowed deeply to her people. \u201cMay all the gods look kindly on you.\u201d</p><p>With that, she returned to her palanquin, and I joined her, letting go my grip on the twilight. The crowds parted for us, Bao and Hasan Dar and the guards resuming their protective positions.</p><p>\u201cThat was most beautifully said, my lady,\u201d I said to her. \u201cI do believe you swayed their hearts.\u201d</p><p>Amrita gave me a sidelong glance. \u201cI do believe you gave me some assistance, dear one. I felt the touch of your magic.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cOnly a very little bit. A tiny push to help move change along. After all, I am not nearly as dangerous as Kamadeva\u2019s diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She laughed, a merry, ringing sound that gladdened my heart, and the hearts of all who heard her. \u201cI am not so very sure of that, Moirin,\u201d she said affectionately. \u201cBut I am grateful nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTY</p><p>After the incident with the onion-throwing and the Rani Amrita\u2019s resounding response, the mood in Bhaktipur was calmer.</p><p>The protesting priests made one last attempt at insurrection, covertly contacting Prince Ravindra in the hopes that he would be willing to consider a coup against his mother. Clever Ravindra waited for all of those in league to show their hands before rebuffing them in a passionate public address.</p><p>\u201cShall I dishonor my beloved mother, who has taught me everything I know of courage, who has endured great suffering to ensure the safety of our people?\u201d he asked in the city square, his narrow face filled with affronted dignity. \u201cNo! A thousand times, no!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite the little speech-maker, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Bao murmured.</p><p>Amrita smiled with rueful pride. \u201cMy young prince is quite a good many things.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what kind of man Ravindra would grow into; and I couldn\u2019t help but grieve at the fact that I would never know. Bao caught my eye, and I knew he was thinking the same thought. It would be very, very hard to leave this place, to leave the Rani and her son.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><p>There was to be a celebration the day the proclamation was made official, a great purification ritual to symbolize the no-longer-unclean status of no-caste people. Amrita fretted over the details.</p><p>\u201cI do not think it is wise to delay,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wish it were spring. The river will be cold. And there will be no fresh flowers! Only dried garlands. There should be fresh flowers to mark a new beginning.\u201d</p><p>The image of a man with a seedling cupped in the palm of his hand came to me, and I drew in a sharp breath. \u201cIf my lady wishes for flowers, there shall be flowers.\u201d</p> <p>Amrita raised her brows at me. \u201cHow so, dear one? Can you coax the very flowers to bloom out of season?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cActually, yes.\u201d</p><p>So it was that on the day that the proclamation was issued, a month after the Rani Amrita had begun making the rounds of the temples, we traveled in procession to a fallow marigold field outside the city, escorted by the guard, trailed by half a dozen empty wagons and scores of curious Bhaktipuri folk on foot.</p><p>It was not a large field, but it was big enough that it daunted me. I had never made an attempt of such scope before, and I hoped I had not boasted out of turn. If I succeeded, there would be no doubt that the gods\u2019 blessing was on this endeavor..... but if I failed, it would cast grave doubts on the Rani\u2019s actions.</p><p>I stood and breathed the Breath of Trees Growing, letting my awareness filter through the soil. The plants slumbered deep in the earth, not even beginning to dream of spring yet. I remembered how I had coaxed the bamboo to flower in the glass pavilion where I had first asked Master Lo to teach me.</p><p>Bao touched my arm, remembering it, too. \u201cYou can do this, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>I hitched up the folds of my sari, kneeling on the soil with bare knees. When Hasan Dar came forward to offer a square of silk, I shook my head at him. I needed to feel the earth beneath me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the dakini doing, highness?\u201d someone called.</p><p>\u201cAsking for the blessing of all the gods upon this day,\u201d Amrita replied in a firm voice. I glanced up at her. She smiled at me with perfect trust and love.</p><p>I prayed I would not fail her.</p><p>I breathed, slowly and deeply, taking the measure of the task at hand. I prayed to Anael the Good Steward, to the Maghuin Dhonn Herself, to the many Bhodistani gods, and to Sakyamuni the Enlightened One.</p><p>Lending a bit of the twilight\u2019s glamour to Amrita had been a small push. This, this would be a very large push.</p><p>In the back of my mind, I saw Jagrati\u2019s stark face, and there was a terrible, vulnerable yearning in it, a hunger that this might come to pass. If I did not fail, mayhap her angry spirit would rest.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whispered to any gods listening, sinking my hands deep into the loose, rich earth. \u201cOh, please!\u201d I took a half-step into the spirit world and held memories of languid summer sunlight in my thoughts, memories of warm, moist air, of everything good and green and fertile, breathed it all deep into my lungs.</p><p>Exhaling, I breathed summer into the soil, over the field. Over and over, I breathed summer into winter.</p><p>The earth roiled.</p><p>Plants burst forth from it with startling exuberance, unfurling ferny leaves, raising tight, hard buds toward the sky. Rows and rows of them, emerging from the soil. Somewhere, there were cries of awe and amazement. I ignored them, breathing summer, breathing the Breath of Trees Growing, willing the plants to grow, coaxing and begging them. Dark green buds opened and marigold blossoms bloomed, a riotous wave of orange, yellow, and saffron breaking across the field like a forest fire, releasing their pungent, spicy odor.</p><p>My head hung low, my hair brushing the earth. I was tired and drained, but my diadh-anam burned bright within me. I did not feel lessened by the effort. It was as Master Lo had taught me. When I used my gift as it was meant to be used, it would come back to me. With a weary laugh, I dragged myself upright, setting onto my heels.</p><p>Bhaktipuri folk swarmed the field, gathering blossoms. Hasan Dar and his men handed out needles and thick, waxed thread for the stringing of garlands. Men and women sang and sewed, happy to take part in a miracle.</p><p>Bao helped me to my feet and slid his arm around my waist. \u201cWell done, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I leaned against him, drawing strength from his presence. \u201cLet us hope it all goes as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can it not, young goddess?\u201d Amrita kissed my cheek. \u201cI named you so rightly! You have made a miracle happen here.\u201d</p><p>From the miraculous field of marigolds, the Rani\u2019s procession returned to the outskirts of the city, to the slums where the untouchables dwelled. I daresay no other ruler in the history of Bhaktipur had visited the place, and I loved her all the more for doing it.</p><p>In some ways, it was not so terrible as I had expected; in others, it was worse. Young Sudhakar, who had served as the Rani\u2019s liaison to the no-caste encampment in this matter now served as our guide, as though we were visiting a foreign land. He pointed out the vast pits dug into the earth where the gathered ordure of Bhaktipur\u2019s upper castes was spread and covered with a layer of barley-straw.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d he said helpfully, pointing at an older patch of ground where vines spread. \u201cIn time, it becomes fertile soil. We could not survive without it.\u201d</p><p>But ah, gods! The level of poverty was staggering. The dwellings in which they lived were crude, ramshackle affairs, in some instances nothing more than a length of ragged cloth stretched between poles. The faces that peered out at us were wary and fearful, not willing to trust to this seeming turn of fortune. A few folk had bright, hopeful eyes, but far, far more were dull and sullen with despair. All of them kept their distance, trained by a lifetime of experience not to sully folk such as us with so much as a shadow or a breath.</p><p>\u201cPeople of Bhaktipur,\u201d the Rani Amrita said in a gentle tone. \u201cThe gods have seen fit to send me a message, and from this day forward, I proclaim that there shall be no more division between caste and no-caste into clean and unclean. All shall be given opportunities to rise in status through hard work and dedication. By the will of the gods, I declare the rules of untouchability are no more. All men shall be brothers, and all women sisters.\u201d She held out a garland of marigolds. \u201cCome! I invite each and every one of you to come to the river and take part in a ritual of purification to celebrate this new beginning.\u201d</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>If I\u2019d had the strength, I\u2019d have lent Amrita a bit of glamour once more, but the marigold field had drained me too deeply. It would be a day or more before I was able to summon the twilight.</p><p>She stood patiently, holding out the garland, Ravindra at her side. Carts heaped with garlands waited behind them. Sudhakar shifted from foot to foot, looking earnest. The crowd that had accompanied us began to murmur, while the untouchables remained silent.</p><p>At last, beneath the shadow of a hovel consisting of a piece of rusted tin propped on a few posts, a small figure stirred, a young girl of some eleven or twelve years, turning to her mother and whispering a question. The mother nodded, and the girl stepped forth.</p><p>I recognized her. She was the girl I had seen being assaulted for attempting to enter a temple when I had first arrived in Bhaktipur.</p><p>\u201cSo, little one!\u201d By the smile in Amrita\u2019s voice, I could tell she had recognized the child, too. \u201cIt falls to you to be bold, eh?\u201d She beckoned. \u201cCome, then. Be the first to accept the gods\u2019 blessing on this day.\u201d</p><p>With a tremulous smile, the girl started forward. She managed to cross half the distance between her and the Rani before falling to her knees, overwhelmed by force of habit and the enormity of the situation.</p><p>Amrita tilted her head at Sudhakar, who went to the girl\u2019s side. \u201cCome, come, Neena!\u201d he said cheerfully to her. \u201cYou know me, eh? There is no reason to be afraid. This is a good day, the best day.\u201d He tugged at one thin arm. \u201cCome and be glad!\u201d</p><p>Holding Sudhakar\u2019s hand, the girl Neena approached the Rani a second time. Her skinny legs, left bare by a garment more rags than dress, trembled like a newborn foal\u2019s. But she did it, releasing Sudhakar\u2019s hand to press her palms together and bow deeply.</p><p>\u201cBrave girl!\u201d the Rani Amrita congratulated her, laying the garland around her neck and kissing her cheek.</p><p>A sound like the wind sobbing through trees broke over the no-caste encampment at that kiss, that simple, sweet gesture that acknowledged the child\u2019s humanity. The girl\u2019s mother staggered out of their hovel, tears streaking her face, her arms outstretched. She fell weeping at Amrita\u2019s feet, embracing her legs.</p><p>My lady Amrita stooped and kissed her brow, then raised her up with her own hands and placed a garland around her neck. \u201cI am glad to see you are well. Be proud of your daughter today.\u201d</p><p>One by one, others stepped forward; and then it was like a dam breaking. All at once, the untouchables of Bhaktipur surged toward the Rani and her son, mobbing them, crying out words of blessing, words of thanks, begging her to anoint them with flowers, begging her to touch them.</p><p>She did, each and every one of them; and there were tears in her eyes, too, but they were joyful ones.</p><p>When the last of seventy-odd folk had been garlanded, the Rani Amrita clapped her hands together. \u201cTo the river!\u201d</p><p>It was a motley procession that wound its way through the city to the banks of the Bhasa River, but stone and sea! It was a joyous one. Former untouchables clad in rags and flowers walked side by side with merchants and tradefolk, escorted by members of the warrior class in all their finery.</p><p>Along the bank of the river, at the sacred bathing spot, priests were waiting with offering bowls, and the Rani\u2019s servants, many of them rescued from Kurugiri, awaited with clean, dry clothing. There were braziers smoking in the open air, and dozens of different kinds of savory foods being prepared.</p><p>I had to own, I wasn\u2019t looking forward to the ritual purification. My lady Amrita thought the gesture would be best if all took part in it, a thought with which I agreed, but the waters of the river spilled from the heights of the Abode of the Gods into this charmed valley, and I was sure they were bound to be frigid.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>The Bhasa River flowed slow and placid at the sacred place where broad steps went down into the water. Curling tendrils of mist rose from its gleaming waters.</p><p>Warm. The water was warm.</p><p>Amrita gave me a startled look. \u201cMore of your magic, dear one?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my throat feeling tight. \u201cNo, my lady. This is truly a gift of the gods.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me. \u201cAs are you.\u201d</p><p>We descended the steps and waded into the river, all of us. Caste and no-caste, warriors and peasants; and the water was warm, as warm as mother\u2019s milk. There was laughter and shouting and singing, and prayers intoned by priests. The soaked folds of my sari floated around me. Bao, grinning, emptied bowls of water over my head; and I did the same to him. Bedecked with garlands of flowers, everyone laughed and splashed in the warm waters of the sacred river, everyone made clean and whole by the ritual, the Rani Amrita no less than the least of her subjects.</p><p>My heart ached at the beauty of it.</p><p>And I thought of my forced, false baptism in chains in Riva, and how a portion of my life had come around full circle; how one person might truly make a difference in the world. I thought about the parallels between Aleksei and my lovely lady Amrita; and I hoped my sweet boy would prove as courageous and kind as my gentle Rani. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hoped he would.</p><p>I thought he might.</p><p>Flowers worked their way loose from hastily strung garlands, floating down the river. We waded dripping out of the river, shivering in the cool air, glad to be met with warm blankets and clean, dry clothing.</p> <p>Priests kindled the sacred fires and sang.</p><p>Everywhere, faces glowed.</p><p>Bao wrapped his arms around me, and I leaned gratefully into his embrace once more. \u201cThe world has changed a little bit today, huh?\u201d he murmured in my ear.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cFor the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what\u2019s next for us,\u201d he mused. \u201cFor there will be a next, Moirin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d I lifted my head to kiss him, my lips lingering on his. \u201cBut for now, can we not just be happy?\u201d</p><p>Bao smiled at me. \u201cFor now, yes.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTY-ONE</p><p>The months that followed were a time of near-perfect happiness. A sense of benediction hovered over the valley and the celebratory mood lingered.</p><p>It was not entirely perfect; here and there, there were folk embittered by the change, folk who refused to have any dealings with the former untouchables or threatened violence against them. The Rani levied a system of steep fines against them, putting the money gathered toward the construction of a new school, and in time even the last holdouts gave way with grudging reluctance.</p><p>But for the most part, all was well. Too many people had witnessed the miracle of marigolds bursting forth from the earth and steam rising from the surface of the Bhasa River to doubt the will of the gods.</p> <p>I was happy, very happy. I had the company of my lovely Rani Amrita and her clever son, who attempted in vain to teach me to play chess. I had the pleasure of spending time with the tulku Laysa and the other women of the harem, watching them blossom in their newfound home, watching their children run and play in the garden, free forever more from the stark tyranny of Kurugiri, watching serious Ravindra abandon his dignity to laugh and play among them.</p><p>And I had Bao.</p><p>It was a good time for us, the first time since we had been together on the greatship that there was no shadow that lay between us. No dragon\u2019s jealousy, no angry, jilted Tatar princess. No Patriarch to sully our union with his vile thoughts, no conspiracy to separate us by leagues and leagues, no hate-filled Spider Queen in her lair.</p><p>And for once, there was no destiny goading us\u2014no princess to rescue, no assassins to thwart, no fortress to invade. Somewhere to the west, further oceans beckoned, but for now, our shared diadh-anam was content to let us rest.</p><p>We learned to be together as friends and lovers, learned to live with ordinary happiness as well as the divine spark that joined us.</p><p>\u201cHe is good with children, that one,\u201d my lady Amrita observed, watching Bao entertain Ravindra and the others, walking upside down on his hands and challenging them to a race. \u201cWill you start a family after you are wed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday, yes.\u201d I smiled wistfully. \u201cNot for a while, I think. I fear the gods are not done with us.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI wish the world were not so very large! I would so like to see your children playing in this very garden.\u201d</p> <p>I took her hand and squeezed it. \u201cSo would I. But our lives will always be the richer for having known you.\u201d</p><p>Having lost his absurd race and been toppled ignominiously by a horde of delighted children, Bao came over to console himself with a cool drink.</p><p>\u201cAmrita thinks you will be a good father one day,\u201d I informed him.</p><p>Bao grinned at me. \u201cI will be an excellent father, O queen of my heart. Our children will deserve nothing less.\u201d</p><p>I flushed at the unexpected endearment, the first Bao had ever given me. His grin softened into a lopsided smile, and we gazed foolishly at each other, still learning this business of being in love.</p><p>Amrita shook her head at us both. \u201cI would say your wedding day cannot come too soon,\u201d she said fondly. \u201cExcept I know my D\u2019Angeline dakini and my bad boy Bao have not bothered to wait for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but we are looking forward to it,\u201d Bao assured her. \u201cVery much so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am glad.\u201d She arranged her fingers in a mudra and took on a serious look. \u201cThere is one great favor I would ask of you, my heroes. As much as I do not like to think of your leaving, I know you must go. Will you take Kamadeva\u2019s diamond with you, and restore it to the temple from which it was taken? It is not far from your path, and there is no one else in the world I would rather trust to do it.\u201d</p><p>Bao gave me an inquiring glance, and I nodded. With the diamond locked safe in a coffer, I had not been tempted by it. \u201cOf course.\u201d He bowed deeply to the Rani in the Ch\u2019in manner, hand over fist. \u201cIt is the least we can do for the trouble we led to your doorstep, highness.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cOn the balance, you have brought far more joy than sorrow. So I will count it as a kindness, and be grateful.\u201d</p><p>One by one, the happy days fled.</p><p>A part of me wanted to cling to them, wanted the world to slow in its turning, to stay here in this charmed valley with people I had come to love, and be happy as long as I was allowed. A part of me welcomed it, yearning to return home, longing for just one glimpse of my mother\u2019s face.</p><p>I wondered what she would make of Bao.</p><p>I had a feeling they would like one another, my taciturn mother and my insolent, irrepressible magpie.</p><p>In the Rani Amrita\u2019s capable hands, the plans for our wedding proceeded apace. To be sure, it would be an untraditional affair. Family, that vast, extended web that was a cornerstone of Bhodistani society, would not come into play here. There would be no dowry, no symbolic transfer of power as I moved from my parents\u2019 household to that of my husband.</p><p>\u201cStill!\u201d Amrita said in a firm voice. \u201cIt will be a very, very splendid celebration, and certain things will be observed.\u201d</p><p>Certain things meant petitioning the elephant-headed god Ganesha to remove any obstacles to our union.</p><p>Certain things meant another ritual in which a priest smeared a dot of red turmeric powder on my brow and Bao\u2019s.</p><p>Certain things meant that I must sit still for hours on end while a special artist applied intricate designs of henna paste to my hands, arms, and feet, rendering me beautiful after the manner of every Bhodistani bride.</p><p>It was a good thing I had learned a great deal about patience.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mind it, though, not really. There was music and dancing, and it made me glad to hear my lady Amrita and the women of the Falconer\u2019s harem discuss men and their foibles and giggle together, finding brightness in the shadow of sorrow and suffering, weaving the strands of loss and anguish into a fabric of togetherness.</p><p>And on the eve of our wedding, certain things meant that Bao and I must spend the night apart.</p><p>\u201cI will miss you, Moirin,\u201d he said to me. \u201cEven for just one night.\u201d</p><p>I laid one hand on his hard chest, feeling his heart beat beneath my palm. \u201cI will miss you, too.\u201d</p><p>Alone in the chamber we had shared, I slept.....</p><p>..... and dreamed of Jehanne again.</p><p>In my dream, I opened the door of the bedchamber she had had made for me, my enchanted bower, filled with growing plants. I found Jehanne naked in my bed, her pale blonde hair loose around her shoulders, her arms wrapped around her knees.</p><p>My heart pounded in my chest.</p><p>\u201cHello, my beautiful girl.\u201d Her eyes sparkled at me. \u201cWon\u2019t you come and give me the kiss of greeting?\u201d</p><p>I sat carefully on the edge of the bed. \u201cJehanne, you know I love you. Must you insist on tormenting me on the eve of my wedding?\u201d</p><p>She looked away, then looked back at me with one of her unreadable expressions. \u201cIs that what you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I gazed at her impossible beauty, the delicate green fern-shadows etched on her fair skin. A tickle of foreboding brushed me, as though someone had trailed a feather along my spine. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a dream, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not meant to be here yet,\u201d Jehanne replied indirectly. \u201cAt least, I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s hard to tell. Time moves differently on the other side, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>She nodded seriously. \u201cYou do know about such things, my lovely witch-girl. That\u2019s why I\u2019m able to reach you. Only..... if it\u2019s not time yet, I suppose you\u2019re right, and it\u2019s jealousy that draws me.\u201d She gave me a self-deprecating smile. \u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I frowned. \u201cBut..... what is this? Why? My lady, I don\u2019t even know what questions to ask.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out with one slender hand, Jehanne stroked my brow, then trailed her fingers down my cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t scowl, Moirin,\u201d she said in a teasing tone. \u201cYou\u2019ll get wrinkles.\u201d</p><p>I pulled away from her distracting touch. \u201cJehanne, please! Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>She withdrew her hand, looking so disconsolate that it was all I could do not to take her in my arms and comfort her with kisses. \u201cI can\u2019t move onward,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither forward nor backward.\u201d</p><p>I struggled to recall what my father had told me of the D\u2019Angeline afterlife. \u201cYou cannot pass on to the Terre d\u2019Ange-that-lies-beyond?\u201d I asked, and she nodded. \u201cNor can you be reborn in the mortal world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to wait,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady!\u201d I swallowed hard, feeling the sting of tears. \u201cWhy such a cruel fate?\u201d</p><p>Her fair shoulders rose in a graceful shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it all. I only know that your business with Raphael de Mereliot is not finished. The time is coming when you will have to reckon with him, and you will need my help before the end.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran over my skin. \u201cDo you know how or why?\u201d</p><p>Jehanne shook her head. \u201cOnly that it is coming. Don\u2019t cry for me, Moirin,\u201d she added, reaching out to wipe a tear from my cheek; and this time I didn\u2019t pull back from her. \u201cLeaving was the hardest part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDying?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>She shook her head again. \u201cDeath is not so fearful as I thought it would be. But leaving..... leaving Daniel, leaving my infant daughter. Leaving a world with one such as you in it.\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cWill you tell my Desir\u00e9e about me when you meet her? Everyone in the Court except her father will only tell her of the scandals and gossip I caused. You..... you can tell her that her mother did a very good thing once when she rescued a beautiful young woman from her own folly.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help my tears. \u201cJehanne, of course I will! You needn\u2019t ask; I would have done it anyway. I will tell her that you loved her very much, that you would have been a wonderful mother, and grown into a wise and gracious queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your precious Rani?\u201d Jehanne asked crossly in a mercurial mood shift that was so familiar it made me laugh through my tears.</p><p>\u201cYou are jealous!\u201d I said to her.</p><p>She smiled again, taking my hand. \u201cYes. And a bit cheated that I didn\u2019t have the time to grow into this wise and gracious queen you dreamed I would become.\u201d Watching me beneath her lashes, she traced the intricate patterns of henna on my hand and forearm with the tip of one finger, a touch that was at once impossibly delicate and maddeningly arousing, making my skin prickle.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cJehanne.....\u201d</p><p>Her blue-grey eyes opened wide and ingenuous. \u201cYou promised you would not say no to me. And I do not know when I will be able to reach you again, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and I\u2019m getting married tomorrow!\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is tomorrow.\u201d She stroked my skin with that exquisite touch. \u201cAnd I am here. You used to say that to me, remember? I am here. It always comforted me. Will you not stay?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated.</p><p>Jehanne\u2019s voice broke slightly, breaking my heart. \u201cPlease? It\u2019s so very lonely where I am.\u201d</p><p>And because I could no more resist her than the ocean\u2019s tides could resist the pull of the moon, I gave in to her as I had done a thousand times before; and even though it was a dream, it felt so very real, my lady Jehanne warm and alive in my arms, naked and silken, the intoxicating scent of her skin making me dizzy with longing, Jehanne winding her arms around my neck, kissing me with consummate skill and desperate ardor, whispering my name like a prayer.</p><p>I stayed; and this time the dream did not cast me out. In my dream, I fell asleep holding her.</p><p>I awoke to morning light and an empty bed, the linens rumpled.</p><p>Jehanne\u2019s scent lingered in the room.</p><p>I sighed and arose, my heart at once heavy with guilt and light with gladness, my body languid with the aftermath of pleasure.</p><p>The Rani Amrita and her attendants bustled into the chamber, laying out the bridal finery I was to wear\u2014the crimson sari embroidered and trimmed with gold, the elaborate jewelry.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d my lady Amrita said brightly to me. \u201cThe day is here at last. Are you ready to wed your bad boy, my dear one?\u201d</p><p>With guilt, regret, and a surety of purpose, I put my dream of Jehanne aside. It was real and not-real at the same time. It was a promise of things to come; but they were things that had not happened yet.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>EIGHTY-TWO</p><p>It was a glorious day.</p><p>The Rani\u2019s attendants helped me bathe and prepare, rubbing fragrant oils into my skin, brushing my hair until it gleamed, painting my eyelids with kohl. They helped me don the gorgeous crimson and gold sari, pinning the folds in place. Amrita insisted on adorning me with jewelry herself, sliding gold bangles onto my wrists, fastening tinkling anklets in place, pinning a gold filigree headpiece to my hair.</p><p>When she had finished, she clapped her hands together in delight. \u201cYou are the perfect bride, Moirin!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had a fleeting memory of my dream and smiled ruefully. \u201cNot quite, I fear, but surely you have done your best, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She fussed with the filigree pendant hanging on my brow. \u201cYou are perfectly yourself, dear one, and that is all that matters. And you look very, very lovely.\u201d</p><p>I hugged her, holding her close. \u201cThank you, Amrita.\u201d</p> <p>She returned my embrace, then released me. \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome. Now, do not muss your sari.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, her fussing and mothering made me laugh aloud. Amrita gave me an inquiring glance, and I shook my head, unable to explain. All I could do was gaze at her with a heart filled with a complicated mixture of affection, remembering all the many kindnesses she had shown me.</p><p>\u201cBad girl.\u201d She tapped my lips lovingly with one finger. \u201cDo not look at me so. You are getting married today, remember?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her. \u201cOh, I do.\u201d</p><p>Once the preparations were finished, we adjourned to one of the palace\u2019s towers to watch the bridegroom\u2019s procession approach. The sun was high overhead, the sky was a bright, cloudless blue, and the spring air was warm and balmy.</p> <p>I was getting married today.</p><p>It was an exhilarating thought\u2014and a frightening one, too. But my heart beat surely and steadily and my diadh-anam called to Bao\u2019s, measuring his progress toward me. I felt him long before I saw him, resplendent in a crimson tunic and breeches, riding astride a white horse garlanded with flowers, his head held high, a crimson turban atop his unruly hair, gold hoops gleaming in his ears, his irrepressible grin in place. Hasan Dar and a handful of guards surrounded him, Sudhakar and Ravindra among them, cheering and singing love songs. The sight made my heart swell inside my chest.</p><p>My magpie, my peasant-boy, my Tatar prince.</p><p>Gods, I did love him very much.</p><p>How had that happened?</p><p>Bao glanced up at me as I leaned out of the turret, his grin widening, his almond-shaped eyes crinkling.</p> <p>I had to tell him about Jehanne and my dream.</p><p>Later, I thought; later.</p><p>Amrita tugged at my arm. \u201cCome, come, Moirin! You\u2019re meant to be in the garden before the bridegroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady,\u201d I said obediently, following her.</p><p>It was spring in the charmed valley of Bhaktipur and the garden was in full bloom, filled with towering rhododendrons sporting a wealth of enormous purple blossoms, snaking lianna vines, delicate frangipani perfuming the air with fragrance, and marigolds I had coaxed to bloom early. Beneath the trees, an immense, elaborate canopy of colorful sequined fabric had been erected, sparkling in the sunlight, held up by gilded poles. There was a brazier of sacred fire, tended to by a lean priest whose kind smile belied his ascetic figure.</p><p>All the women and children of the harem were there, faces glowing on this happy day; and then the groom\u2019s party entered the garden on foot, laughing and singing, and my heart grew even fuller.</p><p>With much fanfare, Bao and I were seated opposite one another beneath the canopy, smiling at one another.</p><p>The priest beamed at all of us. \u201cToday among friends and loved ones, in the presence of the sacred fire, upon the life-giving earth and beneath the radiant sun, we come together to seek the blessing of the gods on the marriage of Moirin and Bao,\u201d he announced.</p> <p>My lady Amrita came forward and handed me a garland of flowers. Bao inclined his head, and I laid it around his neck, laughing a little as it caught and snagged on his unfamiliar turban and pulled it askew. He grinned and settled it in place. And then Ravindra, his narrow face solemn, extended a garland to Bao, who leaned forward and placed it carefully over my shoulders.</p><p>The priest intoned a sing-song series of prayers and I listened, or at least I half-listened, with my heart so very full.</p><p>If it had been a traditional Bhodistani wedding, our parents would have spoken next. I felt a pang at the absence of my beloved mother and the gracious father I had found in the City of Elua\u2014and, too, at the absence of Bao\u2019s gentle seamstress mother and her lively daughter. I even wished the bitter non-father who had cast him out, and Tatar general who had fathered him and claimed him with pride, could be here and find gladness in this day.</p><p>But we were among loved ones; and it was enough.</p><p>\u201cNow you shall exchange vows of devotion,\u201d the priest declared. \u201cMoirin, it falls to you to speak first.\u201d</p><p>There were traditional words for this, too, but not vows that would make sense for such an unlikely couple as us.</p><p>I took a deep breath, gazing at Bao. \u201cSo much of what happened to thrust us together, neither of us chose. You wanted to find a way to be sure of me, my magpie? Well, today is it. We did not have to do this, you and I. You did not have to ask me to wed you, and I did not have to accept your offer.\u201d I swallowed hard, my eyes stinging. \u201cI am here beneath this canopy, saying these words because I love you and I choose to be with you for the rest of my life. Today, I am choosing this and giving my heart to you.\u201d</p><p>Bao\u2019s dark eyes were bright with tears, and one spilled onto his cheek. I tried to remember if I\u2019d ever seen him cry before.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>The priest gestured at him. \u201cNow you.\u201d</p><p>Bao laughed self-consciously. \u201cMoirin.\u201d His hands clenched in his lap. \u201cI am not good at this. Only know.....\u201d His fisted hands unknitted, lying upward and folded, and his eyes were bright, so bright, looking earnestly at me. \u201cYou have a very, very large heart. And I will do my best to take good care of it.\u201d</p><p>Shouts of laughter and approval surrounded us.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait!\u201d The priest raised his hands in a good-humored protest. \u201cWe are not finished here, eh?\u201d</p><p>So we finished.</p><p>First I cupped my hands in Bao\u2019s and the priest poured rice into our joined hands. Together we poured it into the sacred fire, a rich toasty smell arising.</p><p>Then the priest tied our wrists together with a long cord and bade us circle the brazier seven times. This we did, while he intoned a seven-fold blessing upon us, begging the gods to bless us with happiness, prosperity, and children, and a good many other things.</p><p>And then it was done.</p><p>Bao glanced sidelong at the priest. \u201cMay I kiss her now?\u201d</p><p>The priest nodded.</p><p>Bao kissed me, smelling of sandalwood and incense, of unfamiliar oils. But beneath it, he smelled of himself, the hot-forge scent that made me feel safe and loved and protected, and I twined my arms around his neck, returning his kiss, glad he did not share the Ch\u2019in reluctance to show affection in public.</p><p>It felt good.</p><p>It felt so very good, and right.</p><p>Our shared diadh-anam sang between us, and I leaned my brow against his. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou have to ask? Today of all days? Yes, occasionally stupid girl. I love you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I smiled at him, hoping he would remember it later. \u201cI am glad.\u201d</p><p>There was a feast that went on for many hours, servants carrying dozens of laden trays filled with spicy and savory dishes into the garden, where long tables had been erected and draped in more bright fabric. There was music and dancing, and there were games I didn\u2019t fully understand, including one in which Bao and I were made to sit back to back and answer a series of questions about each other; and yet another in which the cord that had tied us together was knotted around our wrists in a complex pattern which we had to unravel one-handed.</p><p>We did well at those.</p><p>We knew each other very well, my magpie and I. We worked well together, even at a simple task such as untying knots.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t really grasp the details of the traditions, that the traditions didn\u2019t really apply to us. It didn\u2019t matter that neither of us were familiar with Bhodistani dances, gladly making fools of ourselves in the effort.</p><p>All that mattered was that we were together, and surrounded by love. Celebrating beneath the open sky, garlanded with flowers, reveling in all the joy and abundance the world had to offer.</p><p>I waited until the sun was sinking low, casting long shadows over the garden, to tell Bao about my dream\u2014or at least the important part of it. As much as I hated to do it, I couldn\u2019t go to our bedchamber with it unspoken between us.</p><p>He listened without comment.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it is real?\u201d he asked gravely when I finished. \u201cOr is it only your fear speaking to you?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cI think it\u2019s real, Bao. It felt very real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Bao raised his brows at me. \u201cHow real, Moirin?\u201d</p><p>I flushed; I couldn\u2019t help it. I felt the warm blood climb into my throat and scald my cheeks, revealing my guilty secret. It wasn\u2019t always to my advantage that he knew me so well, and at such a time, Naamah\u2019s gifts felt like a curse in truth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! But it was Jehanne,\u201d I said as though that excused me for betraying him in a dream, knowing it didn\u2019t, knowing I would do it again anyway if she came to me. \u201cAnd she was lonely, so very lonely. It broke my heart! I couldn\u2019t help it. It would have broken yours, too.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from me.</p><p>I clutched his arm. \u201cBao? I am sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to do it, only.....\u201d</p><p>His shoulders shook, and I realized belatedly that he was trying not to laugh. \u201cSo!\u201d He turned his gaze on me, his dark eyes now bright with tears of barely suppressed laughter. \u201cWithin hours of our wedding, Moirin, you are telling me that it appears I am sharing you with the ghost of the White Queen; and that together somehow you must face that idiot demon-summoning Lord Lion Mane Raphael both of you loved for no good reason. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, chagrined. \u201cAye, more or less.\u201d</p><p>Bao exhaled. \u201cI knew I should have thumped that Raphael over the head,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNext time, I won\u2019t hesitate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ruined our wedding?\u201d I asked in a miserable tone.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bao cupped my face in his hands \u201cNo,\u201d he said a second time, his breath warm on my skin. \u201cI told you before. I love you as you are, Moirin. I would not change anything about you, even the fact that you have the will and morals of an alley-cat, because that is as your gods made you, and it is part of the reason for your very large heart.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cAlthough I might have wished for a few days of wedded bliss before life with you got stranger.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, relieved and glad once more.</p><p>Bao kissed me\u2014once gently, a second time with the rising heat of desire. I felt our diadh-anam blaze brighter than ever with the approval of the Maghuin Dhonn Herself; and then a second burst of brightness, warm and golden, a soft thunderclap all around us like a thousand doves taking flight at once, turning the blood molten in our veins and filling our mouths with a sweetness like honey.</p><p>Naamah\u2019s blessing settled over us, over the entire charmed garden and everyone in it, driving away now and forever any doubt that her gifts carried any taint of a curse. I heard soft cries of wonder as folk turned to one another and embraced spontaneously.</p><p>My magpie prince lifted his head, eyes wide with awe. \u201cThat was.....\u201d</p><p>He had removed his turban hours ago, and now I ran one hand through his thick, unruly hair, tugging his head down to kiss me again. \u201cThat,\u201d I whispered against his lips, \u201cwas Naamah\u2019s blessing. And I do believe she approves of this marriage.\u201d</p><p>Bao smiled and pulled me closer to him, one strong, lean arm snaking around my waist. \u201cI do believe I\u2019m ready for this party to end, Moirin.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, the golden warmth of Naamah\u2019s blessing still coursing through my veins, fanning the flames of desire. \u201cOh, yes!\u201d</p><p>And so we said our thanks to our guests and our ever-gracious hostess Amrita, who regarded us with laughter in her eyes; and I couldn\u2019t help but smile fondly at her, still a little in love with her, in love with the whole world tonight. And with the heady mantle of Naamah\u2019s grace hovering over us all, it felt as though the whole love-struck, desire-smitten, intoxicated world returned the favor.</p><p>\u201cGo, go!\u201d Amrita said in her musical voice, making a shooing gesture at us, a rare gleam of devilry in her lustrous gaze. \u201cI know your impatience very well, dear one.\u201d</p><p>Bao stifled a cough.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Mama-ji?\u201d Ravindra inquired in a puzzled tone.</p><p>\u201cIt is more grown-up teasing, young highness,\u201d Bao informed him. \u201cTrust me when I tell you that you would rather not understand the jest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ravindra gave him a dubious look. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, we took our leave of the party.</p><p>Our bedchamber had been filled with flowers and candles, and Bao and I made love for long hours that night, surrounded by fragrance and flickering candlelight, and it was by turns tender and sweet, and fierce and urgent, and all of it was good, so good, sanctified by Naamah\u2019s lingering blessing.</p><p>Somewhere in the small hours of the night, Bao surrendered to sleep as we lay together in a quiet moment.</p><p>I lay propped on one elbow and watched him sleep, his face as serene in repose as it never was when he was awake, as calm and beautiful as an effigy of the Enlightened One, a Dharma saint with a warrior\u2019s body.</p><p>And I thought how his journey to this moment was as long and strange as mine: a Ch\u2019in peasant-boy sold into slavery, stubborn enough to take his destiny into his own hands no matter what the cost. A stick-fighting prince of thugs who had walked away from the entire life he\u2019d built to become Master Lo\u2019s magpie. A leader of men, a rescuer of princesses and dragons. One called twice-born, one who had died and been restored to life.</p><p>A Tatar prince, struggling against an unwanted destiny.</p><p>Jagrati\u2019s favorite.</p><p>My husband.</p><p>Even in my thoughts, the word sounded strange to me; strange, but right. Like as not, I would be a dreadful wife. But Bao knew it and was not afraid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the first time in longer than I could recall, I felt the tug of destiny on my diadh-anam, our diadh-anam, grow a little more urgent, a little more insistent. Bao made a faint noise in his sleep. I glanced westward, wondering what awaited us.</p><p>Oceans; further oceans.</p><p>I wondered how many.</p> <p>There was Jehanne\u2019s motherless daughter, whom I had promised to tell about her mother\u2019s courage of heart and the love and kindness and generosity she had shown to me. One day, I would tell her about the genuine fears that underlay Jehanne\u2019s foibles, and the steadily increasing joy and excitement with which she had welcomed her daughter\u2019s birth.</p><p>And there was ambitious and charismatic Raphael de Mereliot, not content with the gift of a physician\u2019s healing hands; Raphael, who had nearly been taken over entirely by the last demon he summoned.</p><p>We had saved him, Bao and I and Master Lo. We had driven away the demon Focalor, a Grand Duke of the Fallen. But I had always wondered about something I saw that day, after the demon had been forced to relinquish Raphael, after I had thrust him through the doorway and closed it. After it was all over, I thought I\u2019d seen the briefest glimpse of Focalor\u2019s lightning flicker in Raphael\u2019s storm-grey eyes, and wondered if a trace of the demon\u2019s essence lingered in him.</p><p>If the divine spark of my diadh-anam could be divided, mayhap a demon\u2019s spirit could be, too.</p><p>That same feather of foreboding brushed along my spine, making me shiver.</p> <p>\u201cMoirin,\u201d Bao mumbled sleepily, half-awakened by my shudder. \u201cStop thinking and go to sleep. And no dreams tonight, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he said a bit more firmly.</p><p>So I settled alongside him, my head on his shoulder, and Bao held me in his Kurugiri-marked arms, his entire body making a strong, safe haven for me, a pledge of enduring love. His breathing softened into sleep once more, a soothing and calming rhythm. Although I did not think I could sleep yet, my breathing slowed to match his as it had so many times before, and I thought that there was nowhere else I would rather be, and no one else with whom I\u2019d rather face my everlasting destiny. Traces of Naamah\u2019s blessing lingered over us both like a promise that one day, every day would be as joyous as this one.</p><p>Somewhere, the bright lady smiled in gentle approval.</p><p>Somewhere on the far side of the stone doorway, the Maghuin Dhonn Herself paced in majesty, lifted Her mighty head, and gazed at the errant child She had loosed on the world with love and pride in Her deep, deep eyes.</p> <p>A word surfaced in my thoughts. Home\u2014the gods were calling me home, and I was ready to go.</p><p>Whatever came next, Bao and I would face it together.</p><p>As candles guttered low and sank into pools of wax all across the bedchamber, and I drifted down toward darkness, a sigh of happiness escaped me.</p><p>I slept, and did not dream. </p> </body></html>"]
