Even if it\u2019s true.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p> <p>My life didn\u2019t begin until I died.</p><p>Pre-vampire Jane worked Saturdays and holidays and any other days that no one else on the library staff wanted to work. I had never done anything for myself. I\u2019d never traveled. And now, I was my own boss. I\u2019d had the opportunity to kiss foreign soil. Actually, it was the tile in Heathrow Airport\u2019s Sunproof Lounge on the very first stop of our trip\u2014London. I think my worship of solid ground embarrassed my sire/boyfriend, Gabriel Nightengale. And the pickpockets were able to peg me as a tourist right away. But I was really, really happy to be off that plane.</p><p>I have claustrophobia issues.</p><p>I\u2019d never had a healthy adult relationship as a live girl. Then again, I\u2019d just abandoned my 150-year-old boy-friend in a hotel room in Brussels, so maybe this one didn\u2019t count, either.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure it was Brussels. We\u2019d made quite a few stops since London.</p> <p>My \u2019round-the-world romantic getaway with Gabriel turned sour early on, right after we checked into our first hotel in London. There was a note waiting for Gabriel at the front desk, fancy linen paper addressed in spidery black ink. Whatever it said, it put him in a very foul mood. The minute we\u2019d settled into the exceedingly posh room, he put his flowy black coat back on, said he had to make some phone calls, and disappeared for most of the night. My newly purchased trunkload of lacy underthings took this very personally. When he returned, he gave me a cursory kiss good night and collapsed into sleep. I managed to say, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d in about fourteen languages.</p><p>You know how after you\u2019ve hung around a person for a while, you can tell when they\u2019re trying to have a good time? Well, this phenomenon was just frightening in Gabriel. He was like a Carlson Wagonlit agent on crack, manically planning all-night excursions to museums, the opera, beer gardens, fancy intimidating parties with his fancy intimidating friends\u2014anything that would keep us out of the hotel room from dusk till dawn. Gabriel\u2019s credit-card company put a fraud watch on his accounts as we switched hotels on a whim, two or three times per city. Each time we checked in, a creamy linen envelope was waiting for him at the front desk. And each time, his eyes got just a little more Manson-ish. Charles or Marilyn, take your pick.</p><p>His cell phone rang incessantly, and every time it did, he either let it go to voicemail or whispered, \u201cBusiness,\u201d and took the call outside. I tried to ignore the warning signs. I tried to give Gabriel the benefit of the doubt, but a girl can only bury her head so deep in the sand. He had told me months before that he was having issues he couldn\u2019t tell me about. There were frequent business trips during which I couldn\u2019t reach him by phone. And I\u2019d found out that on several occasions, he\u2019d lied about where he\u2019d been. He\u2019d assured me that it wasn\u2019t another woman, despite the fact that the name \u201cJeanine\u201d had popped up on his cell phone several times. Never had I wished so much that my stupid, inconsistent mind-reading powers worked on my sire.</p><p>Even though I still had (raging, screaming) doubts, I had chosen to believe him. And now, I was starting to feel like one of those women at whom people yell, \u201cHow stupid can you be?\u201d when they inevitably appear on Dr. Phil .</p><p>I suppose one should expect a certain amount of drama in a relationship that started with one party dying in a muddy ditch off a dark country road. I don\u2019t like talking about the night I was turned. All young vampires eventually get drunk with their buddies and share war stories about how they became undead. I do not partake in such revelries. Why?</p><p>The short version is this: I was (unfairly, unceremoniously) fired from the library and replaced by my supervisor\u2019s barely literate firebug stepdaughter. But instead of getting a severance check, I got just enough of a gift certificate to get rip-snorting drunk at Shenanigans. I met Gabriel, flirtation ensued. I sobered enough to drive, but as a result of unfortunate circumstances, my ancient car, Big Bertha, died halfway home. I was spotted walking down the road by the town drunk, Bud McElray, who mistook me for a deer and shot me. I was left in the ditch to die, only to be found and turned by Gabriel.</p> <p>You don\u2019t become a vampire just by being bitten. Vampirism isn\u2019t a germ or a curse or karmic justice for overtanners. To make a childe, a vampire will feed on a human until he or she reaches the point of death, then feed the initiate as much undead blood as he or she can take. The process takes a lot out of the sire, which is why a vampire will only turn a handful of \u201cchildren\u201d in his or her lifetime.</p><p>Gabriel being my sire and my boyfriend caused some complications in our relationship. It was his job to lead me through the transition to vampirism, but since I rarely listened to him, that didn\u2019t work out so well. And confrontations between the two of us tended to get sort of violent ... and naked. So, instead of indulging in accusations of infidelity and undead Johnny Depp hotel theatrics, I bit my tongue. Hell, I bit a hole through my tongue. Fortunately, I had vampire healing, so it grew right back. But then we checked into the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Munich, and a linen envelope was waiting.</p><p>The look on Gabriel\u2019s face made a bellboy cry.</p><p>Our itinerary became even more packed. I was frequently left alone with Gabriel\u2019s strange Euro-vampire friends as he held urgent \u201cbusiness meetings.\u201d I occasionally woke up at dusk and couldn\u2019t figure out where Gabriel was. Of course, we switched locations so often, a few times I woke up and couldn\u2019t figure out where I was. But that didn\u2019t make me feel any better when Gabriel crept into the room with lame excuses about running out for a newspaper or a fresh bottle of blood. Even my \u201cwhite lie acceptance\u201d level has limits.</p><p>When Gabriel was in the shower one night, I happened to peek into the wastebasket, where he\u2019d left the torn remnants of his latest note. I saw words like \u201cbloodmate\u201d and \u201clove you.\u201d</p><p>I swear, it wasn\u2019t my fault that the basket tipped over and those little bits of paper somehow managed to reassemble themselves perfectly into their original order. OK, fine, I abused my jigsaw-puzzle skills. But if Gabriel didn\u2019t want me reading the note, he probably should have burned it. My vision tinged red as I made out phrases like \u201cRemember what we are to each other,\u201d \u201cRemember what we have,\u201d \u201cThe woman you\u2019re with can\u2019t satisfy you like I do.\u201d</p><p>Satisfy you like I do ? In the present tense? Gabriel had recently been satisfied by this woman? I fell on my knees, stunned by an explosion of pain in my chest. If my heart beat, I would have sworn I\u2019d blown an aorta. He\u2019d promised. He\u2019d sworn that he was faithful to me. And, like an idiot, I\u2019d believed him.</p><p>The phone rang. With numbed fingers, I knocked the phone off its cradle and heard the voice of my best friend, Zeb. I launched into a paranoid diatribe on cheating boyfriends. I ignored all attempts on his part to make me think like a normal person or believe that all of this could be a very complicated coincidence.</p> <p>\u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d I hissed, listening for the sound of Gabriel\u2019s shower running. I swiped the little bits of paper back into the wastebasket.</p><p>\u201cUm, logic and reason?\u201d Zeb suggested. \u201cAnd as much as I enjoy paying ten dollars a minute to listen to you rant hysterically, I called to let you know there was a burglary at the shop last night.\u201d</p><p>After my masterful string of profanity, Zeb explained that two nights before, someone had thrown a brick through the front window and ransacked the stock. Oddly enough, some of the more valuable items\u2014figurines and crystals and ceremonial objects\u2014had been ignored in favor of tearing through boxes of books. Books were thrown aside, their spines cracked and damaged, Zeb\u2019s descriptions of which were enough to make me produce distressed sounds in several different languages.</p><p>Zeb said in a soothing voice, \u201cFortunately, they didn\u2019t know how valuable some of the books were, because they didn\u2019t take anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of underachieving burglars don\u2019t take anything?\u201d I asked, grasping at any excuse not to think about the nauseating ripple of pain shredding through my body. I could do this. I could get through this. I just had to focus on what Zeb was saying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Mr. Wainwright was out on the town with your aunt Jettie, so he was no help. It\u2019s my theory that one of the adult-video store\u2019s old clients just got confused and was searching for his recommended daily allowance of visual stimuli,\u201d Zeb said as I pulled my suitcase out of the closet. \u201cDick thinks it was someone looking for something specific, who couldn\u2019t understand your weird shelving system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, alphabetical order is revolutionary.\u201d I snorted. \u201cSo, how much damage are we talking about here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. Other than the window being broken and the books being tossed around, nothing. Which, to me, says the thieves were over thirty. No angry teenager could pass up the chance to mess up newly painted walls and a shiny new espresso machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m coming home on the next flight,\u201d I said, randomly tossing clothes into my bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, Jane, there\u2019s no reason to do that. Dick and Andrea can take care of everything. Andrea\u2019s almost as anal-retentive as you are. She\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming home, Zeb,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cJane, don\u2019t turn this into a\u2014 You\u2019re hanging up on me now, aren\u2019t you? Dang it, Jane!\u201d he cried as I snapped the phone back into the cradle.</p><p>Gabriel emerged from the bathroom, his hips swathed in a huge white towel. His deep gray eyes tracked warily from my packed bag to the phone. \u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d</p><p>My head snapped up, and it took everything in me not to throw the nightstand across the room at him. I wanted to scream, to strike at him until he hurt as much as I did. But I couldn\u2019t. I had become numb. Empty. I took a few deep breaths, unlocked my jaw, and concentrated on keeping my tone even, unaffected.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a break-in at the shop. I need to go home and take care of it,\u201d I said, clicking the suitcase shut. \u201cIf you could send the rest of my stuff home, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>I looked up, hoping to see some response from Gabriel, something to show that he wanted me to stay. But he seemed relieved. He blew out a breath and slid into a pair of black jeans. \u201cWell, if you have to go, you have to go. It\u2019s probably better this way.\u201d</p><p>And then he helped me pack.</p><p>It was like being slapped with indifference. He honestly did not care whether I was there or not. I could have just announced that I was going to take a flying leap off the roof, and he would have just nodded obligingly.</p><p>\u201cWell, OK, then,\u201d I muttered, throwing my jacket on. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when you get home. After you\u2019ve finished your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d he promised as gave me a sterile peck on the forehead. It was a dismissive and fatherly sort of kiss. \u201cThis is really for the best. I think we can both agree that this trip hasn\u2019t quite worked out as we\u2019d hoped. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>As the door literally hit me in the butt on my way out, I was struck by the realization that Gabriel had just used classic brush-off platitudes on me. Did he just break up with me and not even have the decency to tell me? Now well and truly pissed, I carted my luggage to the front desk.</p><p>You know those French movies, where a weary lover climbs into a taxi wearing an oversized shawl and Jackie O sunglasses as Paris slowly fades away? And as she\u2019s driven to the airport, they might show a single glistening tear sliding down her cheek? Yes, the image is dramatic and glamorous, but living it just plain sucks.</p><p>If one is undead and hell-bent on travel, I must suggest Virgin Airlines\u2019 Vamp Air. Trust Richard Branson to find a niche market involving carefully shaded windows and a selection of blood constantly warmed to exactly 98.6 degrees. Plus, few parents are willing to bring crying babies onto a plane full of vampires, so it\u2019s blissfully quiet. I dragged my sunscreened, jet-lagged carcass through the Nashville International baggage claim at four A.M. to find Zeb waiting for me, holding a sign that said, \u201cUndead Tourism Bureau.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I propped my sunglasses on top of my head and smirked. \u201cWhat were you going to do if someone else fit the bill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you bring me? What\u2019d you bring me?\u201d he asked, hopping up and down.</p><p>\u201cTiny liquor bottles from the minibar,\u201d I said, holding up my suitcase proudly and thumping it into his chest.</p> <p>\u201cSadly, that\u2019s the same thing my uncle Ron gave me for Christmas.\u201d He snorted, taking my little carry-on bag onto his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI wrapped them in hotel towels from four different countries,\u201d I added.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>I actually had gotten him and Jolene fancy 500-thread-count sheets and some very expensive snacks from Harrods. The hotel towels were for me.</p><p>We reached Zeb\u2019s car, threw my luggage into the backseat, and took our places up front. Zeb started the car and paid the exorbitant parking fee. \u201cSo, tell me everything. Where did you go? What did you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWent to some parties, met strange and snotty people. Saw some great museums and restaurants, but being in France and not being able to eat chocolate is downright masochistic. Oh, we saw Carmen performed in Vienna. Did you know the whole first song is about cigarette smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Zeb admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ha-ha. So, where\u2019s your lovely wife?\u201d I asked as we pulled onto the interstate. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing letting you take off for Nashville after midnight? Doesn\u2019t she know you get lost?\u201d</p><p>Zeb grimaced. Things between Jolene and Zeb had been tense lately. They were still trying to build a home on the land I\u2019d given them as a wedding present. The house was slow to finish because Jolene\u2019s family was pressuring them to move back onto the McClaine family compound. Werewolves are notoriously territorial, and Jolene was the first McClaine to live \u201coff-site\u201d since they\u2019d settled in the Hollow two hundred years before. The family owns multiple businesses in the Hollow, including several construction firms. And what they don\u2019t own they could influence with scary male werewolf dominance. So, to say that it was difficult for Zeb and Jolene to get contractors to show up\u2014risking pissing off Jolene\u2019s kin\u2014much less finish their work, was an understatement.</p><p>To top it off, the brand-newish trailer they\u2019d been offered as an incentive to live on McClaine land had mysteriously evaporated when Zeb and Jolene announced they were building their own home, leaving the newly-weds with the camper recently vacated by Jolene\u2019s stoner cousin, Larry. And one could live in the close quarters of a cannabis-saturated camper for only so long before one\u2019s marriage began feeling like the last half of The Shining .</p><p>I would say that Zeb was a saint to put up with such interference from his in-laws, but his family\u2019s no prize herd, either. Let\u2019s just say that one of the Lavelle family\u2019s favorite Christmas activities is to gather around the TV and watch their highlight reel from the \u201cRowdy Rural Towns\u201d episode of COPS .</p> <p>Zeb\u2019s mother, Ginger Lavelle, had a number of reasons to shun me lately, the least of which was that I refused to let her ruin Zeb\u2019s honeymoon. To bastardize Harry Potter, I was Zeb\u2019s \u201cSecret Keeper\u201d for his honeymoon destination. Zeb told his family that he and Jolene were going to the mountain retreats of Gatlinburg, when he, in fact, took his blushing bride to Biloxi, for a week of Gulf shrimp, putt-putt, and blessed silence. Their hotel information was sealed in an envelope and given to me with the instructions that it was to be opened only if someone was dead or incapacitated ... well, more incapacitated than usual.</p><p>While contrite over her wacky antiwedding antics, Mama Ginger could remain chastised for only so long. Incensed that she could not locate her son after calling every hotel in Gatlinburg, Mama Ginger called me to demand that I give her the location and phone number right now, because she was having chest pains and was being taken to the hospital. Used to this ploy, I refused. She switched tactics and said that she needed the number because Zeb\u2019s father, Floyd, had dropped an automatic cigarette lighter into his lap while driving and was being treated for several third-degree burns in sensitive areas.</p><p>While that scenario was far more plausible, I still withheld the number, which prompted Mama Ginger to announce that she would never speak to me again. I was not properly devastated by this announcement, which just made Mama Ginger angrier. Mama Ginger had long held out hope that Zeb and I would one day wed, but now that she knew about my \u201cunfortunate condition,\u201d she was slightly ashamed to have wanted a vampire as an in-law. She was still less than civil to Jolene. But she now preferred her daughter-in-law to me, because at least Jolene wasn\u2019t a vampire. Of course, Zeb hadn\u2019t yet broken the news about his new bride being a werewolf, but that was neither here nor there.</p><p>I\u2019d promised myself that I was going to back off and stop interfering in Jolene and Zeb\u2019s relationship, but it was so much healthier than talking about my own relationship. So, I think I earned a pass just this once. \u201cTell me you haven\u2019t been watching The Howling again,\u201d I groaned. \u201cYou know it\u2019s just a movie.\u201d</p><p>Zeb gave me a distinctly not-amused look, then sighed. \u201cMarriage is a little harder than I thought it would be. Just normal stuff, you know. Things that get on each other\u2019s nerves.\u201d He began ticking off Jolene\u2019s numerous faults on his fingers. \u201cShe chews her fingernails and her toenails. She cannot stop herself from answering the questions from Jeopardy out loud, even when she knows she\u2019s wrong. She sheds. She puts ketchup on her egg rolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlasphemy.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cAnd as much as it would be in my own personal interest to interfere with your marriage and reclaim your full attention, you do realize that you are married to arguably one of the most beautiful women on the planet. And you are a male kindergarten teacher who collects dolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAction figures,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cAnd she stuck with you, despite the fact that your mother tried to make wedding-party casting changes during the rehearsal and had you hypnotized by a five-dollar psychic so you\u2019d dump Jolene at the altar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer family put out a bear trap for me!\u201d he huffed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that just means that your families cancel each other out.\u201d</p><p>He snickered, his expression softening. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>My jaw actually hit the middle of my chest. \u201cWell, that explains the egg rolls and ketchup.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened at the thought of Zeb having a baby. This was so huge, the last step toward Zeb really growing up. I\u2019ll admit I was a little jealous. I was being left behind again. Zeb was doing something I would never do. But, as I\u2019d discovered last year when Zeb\u2019s mom dumped an infant on my doorstep in an attempt to jump-start my biological clock, I am not cut out to nurture. And because I no longer have a pulse, I can\u2019t have children\u2014which works out nicely.</p><p>\u201cBut this is a good thing, right?\u201d I shook his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to be an honorary aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing, except the idea of being responsible for a whole family sort of scares the crap out of me. We wanted to have kids right away, and given how fertile her family is, we knew there was no contraception on earth that would work. But that\u2019s not really our problem. Her mother comes over every single day. Her aunts are always bringing over food, or they\u2019re putting up curtains that they made, or they\u2019re moving our dishes around in the cabinets without asking. And Jolene just lets them. And the men! If they don\u2019t back off and let a contractor come out to finish the house, we\u2019re going to be raising their grandchild in a pot-soaked RV. Is that what they want? I\u2019m just frustrated and feel ... impotent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously, that\u2019s not the case. When is she due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn about four months,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You guys were pregnant before the wedding? And you didn\u2019t tell me!\u201d</p><p>Zeb rolled his eyes. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a werewolf thing. The average wolf pregnancy is only about sixty days. Werewolves sort of split the difference with five months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So, you have very little time to get ready for this baby\u2014babies? How many kids is Jolene going to have? Is it going to be like a litter?\u201d</p><p>Zeb looked horror-struck.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you hadn\u2019t thought of that before?\u201d I asked him as little beads of sweat popped out on his forehead. \u201cThere are four sets of twins just among Jolene\u2019s first cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still processing everything!\u201d Zeb shouted.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should drive,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s talk about why you think Gabriel would suddenly start cheating on you. That will keep me awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not,\u201d I told him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rehash the whole thing. I just want to pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause denial usually works so well for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to deny that I just heard that. Should we stop by the shop? I\u2019d like to see the damages, know what I\u2019m getting into,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYour internal clock must be off, world traveler. The sun\u2019s going to rise soon.\u201d He nodded to the lightening blue-gray sky on the horizon. \u201cWe\u2019ll have just enough time to get you home.\u201d</p><p>As the sky turned toward lilac, I snuggled under a blanket and dozed the last hour or so before we reached the family manse, River Oaks. More English country cottage than sprawling Georgian plantation, River Oaks is at its heart just an old family farm home that happened to be built before the Civil War. Despite my having spent the last few weeks in buildings that were much older and far more elegant, my house had never seemed so beautiful.</p><p>I kissed Zeb\u2019s cheeks, mumbled a good night, and dashed for the door with the blanket over my head. In my room, on sheets that were weeks old and slightly musty, I lay down and, for reasons I hadn\u2019t quite processed yet, cried.</p><p>2</p><p>Successful relationships are about compromise.

Aunt Jettie! We have a rule about knocking!\u201d</p><p>My ghostly favorite aunt/roommate placed her transparent hands on her hips. \u201cOh, get down from the ceiling and let me look at you. I haven\u2019t seen you in weeks. Don\u2019t make me float up there, it makes me dizzy.\u201d</p><p>Jettie Belle Early, sister to my grandma Ruthie, took me under her wing when I was around age six and when Ruthie and I both figured out that we were basically incompatible. (Grandma Ruthie wanted to give me a home perm and enter me in the Little Miss Half-Moon Hollow Pageant. I hid in her attic all day to avoid the perm, pretending that I was Anne Frank.) I spent entire summers with Jettie at River Oaks, which she inherited after spending her formative years caring for her elderly father. This was a great shock to Grandma Ruthie, who had already made plans to overhaul the house in time for the local historical society\u2019s annual tour of historic homes.</p><p>Aunt Jettie was a linchpin in every major moment in my life. It was Aunt Jettie who helped me fill out financial-aid paperwork for college. It was Aunt Jettie who persuaded me to stay in school and get my master\u2019s in library science so the local public library would have no choice but to hire me. It was Aunt Jettie who helped me through that first night as a vampire. It was Aunt Jettie whose upside-down face was now smiling up at me expectantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI missed you, too, Aunt Jettie,\u201d I grunted as I disengaged my fingernails from the plaster and hopped down to the bed. \u201cIs Mr. Wainwright here?\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she thought of her beau, who also happened to be my recently deceased boss. \u201cNo, he\u2019s really beating himself up over this break-in, so he\u2019s standing guard at the shop. I told Zeb not to bother you with it, but he insisted you\u2019d want to. Why are your eyes all puffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s just the French,\u201d I said, wiping at the oh-so-attractive bloody tear tracks drying on my cheeks. \u201cThey were so damn rude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were in Brussels,\u201d Jettie said as I climbed back into bed. Outside my bedroom window, creeping fingers of sunlight were flirting with the edges of my blackout curtains. My internal clock told me it was almost six A.M., and I was so tired I could actually feel the drag on my limbs. Aunt Jettie pulled the covers up to my chin as she asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill in Brussels,\u201d I said. \u201cHe had some things to take care of.\u201d</p><p>Jettie studied my face in that unnerving X-ray method of hers. Fortunately, any penetrating wisdom on her part was cut short by my mother\u2019s sudden appearance at my bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby!\u201d Mama cried. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you people?\u201d I howled, chucking a pillow at her. \u201cWhat are you doing here so early?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve been coming by every day to check on the place,\u201d she said, throwing her arms around me. \u201cLet me look at you! Oh, don\u2019t ever go away for that long again, honey. I got so nervous not being able to see you or check in on you.\u201d</p><p>Mama\u2019s idea of a good vacation spot was the Blue Pineapple Motel in Panama City Beach, Florida. She did not see why it was necessary for me to see the world or why it was necessary to run off \u201cGod knows where\u201d and share hotel rooms with a man I was not married to. She insisted that the hoteliers would know that we were not a married couple and we would give people a bad impression of America. I told her that if American tourists hadn\u2019t already done that by eating string cheese while they toured the Louvre, I doubted my premarital sleeping habits would bother them all that much. She didn\u2019t laugh.</p><p>Mama\u2019s predictions of travel tragedy included my getting mugged. (I have superpowers, so it wasn\u2019t likely.) Or developing food poisoning. (I don\u2019t eat, so that was even less likely.) Or getting a rash from hotel soap. (OK, that actually happened, but it cleared right up.) But I doubt she foresaw me getting dumped in such a halfhearted, half-assed way. She definitely would have warned me.</p><p>Wait a minute. My brain finally caught up to what she\u2019d just said.</p><p>\u201cYou come by the house when I\u2019m not home?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Mama gave me her patented \u201cWell, of course, I\u2019m invading your privacy, silly!\u201d expression. \u201cYou gave us a key for emergencies. Someone has to keep your plants watered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any plants.\u201d I pressed the pillow over my head and muttered, \u201cI\u2019m getting a moat.\u201d</p><p>Mama pretended not to hear me, instead dropping a pile of envelopes onto my lap. \u201cHere, honey, I got your mail while you were away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch that curtain, and I won\u2019t give you your present.\u201d I didn\u2019t bother looking up as Mama approached the window. Mama considered for a moment and then backed away.</p><p>In general terms, Mama had stopped trying to rehabilitate me out of being a vampire. This was good, because I was out of the coffin to most of the community. I was one of a few vampires in the Hollow who chose to live out in the open and maintain relationships with the living. Studies showed that most vampires turned since tax consultant/vampire Arnie Frink outed us with his right-to-work lawsuit dropped out of sight and moved to big cities like New York or New Orleans. They assimilated into the large populations of vampires and learned how to adjust to their new lifestyles ... or their neighbors claimed to have no idea how they managed to fall into a puddle of gasoline, then trip into a burning leaf pile.</p><p>Thanks in no small part to my former supervisor, Mrs. Stubblefield, the news of my vampirism had officially made the beauty-parlor and kitchen circuit. Mama said people had stopped talking whenever she walked into the pre-church coffees on Sunday mornings, which meant the congregation of Half-Moon Hollow Baptist Church was aware as well. She took to her bed for a few days. But ever since a well-known member of the cast of All My Children came out as the parent of a vampire and Oprah did a show featuring Friends and Family of the Undead, Mama figures my being a vampire makes her \u201ccurrent.\u201d She now introduces me as her \u201cvampire daughter,\u201d even to people I\u2019ve known since I was a kid. She\u2019s got a little bumper sticker with two inverted white triangles on a black background, the international symbol of support for vampire rights. She\u2019s even insisted on attending a meeting of the Friends and Family of the Undead, which, fortunately, had suspended activities after the foreclosure of the Traveler\u2019s Bowl, the hippie restaurant that hosted our meetings.</p><p>Of course, Mama still stocked my freezer with homemade pot pies to tempt me off my liquid diet. She showed up while I was sleeping and opened windows, hoping that I would slowly build up a tolerance to sunlight. As much as she loved me and being en vogue, Mama was determined to have a normal daughter. Even if it killed me.</p><p>I sifted through the alarming pile of mail while Mama bustled about my room, gathering dirty clothes. I\u2019d been approved for an obscenely high-limit credit card that I hadn\u2019t applied for. I\u2019d been accepted as the newest member of the Half-Moon Hollow Chamber of Commerce, which I had applied for. My letter to the editor for the American Library Association newsletter regarding the nationwide need for more vamp-friendly resources and hours was rejected. The fancy linen envelope stuck out like a sore thumb among the cheap, glossy promotions. My hands shook a little as I turned it over in my hands. Had Gabriel\u2019s mysterious pen pal finally decided to contact me? Imagine my horror when I saw the neat printed label addressed to \u201cMiss Jame Janeson\u201d from the Half-Moon Hollow High Alumni Committee instead. \u201cMiss\u201d was underlined. Twice.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, hon?\u201d Mama asked, folding my jeans with sharp creases.</p><p>I opened the overtly elegant invitation decorated with a palm tree. \u201cMy tenth high school reunion is this year. Ugh. And SueAnn Caldwell is our class president. I would rather face a den full of zombies than go to this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why on earth would you say that?\u201d Mama cried. \u201cYou had such a good time in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was Jenny, the cheerleader. I was the one with the braces and the tuba.\u201d</p><p>Mama winced at the venom in my voice when I said Jenny\u2019s name. My older, perfect sister was not speaking to me for various reasons, including the dismissal of her lawsuit against me. The judge had this wacky idea that property that was willed to me in a legal and binding last testament should remain mine, even though I was no longer technically living. This, combined with her overall disgust with how I handled the outing of our potential step-grandfather as a ghoul, had prompted her to tell Mama that I was officially dead to her. Even Mama saw the lack of logic in that statement, but she declined to comment on it.</p><p>Crafty, blond, and born with a naturally disdainful curl to her lip, Jenny was the twin-setted, Martha-worshipping yin to my never-even-considered-baking-from-scratch yang. She was the undisputed \u201cgood daughter\u201d between the two of us. She rarely disagreed with Mama. She enjoyed most of the things Mama loved: quilting, reading inspirational romance novels about Amish girls, actually ironing clothes instead of just throwing them in the dryer for a few minutes. And she\u2019d done her duty to the family by bearing two obnoxious spawn, Andrew and Whatshisface.</p><p>Life was oddly quiet and stale without Jenny\u2019s needling and disapproval. I\u2019d always thought I would be so much better off as an only child, but now, I sort of missed her. Of course, I would never admit this, even under pain of death and/or a threatened Baywatch marathon.</p><p>Mama rolled her eyes in a gesture that was somehow both dismissive and loving. \u201cOh, you have to go. Jenny went to her tenth reunion, and she had a wonderful time.\u201d</p><p>I scanned the invitation. \u201cJenny organized her high school reunion. I\u2019m sure she had a great time. Oh, come on. Our reunion theme is \u2018Enchanted Paradise,\u2019 which was our senior prom theme. They haven\u2019t had an original idea since then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think it would be good for you to go back and see that some of the people you went to school with weren\u2019t as scary as you made them out to be. You gave them a lot of power over you. Maybe it would do you some good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I went to my tenth reunion, everybody had gotten bald and fat. The Prom Queen was married to the Septic Tank King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes it slightly more tempting,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going downstairs to get your laundry started up. You get your rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary, Mama, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t have time to find a laundromat when you were gallivanting around God knows where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, the hotels had very nice laundry services. I didn\u2019t even know hotels did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let a stranger wash your clothes, but you don\u2019t want me to?\u201d Mama gasped.</p><p>\u201cIf it will make you happy and let me get back to sleep, wash away,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, honey.\u201d Mama grabbed the freshly folded dirty clothes and walked out. She popped her head back into the bedroom doorway. \u201cYou were just teasing about the zombies, right? They\u2019re not real?\u201d</p><p>I pulled a sleep mask over my eyes and did not answer.</p><p>My mother ironed my jeans. With starch.</p><p>And because I am obviously incapable of washing my own clothes properly, Mama gathered all of my clean clothes out of my closet and washed those while I slept. So, without other pants options, I was basically moseying into the shop, John Wayne-style.</p><p>On the drive to Specialty Books, I worked on a self-improvement plan, a personal to-do list, if you will. I had taken way too much time adjusting to my new vampire lifestyle, using it as an excuse for just floating along, reacting to problems as they came up. It wasn\u2019t surprising, really, when you considered that if there was a \u201cMost Likely to Be Paralyzed by Fear of Change\u201d award, a picture of me cringing would have been prominently featured in my high school yearbook. I had to get proactive. I had to demand things from the universe. I had to start kicking some ass ... though not in the physical sense, because I\u2019d basically lost or nearly lost every fight I\u2019d gotten into since being turned.</p><p>Moving on.</p><p>My plan to become a Brave New Jane went a little something like this:</p><p>(1) Develop a healthy, normal romantic relationship, preferably with Gabriel.</p><p>(2) Create a fulfilling career for myself.</p><p>(3) Demand that my family love me without judgment. Even if it means I have to rent a new family over the Internet.</p><p>(4) Find a solution for world peace.</p><p>I can live without that last one, though I know it\u2019s far more likely than the other three.</p><p>Considering that I was estranged from a sibling and a boyfriend, so far I\u2019d failed miserably at the list\u2014with the exception of the shop. It was barely recognizable, and not just because we\u2019d torn down a wall and expanded into the porn store next door. Other than the plywood Dick had nailed over the broken window, there were no signs of a break-in. Books that might have been damaged by the hands of thieves were laid out carefully on the bar. The rest were piled haphazardly under heavy plastic drop cloths.</p><p>The space had been realigned, expanded. The front counter, still the same antique leaded glass and maple affair Mr. Wainwright had left behind, had been moved closer to the door. New beige carpet had been installed and was prepared for the bolts needed for the new shelving system, a shelving system that would actually allow customers to find what they want and navigate their way back out of the store, neither of which was encouraged by the previous system. While I planned on offering general-interest books and classic literature, the inventory would focus on vampire needs: cookbooks, history, finance, investment advice. I had already ordered two hundred copies of The Guide for the Newly Undead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The walls were painted a cheerful midnight blue with a sprinkle of twinkling silver stars\u2014Andrea\u2019s suggestion, to keep the place from being \u201ctoo serious.\u201d I could have gone with the stereotypical blood-red walls and black-lacquered surfaces, but I didn\u2019t think that would be very restful for the customers. If not for the blood warmer next to the espresso machine and the chalkboard advertising a \u201cHalf-Caf Fat-Free Type A Mocha Latte\u201d (Dick\u2019s attempt at bonding with our yuppier customers), the store would look like any intentionally whimsical small-town bookstore. It was remarkable progress, considering that the first time I\u2019d come into the store, I narrowly missed having a shelf collapse on top of me.</p><p>Despite my wandering into the shop one night and rearranging stacks without permission, the former owner, Mr. Wainwright, had hired me on the spot for my organizational skills and rabid love of books. He became a surrogate grandparent, a mentor, and a close friend. Even though he\u2019d died the previous year, he was the happiest he\u2019d ever been, quite content to haunt the Hollow and pursue a logic-boggling relationship with my aunt Jettie. When he left me the shop in his will, I\u2019d considered closing it. But, aside from the library, Specialty Books was the only place where I\u2019d felt at home. I loved the smell of the books, the odd and nonsensical variety of titles. I loved the memories I had of Mr. Wainwright, his quirks, his stories of a lifetime searching the globe for paranormal creatures. I could just imagine him, standing at the end of the counter, giving me that fond, slightly befuddled smile.</p><p>It was at that moment that I realized I was not imagining Mr. Wainwright. He was standing at the end of the counter, giving me that fond, slightly befuddled smile.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Wainwright.\u201d I sighed at the apparition and, forgetting that he was noncorporeal, tried to throw my arms around him. I ended up falling through him, a clammy got-in-the-shower-too-early sensation that set even my teeth on edge.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since I got back. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve been rather ashamed to face you,\u201d he said, twisting his hands. \u201cI spent less and less time at the shop while you were gone. I have been ever since ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started enjoying my great-aunt\u2019s company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAnd as it turned out, the shop being in such upheaval, well, it upset me more than I anticipated, and I haven\u2019t wanted to spend as much time here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d I was stricken. When Mr. Wainwright had given me his blessing to burn the shop for insurance money if necessary, I charged ahead with the renovations, thinking that if he was onboard for arson for hire, surely a little remodeling wouldn\u2019t bother him. I was an ass. A complete and utter ass.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t realize how much change you would deem necessary. I don\u2019t take it as a personal insult, dear. I didn\u2019t expect so much to happen so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Wainwright\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waved away my apologies. \u201cThe point is that I told you I\u2019d keep an eye on the shop while you were gone, and it was my fault that someone broke in. I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, do not play the self-blame game with the world champion, OK? It\u2019s not as if they did a lot of damage, Mr. Wainwright. It\u2019s not a big deal. Besides, you\u2019re not tethered to the place. You\u2019re allowed to have a life ... or not, as the case may.\u201d I cringed. It took Mr. Wainwright a beat to grasp the insensitivity of what I had just said, but then he hooted. I laughed, and then it turned into an all-out ghostly giggle fest, which was a fabulous emotional icebreaker.</p><p>I wiped at my eyes, trying to compose myself. \u201cAny idea who might have broken into the shop? Have there been suspicious characters hanging around? More suspicious than the characters we normally get?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. If there had been, I would have given them what your aunt Jettie calls the usual.\u201d</p><p>Cold chills, goose bumps, a vague feeling of unease as if they\u2019ve left the iron on?\u201d I asked. Mr. Wainwright nodded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go visit Aunt Jettie?\u201d I suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll be here for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we did get rather used to having the house to ourselves while you were gone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo details, please,\u201d I said, holding my hands up. \u201cJust go and enjoy yourselves, in a way that I never have to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, fading slightly. \u201cAnd Jane?\u201d I looked up, and he smiled at me. \u201cI missed you, too, dear.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright winked at me and dissolved into thin air.</p><p>Outside the shop, I heard the motor of Dick\u2019s El Camino roaring to a stop. I laughed and ran to the door. Richard Cheney, who, for reasons I didn\u2019t understand, insists on being called Dick, had enjoyed annoying the hell out of Gabriel since they were children in the pre-Civil War Hollow. In their last human years, Dick had developed a bit of a gambling problem and lost his family plantation house to Gabriel in a card game. Gabriel\u2019s guilt over winning against an incredibly drunk Dick and Dick\u2019s pride-fueled refusal to take the house back led to a rift that lasted long after they were both turned into vampires. Immortality had just given Dick a lot more time to think up insulting nicknames and juvenile practical jokes.</p><p>A mystifying mix of fierce loyalty and moral flexibility, Dick was the local go-to guy for under-the-table commerce. And he had fallen hard for Andrea, the first woman to turn him down in about a century. Andrea didn\u2019t put up with much in the way of bullshit from Dick, which, apparently, was what he was looking for all along. She was the only woman he was willing (intentionally) to make a fool of himself over.</p> <p>They were now shacking up in a big way. He slowly but surely had moved his vaguely obscene T-shirts and Dukes of Hazzard memorabilia into her swanky condo. Before she realized it, they were cohabitating. It\u2019s by far the sneakiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen him do, and that\u2019s saying something.</p><p>For her part, Andrea didn\u2019t seem to mind. They didn\u2019t seem to have the adjustment problems that Gabriel and I had. Neither of them had really changed. Andrea was still the same classy, ethereally beautiful redhead with the elegant wardrobe. Dick was still the same guy you wouldn\u2019t want to take home to Mom. But he spent a lot more time at the shop and way less time in back alleys negotiating for counterfeit concert tickets. That\u2019s progress, right?</p><p>To be fair, Andrea had more experience that I did at dating the undead. When she was in college, her rare blood type caught the attention of a vampire professor, who convinced her to drop out, move in with him, and be his personal human wine cellar. A few years later, Andrea was unceremoniously booted by her fickle vampire lover, leaving her with no education, no job, and a family that refused to speak to her. She\u2019d moved to the Hollow, where she worked part-time as a blood surrogate and, now, full-time as an employee of Specialty Books and a part-time dog-sitter.</p><p>In addition to her clerk duties, Dick and Andrea kept Fitz for me while I was out of town. As much as Jolene and Fitz loved to play, it can be confusing for weres to spend a lot of time with dogs. There are food-competition issues.</p><p>Fitz bounded into the store and nearly knocked me down with the weight of his hello kisses. Fitz is a pound find, the apparent result of a night of reckless passion between Scooby-Doo and a bean-bag chair. The only thing remotely dignified about him is that I named him after Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy from Pride and Prejudice.</p><p>Despite being the size of a small tank, Fitz wasn\u2019t much of a daytime guard. Now that I\u2019d had one of those \u201cshock collar\u201d invisible fences installed around the property to keep Fitz from bothering Jolene and Zeb, he mostly just enjoyed loping around the acreage, protecting the perimeter from roving bands of squirrels.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d I squealed, scratching behind Fitz\u2019s ears. \u201cOh, who\u2019s a good boy? Did you miss me?\u201d</p><p>Andrea and Dick stepped through the front door. A huge smile stretched across Andrea\u2019s face. Dick usually greeted me with a wildly inappropriate single entendre, but today he had an agenda. \u201cThat dog,\u201d he informed me as Fitz licked my neck, \u201cis a menace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he wasn\u2019t a bother, were you?\u201d Andrea cooed as Fitz rolled over for a belly rub. \u201cWere you, buddy? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you wearing a golf shirt?\u201d I asked, fingering the light blue material of Dick\u2019s collared attire.</p><p>Dick seethed a moment before slapping my hand away. \u201cHe ate my favorite T-shirt!\u201d He kissed Andrea\u2019s temple and stalked off. \u201cI\u2019m going to go steal something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I called after Dick, who continued to sulk as he went about gathering boxes for the trash. \u201cThe shirt will probably pass in a few days.\u201d I turned to Andrea, who threw her arms around my neck. \u201cHe seems really pissed. When he said he was going to steal something, did he mean from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said. \u201cDick loves Fitz. He would ignore Fitz and scold him for getting up on the couch, but the minute I left the room, Dick was scratching his ears and baby-talking to him worse than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick was using baby talk?\u201d I said, limping as I rounded the counter. \u201cYou\u2019ve neutered him. What\u2019s next? Sweater vests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you doing back?\u201d she asked, squeezing me tight. \u201cI told Zeb not to call you. The break-in wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m very glad to be back, and I missed you, too,\u201d I responded in a flat voice, avoiding the question. \u201cKeep this barrage of homecoming welcome going, and I won\u2019t give you your presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresents!\u201d Andrea cried, clapping and hopping up and down.</p><p>\u201cFrom the snottiest personal parfumerie in France.\u201d I paused to hand her a little lavender gift bag. \u201cI have to tell you that the chemist was slightly unnerved that I was able to describe your natural scent in so much detail, but it was important to get the blend that would complement you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c I\u2019m a little unnerved that you could describe my natural scent in such detail,\u201d she admitted. \u201cDid you get Dick what he asked for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I got him shot glasses from every country we visited. And in every gift shop I entered, I was glared at and called a \u2018horrible American,\u2019\u201d I said, rolling my eyes as I handed her the tinkling box of extremely embarrassing trinkets. \u201cAnd I got him this!\u201d</p><p>She squinted to read the wrinkled red T-shirt I was holding up. \u201cIt\u2019s in Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says, \u2018My friend went to Italy, and all I got was this stupid T-shirt,\u2019\u201d I said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d add some class to Dick\u2019s T-shirt collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got rid of most of the tackier ones.\u201d Andrea groaned.</p><p>\u201cSo ... you framed my dog for T-shirt theft, huh?\u201d I narrowed my eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cIf you were laundering a \u201cFederal Bikini Inspector\u201d T-shirt what would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not use an innocent dog to mask my attempts at giving my boyfriend a makeover,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to change all of him,\u201d she whispered, eyeing the back of the shop, where Dick was working. \u201cJust the tackier T-shirts. And the ones with crusty armpits.\u201d</p><p>Andrea eyed my hesitant gait as I rounded the counter. \u201cDid you get a rash while you were traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, jeans, starch. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d I shuddered as I climbed onto one of the high, cushioned bar stools I\u2019d ordered in a deep eggplant. \u201cHow do you guys do it? You make it look so easy. You\u2019ve only been dating for a little while, and your personalities are so different. Frankly, your googly-eyed happiness is starting to piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to be honest, we had a little outside help,\u201d she said, her tone a bit sheepish. She disappeared to the self-help section, then came back with a large pink book with pouty fang-puckered lips from the cover. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLove Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less Destructive Relationships. \u201d I read the title aloud. My eyes narrowed at her. \u201cYou read this crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sell this crap, you hypocrite,\u201d she said, her lips pinched into an expression that would have made Jenny proud. \u201cBesides, there aren\u2019t a lot of books out there for mortal women dating vampires. I think the psychiatric world at large believes that if you\u2019re dating a vampire, you have other issues that need to be addressed before your relationship problems. But this was really helpful. It\u2019s written for women who have recently been turned and are having a hard time adjusting to dating their undead peers. There\u2019s lots of stuff about healthy expectations and boundaries and violent tendencies. So, do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Andrea walked to the coffee bar. A few seconds later, the espresso machine roared to life. \u201cRight, because what would I know about being in a relationship with a much older vampire you may or may not be able to trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDang you and your logic.\u201d I pressed the heels of my hands into my eyes and took a deep, unnecessary breath. Andrea was the first human I\u2019d ever fed from. It tends to bond gals for life. Andrea helped me bridge the gap from semi-social-phobic closet vampire to respectable undead citizen. Thrilled finally to have someone to take classes with after years of an empty social calendar, she enrolled us in yoga classes, ceramics classes, jewelry-making classes, even cake decorating, which we agreed later was a mistake. She\u2019d basically become the girlfriend I\u2019d always tried to make Zeb into. If I couldn\u2019t talk to her about this, whom could I talk to?</p><p>I sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s probably cheating on me. And I think he might have broken up with me ... but without saying the actual words.\u201d</p><p>Andrea chewed her plump bottom lip. \u201cGabriel is a pretty direct person. I\u2019m sure he would have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018If you have to go, you have to go.\u2019 And then he said, \u2018This is for the best. This trip didn\u2019t exactly work out as we\u2019d hoped. I\u2019ll call you.\u2019\u201d I caught the flash of horror cross her features. \u201cSee? You flinched! I knew it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the beginning. Why did you think Gabriel might be cheating on you? Not impressions or feelings, actual facts.\u201d</p><p>I ticked the offenses off with my fingers. \u201cWeird phone calls that he refused to take around me, manic behavior, constant changes in our hotel plans, notes at our hotels that he wouldn\u2019t let me read. And what I could read wasn\u2019t good. Lots of present-tense words. But I\u2019m just being paranoid, right? I mean, there\u2019s probably a rational explanation for all this, right? Like he\u2019s an undead secret agent? That\u2019s plausible, right?\u201d</p><p>Andrea winced as she poured me an espresso in a tiny white demitasse. \u201cWell ... probably not. That\u2019s all pretty suspicious stuff. When Mattias cheated on me, he had a lot of late \u2018faculty meetings.\u2019 He took calls from his \u2018teaching assistant\u2019 in another room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop using the quotation marks, I need this life lesson to be unvarnished and without ironic subtext.\u201d Andrea pushed the fancy cup at me again. I considered claiming some sort of vampire aversion to the high-octane concoction, but Andrea was well aware that while we lack the digestive enzymes to digest solid food, we have no problems with most liquids. Sometimes it\u2019s a pain that Andrea is so well informed.</p><p>I was not a big coffee drinker in life. Iced frappuccinos from Dairy Queen were about as adventurous as I got. But Andrea insisted that if I was going to sell coffee, I had to know what I was talking about. And now that the machinery was up and running, she was my self-appointed caffeine pusher.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d Andrea shoved the cup at me with more force. I took a sip. \u201cGah! That\u2019s awful! My cousin Muriel isn\u2019t that bitter, and she has two gay ex-husbands ... who now live together. Is that how it\u2019s supposed to taste?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSadly, yes. It\u2019s an acquired taste,\u201d Andrea admitted as she sipped her own coffee without making Edward G. Robinson faces. \u201cSo, invisible quotation marks aside, when Mattias cheated on me, he stopped taking me to familiar restaurants, because he\u2019d started taking her to our places. It was new restaurants all the time. He was on edge. He accused me of being paranoid when I asked legitimate questions like \u2018Why did you change your e-mail password?\u2019 or \u2018Where did you sleep yesterday?\u2019\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cI\u2019m going to be miserable and alone for the rest of my long, long life.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOh, it\u2019s not so bad. We still have yoga on Thursday nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, that will make up for the loss of companionship and sexual gratification.\u201d</p><p>Andrea grinned salaciously. \u201cWell, you never know what you might learn in yoga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerv.\u201d I chucked a coffee filter at her.</p><p>Andrea finally gave me the full report on the break-in. She\u2019d arrived early a few evenings back, expecting a delivery of comfy chairs for the reading nook, and found the front window bashed in. She called the cops, who were sadly familiar with the neighborhood, and they chalked it up to drug addicts, teenagers, or drug-addicted teenagers. Proving precisely why I hired her in the first place, Andrea had already filed the insurance paperwork, arranged for an antiques appraiser from Louisville to come by to estimate the damage to the books, and contacted a glass repairman to replace the front window the following afternoon.</p><p>\u201cSo, really, there was no reason for me to come home,\u201d I said, awkwardly stuffing my hands into my pockets.</p> <p>Andrea arched an eyebrow at me. \u201cYeah, I wish someone had thought to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>In an undead relationship, it\u2019s best not to focus on the \u201cnots.\u201d Not being able to have children. Not being able to legally marry. Instead, focus on what you can have, true long-term commitment.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to</p><p>Less Destructive Relationships</p><p>I could smell that Jolene was pregnant, a new, soft, green sort of scent that hit me the moment she opened the creaking trailer door.</p><p>I put on my \u201cignoring my surroundings\u201d smile, the one that said, \u201cI do not see the huge streaks of rust lapping down the pink wall panels or the carpeting that may be Astroturf.\u201d Zeb was overseeing a PTA meeting that night and had asked me to check in on his bride. She\u2019d missed me, he said, and was a little put out that it had taken me three days to make it over to their place. Fortunately, I was carrying two recently reheated pot pies to win my way back into her good graces.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She beamed until she saw what I was holding. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jolene loved Mama\u2019s pot pies. For the last year, they were the only thing that kept her enormous appetite at bay when she visited my house. Since she and Zeb became my neighbors, I brought them over regularly for Jolene to snack on. And now, the mere presence of my foil-wrapped gift seemed to be turning Jolene a delightful shade of \u201cbleh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cI\u2019m just a little sensitive to smells right now. Hormones combined with werewolf nose make it so much worse. Zeb was brownin\u2019 hamburger the other night, and I had to run out of the room to throw up twice. And I can\u2019t eat the foods I usually love. I couldn\u2019t get enough of your mama\u2019s pot pies a few months ago, and now, just the thought of breakin\u2019 the crust\u2014\u201d Jolene took a deep breath and pursed her lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it outside,\u201d I said. \u201cYou sit down.\u201d</p><p>I went to the kitchen and managed to smack myself in the face with a half-attached cupboard door while I poured Jolene a glass of water. The trailer was snug, to say the least. The kitchen was what Jolene\u2019s mother, Mimi, called a \u201ctwo-butt model,\u201d meaning no more than two butts could fit side by side between the stained faux-wood-grain counters at any one time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of Saltines, so I grabbed some Ritz crackers,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, the color of her cheeks returning ever so slightly as she opened the wax-paper tube. \u201cSo, how was your trip?\u201d</p><p>I launched into what was now the standard, heavily edited description. Lovely hotels, rude people, beautiful museums. Jolene paused mid-chew and clapped a hand over her mouth. With an \u201cOh, God,\u201d she ran for the bathroom door and retched pitifully.</p><p>Like a doofus, I followed her into the tiny bathroom. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>I pressed my hand over my nose as Jolene\u2019s sick smell smacked me in the face.</p><p>\u201cThis is as close to pregnancy as I ever want to get.\u201d I handed her the water glass. \u201cI thought morning sickness was just supposed to be, well, in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ass. It\u2019s around-the clock- \u2018no-warnin\u2019 sickness,\u2019\u201d she wheezed. \u201cOne minute, I\u2019m a perfectly fine, functioning human being, and the next, I\u2019m tossin\u2019 up everything I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s saying something,\u201d I marveled. She glared at me. \u201cNot helping, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw up in the parkin\u2019 lot at the Piggly Wiggly the other day. I had to tell Bitty Tate I was pregnant, because I didn\u2019t want her telling everybody I\u2019ve got a drinkin\u2019 problem. Everything makes me sick. I ate a salad the other day, a salad, without any meat at all. I\u2019m gonna waste away to nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I eyed her belly paunch, which made her look about four months along in human terms. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d</p><p>She glared up at me. \u201cI\u2019m gonna hit you, just as soon as I can stand up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so miserable,\u201d she said, tears welling up in her eyes. \u201cAnd I should be grateful that we made a baby so easily. Some mixed couples can\u2019t, you know. And I can\u2019t complain to my mama, because she\u2019ll camp out here in the living room and refuse to leave until the baby is in college. And I can\u2019t complain to Zeb, because he gets this weird, frightened-rabbit look in his eyes if I imply that I\u2019m anythin\u2019 but one-hundred-percent awesome. I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you look great,\u201d I told her, pushing her hair back from her sweaty forehead. And it was true in an infuriating way. Even the sweaty glow and water retention of early pregnancy only bumped Jolene down to what would be considered gorgeous for most humans. It just wasn\u2019t fair to the four billion or so other women on the planet. My only consolation was that eating a Ritz cracker had just made her throw up.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s your family?\u201d I asked, helping her back into her chair.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mama\u2019s overjoyed. Calls me six or seven times a day. She says hi, by the way. Daddy\u2019s sort of torn between pride and the horror of knowin\u2019 what his little girl\u2019s been up to. I think up until now, he\u2019d been tellin\u2019 himself that Zeb and I were sleepin\u2019 in bunk beds. My cousins are sort of holdin\u2019 their breath, I think, because they know my aunts are gonna make a huge fuss because it\u2019s my first baby. And my cousin Vance has run away with a carnival.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, picturing the none-too-bright cousin with unnatural feelings for Jolene operating a Tilt-A-Whirl. \u201cIs this one of those things where I hope that you\u2019re kidding but assume that you\u2019re not?\u201d She nodded. I tried to use a nonchalant tone as I asked, \u201cHow are you and Zeb doing?\u201d</p><p>She sighed again. \u201cWeird. He\u2019s so quiet. He\u2019s never quiet, except for when, you know, under a whammy. Oh, man, you don\u2019t think Mama Ginger scrambled his brain again, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not, or we wouldn\u2019t be havin\u2019 this conversation,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI think Zeb\u2019s just scared. Scared of growing up. Scared of not being able to take care of you and the ... litter.\u201d Jolene got it together enough to smack my arm. I winced, glad that bruises didn\u2019t last long on me. \u201cOK, think about what happens to married people with children in Zeb\u2019s family. They end up drunk and angry and living in matching trailers in their relatives\u2019 backyards. He\u2019s terrified of ending up like Mama Ginger and Floyd. I think he convinced himself that he could handle the transition to husband pretty well, but what I will only refer to as his spontaneity and your superabsorbent eggs came back to bite both of you on the butt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop putting ketchup on your egg rolls, for one thing. That\u2019s gross. And maybe your family could spend less time rearranging your cabinets. Other than that, hell, I\u2019ve never been married or pregnant. What do I know?\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cWell, you\u2019re a big help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do what I can. Or don\u2019t, as the case may be. Now, tell me, how is Mama Ginger? Is she still all skittish and sorry? Or has she returned to her deranged, yet strangely effective, ways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank the Lord.\u201d Jolene rolled her eyes. \u201cShe seems to feel just bad enough to stick to snippy comments when Zeb\u2019s not around and then pretendin\u2019 not to know why I\u2019m upset.\u201d</p><p>My brows lifted. \u201cComments about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout having everythin\u2019 handed to me. How it must be nice to have a family that will give you a trailer, friends that will give you land and money to build a house. About how I need to cut the apron strings and stop letting my family boss me around. I guess, \u2019cause she wants to be the one bossin\u2019 me around. Then she\u2019ll start makin\u2019 suggestions on how I could make her son happier. And then I just mention how you might be droppin\u2019 by, and she gets really quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew I was out of the country, right?\u201d I asked. Jolene nodded. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not as if I can teleport home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told Mama Ginger about the baby yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cI was thinking we would wait for the baby to be a year old or so. Maybe in kindergarten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not unwise,\u201d I said, picturing what Mama Ginger might consider appropriate boundaries and advice for an expectant mother. \u201cSo, how does this whole werewolf pregnancy work? Zeb already told me about the shorter-gestation thing. But what else is different? I mean, can you still transform? Are werewolf babies born able to transform? Do you give birth in a big cardboard box with towels in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d Jolene said, glaring at me.</p><p>I held up my thumb and forefinger, measuring \u201ca little bit funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can phase for about another month. After that, it can be stressful for me and for the baby,\u201d she said, rubbing her belly. \u201cPups can\u2019t phase until they\u2019re at least five. Their little bodies can\u2019t handle it until then. Mama always said it was God\u2019s way of keepin\u2019 them from runnin\u2019 off and never being seen again,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a perfectly normal human birth with a perfectly normal baby. And even though the women in my pack have given birth at home for the last twenty generations, I\u2019ll be givin\u2019 birth in a hospital. Zeb\u2019s sort of insistin\u2019 on it. I think the idea of not havin\u2019 doctors, expensive machines, and high-test drugs\u2014for him, not me\u2014makes him a little panicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t really blame him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m sort of relieved to have an excuse to go to a hospital,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve always hated attendin\u2019 the births on the farm. I mean, I know I don\u2019t exactly have modesty issues, but the idea of being laid out like that and, you know, all that stuff coming out while my aunts and cousins come runnin\u2019 in and out of the room, takin\u2019 pictures and smokin\u2019 and describin\u2019 their own horrible births. No, thank you. Mama\u2019s a little disappointed, and I think it hurts the aunts\u2019 feelin\u2019s. But to be honest, I think everybody else is sort of interested in what it\u2019s gonna be like to wait around in the hospital for a baby. It will be a McClaine family first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about prenatal care? Ultrasounds? Won\u2019t a doctor notice that you gave birth to a full-term baby four months early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a midwife in town who\u2019s been takin\u2019 care of the family for years. She helps with the births and prenatal care. She helps us fake the medical records and the birth certificates so they appear normal. The humans will just assume I was pregnant before the wedding, which I can live with,\u201d she said, toying with her glass. \u201cBut I have a favor to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this involves the words \u2018birthing coach,\u2019 my answer is \u2018I\u2019m touched, but no thank you,\u2019\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI was hopin\u2019 you would come be there at the hospital, as sort of a referee/bouncer. Keep my family from invadin\u2019 the labor room and Zeb\u2019s family from killin\u2019 each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t have to see anything or hear anything or, again, see anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m your girl.\u201d</p><p>I should have suspected something was wrong with the Half-Moon Hollow Chamber of Commerce as soon as I saw the chamber seal was pink.</p><p>It had been a while since I\u2019d attended a chamber meeting\u2014ten years, to be exact, since I was awarded a $1,500 Chamber of Commerce good citizen\u2019s scholarship for writing an essay on \u201cPatriotism: What Living in Half-Moon Hollow Means to Me.\u201d It was May 1995. I was a senior. I was $1,000 short on tuition and faced living at home and attending the local community college. I would have written it in limerick form if they\u2019d asked.</p><p>That dinner was unremarkable, the main difference being that the chamber seal was still navy blue and gold. I was served bland chicken while the chamber president gave a speech on the perils of youth and supporting good, decent young people where they could find them. I was handed a check and dismissed so the chamber could discuss the possibility of attracting a rubber-band manufacturer to the Hollow.</p><p>The present-day chamber office had moved to a swankier part of downtown, to a restored Victorian townhouse with a dizzying amount of gingerbread. With the pink and white seal proudly presented on the lawn, the place looked more like a sorority house than the place where our community\u2019s collective business interests met.</p><p>To be honest, joining the chamber was sort of a test. Reopening the shop and trying to attract a larger clientele meant I was going to have face the living public with much more regularity. I\u2019d managed to operate on the fringes of polite society for the past year or so. And frankly, I had no confidence that I wasn\u2019t going to get staked by a random customer in a disagreement over a senior discount. I wanted to see if I could move among humans again. Plus, it was important for Specialty Books to shed its obscurity and enter the mainstream business community. Too many Hollow residents had no idea what or where we were. Andrea and I wanted to be the sort of establishment that welcomed all beings, dead or undead, and their money. Joining the chamber was the first step in becoming legitimate.</p><p>I was greeted at the door by a wall of high-pitched chatter. All around me, slender blond women in knockoff designer suits sipped wine spritzers and swished their hair back and forth in slow motion. A few of the braver, thinner souls were wearing suit jackets paired with capris, which to me has always seemed like the professional equivalent to wearing hot pants to the office. But on these girls, it looked fashion-forward.</p><p>They were all so ... shiny. The last time I was around this much pink, it belonged to Missy Houston, the vampire real-estate agent who tried to frame me for murder, steal my house, and kill me. I shook through my color phobia and built up whatever psychic defenses I could muster against the waves of rampant thoughts. It was like having a really insecure mosquito buzzing around the surface of my brain. Given the \u201cjust flew in from the tanning bed\u201d glow most of the girls were sporting, I was absolutely sure I was the only vampire in the building. And somehow, I didn\u2019t think it would be a good time to bring it up.</p><p>The floor was highly polished and very old. I felt my own sensible flats slip across the polished surface and wondered how these women negotiated it in those stilettos. I plucked at the conservative navy pantsuit I\u2019d chosen in the hopes that it made me appear to be a serious businesswoman. Even with vampire hotness on my side, I felt a little dowdy. I checked to make sure that at the very least, I\u2019d worn matching shoes.</p><p>I decided to give it three minutes before I bolted from the building as if my eyebrows were on fire. There was a sign-up table offering \u201cHello, My Name Is\u201d tags and pastel gel pens. But none of the other ladies was wearing one, because, of course, they already knew one another. I snagged a copy of the meeting agenda from the refreshment table. It was printed on pink paper with brown polka dots, the kind you might buy from an extremely perky stationery store.</p><p>That\u2019s when I realized. There were no men. Anywhere. Not a single whiff of testosterone in the place. Had I accidentally stumbled into a man-eating coven? Was I going to be sacrificed as the ugly brunette?</p><p>I decided that my three-minute limit was up and made a dash toward the door, bumping into a willowy blonde as she poured another chardonnay. She dropped the bottle, which I quickly snagged before it hit the carpet.</p><p>\u201cFast hands,\u201d she said, tinkling out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m lucky you caught that, or Courtney Ahern would have torn out my eyes for ruining the Persian rug. I\u2019m Courtney Barrow. I own the Unique Boutique, the sterling-silver shop over on Dogwood.\u201d</p><p>Courtney Barrow was just as cute as a button. She was tiny, curvy, and had an intricately braided silver necklace looped around her neck. Though my proximity to a substance I was highly allergic to made me somewhat nervous, Courtney Barrow was the only genuinely friendly face I\u2019d seen that night, so I was sticking close to her.</p><p>\u201cJane Jameson, Specialty Books.\u201d</p><p>Her slick, coral lips quirked. \u201cIsn\u2019t that an adult store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, there used to be an adult store next door. But we bought them out and expanded into their space. We pretty much gutted the store and started all over. You couldn\u2019t have used that space for anything else, anyway. There was a lot of steam-cleaning involved. I don\u2019t know when to stop talking sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Courtney was unfazed by my babbling. \u201cA bookstore. That\u2019s so interesting. What made you go into the book business, Jane?</p><p>\u201cI was too tall to be a ballerina?\u201d I offered.</p><p>Courtney giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re a hoot! Oh, you just have to meet Courtney Harris. She\u2019d love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d I said as she wound her arm through mine. \u201cWait, she\u2019s named Courtney, too? How many Courtneys are there here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d Courtney sighed as she led me deeper into the crowd of shimmering Courtneys. I was introduced to Courtney Gordon, who had started an event-planning company for children\u2019s birthday parties, and Courtney Stephenson, who ran a specialty shop for baby bed linens. None of them seemed even remotely interested in my bookshop, and, to be honest, I couldn\u2019t figure out how I would cross-promote occult items with luxury crib sheets. I was starting to think I\u2019d made a huge mistake joining the chamber. I wondered if Courtney Barrow would release me voluntarily or if I would have to gnaw off my arm like a coyote stuck in a trap.</p><p>\u201cIt was so confusing when we all joined at once. We didn\u2019t want to call each other \u2018Courtney H,\u2019 \u2018Courtney B,\u2019 \u2018Courtney G.\u2019 This isn\u2019t second grade, you know?\u201d I smiled and nodded, because there was no derailing this chick\u2019s train of thought. \u201cSo, we tried nicknames, \u2018Short Courtney,\u2019 \u2018Blond Courtney,\u2019 \u2018Cankles Courtney.\u2019 But some of the girls\u2019 feelings were hurt, so we ended up having to use Courtney H, Courtney B, Courtney G anyway. We still use Cankles Courtney, but only behind her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that sounds mean,\u201d Courtney conceded. \u201cBut trust me, you\u2019ll know her when you see her.\u201d</p><p>OK, it was mean, but I did recognize Cankles Courtney right away. Sadly lacking in lower-quadrant definition, she was cowering before the formidable Courtney Herndon and receiving a stern talking-to regarding the chamber newsletter\u2019s font style. Apparently, Cankles\u2019 version of Curlz wasn\u2019t curly enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCourtney Herndon is the head Courtney,\u201d Courtney Barrow whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s been the chamber president for the last four years.\u201d</p><p>Did she just say \u201chead Courtney\u201d? There was a Courtney hierarchy?</p><p>\u201cCourtney!\u201d my guide exclaimed. Several women throughout the room turned to us, realized we were referring to someone else, and went back to their wine. Courtney Herndon gave me an appraising look and a thin smile.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Jane. She runs a bookstore where the porn shop used to be!\u201d Courtney Barrow squealed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuper,\u201d Courtney Herndon said, though her voice gave the distinct impression that she couldn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cAre you from the Hollow originally, or are you a transplant like us?\u201d Courtney Barrow asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a native,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018transplant\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, we all married boys from the Hollow.\u201d Courtney Herndon snorted derisively, as though she did not appreciate being uprooted.</p> <p>Courtney Barrow smiled fondly, ignoring Courtney Herndon, as she said, \u201cMy husband, Gary, told me he couldn\u2019t imagine living anywhere else, so I just followed him home. Same with all of the Courtneys. None of us really has to work, but we\u2019re self-starters. Except for Lisa over there.\u201d Courtney lowered her voice and nodded toward a strawberry blonde in a suit even more conservative than mine. \u201cShe runs her family\u2019s accounting firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains why I\u2019ve never met most of you.\u201d I turned to Courtney Herndon. \u201cCourtney, what do you do?\u201d</p><p>Courtney Herndon stroked back a stray blond curl. \u201cI do home demonstrations for women interested in cosmetic products. I do home parties, makeovers, special kits.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSo, it\u2019s like Mary Kay?\u201d</p><p>Courtney H\u2019s jaw twitched as she hissed out, \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like Mary Kay !\u201d She turned on her ice-pick heels and stomped toward the wine table.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMary Kay asked Courtney H to resign because her sales tactics were too aggressive,\u201d Courtney Barrow whispered, a conspiratorial grin tilting her lips. \u201cShe would point out a flaw and then recommend a product to fix it. Only, Courtney can be really, really ... honest sometimes. And some customers complained. So, Courtney sent the customers letters to tell them why they were wrong ... and then Mary Kay\u2019s corporate offices filed the restraining order.\u201d</p><p>I stifled a laugh. \u201cWho\u2019s she working for now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says she\u2019s an independent contractor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s mixing up her own makeup in her basement? Given the restraining order, that can\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Courtney Barrow lowered her voice even more. Even with vampire hearing, I\u2019m sort of surprised I could hear her. \u201cShe\u2019s still selling the Mary Kay stuff. She had loads of it when she quit. You know, your upline always tells you that you can\u2019t sell from an empty wagon? Well, she took it seriously. She has enough lip plumper to sink a cruise ship. She just takes off all the packaging and replaces it with her own stickers she prints at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is both brilliant and deranged,\u201d I whispered back. Courtney Barrow giggled again, which was becoming less annoying.</p><p>She nodded to a tense blonde in the corner, who seemed to be scanning the room over and over, searching for some sort of infraction. \u201cThat\u2019s Courtney Ahern, the one who\u2019s crazy about the carpet. This house used to belong to one of her in-laws, but she persuaded her husband to give the tenants the boot and renovate the place for our headquarters. But now she\u2019s paranoid one of us will do something to ruin the house\u2019s potential resale value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Courtney A do?\u201d I asked. \u201cSell something that\u2019s nothing like Amway?\u201d</p> <p>Courtney Barrow guffawed. \u201cI\u2019m going to like you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... good.\u201d</p><p>Courtney Herndon stood, cleared her throat, and silenced the room. The various Courtneys filed into the meeting room, where we were directed to cozy tea chairs instead of the usual folding monstrosities. I sat through the approval of the minutes, the agenda, and the pledge. I came up with my own identification system for the Courtneys as they debated the proper color scheme for the annual business directory. Courtney Barrow, the only one who\u2019d bothered to be friendly, was \u201cNice Courtney.\u201d Courtney Herndon was \u201cHead Courtney.\u201d Courtney Gordon, who appeared to be some sort of sycophant/enforcer, was \u201cToady Courtney.\u201d Courtney Ahern was \u201cCoaster Courtney.\u201d I couldn\u2019t come up with a better-fitting nickname for Cankles Courtney and felt a little bad about it. I moved on to picking which chamber member I would eat first if we were stuck on a desert island. I settled on Courtney Jensen, or \u201cFitness Courtney,\u201d because it was obvious that woman hadn\u2019t even seen a carb in years, and high-protein diets give blood a rich, oaky finish. I\u2019d almost nodded off when I heard my name being called.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I almost shouted, bolting upright in my fancy laced chair.</p><p>\u201cIt is Jane, right?\u201d Head Courtney demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re the new member?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ...\u201d</p><p>Head Courtney\u2019s smile tightened as the other ladies tittered. \u201cWe were just discussing the Fall Festival charity for the animal shelter.\u201d</p><p>This was so much worse than being caught sleeping in math class. I nodded and slapped on my \u201cpleasant face.\u201d On my right, Nice Courtney sat frozen in her chair, a Stepford smile pasted on.</p><p>\u201cNow, Jane, I think it would be a great idea if you gathered together the prizes for the games? Normally, we solicit donated items from businesses in the community. And since you\u2019re new, you probably have all kinds of contacts that we haven\u2019t even thought of yet!\u201d</p><p>Well, I could ask Dick about that trunkload of pirated Knight Rider DVDs I gave him the year before ...</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll just put you down to head the prize committee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just my first meeting,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m qualified\u2014\u201d</p><p>Head Courtney\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThere\u2019s no better way to get to know us better than just to throw yourself into the work. Really, it\u2019s the best way to make friends here at the chamber, showing what a team player you can be. You do want us to think you\u2019re a team player, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t my sister in this club? Seriously?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to help with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Head Courtney cried, interrupting my attempt at shirking the games in favor of decorations or something less \u201ccommitment-y.\u201d \u201cLisa will give you all of the information from last year.\u201d</p><p>From across the room, Lisa rolled her eyes and shared a commiserating look with me. This was followed by a report from the jack-o\u2019-lantern committee and the treat committee, who lamented the lack of volunteers for making gluten-free snacks. I had never so earnestly wished that I could die of natural causes. Boredom was a natural cause, right? After the game committee and the inflatable committee, I wondered whether there was anyone in the room who was not on a committee.</p><p>\u201cNow, the planning committee has come up with a list of acceptable costumes. I know some of you older members like to get started on your kids\u2019 costumes early.\u201d</p><p>The oldest member in the room looked to be about thirty-five. And she did not look as if she took that as a compliment.</p><p>I raised my hand. \u201cSo, wait, this is a Halloween party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, if we call it a Halloween party, some families won\u2019t come. So it\u2019s a Fall Festival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re going to have pumpkins ... and costumes ... and candy.\u201d</p><p>Head Courtney glared down at me. \u201cIs there going to be a problem, Jane?\u201d</p><p>There could be a problem. Believe it or not, vampires tend to hole up on All Hallows Eve and refuse to come out until the last trick-or-treater has been dragged home kicking and screaming. You\u2019d stay home, too, if you were confronted with a holiday that parades around the worst cultural stereotypes pertaining to your particular species\u2014bluish pallor, black capes, stupid accents exaggerated by clownish fangs\u2014and presents it as \u201call in good fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that ... is the chamber really supposed to hold fund-raisers?\u201d I asked. \u201cI thought the Chamber of Commerce was about community building and economic development, bringing in new employers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is the way we run the Chamber of Commerce,\u201d Head Courtney said through gritted teeth. \u201cThe Half-Moon Hollow Animal Shelter is a cause we\u2019ve supported for years. Why, just last year, we collected five thousand dollars in cash donations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople will just give you cash for the shelter? Without a carnival?\u201d</p><p>Head Courtney\u2019s disapproving sneer was now an all-out death glare.</p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry,\u201d I mumbled, staring down into my lap as a sign of submission.</p><p>For the rest of the meeting, I sat still and silent, just praying to get out alive. And I was incredibly angry with myself. Why the hell was I afraid of these women? If I wanted to, I could beat them all senseless, take their fancy foufou designer wallets, and make them forget I ever did it.</p><p>Not that I would ever do that.</p><p>4</p><p>The best way to show that you\u2019re independent is actually to be independent. Develop outside interests, attend cultural events, anything to show your wayward vampire mate that you\u2019re not sitting at home pining away.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>I slunk up my front-porch steps, exhausted and in serious need of sedatives and/or lobotomy instruments. Andrea, on the other hand, looked cool and collected, stretched out on my porch swing, scratching my dog behind the ears, and sipping a tall icy beverage that I promptly stole from her.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she cried. \u201cI used your best liquor to make that! And there wasn\u2019t much to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency,\u201d I told her between swigs of what I think was a daiquiri. Because of my sordid history with the demon alcohol and the inevitably humiliating results, I don\u2019t usually imbibe. But tonight I was making an exception. I slumped onto the swing with Andrea and sighed. \u201cNot that you\u2019re not welcome here at River Oaks, but has it occurred to you that making yourself frosty cocktails while I\u2019m not home is breaking and entering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it did. But I was thirsty, and you left me your key ring to close up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m way too trusting. Am I going to come home one night and find you taking a bath in my tub and wearing my clothes?\u201d She arched her eyebrow, looking from her own stylishly cut silk blouse and slacks to my suit\u2014which had been purchased by my mother. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to go all single white female on you. But I do love this place. I still have a hard time believing you own a home with a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for all of this, my sister is willing to sue me, steal from me, and have me audited. So, you might want to reconsider your whole romantic image of gentility.\u201d</p><p>Andrea sighed heavily. \u201cWhy must you destroy my illusions? How was your networking?\u201d she asked as I tried to beckon my dog. Fitz sniffed and rested his head on his paws.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to say anything about sisterhood or women in power, but what a bunch of bitches.\u201d</p><p>Andrea laughed and pulled a pitcher of daiquiris from behind the porch swing. She poured herself another drink, grinning as she said, \u201cI thought you might feel that way. My boss at the gift shop used to complain about the meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d I cried, chucking a cushion at her. \u201cYou knew, and you let me walk into that den of iniquity unprepared?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, hey! If you can\u2019t respect the daiquiri, at least respect the shirt,\u201d she griped, swiping at the liquor I\u2019d made her spill on her celery-colored blouse. \u201cI know better than to ask you to respect me.\u201d</p><p>I blew her a kiss and poured more daiquiri as Andrea began her tale in an ominous tone. \u201cMargie said it happened slowly. One cold October night, a Courtney attended her first meeting, then another and another. It was as if the chamber was a hive being invaded by really perky Africanized bees. And pretty soon, they were proposing extra events and creating committees to run those events, and they built a power base. They elected themselves as officers, moved the headquarters, rewrote the bylaws, and made life miserable for the old-school members. One by one, the charter members all left. Margie quit after they gave her a demerit for wearing brown shoes with a black suit. To Margie, that translated to: You\u2019re over forty, get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to all the men?\u201d</p> <p>Andrea shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess they just quit, or they got too many demerits ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the Courtneys ate them,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cYour guess is there\u2019s some supernatural reason for the pink chamber seal?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cMy guess: coven of succubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should fit in well, being a vampire and all.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cYou did tell them that you\u2019re a vampire, right?\u201d</p> <p>I sipped my drink to avoid answering.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t going to live in the coffin anymore!\u201d Andrea cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not living in the coffin. I\u2019m just not volunteering any information that wouldn\u2019t come up in an introductory conversation. Do you walk up to people and say, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Andrea. I\u2019m a natural redhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a natural redhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t deflect the question. So, I guess you\u2019re not going back, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of the prizes for the charity carnival.\u201d</p><p>Andrea hooted. \u201cThey\u2019ve pulled you in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey made you their prize bitch! And not in the dog-show way. You might as well have given them all your milk money and then done their homework for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, they\u2019re scary. And blond. We\u2019ve established that I don\u2019t do well with scary blond people. And you\u2019re starting to talk like me the more time we spend together. I think we can both agree that having one person in the world who talks like me is too many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, maybe you could see this as an opportunity to grow as a person, to face your fears, to be a little less wracked by insecurity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not wracked by fear and insecurity. I have completely normal fears: failure, clowns, spiders. What\u2019s weird about that?\u201d I groaned. \u201cOh, who am I kidding? It\u2019s all gone pear-shaped.\u201d</p><p>Andrea patted my head. \u201cNo more Kitchen Nightmares for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Gordon Ramsay. I can\u2019t help myself. All the yelling and the cursing ... it\u2019s so forceful. And he takes off his shirt at least once every episode to change into his chef\u2019s uniform.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cFreak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to stick it out. I have to. Joining the chamber is good for the shop ... it\u2019s going to be good for the shop. Please, God, let it be good for the shop. And at least we know that they\u2019ll let you quit if it\u2019s not the place for you ... or you exceed the maximum weight allowances.\u201d</p><p>Andrea snickered. \u201cYou know, maybe you\u2019d be a little more confident if you jazzed up your wardrobe a bit.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re just looking for an excuse to take me on another humiliating shopping excursion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it up, and I\u2019ll put you in a stylish poncho,\u201d she said, giving me a mock evil glare.</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cVampires should not wear ponchos.\u201d I made kissing noises and beckoned my dog. \u201cCome here, Fitz.\u201d</p><p>Fitz yawned and scooched even further under the porch swing, nuzzling his head into Andrea\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cTraitor,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, you got a shipment at the shop. I put it on your hall table,\u201d she said, rising and dislodging Fitz\u2019s head from her knee.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just leave it at the shop?\u201d I asked, following her through the front door, pitcher in hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought maybe you\u2019d want these for yourself,\u201d she said, smirking, handing me the opened box. About a dozen books with blazing neon titles winked out at me.</p><p>\u201c Forbidden Thirst. Blood Lust. Penetrating Fangs. The Misadventures of Millie ,\u201d I read, thumbing through the slick paperbacks. This went way beyond the cover of your average bodice-ripper. Let\u2019s just say more was being inserted than fangs. \u201cI didn\u2019t order this! This is ... porn! Vampire porn, but porn all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the publishers prefer the term \u2018erotica.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I shot Andrea my best withering glare. She shrugged, all wide, innocent eyes betrayed by her madly twitching lips. \u201cWell, you said you were going to be lacking in sexual companionship. I thought maybe you decided to expand your horizons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour perception of me is disturbing.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cIs there a packing slip?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Hope you enjoy these samples. Let me know about ordering. Talk soon, Paul,\u2019\u201d Andrea read aloud before showing me the innocent slip of white paper. \u201cWho\u2019s Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul Dupree, one of my suppliers in Atlanta. He specializes in vampire publishing. Normally, he sends me diet guides and self-help books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, that could be considered a form of self-help.\u201d Andrea wriggled her eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>\u201cEw. I\u2019m leather-bound editions, not this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he just got stuck on leather-bound,\u201d she said, cocking her head to get a better look at Millie, who seemed more than thrilled to be tied up, hanging upside down, and leered at by a vampire with implausible pecs.</p><p>\u201cDid Dick give you a list of dirty quips? You\u2019re enjoying this way too much.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some of the titles in your personal library. I don\u2019t think I would be too judgmental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to enter into a censorship debate with you. I have other things on my mind right now\u2014 Stop laughing!\u201d I cried when she collapsed onto a chair. \u201cAll I can say is thank goodness Gabriel\u2019s not here to see this. He\u2019d probably go after Paul and rip his arms off for sending me this sort of thing, professional relationship or no ... or he\u2019d just say, \u2018This porn stash is probably for the best\u2019 and gift me with a lifetime supply of batteries.\u201d</p><p>Andrea doubled over, laughing. I was glad someone could enjoy my pain. The truth was, I didn\u2019t need any form of artificial stimulation. My body refused to believe that Gabriel and I were no longer together, unwilling to give up the orgasms he gave me, even if they had to be manufactured in my dreams. Every night, I had vivid, full-color dreams of Gabriel, his body, his lips, that thing he used to do with his index finger. My cruel subconscious dredged up memories of real encounters or provided elaborate scenarios, like the dream where Gabriel was a police officer and I had to use all my wiles\u2014and a lap dance\u2014to persuade him not to give me a speeding ticket. Or there were the dreams where he just stalked into the house, threw me down on the kitchen table without a word, and took me. Each night, I woke up in the middle of a screaming, head-spinning orgasm and was brought crashing down when I realized that I was alone. I was caught between being afraid to go to sleep and wanting to go to bed hours too early.</p><p>Finally recovered and rubbing at the stitch in her side, Andrea wiped her eyes. She sighed. \u201cStill haven\u2019t heard from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She followed me into the kitchen, where I dropped the empty pitcher into the sink and pulled a Faux Type O out of the fridge. \u201cAnd I\u2019m caught in that hellish \u2018I want to call him, but I would rather he call me, because that proves he wants to talk to me\u2019 limbo. When did my life become a tragic episode of Felicity ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that I feel like I\u2019m waiting for that very special boy to call, only that very special boy isn\u2019t breathing. And he told me it was probably for the best that we part ways more than three thousand miles from home, and he hasn\u2019t deemed it necessary to contact me in two weeks. Not even to make sure my plane didn\u2019t crash into the Atlantic. At this point, I\u2019m not entirely sure he\u2019s not going to stay in Europe until he hears that I\u2019ve moved away or become a nun or something.\u201d</p><p>She patted my head fondly. \u201cWell, next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then. It is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.\u201d</p><p>My face softened into a smile. \u201cYou read Pride and Prejudice .\u201d</p><p>Andrea rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, I figured if I\u2019m going to survive working at the shop, I would have to. And you only hinted that a person of any intelligence was required to read at least one Jane Austen book, like a thousand times.\u201d</p><p>I tapped a finger to my chin. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound anything like me ...\u201d</p><p>It was two days from the reopening. The cash-register drawer was stuck. We were missing a rather large shipment of what I considered our cornerstone product, The Guide for the Newly Undead. And I was beginning to suspect that Andrea was slipping extra espresso into her magical mystery coffee potions because \u201ccaffeinated Jane\u201d amused her.</p><p>The only thing we had going for us was a local dairy that was willing to deliver to an account as small as ours and to a location as bad as ours at night. In fact, it was a delight to come downstairs from Mr. Wainwright\u2019s old apartment to find a tall man in an indecently tight blue Half-Moon Dairy uniform stocking our little coffee-bar fridge with half-and-half and heavy cream.</p><p>\u201cWow, is that our dairy guy?\u201d I whispered. Andrea didn\u2019t bother removing her eyes from the sight of Dairy Guy\u2019s delicious blue-clad bottom swaying as he loaded the fridge.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Andrea answered absently.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be coming here regularly, right?\u201d</p><p>We simultaneously tilted our heads as Dairy Guy\u2019s hips changed angles. Andrea sighed, \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should arrange for Dick to be elsewhere on delivery nights,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBecause you\u2019re drooling. And I don\u2019t blame you because milk does a body goooo\u2014 Oh, my God.\u201d My jaw dropped as Dairy Guy turned, and I recognized him as little Jamie Lanier, whom I used to babysit every summer.</p><p>Jamie loomed four inches over my tall frame. His warm green eyes twinkled at me from under a faded blue ball cap he\u2019d slapped over his wavy dark blond hair. (Curse my weakness for all-American boys!) Every inch of him was toned and tan, and he smelled like Irish Spring soap. I bit back a sigh.</p><p>This was the danger of living in the small town where you grew up. Local hotties have to start off somewhere, and generally, it\u2019s as the annoying towheaded Little Leaguer who would only eat smiley-face pancakes from ages five to seven.</p><p>\u201cMiss Jane! Hi!\u201d He flashed those devastating dimples. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie. How\u2019s your mom?\u201d I asked, flinching at his use of \u201cMiss,\u201d a sure sign that he thought of me as a senior citizen. \u201cStill teaching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But she says she\u2019s going to retire now that I\u2019m graduating and she and dad are going to have the house to themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re graduating from college?\u201d I said, an insane note of desperation in my voice as I tried to do the age math in my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m still a senior at Half-Moon Hollow High. I\u2019m just working at night to save for tuition.\u201d</p><p>Forgive me, Lord, I\u2019m the biggest pervert in the world.</p><p>\u201cSay hi to your mom for me,\u201d I said as he packed up his hand truck and headed out the door. He waved at us from the delivery van as he pulled away. I stared at the ceiling, then told Andrea, \u201cYou may laugh now.\u201d</p> <p>She guffawed, collapsing against the bar as she held her side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just, the look on your face when he said he was graduating from high school !\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my hands over my face. \u201cMy eyes, they burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I get to relive this humiliation with every delivery,\u201d Andrea said, rubbing her hands together in anticipatory glee. \u201cThis is already my favorite job ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you forget sometimes, I am fully capable of hurting you\u2014\u201d We turned to the front door as a woman in a smart peach raincoat came into the shop, clutching her purse close to her side with one arm and carrying an enormous beribboned basket with the other. Courtney Barrows, Nice Courtney, eyed her surroundings suspiciously, apparently afraid to touch anything. \u201cCourtney?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d She sighed, relieved to see me.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it isn\u2019t even my birthday!\u201d Andrea was clearly thrilled that one of the chamber members had showed up for my brainwashing initiation so soon. She whispered, \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cCourtney Barrows, this is my associate, Andrea Byrne. Andrea, Courtney Barrows. Courtney owns the Unique Boutique, the sterling-silver shop over on Dogwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d they chorused. I half expected Courtney to curtsy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not happy to see you again, but what are you doing here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Courtney let out a breathy laugh. \u201cI know! I don\u2019t normally come into this part of town, especially at night. But your store hours are just so odd, I wanted to make sure I caught you,\u201d she said, hauling the giant gift basket onto the counter. \u201cThe chamber sent you this, and I volunteered to bring it by. It\u2019s a welcome muffin basket. There\u2019s an orientation folder, a directory, the memory book, and a suggested list of places where you should go begging for game prizes.\u201d</p><p>Well, that capped it. If I\u2019d learned anything from Missy the psycho real-estate agent, it was never to trust people bearing gift baskets.</p> <p>\u201cMemory book?\u201d Andrea asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little scrapbook for our special events, fund-raisers, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a yearbook!\u201d Andrea exclaimed cheerily, then scowled when I pushed the basket at her with more force than was probably necessary. She stifled a giggle and took it to my office. \u201cI\u2019m taking these muffins, by the way! They\u2019re of no use to you!\u201d</p><p>Courtney shot me a questioning look. I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m on a no-carb, no-sugar, no-gluten diet. But Andrea will love them. It was really nice of you to bring it by. You didn\u2019t have to come all the way down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just liked talking to you so much at the meeting, I thought I\u2019d come by for a visit. I just\u2014 I joined the chamber to make some friends. And the ladies at the chamber ... I didn\u2019t know what I was getting into when I joined. They\u2019re sort of ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cAnd blond?\u201d Andrea shouted from the back of the shop.</p><p>I shot Courtney an apologetic smile, but she didn\u2019t seem offended in the least that I\u2019d been talking about the chamber members behind their backs. \u201cYes. But you were so nice. You know, you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve met at one of those meetings that hasn\u2019t made fun of the fact that my husband runs a construction company. As if my money is dirty or something, just because my husband\u2019s not a doctor or a lawyer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was raised by a teacher and a meddlesome homemaker. I mock no one,\u201d I told her, then amended, \u201cunless they deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lived in the Hollow your whole life. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to try to meet people here when you don\u2019t know anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve been hanging around the wrong Half-Moon Hollow residents. See, I would imagine your husband probably outearns ninety-five percent of the people in this town. Frankly, I admire anyone who can operate heavy machinery without hurting innocent bystanders.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cSee? I told you! You\u2019re a hoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you did. Pull up a seat.\u201d</p><p>Courtney gave an exaggerated look around, her face open and pleasant as she climbed up onto the bar stool. \u201cYour shop is, um, really interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Coffee?\u201d I asked. I pushed a bunch of buttons and hoped a cappuccino would come out. Andrea came running at the rumble of the cappuccino machine, like a mama bear protecting her young. She shooed me away and finished making Courtney\u2019s drink herself.</p><p>Courtney seemed almost shy as she handed me a little pink-wrapped box. \u201cAnd I had a little gift made up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I said, opening the box. Inside was a little keychain attached to a silver disc inscribed with my initials. \u201cThat was really nice.\u201d</p><p>Vampires are allergic to silver. Touching it feels like a combination of burning and being forced to watch Glitter over and over again. Your eyes burn, there\u2019s an unpleasant squelching sound, and you\u2019re left with dirty gray streaks that are very hard to wash off. I knew what I was in for when I politely held the little circle in my palm.</p><p>Andrea\u2019s eyes widened as my hand began to sizzle like bacon. I mouthed, \u201cI know!\u201d Andrea started asking Courtney incredibly complicated questions about how she wanted her coffee. As soon as Courtney\u2019s back was turned, I put the keychain on the counter and silently yowled, shaking my hand back and forth as the dirty gray stain faded from my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou OK, Jane?\u201d Courtney asked, smiling sweetly.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I chuckled. Andrea rolled her eyes in my direction. \u201cI\u2019m just fine. I just have some allergies, a little eczema acting up ... Wait, no, this is stupid. Courtney, you should probably know that I\u2019m a vampire, have been for about a year now. If that\u2019s going to get me banned from the Half-Moon Hollow Chamber of Commerce, so be it. I just don\u2019t have the time or energy to try to fool you into thinking I\u2019m normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I knew that,\u201d Courtney said, patting my arm and turning over my burned hand to examine my palm. \u201cThe keychain was just a test to make sure. But it was obvious the other night what you are. You didn\u2019t touch any of the food. Your teeth are a little sharper than they should be. You\u2019re so pale and, well, sort of glowy. Your skin drove Head Courtney crazy, by the way. She kept trying to figure out what you use on it. I didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>My forehead wrinkled. \u201cSo, what do you plan on doing with this information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, smiling pleasantly and sipping her coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d I told Andrea, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, you\u2019re so much nicer than any of those so-called normal girls,\u201d she said, patting my hand. \u201cI figure, if you\u2019re up front with me, you can\u2019t be all bad. And personally, I want to see how long it takes the other girls to figure it out and how many different ways they manage to put their collective foot in their mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bit of a dark streak in you,\u201d Andrea told her. \u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s going to love you. On second thought, maybe I should keep you two separate.\u201d</p><p>Courtney giggled. \u201cBesides, I experimented a little with vampires in college. Every girl does.\u201d</p><p>I arched my brows at her. \u201cYou know I\u2019m a completely straight vampire, right?\u201d</p><p>Courtney threw her head back and laughed. She turned to Andrea. \u201cDon\u2019t you just love hanging out with her? You never know what she\u2019s going to say!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day\u2019s an adventure,\u201d Andrea said dryly.</p><p>5</p><p>Remember to fight fair. No name-calling, no use of words like always and never , no bringing up old issues to avoid the topic at hand\u2014and no dismembering.</p><p>\u2014 Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>\u201cAre you sure the whole pewter-figurine thing isn\u2019t too kitschy?\u201d</p><p>I repositioned the graceful fairy statues near our selection of amethyst geodes, which I\u2019d moved because I wanted to make room for a display of The Guide for the Newly Undead next to the register. Now I was moving them around like my own personal nude pixie army. I bit my lip and bounced up and down on my heels as I considered their current formation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too kitschy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you rearrange the fanciful bric-a-brac one more time, I\u2019m going to stake you,\u201d Andrea promised. \u201cI thought we agreed that you would get a full day\u2019s sleep before the opening.\u201d</p><p>To say I was a nervous wreck on reopening day was a massive understatement. I must have changed my outfit ten times, which is almost painful for someone who doesn\u2019t care that much about clothes. First, I put on an embroidered blue top and some jeans and decided it looked too casual. So, I changed into a red T-shirt and an Indian skirt\u2014too hippie-dippy. The khaki slacks and polo shirt made me look as if I worked at Best Buy. Finally, I embraced the clich\u00e9: black slacks, black beaded top, tear-shaped carnelian earrings that looked like little drops of blood, and the black boots Andrea had practically forced me to buy at gunpoint. And then I got to the shop and immediately wanted to run home and change when I saw Andrea\u2019s crisp white blouse and beautifully cut gray slacks.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright had come by and given his wholehearted support, then promptly disappeared, saying that he didn\u2019t want to make me nervous on my first day. He promised to bring Aunt Jettie back at the close of business to celebrate my \u201centrepreneurial triumph.\u201d</p><p>It was oddly lonely to have the shop open without my former employer\u2019s spectral presence. But Dick and Andrea were there for me, running last-minute errands, cleaning up last-minute messes, holding a paper bag to my face when I did some last-minute hyperventilating\u2014the irony of the latter compounded by the fact that I didn\u2019t technically breathe.</p><p>\u201cI tried to sleep, and then, despite my very specific and effective internal clock, I was lying there at noon today with a racing brain. I kept thinking I really jumped into this without thinking it through,\u201d I said, putting the Spring Blooms fairy behind the Autumn Mystery fairy and then switching them back again. \u201cI mean, I figured, I\u2019ve already got a location, stock, and more capital than I needed. What else would I need for a successful business? What if I picked the wrong types of books? What if there were no bookstores specifically catering to vampires because most vampires are out living their unlives instead of reading? What if the coffee bar was a stupid idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was certainly a stupid idea to give you what amounted to three double espressos last night.\u201d Andrea sighed, arranging pastries from Half-Moon Hollow Sweets onto a fancy doily.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d I hissed at her. \u201cI knew you were slipping me extra caffeine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it would be much funnier than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry my wacky antics\u2014which you caused\u2014no longer amuse you,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>\u201cCall it a misguided experiment,\u201d she muttered, tossing the pink bakery box aside and wiping down the counter. An array of muffins, cookies, and lemon bars winked out at me from the glass case, mocking my inability to digest solids.</p><p>It may have seemed like a bad idea to give people sticky pastries and staining liquids, then invite them to peruse our books. But I wanted the shop to be the sort of place where you could sit for hours at a time and feel welcome\u2014and therefore guilty enough to buy several expensive books. As an added precaution, we\u2019d put the rarer volumes in a glassed-in special collections case, to which I carried the only key. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe open in ten minutes, and nobody\u2019s here yet,\u201d I said, switching the fairies back to their original position. Andrea reached over and smacked my hand.</p><p>\u201cOw! No hitting!\u201d</p><p>I shot a significant look at her boyfriend, who was conscientiously stacking midnight-blue shopping bags embossed with the new Specialty Books logo near the register. I considered it a supreme gesture of trust to allow Dick to stand that close to an unlocked cash drawer. At my indignant glare, he shrugged and slung an arm around his glaring girlfriend. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you fight. My money\u2019s on her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not paying you, right?\u201d</p><p>Dick shook his head.</p><p>I muttered, \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I your first customer?\u201d I looked up to see my father standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d I cried, throwing my arms around him and nearly bowling him over. \u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p> <p>If there was anyone who could help with my \u201cImprove relationships with family\u201d goal, it was my father. I am an unabashed Daddy\u2019s girl. Not like Carol Anne Mussler, whose home life took on a decidedly creepy aspect after she dedicated \u201cEvery Breath You Take\u201d to her father at the high school\u2019s annual talent show. But what more could I do than pledge my undying favoritism for the man who gave me my lifelong love of reading? The man who defended me from Mama and Grandma Ruthie\u2019s repeated attempts to make me into a Jenny clone? The father who loved me unconditionally, despite my growing catalogue of flaws? If Daddy hadn\u2019t decided to give me the unfortunate middle name of Enid, he would have been a parent without fault.</p><p>Daddy stroked my hair back from my eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Pumpkin, afraid no one will show up?\u201d</p><p>I mulled that over for a millisecond. \u201cUm, yes. That would be it.\u201d</p><p>Daddy opened his wallet and handed me his Mastercard. \u201cWell, point me to the coffee bar, and start a tab for me. And then bring me one of those books on how to be a better parent to an adult vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you gave me a valid credit card, you\u2019ve got my vote for Father of the Year.\u201d</p><p>Dad took a long look at the ritual candle selection. \u201cDoes that mean you can give me a good deal on a magic wand and an owl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would respond, but we just established a storewide no-hitting policy,\u201d I said, poking him in the ribs.</p><p>He tucked a hand under my chin. \u201cIt looks great, honey. Everything. I can tell how much work you girls put into it. I\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Daddy. Is Mama coming?\u201d</p><p>Daddy cleared his throat. \u201cMama sends her support in spirit. But Jenny had some meeting tonight, and she needed Mama to babysit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Convenient.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>Behind us, the bell tinkled, and the door opened. A goth teen with a pasty face, pierced nose, and lime-green-over-dirty-blond ringlets slumped into the store. She was a vampire, but she was so young. And she was obstinately avoiding eye contact. I took the direct approach, saying in my most pleasant tone, \u201cHi, welcome to Specialty Books. Can I help you find anything?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and stared at me. I think she was willing me to disappear. OK, then.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for something in particular or just browsing?\u201d I asked, dialing down the cheerful factor a few points.</p> <p>The green-haired teen queen was now staring through me.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s pretending to be invisible,\u201d Andrea whispered from behind the counter.</p><p>I did not want to alienate my first non-blood-related customer, so I stepped out of her way. As she passed, I reached out to her, gently prying at the edges of her mind. Generally, I can\u2019t read vampires, but she seemed so new, I guess would be the word, that I wanted to see if I could get a few impressions.</p><p>Instead, I was flooded with the chaos of adolescent thought bubbles. She was lonely and was afraid of what would happen if her mom found out she\u2019d driven the family car into the worst part of town. She wished I would just leave her the hell alone so she could look for the latest Buffy Season 8 comic and read it in peace in one of those cool purple chairs. She wished she\u2019d brought enough cash for the comic and a mocha latte, because the coffee smelled pretty good, and she loved, looooved chocolate and missed it like crazy. She even missed her mom telling her that chocolate gave her zits. Her mom didn\u2019t talk to her much at all these days. Her whole stupid family seemed afraid of her, but they were even more afraid of kicking her out of the house. It was just great to be allowed to stay in your own room because your dad\u2019s afraid to talk to you. She didn\u2019t know why I was hassling her; it wasn\u2019t as if she was going to steal or anything. Old people always followed her around in stores because of her hair. She wished she\u2019d never dyed it green, but then her mom made such a big deal out of it that she felt she had to keep dyeing it over and over just to try to get a little attention\u2014</p><p>I had to fight to pull myself out of the swirling vortex of her thoughts. I shook my head, trying to throw off the feelings of gloom and isolation.</p><p>God, I was glad I wasn\u2019t a teenager anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find the Buffy comics over in our graphic-novels section, near the back,\u201d I murmured quietly. She turned, eyeing me warily. \u201cAndrea, could you get our first official customer a tall mocha latte with the \u2018special\u2019 syrup? On the house, of course.\u201d</p><p>The Buffy lover, whom I\u2019d decided I was going to like, even if it killed me, had eyes the size of saucers when I winked at her. \u201cTh-thanks,\u201d she stuttered, in a voice that was higher, shakier, than the voice in her head. \u201cI\u2019m Cindy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, eyeing the nose piercing. \u201cI did not expect that. Cindy, I\u2019m Jane. That\u2019s Andrea. Let us know if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d She turned on her heavily booted heels and headed for the graphic novels.</p><p>\u201cAnd for the record, I\u2019m not that old,\u201d I called after her.</p><p>A remarkably more cordial Cindy parked in a chair with her comic and sipped her coffee. She proved to be quite the good-luck charm, as her arrival brought a stream of steady peals of the front entrance bell. Several vampires, whom I\u2019d never seen before, came in and sipped warmed blood and discussed forming an undead book club. Zeb and Jolene stopped by for pastries (for Jolene) and a book titled The Drama of the Half-Were Child (for Zeb.) They cozied up at the bar near my dad and chatted about the impending Lavelle. They still hadn\u2019t told Zeb\u2019s mother about the pregnancy. After Mama Ginger broke into the trailer, rearranged all the furniture, \u201corganized\u201d their mail and bills, and cleared most of the food out of Jolene\u2019s fridge, Jolene had adjusted the disclosure date to when the baby left for college. She\u2019d also added those biometric fingerprint locks to her plans for the new house. Seriously, you don\u2019t mess with a werewolf\u2019s food supply, even under the guise of being \u201chelpful.\u201d</p><p>Several members of the Friends and Family of the Undead, a group dedicated to helping the loved ones of newly turned vampires, perused new releases in the self-help section and were thrilled when I offered to host the meetings at the shop on Thursday nights. A few of my currently human former library patrons braved the bad part of town and bought up Anita Blake titles they probably wouldn\u2019t have purchased in a \u201cmainstream\u201d bookstore. They also floated the concept of forming a book club focusing on supernatural works, starting with Alice Sebold\u2019s The Lovely Bones .</p><p>I missed the children and children\u2019s books. I missed old tattered copies of Harold and the Purple Crayon and tracking down the copy of Behind the Attic Wall that had been lost and nearly kept by careless girls (including myself) a total of fourteen times. But this new enterprise was certainly rewarding. We actually sold books. To live customers. Which hadn\u2019t happened at Specialty Books in a while. Of course, by live, I mean present at the time of sale. I couldn\u2019t guarantee heart or lung function.</p><p>I was helping books find their way to people again. I would have teared up a little if I\u2019d had time. These misty thoughts were interrupted by the appearance of a petite brunette with a heart-shaped face and high, sharp cheekbones. She had on a thickly ruffled blouse paired with a long black skirt. A delicate cameo pin secured the neck. She was a vampire, and she stared at me for a while before finally approaching the counter.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I believe I\u2019ll just browse about for a while. I think you might have exactly what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d She smiled, the tips of her fangs peeking out over her thin, whitened lips.</p><p>\u201cO ... K.\u201d</p><p>Directing two men who I suspected could be ghouls to the financial-planning section kept me distracted from this odd customer. There was something not quite right about this woman, and it wasn\u2019t just her taste in old clothes. Her eyes were feverish and bright, and I couldn\u2019t seem to look into them for too long. Her skin was pale even by our standards. She smelled wrong, like liniment and camphor, the combination of which was almost overpowering when she approached the register carrying copies of Love Bites, How to Survive Sire Abandonment, 30 Days to a Healthier Undead You, I\u2019m OK, You\u2019re Undead, and, oddly enough, A Walk to Remember .</p><p>\u201cYou have a wonderful selection,\u201d she said, her dark eyes boring through me.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Did you find what you were looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite. But this will do for now.\u201d Her voice was flat as she handed me cash, which was quickly becoming my favorite medium of payment.</p><p>\u201cWell, please come back. And let me know if I can help you find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can,\u201d she said, smiling at me with an intensity that, frankly, was starting to weird me out a little.</p><p>She faded into the crowd (crowd!) of customers and out the door. An hour before closing, my feet were so sore I didn\u2019t even think of asking Andrea whether she\u2019d noticed Creepy Cameo Chick. Instead, we totaled out the drawer, rejoiced over every large bill, and promised each other that Cindy the Goth Good-Luck Charm would be welcome to free lattes whenever she wanted them.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright and Jettie reappeared and admitted to a tiny fib. Mr. Wainwright couldn\u2019t stand the idea of missing my big night and had spent most of it watching the sales floor in invisible ghost mode. Mr. Wainwright waxed poetic over every sale and declared that the shop had probably made more in-store customers that night than in the previous year. He declared Andrea and me to be marketing geniuses. Aunt Jettie just smiled and claimed to have \u201cknown it all along.\u201d Dick popped a bottle of champagne so expensive I dared not ask where he got it, and we sat at the coffee bar toasting a good night.</p><p>All in all, Gabriel certainly picked the right moment to walk back into my life.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d he said, tentatively walking toward me, holding a bouquet of fat, vibrant yellow sunflowers tied with raffia and ribbon.</p><p>I was surprised at how much trouble I had looking him in the eye as he crossed the room, and at how gratifying it was that he looked like ten miles of bad back-country road. Gabriel was paper pale, the hollows of his cheeks dramatic and drawn. And if I wasn\u2019t mistaken, there was a little nervous twitch to his upper lip. If he felt half as bad as he looked, well, the vindictive part of me thought that was a pretty good start. And I was touched that he knew I would know that sunflowers meant \u201cadoration\u201d and \u201cwarmth.\u201d But even after weeks of missing his voice, his face, I found that more than anything, I just wanted him gone. I didn\u2019t want to have this conversation now. I wanted to bask in my success for just a little while longer. I should have known better. If my history has taught me anything, it\u2019s that once I start enjoying a little good fortune, the karmic balance shifts to kick me in the face and restore the status quo.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he breathed, as if he had spent an entire evening planning that single syllable.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I conceded after considerable thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Really? We were starting off with awkward pleasantries? Because I was in an \u201capologize or be destroyed\u201d sort of mood. Hmm. How have I been? Sharpening a lot of stakes. Watching Kill Bill over and over again ...</p><p>Gabriel pressed the flowers into my hands as I asked, \u201cWhat are you doing back?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s your big night. I wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you did miss it. You\u2019ve missed a lot of nights recently. So many nights, in fact, that I started to think maybe you weren\u2019t coming back. Thanks for putting me in that position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, that\u2019s not fair,\u201d he said quietly as Jettie and Mr. Wainwright disappeared. Dick and Andrea had a sudden and overwhelming desire to reshelve misplaced stock.</p><p>I sat down and laid the flowers aside. \u201cLook, Gabriel, I\u2019m tired, and I don\u2019t have the patience for empty banter. I\u2019ve had a very long night. A great night, in fact. And you weren\u2019t here for it. I did all of this without you. The funny thing is, I didn\u2019t need you. I didn\u2019t need you to protect me or take care of me or shield my delicate self in your big strong manly arms. I\u2019m getting to the point where I kind of like not needing you. In fact, I\u2019ve decided to start a no-strings-attached, purely carnal relationship with Dick to meet some of my needs, so you don\u2019t even have to show up for that.\u201d</p><p>Dick\u2019s smirking face rose over the diet and health-maintenance shelves. \u201cWell, Stretch, if you\u2019re offerin\u2019\u2014ow!\u201d he cried as Andrea\u2019s hand snaked up from behind and slapped the back of his head.</p><p>Gabriel pushed through an obvious distaste for the mental picture the words \u201cpurely carnal\u201d invoked and said, \u201cJane, let me explain. I haven\u2019t called because I\u2019ve been stuck in meetings every night for the last few weeks. First, a manufacturing plant I\u2019d hoped to purchase in Leeds had labor problems. And then a real-estate deal fell through in Italy. I had to soothe some very insulted Czech tempers when my interpreter called one of them a \u2018horse\u2019s ass\u2019 when I was trying sell them a film-processing plant\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me.\u201d At this point, I was thankful for the gut-burning anger that was preventing tears from welling up.</p><p>Gabriel started. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying, right now. To my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are, because when you lie, you get this little wrinkly line between your eyebrows.\u201d I tapped him on the forehead. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed, but it happened every time you got one of those fancy linen envelopes and tried to explain it away as business correspondence. It\u2019s like a little exclamation point in the middle of your forehead that screams, \u2018I\u2019m lying!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d he cried.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got one right now!\u201d I yelled, pointing to his head, over which he slapped a protective hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve explained to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve explained nothing to me. Nothing. And this is not an issue that will go away if we ignore it hard enough. Weirdly timed \u2018business\u2019 calls I\u2019m not allowed to overhear. Secret notes at every hotel that you destroy immediately after reading. Notes that talk about what you and some other woman \u2018are\u2019 to each other. How I can\u2019t satisfy you the way she \u2018does\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read the notes?\u201d he demanded, his voice reaching that \u201cboyfriend in trouble\u201d pitch that only dogs can hear.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to, but damn it, Gabriel, what else what I supposed to do? Just keep pretending that nothing was going on? Pardon me if the only logical conclusion I can come up with is that you\u2019re cheating on me. If there are other less crazy options, please tell me. I would love to hear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would think, after all we\u2019ve been through, that I would want to be with someone else!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is something that someone who is cheating would say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he yelled. \u201cJust stop it, Jane. I\u2019ve told you, there are things going on right now that I can\u2019t tell you about. It\u2019s for your own good. I asked you to trust me, and you can\u2019t stand to be happy, can you? You\u2019re just waiting for the other shoe to drop, and when there are no problems, you invent them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s ... painfully accurate. But let\u2019s explore why I might look for problems, shall we? Since I\u2019ve met you, I\u2019ve died. An insane blond Realtor tried to frame me for murder so she could turn my family home into a tacky condo development. My sister is suing me because she\u2019s decided that I don\u2019t deserve any part of my family\u2019s history. My grandmother has stopped speaking to me, a vampire, but she\u2019s perfectly OK with being engaged-to-be-engaged to a ghoul. My tenth high school reunion is coming up, and I\u2019m the only Undead American in my graduating class. Oh, and my suppliers believe I\u2019m lonely enough to need porn.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows drew up at this, but I continued my tirade. \u201cAnd despite all of that, the only thing that\u2019s really knocked me on my ass is thinking that, yes, you\u2019ve been with someone else. That you\u2019ve touched someone else, told her you love her, despite all of your sire-childe, \u2018I\u2019m drawn to you because of your innocence and how good you smell, I\u2019m going to love you forever\u2019 bullshit. If there\u2019s another explanation, I would love to hear it. Because what in the world could be worse that that? What could be so bad that you don\u2019t think I could handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just trust me,\u201d he said, clutching my face between his palms like a life preserver. \u201cTrust that everything I do is to protect you. Trust that seeing you being threatened tears at me in a way that I can\u2019t explain. Just trust me, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThreatened in what way? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d I pried Gabriel\u2019s hands away. \u201cAnd why should I trust you? You\u2019re jealous and secretive, and you have a tendency to kill people, somehow deluding yourself that it\u2019s for my own good. I don\u2019t want to trust you. I don\u2019t care anymore, Gabriel. I just don\u2019t care what you have to say. I wish you and her\u2014at least, I hope it\u2019s a her\u2014my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! I\u2019ve given you a dozen chances to explain.\u201d The more I spoke, the angrier I got, until I was shouting loudly enough to rattle the windows. \u201cAll you do is make excuses and tell me half of the truth. This is a textbook bad relationship. And you know what? I\u2019m glad I am discovering this now, before I spent one hundred years of my life thinking that I was lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope all your books keep you warm at night!\u201d he yelled, stomping toward the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re room temperature at best, buddy. You never kept me that warm to begin with!\u201d I shouted back, tossing a particularly weighty Tolkien volume at his retreating back.</p><p>Well, there went my \u201chealthy, normal relationship\u201d goal.</p><p>\u201cOw! What is wrong with you?\u201d he roared, stalking back to me.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cSo, hit me, but don\u2019t bother with the books,\u201d he demanded, grabbing my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to touch me!\u201d I slapped his hands away.</p><p>Dick emerged from the back room, his face thunderous as he told Gabriel, \u201cSon, you\u2019d better back off, now .\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face softened, and his hands dropped to his sides. \u201cJust let it out, so we can get through this.\u201d He was almost begging now. He leaned his forehead against mine and pulled my hands gently into his. \u201cThis is what we do. So, let\u2019s just fight and then fight some more until we get this out of our system and we can go back to normal again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, my own voice shaking as I backed away from him, toward my office. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like this anymore. And we are anything but normal. Just stay away from me, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you think so.\u201d I nodded and stepped back behind the closed office door, waiting until I heard the front doorbell tell me that he\u2019d walked out.</p><p>6</p><p>If a man is callous and fickle in life, being a vampire won\u2019t suddenly make him sensitive to your needs.</p><p>\u2014 Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>There is nothing sadder than a vampire in her bathrobe, drinking Hershey\u2019s Blood Additive Chocolate Syrup straight from the bottle and watching Fatal Attraction over and over again.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t gotten so much as a call from Gabriel since the ugly scene at the shop. Even though I probably would have hung up on him if he had called, he could have at least made the gesture of letting me hang up on him. But it appeared that Gabriel had learned his lesson from the first time I stopped talking to him. Complete radio silence. Every once in a while, I thought I could sense his presence outside the house, but it seemed like wishful thinking on my part. I walked outside, hoping to catch a glimpse of him. But there was nothing, not even a trace of his scent on the breeze.</p><p>Gabriel, it seemed, had moved on. And if he hadn\u2019t moved on, he was doing a damn fine impersonation of someone who had. So I decided to follow suit.</p><p>For the past four nights, I\u2019d served coffee, helped customers select books, and kept our new mascot, Cindy, in comics and lattes. The crowd wasn\u2019t quite as big as opening night, but it was certainly respectable. And we seemed to be developing regulars, human and vampire.</p><p>But when Sunday night, our closed night, came, I found myself in my bathrobe in the kitchen, staring down the Hershey\u2019s bottle. The phone rang, and even though I really, really hoped it was Gabriel, I was still contrary enough not to answer just in case it was Gabriel.</p><p>Instead, Mama\u2019s voice echoed from my answering machine through my impossibly empty kitchen. \u201cJane, honey, it\u2019s Mama. Daddy told me all about what happened with Gabriel. I don\u2019t know why you told Daddy about it instead of me ... but anyway, I think you just need to stop being silly and call him. It\u2019s not like there are a lot of available vampires out there. And you two are so good together. Whatever Gabriel did, I think you just need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The machine cut her off. God bless technology.</p><p>Before Mama could call back, Andrea and Jolene came barreling into the house like the cavalry, armed with DVDs; dessert blood, obviously for me; ice cream, obviously not for me; and wine, obviously not for Jolene. There was also an alarming assortment of junk food, including ready-made cheesecake filling in a tub, which I didn\u2019t even know existed. And now that I was aware of it, I was extremely disgruntled that I couldn\u2019t eat any of it. At the sight of this cornucopia of girlie comfort, I promptly burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cI love you guys.\u201d I sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not crying \u2019cause of Gabriel. I just really love you guys.\u201d</p><p>Jolene wrapped her arms around me and made soft wuffling noises as I snotted up her T-shirt. I had really good friends, girlfriends, which was something I\u2019d never had in life. Somehow they complemented each other to form some sort of perfectly balanced break-up safety net.</p><p>\u201cAw, honey, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Jolene soothed. \u201cHe\u2019s a bastard. Zeb was too busy mumblin\u2019 empty threats to make it clear what Gabriel did, but he\u2019s a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, have we already reached the \u2018calling Gabriel names\u2019 portion of the festivities?\u201d Andrea asked, returning to the kitchen with my corkscrew. \u201cI thought we\u2019d at least get her drunk and watch a movie first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were supposed to get her drunk and put her panties in the freezer,\u201d Jolene said, her pretty face scrunched in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re mixing up your female-bonding customs,\u201d I told her. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018thirteen-year-olds at a sleepover,\u2019 not \u2018vampire boyfriend may or may not have cheated on you, but either way, he\u2019s an emotionally unavailable asshat.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, how the hell am I supposed to keep up with all your weird human rituals?\u201d She grunted, prying the lid off Ben and Jerry\u2019s Mint Chocolate Cookie and digging in. \u201cIf this was a werewolf thing, we\u2019d just go pee on his front porch so no other females would come near him for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>I surveyed Andrea\u2019s outfit of artfully worn jeans and what was obviously one of Dick\u2019s T-shirts, advertising the joys of Hot Springs, Arkansas. \u201cI thought you said you were getting rid of Dick\u2019s tacky T-shirts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, this isn\u2019t tacky, this is vintage,\u201d she said, turning proudly to show off the way the shirt hugged her curves. \u201cI put a seam here and there. It\u2019s a little more tailored, so instant classic.\u201d</p><p>I peered down at my own happy-face pajama pants and a baggy T-shirt advertising the annual 4-H Hog Call. \u201cI hate you. What\u2019d you bring?\u201d I examined the stack of videos. \u201c Steel Magnolias and Beaches ? Are you trying to comfort me or get me to commit suicide?\u201d</p><p>Jolene shrugged. \u201cWhen I want an excuse to cry, I watch Steel Magnolias .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d I held up a copy of 9 to 5 .</p><p>\u201cI think Jolene got confused about the theme,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cBut still, female empowerment, dosing your boss with rat poison. It could work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m your boss,\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThat does pose a problem,\u201d Andrea agreed as my eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cZeb said we should bring over the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but Andrea thought you\u2019d get all depressed,\u201d Jolene told me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because what\u2019s the point of watching Buffy if you\u2019re not watching the second-season episodes with Spike in them?\u201d I asked, uncorking the bottle of wine. Andrea poured me a large glass. \u201cHmmm. I wonder if it would be unethical for me to turn James Marsters? And then force him to fake the Cockney accent? And then make him my love monkey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the Council would probably notice that.\u201d Andrea snorted.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m surprised some crazy, recently turned fan girl hasn\u2019t already thought of it,\u201d I muttered into my wine.</p> <p>Andrea pulled a DVD case with a blank cover out of her purse. \u201cI also brought this. It\u2019s an unrated version of the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, the Colin Firth version. Dick got it from one of his ... sources. There\u2019s a rumor that during the bath scene, you get an accidental peek at Mr. Darcy\u2019s bum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, she\u2019s crying again,\u201d Jolene groaned as I gave her neck another moist hug.</p><p>I blubbered, \u201cI\u2019m just so happy!\u201d</p><p>We indulged in buttoned-up Austenian dramedy for a few hours, consuming more calories than should be allowed by law. I painted my toes a bold eggplant, which Gabriel had always disliked. He said it made my feet look hypothermic. Thanks to her accelerated pregnancy, Jolene\u2019s brief flirtation with crippling morning sickness was over. She polished off the Mint Chocolate Cookie and the Cherry Garcia but not the Chunky Monkey, which Andrea specifically chose because Jolene hated banana. I became concerned about Andrea\u2019s wine-to-ice-cream consumption ratio and what sort of color she might turn my carpet if she got sick. But then I had a few glasses myself and just didn\u2019t care. Fitz couldn\u2019t decide whom he\u2019d rather spurn me for, Andrea or Jolene, both of whom he adored. But since he had a better chance of Andrea sharing food with him, he snuggled up with Andrea.</p><p>\u201cDo you consider yourselves Colin Firth girls or Colin Farrell girls?\u201d Jolene asked, munching on her thousandth or so mini-Snickers as Mr. Darcy informed Elizabeth that he most ardently admired and loved her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I have both?\u201d Andrea asked with a dreamy sort of leer. \u201cOne of them could run the video camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat answer, by its very nature, makes you a Colin Farrell girl.\u201d I snickered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying what you\u2019re both think\u2014\u201d Andrea let out a shriek and dropped her half-melted tub of ice cream on my floor.</p> <p>At least it wasn\u2019t vomit.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I squinted at her whitened face in the flickering light of the TV.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s somebody out there!\u201d she cried. \u201cI saw them! They were looking in the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt was all blurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d I drawled, looking pointedly at the two empty wine bottles at her feet.</p><p>\u201cJane, I\u2019m serious, there was someone standing there, watching us through the window!\u201d Andrea insisted.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t picked up on anything.\u201d</p><p>I looked to Jolene, who shrugged. \u201cI usually have to be pretty focused to sense something watching me.\u201d</p><p>Jolene and I went to the window and saw nothing reflected back at us but darkened woods.</p><p>\u201cHit pause. I\u2019ll go check it out.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s Gabriel? Or what if it\u2019s some townie lookin\u2019 to mess with a vamp?\u201d Jolene asked. \u201cAnd you\u2019re wearin\u2019 your bathrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, I get to hit something, so yay. They\u2019re probably gone by now, anyway.\u201d I shrugged. Andrea did not look convinced. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged out of my robe, reached into the hall closet, and pulled out a Louisville Slugger, which had been sharpened to a wicked point.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have that giant phallic symbol in your hall closet?\u201d Andrea asked, pointing to my bat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman living alone in the country. Vampire or not, I feel the need to take some precautions. Why do you think I keep that pair of muddy men\u2019s boots out on the porch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a tacky decoration,\u201d Andrea said, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019, too,\u201d Jolene said, rolling her shoulders in a way I knew meant she was preparing to wolf out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, pregnant lady. You just stay here and keep your belly covered. Besides, someone has to keep Lushy here company. Lock the door behind me. Call Dick if things get weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen aren\u2019t they weird?\u201d Andrea grumbled as I walked out the front door. I crept around the house, bat on shoulder, to the den window. There was a fresh smear of scent on the air, a cold, angry presence. Someone had been standing outside my window, watching as we gorged ourselves and watched silly movies. Someone had intruded on what was supposed to be my sanctuary.</p><p>That just pissed me off.</p><p>The scent was emotional, unfamiliar, dark and red and desperate. I followed it to the tree line and, against my better judgment, walked into the dense grove of oaks that surrounded my house. Night is rarely quiet in Kentucky, especially in the hazy weeks of late summer. Mosquitoes buzzed near my head but apparently knew better than to try to graze on my undead skin. Bullfrogs croaked their love songs from the slow-moving creek that flowed into the long-abandoned pastures. Growth had given way to ripening and rot, a wet, sad smell that rose up to meet me with every step, covering the trail of the intruder.</p><p>I moved quickly through the trees, cringing with every acorn that crackled beneath my feet. A draft of icy, frigid air seemed to snake around my ankles, rising to twine around my body and squeeze at my chest. I froze, turning toward a bank of poplar trees on my left, the source of the strange sensation. I couldn\u2019t see anything, anyone, even with my clear, inhuman vision. I closed my eyes and tried to search for the mind of whoever was out there. It was like scratching my fingers at a slick marble wall, cold, hard, and impossible to get a grip. Even with my limited psychic practice, I could tell that the clammy blast of air clinging to my skin wasn\u2019t coming from whoever might be out there. It felt like an internal alarm, an organic warning even stronger than a sense of dread or foreboding. My body was trying to tell me that something bad was coming.</p><p>I took an instinctual step back toward the house, where I could lock several doors against this sense of impending doom. Instead, I locked my legs against the impulse to run. The time for running was over. Time to be proactive, I told myself.</p><p>Mustering up all the bravado I could, I yelled, \u201cHey! I know you\u2019re out here. I don\u2019t care who you are. I don\u2019t care why you\u2019re here. If you have something to say to me, you don\u2019t skulk outside my window like a peeping Tom, understand? You come to my door and approach me like a grown-up evil being.\u201d</p><p>I waited another few beats, but the only presence I felt was the frogs, their tiny hearts fluttering in the dark. \u201cI thought so. Stay away from my house, you freaking coward!\u201d</p><p>I turned on my heel, stepped into a mud slick, and went flying, landing on my back with a thud and whacking my head against a stump.</p><p>Through the lacy green canopy of leaves, the stars twinkled, mocking me.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d I huffed, pulling myself to my feet. I was lucky I hadn\u2019t impaled myself on my bat or some handy branch. Now fully sober and disgruntled, I trudged back to the house.</p><p>Jolene and Andrea, who had cleaned up the ice-cream mess in my absence, fired questions at me as I went upstairs to change out of my muddy clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there was someone out there, so I owe you an apology,\u201d I told Andrea.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think it was?\u201d Jolene asked, rubbing her stomach nervously. \u201cI cracked the door open just a little to get a sniff, but I couldn\u2019t tell. Also, Andrea closed the door on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told us to stay inside,\u201d Andrea said, as slowly and patiently as she could. \u201cAnd some of us don\u2019t have superpowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it was Gabriel?\u201d Jolene asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t be completely out of character, considering he pretty much kept watch outside my house for the first few months I was a vampire. But it didn\u2019t smell or feel like anybody I know. It smelled ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry,\u201d Jolene finished for me. \u201cAnd desperate and sort of like bug spray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d I nodded. \u201cSo, who\u2019s ready for Elizabeth to visit Pemberley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to call the cops?\u201d Andrea demanded.</p><p>\u201cAnd tell them what?\u201d I laughed. \u201cThat I smelled an intruder? After several glasses of wine? And I chased after him in my pajamas with what is probably considered an illegal weapon? No. I\u2019m going back downstairs, and I\u2019m going to finish watching our movie. I\u2019m going to drink that Hershey\u2019s syrup straight from the bottle. And if peeping guy wants to come back, he\u2019s getting a crotchful of my left foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s Gabriel?\u201d Jolene asked.</p><p>\u201cEspecially if it\u2019s Gabriel,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Andrea leaned over to Jolene and whispered, \u201cWell, the good news is, she seems to have moved on to the angry stage.\u201d</p><p>The next night, Dick greeted me at the door wearing a T-shirt that I can only guess he rescued from Andrea\u2019s culling process. In blurry white letters, it read, \u201cIf you can read this, please put me back on my bar stool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are all class, my friend,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Stretch, we\u2019re going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea told you what happened the other night, didn\u2019t she?\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cMy lovely lady friend keeps no secrets from me. Come on. Andrea\u2019s taking care of the shop tonight. We\u2019re going out.\u201d Dick hustled me up the stairs, where he threw open my closet door and selected a clingy red tank top that I normally wore as a camisole under other shirts. He tossed it at me, along with a black push-up bra that was hanging out of my underwear drawer. When he tried to open the drawer a bit to peek inside, I smacked his hand. I went to the closet to pick an overshirt, but Dick shook his head. \u201cJust wear the tank top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWearing something on top of that is a waste of your God-given gift of cleavage,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s practically blasphemy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know I\u2019m your first female friend, so it\u2019s taken some adjustments for you. But we\u2019re not going to have in-depth mammary discussions. Also, I\u2019m not changing in front of you,\u201d I told him. Dick rolled his eyes and turned his back.</p><p>When I remained clothed, he sighed his martyr\u2019s sigh and slunk outside my bedroom door, calling in, \u201cWhatever you girls did to banish the Ghost of Jackasses Past obviously didn\u2019t work, because you\u2019re all still sulky. So, you\u2019re going to take this like a man. No ice cream. No fruity drinks. No movies where whiny women \u2018find their power.\u2019 You\u2019re not a girl, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my God-given gift of cleavage proves otherwise,\u201d I muttered as I pulled the tank top over my head.</p> <p>Dick snickered. \u201cYou know what I mean. You\u2019re not like other girls. If you were, you\u2019d be sitting in a dark room somewhere, making a scrapbook of painful memories and reading Women Are from Mars, Men Are from Uranus or something. You\u2019re sort of a guy at heart, Jane. And you know what guys do when we\u2019re suffering?\u201d</p><p>I poked my head out of my room and informed him, \u201cIf this involves going to the Booby Hatch and watching my cousin Junie do her tribute to famous interns, I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>Dick ignored me. \u201cThere are three things guys do when we\u2019re suffering. We drink, and we don\u2019t talk about our feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I find that extremely appealing. What\u2019s the third thing?\u201d</p><p>Dick handed me my purse and ushered me out the door. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do I see cow tipping in my immediate future?\u201d</p><p>When I found myself sitting in the parking lot of the Cellar, staring at the sputtering neon sign, I asked Dick if he\u2019d lost his ever-loving mind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Cellar, you loved the Cellar,\u201d Dick said, jiggling my shoulder. \u201cThat one time. Come on, Norm asks about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in \u2018Whatever happened to that girl who got her ass handed to her in my parking lot and was suspected of setting Walter on fire?\u2019\u201d I snorted.</p><p>Dick dragged me out of the car. \u201cNo, as in \u2018Whatever happened to that girl who kept me from being a Norm-shaped smear across the parking lot?\u2019\u201d</p><p>The Cellar was packed compared with the single night I\u2019d spent there the previous year. Norm, the ironically named cuddly bartender, was busy, his work complicated by the house band blaring painfully earnest Elton John covers. But there were humans and vampires on the dance floor, and everybody sitting at the bar seemed companionably drunk.</p> <p>\u201cNorm!\u201d Dick crowed over the din.</p><p>Norm shook his broad, balding head and chuckled. \u201cThat never gets old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlace is busy tonight,\u201d Dick observed.</p><p>Norm opened his mouth to answer but started when he saw my face. \u201cJane! I almost didn\u2019t recognize you! Haven\u2019t seen you around here since, well, the night Walter died.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and hoped none of Walter\u2019s friends overheard this conversation. Technically, Missy did the actual killing, but that report wasn\u2019t as widely circulated in the vampire community as the one accusing me of setting Walter on fire. ... Oh, wait, Walter didn\u2019t have any friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to thank you,\u201d Norm said, grasping my hands in his own warm, thick paws. \u201cMost vamps, especially newborns, probably would have wanted to stay out of that mess and let me fend for myself. You helped me, and I appreciate it. You don\u2019t pay for drinks here, ever, got it?\u201d</p><p>If I could have blushed, I would have. Instead, I just gave him a crooked smile and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I was there, too,\u201d Dick objected.</p> <p>\u201cYou were in the can,\u201d Norm said with considerably less warmth. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen you drink. You\u2019d run me out of business. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Dick grinned liked a winsome, irresistible toddler. \u201cA bottle of tequila and two shot glasses, please, Norm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be twenty-five dollars, up front,\u201d Norm told him.</p><p>\u201cI ask you, where\u2019s the trust?\u201d Dick grumbled as he dug bills out of his wallet.</p><p>Norm handed over his best bottle of tequila, which I could only imagine was a nod to me, a bowl of lime slices, salt, and shot glasses.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about this. I know this is going to shock you, but I\u2019ve never actually done tequila shooters. I\u2019ve always been more of a \u2018mixed drinks that taste like snow cones\u2019 kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Dick poured two shots and nudged a lime slice my way. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re a natural, honey.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cSet me up.\u201d</p><p>Following Dick\u2019s motions, I licked the salt, pinched my nose, and knocked back the shot, wheezing when it hit my throat. Dick forced the lime to my lips and I bit down, careful not to swallow any vomit-inducing pulp. The heady, antiseptic burn of the liquor mixed with fresh, tart citrus juice. Dick laughed and tapped his shot glass twice on the bar. \u201cWhat do you think, Stretch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my throat is melting.\u201d I coughed, though the room started to tilt pleasantly. \u201cGive me another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl!\u201d he crowed, pouring another shot.</p><p>Three shots later, I was a much mellower vampire. Hell, I was even admiring the finer points of the band\u2019s rendition of \u201cRocket Man.\u201d So, when a tall, handsome vamp came my way and asked me to dance, I was just relaxed enough not to embarrass myself completely.</p><p>OK, what I said was, \u201cI have to go to the bathroom,\u201d and then I ran to the back of the bar. Which was only a little embarrassing.</p><p>In the ladies\u2019 room, I stared at the ceiling and wondered why I didn\u2019t get any share of the Early feminine wiles, so aptly handled by Jenny, Mama, and Grandma Ruthie.</p><p>\u201cYou are a ridiculous person,\u201d I told myself. \u201cThat was a perfectly nice-looking, nonthreatening person, who, for some reason, seems not to find you repulsive. And if you were a woman who had normal emotional responses and a regulated sense of paranoia, you would actually give that man a chance to take you home tonight. Go back out there, and stop being a spaz.\u201d</p><p>I shoved the door open, fully committed to non-spazdom, and heard someone on the other side yelp. I stepped out to see that I had smacked some poor guy with the door and spilled his beer down the front of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWell, there goes that,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>The vampire now wearing his beer laughed and wrung out his shirt. \u201cSo, are you anti-drinking, or do you just really hate plaid?\u201d</p><p>I laughed at the situation and the funny. \u201cBoth, actually. I had a traumatic childhood involving hard-drinking lumberjacks.\u201d His smile was wide, friendly, his fangs incongruent with the sweet chocolate eyes. \u201cCan I buy you another beer to replace what you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my friend\u2019s round, and he tends to buy domestic. But you can dance with me. To cover my chest, so no one will see the stain on my shirt ... that you caused. Not to make you feel obligated or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I feel obligated?\u201d I laughed and let him lead me to the dance floor as the band struck up \u201cYour Song.\u201d I hadn\u2019t slow-danced since Zeb and Jolene\u2019s wedding, when Gabriel twirled me around the floor to the strains of \u201cMy Heart Will Go On .\u201d Oh, thinking about Gabriel was really not going to help me right now. I pushed those images away as this delicious man, who smelled pleasantly of Polo cologne and beer, put my arms around his neck and pulled me close. Normal, healthy relationship, I repeated over and over in my head. Normal, healthy relationship.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed you earlier, you know. You\u2019re one of the only women in here whose smile looks real. Sometimes when people are turned, they lose that. It\u2019s nice to meet someone who hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cSee? There it is again,\u201d he teased, his dimples winking as he smiled back.</p><p>Charlie was the type of guy I would have loved meeting when I was living. Sincere, friendly, open, and out in the world. Of course, I never went to bars when I was living, so technically I wasn\u2019t out in the world.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s a nice girl like you doing shots in a place like this?\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost a bet?\u201d Charlie asked. I giggled\u2014yes, it\u2019s pathetic, I know\u2014and shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019re new to Alcoholics Anonymous, and you\u2019re unclear on the rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood guess, but no.\u201d</p><p>Charlie bit his lip and considered. \u201cYou\u2019re in the witness-protection program and that guy is your inept federal handler?\u201d</p><p>We glanced back at Dick, who was giving Charlie the \u201cmale relative\u201d death glare.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my friend Dick. I\u2019ve been having a rough time lately, and he\u2019s trying to cheer me up with good booze and bad Elton John music, forgetting that I intensely dislike both. But I do like Dick, so I\u2019m making the best of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you.\u201d There was the smile again, drawing my attention to his mouth. It looked soft and sweet; obviously, he made Chapstick a priority.</p><p>As we swayed and turned in silence, listening to the insistently poignant music, I caught sight of Dick watching us from the bar. He looked concerned, not necessarily judging me but definitely concerned. One didn\u2019t have to be a mind reader to tell that he was wary of Charlie and the fact that Charlie\u2019s hands were making contact with actual skin. It was only the skin on my arms, but it still seemed to disturb Dick.</p><p>I turned my back on him. Charlie took this as a hint to hold me closer, so that his lips brushed my forehead. It felt good, uncomplicated. His hands stroked my back in slow circles, urging me ever closer. It would be so easy to tip up my head and let him kiss me. But something was holding me back. Actually, it was several somethings: the knowledge that Dick was watching, doubt over whether a nice girl would move on this fast after breaking up with her vampire sire, and the possibility that for all I knew, this was the guy who had lurked outside my house the other night. I really didn\u2019t like that last one.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t I be the casual-romance girl? Why couldn\u2019t I pick up some strange guy at a bar, flirt and kiss, and have no-strings-attached sex? Why did my brain always prevent me from behaving like a normal person?</p><p>Kissing. I would start with kissing.</p><p>So I did. I parted my lips and felt the cool, wet slide of his mouth across mine. He slipped his hands under my chin, tilting my face toward his so he could take even more of my mouth. He was gentle. He was sweet. And it felt wrong.</p><p>You know when you can tell you\u2019re making a huge mistake\u2014not just buying ugly shoes because they\u2019re on sale or choosing the wrong Christmas gift for your mother but \u201cthe world is off its axis, spinning out of control into the abyss of space\u201d wrong? I was making a huge mistake. Even though it was possible Gabriel was out, enjoying a \u201cpurely carnal\u201d relationship with a woman who enjoyed high-quality stationery, at that very moment, it felt wrong for me to be kissing someone else. It felt like a betrayal.</p><p>I pulled back from him and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Charlie. You\u2019re really nice. And that was a really great kiss. I don\u2019t want to lead you on or send out mixed signals, which is, ironically, exactly what I\u2019m doing right now. But I just got out of a weird relationship, and I\u2019m not ready to do this yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be your rebound guy,\u201d he offered affably. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt my feelings, honest.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a beat, my hormones waging war against my more rational parts. Stupid rational parts! I groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s really tempting, trust me.

He pulled out his wallet and handed me a business card for Dr. Charles McCraffrey and his ear, nose, and throat practice in nearby Willardsville. He was a doctor. A vampire doctor but a doctor all the same. It was a good thing my mother wasn\u2019t there to witness this. \u201cIf you change your mind, please give me a call. It was very nice to meet you, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with Mr. Hands?\u201d Dick asked, glaring in Charlie\u2019s direction when I slumped back to the bar stool.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted me to share my \u2018gift\u2019 with the world,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cPour me another drink.\u201d</p><p>Dick obliged, asking Norm for a bottle of water. Apparently, I was being cut off. \u201cThat was a really nice guy,\u201d I told Dick. \u201cAnd a doctor. Do you know what the chances are of meeting a nice, noncrazy vampire doctor at a bar in Half-Moon Hollow? I have a better chance of being struck by lightning and winning the lottery at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we should go out and buy some tickets,\u201d Dick said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t humor the cranky vampire. What is wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I just meet a nice guy and go home with him? Why do I have all these weird hang-ups about feelings and meaning and making sure I have this intuitive bell going off in my head before I can let someone into my pants? You know, even when Gabriel and I had sex for the first time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to hear this,\u201d Dick said, shaking his head.</p> <p>\u201cI had to be all angry and \u2018out of control.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t just get lost in the moment. I needed an excuse, which is ridiculous, because there\u2019s no reason not to want to have sex with Gabriel. I mean, he has an amazing body\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018drinking and not talking\u2019 did I not make clear?\u201d Dick demanded.</p><p>The band kicked into \u201cBenny and the Jets.\u201d A skinny, pimpled vampire and two of his buddies appeared behind Dick and tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cDick, I want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Dick looked thrilled for the interruption. \u201cTodd, thank God. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my money back for those Springsteen tickets,\u201d Todd demanded, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing indignantly.</p><p>Using a patient, paternal voice, Dick said, \u201cNow, Todd, I gave you a good deal on those tickets. I didn\u2019t even charge a handling fee. You couldn\u2019t get a price that good from Ticketmaster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose tickets were to a concert two years ago!\u201d Todd shouted, a cue for his companions to put on their mean faces and look intimidating. I rolled my eyes and took a swig of water, which did nothing for my thirst, blood- or liquor-wise.</p><p>\u201cThey were collector\u2019s items!\u201d Dick shouted back. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t look on the tickets to check the date. I never told you they were for a concert this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you sure the hell didn\u2019t tell me they weren\u2019t!\u201d Todd whined. \u201cI took a girl all the way to Memphis for that concert. There was nothing there! Marcy was convinced I was trying to trick her into something. I felt like an asshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Todd,\u201d Dick said, giving Todd what could be construed as a sympathetic headshake, \u201cyou are an asshole.\u201d</p><p>A lot of things seemed to happen at once. One of Todd\u2019s friends took a swing at Dick, missing and pinning me against the bar as he fell. I reached into my purse, feeling for the little keychain canister of vampire mace Gabriel had given me for Christmas, but couldn\u2019t find it. It wasn\u2019t attached to my keys or caught loose in the lining. Crap. I thought about stepping out of the way and letting Dick handle this, but then Todd smashed a pilsner over Dick\u2019s head. I yelled, \u201cHey! What the hell are you doing?\u201d and shoved Todd back. The smaller of Todd\u2019s buddies gave me an admirable upward right hook to the jaw, knocking me back on my butt.</p><p>Have I mentioned that most male vampires have no compunctions about hitting girl vampires?</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, picked the Girl Hitter up, and slammed him to the floor. Todd spun me on my heel and punched me in the eye.</p><p>Ow.</p> <p>The dance-floor crowd was now circled around the ruckus, cheering Dick on as he kicked Todd in the kneecap and hit him in the throat with a pool cue. The taller of Todd\u2019s friends smashed another pilsner and the tequila bottle over Dick\u2019s head, so I kicked him in the crotch and felt a vicious little thrill when he howled and toppled over.</p><p>As Todd turned and advanced on me, I grabbed a chair, sidestepped him, and broke it over his back on \u201cB-b-b-benny\u201d and knocked him to the floor on \u201cthe Jets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside, Dick, now!\u201d Norm yelled, apparently hitting his limit in terms of broken bar paraphernalia. Dick grabbed a pool cue and chased the three of them out of the bar. I felt I had no choice but to follow, along with most of the patrons in the bar. The gentleman with the spanking-new crotch injury elected to get into his car rather than suffer further humiliation.</p><p>Todd was getting winded, and his other friend was whining about something in his face being broken.</p><p>\u201cJust give me my money, and we\u2019ll call it a night,\u201d Todd wheezed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, you get in your car and get the hell out of here, and I\u2019ll keep my girl here from kicking you in the goods, too.\u201d Dick smirked. \u201cShe\u2019s done it before. She\u2019ll do it again.\u201d</p><p>Todd look one look at my size-nine boots. I smiled, my fangs fully extended over my lip. Todd ran for it. The crowd groaned in disappointment and dispersed.</p><p>After I handed over cash to cover the broken stools and pitchers, a more forgiving Norm allowed us back into the bar to press ice to our rapidly healing faces.</p><p>\u201cYou should know better,\u201d Norm told Dick.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jane threw just as many punches as I did!\u201d Dick cried.</p><p>Norm shook his head. \u201cShe was hitting in self-defense. You started it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTodd hit me first. Besides, how was I supposed to know he was dumb enough to head all the way to Memphis without even looking at the stupid tickets? I thought he would have figured it out weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Norm pointed a fatherly finger at Dick. \u201cYou know what I mean. If you didn\u2019t do your back-alley deals at my bar, I wouldn\u2019t have all that many fights. Why did you even come tonight, anyway? You knew Todd would come looking for you, and you know he loves Cover Band Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot all about it,\u201d Dick said, avoiding eye contact with me. Norm muttered something under his breath and turned his back to help another customer.</p><p>I stared at Dick, who busied himself pouring the remaining ice from his face pack into my water glass and stretching his freshly healed jaw. \u201cDick, what\u2019s the third thing?\u201d</p><p>Dick stared at me, his face blank. \u201cDid you get a concussion, Stretch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe third thing that men do to get over a break-up. Drinking, not talking about your feelings, and then what?\u201d I said, growing suspicious. \u201cIt\u2019s fighting, isn\u2019t it? You set this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Dick said, still not making eye contact.</p><p>\u201cYou set this up,\u201d I repeated, poking him in the sides.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he mumbled in the tone of a little boy who\u2019d burnt his Mother\u2019s Day breakfast in bed. He smirked. \u201cI didn\u2019t arrange for him to hassle me, but I figured, you\u2019re sad, you\u2019re angry, you didn\u2019t get to hit anything the other night. Todd was going to be there anyway, so why not let you get some stuff out of your system? I always feel better after a good cathartic tussle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did all this for me?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou feel better, right?\u201d</p><p>I thought about it for a second and realized that I did. That beating the tar out of a Bruce Springsteen fan with poor attention to detail had made me feel better than all the liquor and ice cream and Bette Midler in the world. \u201cI sort of love you, Dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile my heart and all my other parts belong to a certain adorable redhead, I love you, too, Stretch,\u201d he said, giving my shoulder a brief squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019re the sister I never really wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>When you\u2019re having relationship problems, channel your energy into productive projects. Join a charitable group, or volunteer with an animal shelter or a soup kitchen. (It\u2019s best to avoid the temptation of blood drives.)</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>Once I decided not to let moping take over my life, it was a lot easier to get up and going in the evenings.</p><p>I cleaned the house from top to bottom, something I\u2019d neglected during the busy months before the shop opened. I did a total inventory of the valuables to make sure Jenny and Grandma Ruthie hadn\u2019t managed to sneak into the house while I was out of town. I reorganized my library, and found about fifteen paperback copies of Pride and Prejudice. I also found a few titles that Mr. Wainwright had sent home with me from the shop to help me \u201cacclimate to my new culture\u201d: Love Customs of the Were, a few volumes on exotic were species, and The Spectrum of Vampirism . Mr. Wainwright loaned it to me the year before to help me find my way through the subtle levels of vampirism. Honestly, it\u2019s like Scientology. I boxed them up and set them in Big Bertha\u2019s trunk, so I\u2019d remember to return them to the stock.</p><p>And finally, I packed up everything associated with Gabriel: the ticket stubs from our first movie date, the little platinum unicorn necklace he\u2019d given me for Christmas, the travel guides I\u2019d pored over before we left on our trip. I put them in a cardboard box and took them down to the root cellar. Maybe one day, I\u2019d be strong enough to take them out again or even throw them away, but for the moment, I just wanted them out of sight.</p><p>In the wake of our repetitive bonding experiences, Andrea, Dick, and I developed a new schedule at the shop. Andrea and I would open, brew coffee, go through mail, and prepare orders for shipping for about an hour before customers started showing up. Andrea generally needed a nap around midnight, so Dick would show up and give me a hand until closing. In the interest of keeping Andrea from being completely nocturnal, she got Wednesdays off, and Dick helped me open. The routine was relaxed but organized enough to suit my compulsive librarian\u2019s soul.</p><p>So, imagine our surprise when we arrived on a Wednesday night to find a man in wrinkled khakis sleeping against the front door of the shop. Sadly, it wasn\u2019t all that odd to find a drunk sleeping it off in our doorway, so Dick rousted him with a few shoves to the shoulder, while I gathered the delivery parcel Rip Van Winkle was using as a pillow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to find some other place to rest your head.\u201d Dick sighed, pulling at the man\u2019s shirt. \u201cCome on, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Rip snorted and yawned. \u201cJane Jameson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to put it on the door!\u201d Dick exclaimed, pointing at the little sign that read, \u201cJane Jameson, Proprietor. You have enough problems without giving the crazies your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Jane Jameson,\u201d the man said, yawning and scratching at two days\u2019 worth of beard growth. \u201cI\u2019m Emery Mueller, Gilbert Wainwright\u2019s nephew.\u201d</p><p>As advertised, Mr. Wainwright\u2019s nephew, Emery, was both milquetoast and mealy-mouthed. Emery was the son of Mr. Wainwright\u2019s only sister, Margaret, who had moved to California in the 1960s and married a radio evangelist. Mr. Wainwright had only seen Emery on rare visits to the Hollow before Emery moved to Guatemala to teach English at a mountain seminary. He\u2019d described Emery as an odd little boy who\u2019d grown into an odd little man. And considering the level of oddity in Mr. Wainwright, that was saying something.</p><p>The cherry on this sundae of genetic improbability was that Emery and Mr. Wainwright also happened to be Dick\u2019s descendants. Dick had watched over the Wainwright family, the illegitimate product of a prevampirism dalliance with a servant girl, for generations. He considered Mr. Wainwright to be the \u201cpick of the litter,\u201d stepping in to pay for his college tuition and proudly watching as Mr. Wainwright became one of the first Hollow boys to volunteer for duty in World War II. Dick was afraid that his less-than-upstanding connections might put the family at risk, so he\u2019d only confessed to the relation the previous year, after Mr. Wainwright died. Watching those two bond, a vampire who appeared to be in his thirties giving fatherly advice to a ghost in his seventies, was as mind-boggling as it was touching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dick was obviously not as impressed with the latest branch of the Wainwright family tree. I thought living in South America was supposed to make you all tan and scruffy-sexy, like Harrison Ford. Emery just seemed pale and clammy, like gone-over cheese. He wore hornrimmed glasses and a permanently constipated expression. His skin was pitted with old acne scars, which might have remained unnoticed if not for his tendency to flush and blush at the slightest provocation. His hair and his eyes were the same color, which I can only describe as \u201cdust.\u201d</p><p>Ever since Emery had responded to Mr. Wainwright\u2019s death with a telegram telling us to proceed with the funeral without him, Dick and I had a running bet about when Emery would show up. I guessed four months, Dick guessed six months, and Mr. Wainwright guessed a year. We still had no idea how we would collect a wager from a ghost.</p><p>\u201cFour months!\u201d I cried triumphantly to Dick, who slapped a twenty-dollar bill into my hand.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Emery, I\u2019m Jane,\u201d I said to a clearly confused Emery. \u201cThis is my friend Dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sent the e-mail.\u201d Emery yawned. \u201cTo let me know about Uncle Gilbert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, several months ago,\u201d I said, smiling in that overly sweet way only Dick knew was insincere. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you. I drove that rental car all the way from Louisville without air conditioning. It was terrible,\u201d he said, heaving himself off the ground.</p><p>My lips quirked involuntarily at his pronunciation of Louisville. Not because he had an accent or anything. One\u2019s Kentucky street cred can be determined based on how one pronounces Louisville. Luh-vul, you\u2019re from west Kentucky. Louie-ville, east Kentucky. Louis-ville, you\u2019re from Illinois.</p> <p>\u201cI know it seems odd to show up unannounced at this time of night. And it\u2019s so nice to meet you,\u201d Emery simpered as we led him into the shop. \u201cWhile I dearly love doing the Lord\u2019s work, I\u2019m so glad to be back here. I spent many hours as a child in the store, poring over the books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said, arching a brow. \u201cIt\u2019s just that they\u2019re all, you know, occult books. Mr. Wainwright said you were very devout, even as a child. He said you tried to baptize him with bottled water when you were nine.\u201d</p><p>Emery flushed pink and cleared his throat. \u201cYes, well, spending time here was a taste of the forbidden fruit. I was fascinated by the books because they were so different from anything in my house. It drove my mother crazy.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright appeared behind Emery and nodded. \u201cHe did spend a lot of time here. And it was his predilection for the woodcarvings of the nude rituals practiced by eastern European vampire clans that upset his mother. I had to hide all the books that bared what his mother called \u2018lady bumps.\u2019 It was horrifying.\u201d</p><p>Dick excused himself so he could go out to the parking lot and laugh. I was stuck chewing on my lip and praying for a straight face. I flipped on the light switch, and Gilbert gave a loud gasp at the appearance of the shop. \u201cIt\u2019s so different!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, we\u2019ve renovated extensively since you were here last.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must have spent a fortune!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly nicer than anything in the neighborhood ... you might have outpaced yourself there.\u201d</p><p>I shot a \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d look at Dick, who had just walked back in.</p><p>\u201cAnd look, everything is so orderly! You could find anything you wanted now. Uncle Gilbert never did have a head for alphabetizing.\u201d Emery smirked. \u201cBut I guess he had you for that, among other things. He wrote to me about you once. He was very fond of you, a young, pretty vampire girl who was willing to spend so much time with him. Obviously, he had to be fond of you, if he sank all his money into renovating the shop and leaving it to you. I\u2019m glad he had someone to make his last months so pleasurable, someone who took care of him. Even if it was only an employee.\u201d</p><p>Call me oversensitive, but had Emery just implied that I exchanged sexual favors for cash and redecorating?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I appreciate what he\u2019s implying,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said, staring at his nephew.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d I muttered, to which Emery gave me a confused look. I cleared my throat. \u201cMr. Mueller, I don\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea about my relationship with Mr. Wainwright and how his will was written. I didn\u2019t set out to take over the shop or get in good with your uncle. I was just lucky enough to be hired by one of the sweetest men on earth, and he became a close friend. I didn\u2019t know he planned on leaving me the shop, and I wasn\u2019t even sure I was going to keep it at first. In fact, I was thinking very seriously of selling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! I think that\u2019s for the best, the right thing to do,\u201d Emery said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything I can to help speed things along.\u201d</p><p>I was caught off-guard by his sudden enthusiasm. Who was he to be so enthusiastic about tossing out his uncle\u2019s legacy? Especially when that legacy technically belonged to me now?</p> <p>\u201cGive him what for, Jane,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said, smirking at what he recognized was my temper building. Emery wasn\u2019t smart enough to see it himself.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying, I thought about selling. But I decided the best way to honor your uncle\u2019s memory would be to keep this place going. So I sank my own money into renovations. It didn\u2019t cost your uncle a penny. And the business seems to be taking off, so we\u2019re not going to be closing anytime soon. Um, for now, anything you want to take, you\u2019re welcome to, especially stuff from his personal effects or private collections. He didn\u2019t spell that out in the will, but I wouldn\u2019t feel right keeping everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d Emery sighed, picking up his duffel. \u201cFor now, I\u2019m going upstairs to bed. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m being rude. I\u2019m just so tired. Jet lag, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, exchanging a look with Mr. Wainwright. \u201cActually, there\u2019s no apartment there anymore. We turned it into storage and office space. I can recommend some hotels in town, though, depending on how long you\u2019re planning on staying.\u201d</p><p>Emery\u2019s lips thinned in a way that showed that he was clearly insulted by this change. \u201cI see. I didn\u2019t anticipate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I\u2019d known you were coming, I would have made hotel arrangements for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy hotels,\u201d Emery said sulkily. \u201cYou never know who\u2019s stayed in the room before you or whether the facilities have been cleaned properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is absolutely phobic about germs.\u201d Mr. Wainwright chuckled. \u201cBut only American germs, for some reason. He thinks people in other countries are cleaner than we are. Don\u2019t let him talk you into staying with you, Jane. The last time he was a guest in my house, I woke up at three A.M. to find him steam-cleaning the inside of my dishwasher.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Emery staying with me hadn\u2019t even occurred to me. Yes, I had room to put Emery at my house, but ... no. I was not inviting a mouth-breathing stranger into my home. A vaguely rude mouth-breathing stranger at that. I wondered if Dick would invite him to stay at Andrea\u2019s place. But given the way Emery was fastidiously wiping at his hands with hand sanitizer, as if we had some sort of germ that was more powerful than what they had in Guatemala, Dick didn\u2019t seem inclined to bond with him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Emery,\u201d Dick said, taking Emery\u2019s duffel bag onto his shoulder and patting him on the back. \u201cI know a good boardinghouse in town. Very clean. The owner owes me a favor. I\u2019ll get you settled in.\u201d</p><p>Dick escorted Emery to his car and came back into the shop under the guise of forgetting something. \u201cThat\u2019s the fruit of my loins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your genes lost their mojo somewhere along the way,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Dick was indignant. \u201cThose are not my genes. Margaret must have mated with a jellyfish or something.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not too far off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at Gilbert. He wasn\u2019t exactly strapping when he was young, but he had guts! He had gumption! He wasn\u2019t afraid of hotel sheets!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dick,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said, smiling proudly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you!\u201d Dick cried. \u201cWhat are you thinking, telling him he can have anything he wants from the stock? What if he runs off with something valuable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s probably got more rights to anything here than I do,\u201d I said.</p><p>Mr. Wainwright winced. \u201cOh, please, don\u2019t say that in front of him, dear. He\u2019ll take everything that\u2019s not nailed down and donate the proceeds to a questionable charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you softening up to the doughy young missionary?\u201d Dick asked me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with missionaries,\u201d I said, grinning at him. \u201cBesides, he is your great-great-grandson, your own flesh and blood. And we both know you could use a little churching up. It might be interesting for you to talk to him, to hear things from his point of view.\u201d</p><p>Dick made a sour face. \u201cHis point of view is that we\u2019re evil and should be struck through the heart with a stake wrapped in wild roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that seems harsh.\u201d</p><p>Dick walked out, putting his \u201cdetermined to be polite\u201d face on. I busied myself with getting the coffee bar ready for that night\u2019s crowd.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been, Jane, dear?\u201d Mr. Wainwright asked. \u201cYour aunt told me about your difficulties with Gabriel. She said you took it rather hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, after going through the female and male break-up recovery rituals, I can determine that, one, I\u2019m going to be OK. And two, the male break-up ritual is more fun but harder to heal up from. I\u2019m fine, really. I\u2019m just keeping busy and trying not to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can haunt Gabriel\u2019s house for you, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Mr. Wainwright offered.</p><p>\u201cThank you, that\u2019s very sweet, but I don\u2019t think you can really scare someone after you\u2019ve spent Christmas Eve with them. Unless you\u2019re my grandma Ruthie.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright chuckled. I rummaged through the drawers behind the bar and then got on my hands and knees, searching for the tiny canister of vampire mace. It had obviously been detached from my keyring at some point, and it didn\u2019t show up in a thorough postfight search of my purse and house. And it wasn\u2019t the sort of thing I wanted lying around the shop.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wainwright, have you seen a little metal tube, about the size of a Chapstick?\u201d I asked, lifting a chaise longue with one hand to search under it. Mr. Wainwright, who was always entertained by my feats of vampire strength, shook his head. \u201cGreat. Either I\u2019m going to have to wait for Fitz to pass it or pray I don\u2019t step on it and mace myself.\u201d</p><p>The front bell rang, and Zeb walked into the shop, pale and shaking. Wordlessly, he walked to the coffee bar and climbed onto a stool.</p><p>I snapped my fingers in front of his face. \u201cZeb, are you OK? What\u2019s wrong? Is it Jolene? Is the baby OK? Did one of Jolene\u2019s relatives get trapped by the Department of Fish and Wildlife? Did the police find your dad\u2019s still? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of them,\u201d he said, his eyes oddly dilated.</p><p>\u201cOne of Jolene\u2019s relatives was trapped by the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the police found your dad\u2019s still? What are the odds of that?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>He snapped out of his funk long enough to look annoyed with me. \u201cNo, two of them, on the ultrasound. There\u2019s two babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins?\u201d I laughed. \u201cBut that\u2019s great! And considering the number of multiple births in Jolene\u2019s family, not entirely unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Mr. Wainwright cried, and then he caught sight of Zeb\u2019s stricken expression. \u201cI\u2019ll be going now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zeb scrubbed his hand over his face as Mr. Wainwright faded out of sight. \u201cI was prepared for one baby. I don\u2019t know if I can handle two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that. There\u2019s a very strict no-return policy on babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, Jane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, what do you want me to do? Take one off your hands? There\u2019s not much I can do, except pay someone else to babysit. Are they boys or girls?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know yet; it\u2019s too early to tell. To be honest, I didn\u2019t catch much after \u2018two heartbeats.\u2019 One of them was doing a sort of Homer Simpson shimmy. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s the one that takes after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way: you\u2019re lucky it\u2019s not triplets or quadruplets.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to cheer him.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep going, you can form your own basketball team,\u201d I suggested. He furrowed his brow and frowned at me. \u201cToo soon?\u201d He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll fix you some herbal tea. It\u2019s soothing,\u201d I said, patting his hand. \u201cHow\u2019s Jolene? Is she craving pickles and ice cream yet?\u201d</p> <p>Zeb groaned. \u201cIf only. It\u2019s more like Canadian bacon and ice cream. Peanut butter and turkey sandwiches. Tuna noodle pie. She actually made what she called \u2018bacon chip cookies\u2019 the other day\u2014a chocolate-chip cookie recipe with bacon pieces instead of chocolate chips. She said it\u2019s her body\u2019s way of getting as much protein as possible for the babies, but I swear if I see her eat one more of those pies, I\u2019m going to yark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the good news, is whenever I regret not being able to eat, I\u2019ll call those images to mind. I\u2019ll never want solid food again.\u201d I shuddered, rubbing my stomach.</p><p>Zeb perked up as he said, \u201cBy the way, I got a call from the reunion committee today. They wanted some pictures of you for the memorial wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not dead!\u201d</p><p>Zeb smirked. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not the way the committee sees it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m not going to this thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d he said, accepting a cup of chamomile. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go to the reunion. It\u2019ll be fun! You can scare the crap out of all our former classmates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be fun for you. You\u2019re married to a beautiful woman who adores you to the point that she\u2019ll probably maul the first doofus who tries to give you a commemorative wedgie. And she\u2019ll be pregnant, so everyone will know you\u2019ve had sex with her. I, however, will most likely be going solo which will probably just cement all those lesbian rumors. Oh, wait, dead lesbian rumors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you haven\u2019t made up with Gabriel yet, huh?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Cindy the Goth Good-Luck Charm walked through the door, acknowledged me with a nod, and headed for the graphic novels. \u201cYou know, I used to be alone, and I got along just fine. It\u2019s simpler this way. Less messy, less complicated. Less time wondering what the hell is going on in my own life and whether it\u2019s my fault. At least, this way, I know it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>Zeb grimaced. \u201cWell, that\u2019s cheerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do what I can,\u201d I said, shrugging as the front doorbell rang. \u201cI met a really nice doctor the other night. And then he saw me beat a guy senseless, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to want me to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou beat some guy senseless?\u201d Zeb cried.</p><p>\u201cDick made an attempt to cheer me up. It was either a bar fight or cow tipping.\u201d</p> <p>Zeb\u2019s nose wrinkled. \u201cYou and Dick have a complicated relationship.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. I put a mocha latte on the counter for Cindy and left it out for her, like cookies and milk for an Emo Santa Claus. \u201cBesides, Adam Morrow\u2019s going to be there, and I\u2019m still feeling a little weird about him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d had a huge crush on Adam since elementary school. He was the blond, dimpled football hero to my tuba-toting band geek. I never really got over that teeny-bopper obsession with him, which was why it was so difficult for me to see that his efforts to get \u201creacquainted\u201d a few months before had nothing to do with me and everything to do with Adam\u2019s weirdo sexual fascination with vampires. It turned out that despite attending school with me for twelve years, he hadn\u2019t remembered the name of that \u201cegghead who used to annoy him in class\u201d until someone reminded him at my almost-grandpa Bob\u2019s funeral. I dropped Adam like a clove of garlic and mended damaged fences with Gabriel before it was too late.</p><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t realize at the time that it was already too late and Gabriel had moved on to Jeanine. I\u2019ve really got to work on rerouting my thought process so every subject doesn\u2019t come back to Gabriel.</p><p>It seemed unfair that I felt some measure of break-up anxiety over Adam when we never technically went out. But to this day, I couldn\u2019t even hear his name without a rush of guilt and embarrassment. I would have enough to deal with at the reunion\u2014such as my placement on the memorial wall\u2014without delving into those issues again.</p><p>\u201cBut crushing Adam\u2019s hopes and dreams is going to make the reunion even better! You, the untouchable hottie that he can\u2019t, well, touch. It\u2019s going to be such a blow to his ego!\u201d Zeb exclaimed. \u201cI never told you this, because you had that thing for him in school, but I always wanted to just punch that guy in the face with his \u2018Oh, I\u2019m tall and blond and dreamy, and everybody loves me because I\u2019m such a nice guy\u2019 shtick. Maybe there were other guys in the class who were just as nice. Maybe there were some guys in the class who should have been Swing Choir president but didn\u2019t get elected because Adam was \u2018so dreamy.\u2019 Maybe there were some guys who wanted to take Dawn Farber to Homecoming but ended up going stag because Dawn was holding out for Adam \u2018just in case.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t go to the reunion,\u201d I said, sorting through the day\u2019s mail. \u201cShould I start putting horse tranquilizers in your tea?\u201d</p><p>As Zeb ranted on, I sifted through the day\u2019s mail, mostly bills and publishers\u2019 catalogues. An ivory linen paper envelope slipped out and fluttered to the counter. I stared at it for a moment, wondering if I was imagining the spidery black writing that spelled out my name and the shop address. There was no return label. The postmark was in Half-Moon Hollow.</p><p>\u201cYou OK, Janie?\u201d Zeb asked, reaching over to jiggle my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re pale. Paler than usual.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and handed the heavy envelope to Zeb. My hands were shaking. \u201cCould you open that for me?\u201d</p><p>Zeb arched an eyebrow, concern stretching his mouth in a grim line. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I took the letter from his hands and laid it on the bar to keep it steady enough for me to read. There was no opening greeting, just cramped paragraphs crowding the elegant slip of stationery.</p><p>You don\u2019t know who I am, but I have been watching you for a long time, Jane.</p><p>Gabriel Nightengale isn\u2019t the man you think he is. He\u2019s not even the vampire you think he is. Gabriel takes advantage of those who are weaker. He doesn\u2019t care for you. He is incapable of caring for anyone but himself. Even his jealousy and possessiveness, his claims that he wants to protect you, come from his desire to own you, to keep you to himself, like a favorite toy, until he is through playing with you.</p><p>I was once like you, young and innocent. Gabriel claimed he was drawn to me because of that innocence, my goodness. He said he could follow my scent across the world, that it was part of what bonded me to him. He said he loved me. Foolishly, I thought he was exciting and dashing\u2014a dark prince taking me away from a life of boredom, from a gilded cage of limitations and demands. He killed me. He damned me, as he has damned you.</p><p>You are nothing special. You are not different from any girl who has ever walked the earth, despite what he may have told you. And when you have served your purpose, he will grow tired of you. He will use and abandon you as he used and abandoned me.</p><p>I know where you go. I know with whom you spend your time. You seem to enjoy your little life. For your sake, for the sake of the people you care about, you should stay away from Gabriel.</p><p>A Concerned and Vigilant Friend</p><p>I looked down and saw the corner of a photo sticking out of the envelope. I tipped it and slid several photos out into my hands. I gasped as I recognized the subjects. Gabriel and I in a hotel room. The camera was obviously outside a window, but I had no idea where we were or when the picture had been taken. We were stretched out on one of the wide hotel beds, a rare moment of relaxation on the Trip from Hell. My feet were draped across Gabriel\u2019s lap as he painted my toenails a delicate strawberry color. There was another picture of us in London as we walked toward the theater. I was wearing the red dress I\u2019d bought just to attend a performance of As You Like It . There was a photo taken while we were in Rome. I was sitting at a little outdoor caf\u00e9, alone and looking worried, because Gabriel had just gotten up to take another \u201cbusiness call.\u201d Another photo of me, this time alone on my front-porch swing, reading New Moon by Stephenie Meyer, a book I\u2019d chosen in hopes of exorcising my own traumatic vampire break-up issues. The camera seemed focused on the teardrop trailing down my cheek, as if that was the whole point of the picture. The final photo featured Andrea, Jolene, and me sprawled out in my living room, watching TV.</p><p>Andrea had seen someone at my window that night. This person had taken pictures of us, laughing and eating junk food. They\u2019d probably followed me out into the woods on my idiot\u2019s errand. I realized how foolish I\u2019d been to leave the house. This person could have doubled back to the house and hurt Andrea, hurt Jolene and her babies. My stomach twisted into a cold, watery knot. This person had followed us for months, had been privy to intimate, happy moments I wanted to keep private, had enjoyed watching me work through pain. My fangs snuck over my lip. The razor-sharp tips caught the tender flesh and made blood well into my mouth, sending my senses into overdrive. I growled.</p><p>\u201cJanie, what\u2019s wrong? What does it say?\u201d While I was reading, Zeb had stepped around the bar and had an arm wrapped around me. \u201cBad news?\u201d</p><p>I fought to get my temper in check, to get my emotions under control. I didn\u2019t want to worry Zeb with this. He had enough to deal with, worrying over Jolene and the babies. Through force of will and a barrage of unappetizing imagery (basically, any episode of CSI ), I made my fangs retract.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I blew out a breath and faked a smile as I refolded the letter over the photos and stuck them under the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just really persistent junk mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like junk mail. What\u2019s with all the pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Zeb.\u201d</p><p>Zeb didn\u2019t seem convinced, but then customers started coming in, and I didn\u2019t have time to answer questions. I waited until Zeb\u2019s back was turned to fish the letter out and read it again. Obviously, this \u201cconcerned and vigilant friend\u201d was the same person who sent Gabriel letters in Europe. Was it the mysterious Jeanine, the woman whose name had popped up frequently on Gabriel\u2019s cell phone in the last year? And if it was, who the hell was she? And how long ago had Gabriel \u201cused and abandoned\u201d her? And perhaps the most important question, what was she doing in the Hollow?</p><p>8</p><p>It\u2019s important to remember to spend time with your family.

In fact, they seemed to grow more intense after Gabriel\u2019s return. In this particular dream, I was strapped into complicated Victorian underwear. Gabriel was wearing an old-fashioned cut-away tux. We were in an expensive-looking hotel room, lit by gas lamps. Still clad in his white shirtsleeves, an enthusiastic Gabriel peeled my corset away, pushed me back onto the bed, and kissed his way from the curve of my linen-covered breast to the lacy little pantaloons I was wearing. He smiled up at me, the way he used to when we made love, as if I was the most beautiful creature on the planet. I felt my human flesh grow warm and pliable under his hands. He stripped the last of my underthings away, lapping away at my core with strong, sure strokes. He nibbled and kissed until I was panting. When he finally touched the very tip of his tongue to that vital little bundle of nerves, I exploded, screaming his name as I rode wave after wave of dark, shuddering ecstasy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then I felt the pain. My eyes flew open. Gabriel\u2019s fangs were sunk deep into the flesh of my thigh, twin trickles of blood flowing onto the sheets as he fed greedily. He snarled up at me, my blood dripping obscenely from his fangs. I screamed again, for entirely different reasons. And he launched himself at me, snapping his teeth against my throat and draining me. He rolled away, sated, and disappeared into the sheets. Horrified, I raised my bloodied hands and saw them turn slowly gray. They seemed to decompose before my very eyes. I was a corpse, rotting and decayed.</p><p>That certainly explained the smell.</p><p>I woke up with a start and immediately clamped my hand over my nose. As I shook off the last blood-smeared images of the dream, my stomach roiled. I had not smelled anything that foul since an eighteen-wheeler packed with live hogs overturned near my elementary school. My nostrils actually burned with the scents of decaying fish and ammonia. I sat up slowly, my body sluggish in the wake of the peaking sun. I felt as if I was swimming through molasses. I pressed a dirty sock against my nose, which frankly smelled a lot better than whatever was wafting through my house.</p> <p>\u201cAunt Jettie!\u201d I yelled. \u201cHas there been a septic-tank explosion?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the weird cotton-wool sensation of daylight consciousness inside my head, I padded toward the stairs. The smell was getting stronger. I steadied myself and resisted a strong urge to gag. I crept downstairs and checked the bathroom to make sure there hadn\u2019t been some sort of sewer mishap.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doing, honey?\u201d Jettie asked, appearing over my shoulder as I carefully took the lid off the toilet tank. \u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019re looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly. I\u2019m just trying to figure out where the stench of death is coming from. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken. What stench?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smell that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t smell anything. I don\u2019t have a nose,\u201d Aunt Jettie reminded me gently.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you got the better end of the deal.\u201d</p><p>I wandered toward the front door, my eyes watering as the smell took on a new hideous note with every step. It was coming from the porch. Fitz was waiting by the door, thumping his tail on the floor because he thought I was about to let him out. Obviously, whatever was out there, Fitz was desperate to roll in it. Considering the Great Dead Skunk Caper of 2002, this was not a good sign.</p><p>I put on the Jackie O sunglasses, a heavy raincoat of Aunt Jettie\u2019s, and a floppy straw hat and wrapped a scarf around my face. I pulled back the blackout curtains and hissed at the slap in the face even obscured noontime sunlight dealt me. I squinted through the light. I couldn\u2019t see any dead animals or toxic waste strewn across the lawn, but it did seem to get stronger the closer I got to the window glass. I snapped the curtain shut and backed away. Fitz whined and did the \u201clet me out to play\u201d dance.</p><p>I gently shoved him away from the door. \u201cSorry, buddy, I don\u2019t think they make doggie shampoo strong enough.\u201d</p> <p>There was no way I could leave the house to clean it up, so I was stuck. I went to the attic, the farthest point of the house away from the porch, and slept on an old velvet sofa. Well, I tossed and turned and kept a pillow clamped over my face.</p><p>When the sun finally set, I grabbed my car-wash supplies out of the garage and dragged the hose to the porch. There was a slimy, creamy yellow substance smeared on the front door, the banister, the porch swing, the railing, the boards of the porch itself. It smelled like burnt almonds and the orifice of a dead horse. Smashed against the front door was a weird-looking round hull the size of a volleyball. It looked like a spiky, greenish coconut.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of all that\u2019s holy is this?\u201d I wondered, holding the shell at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>I turned to see Zeb\u2019s car pulling to a stop in front of the house.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jolene sent me over with some flyers for the next FFOTU meeting.\u201d His head tilted at the curious object in my hand. \u201cWhere did you get\u2014mother of God!\u201d Zeb yelled. \u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think my front porch has been slimed or possibly defiled by a sea monster.\u201d I held up my fingers to show him the buttery yuck. \u201cI\u2019ve been trapped in the house all day while this stuff baked in the hot sun. I just wish I knew what this thing was, so I would know which haz-mat team to call.\u201d</p><p>A smug grin spread across Zeb\u2019s face, and he crossed him arms and leaned back in the porch swing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cCare to let me in on the joke?\u201d</p> <p>He examined his fingernails nonchalantly. \u201cI\u2019m just reveling in knowing something you don\u2019t. So, this is what it feels like ... to be the smartest person in the room. I like it. I feel all ... tingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, nudging the husk with his foot. \u201cThat\u2019s a durian. I saw it on the Travel Channel. That guy who thinks turtle gall bladders are a great lunch option swears they\u2019re a delicacy. He did a whole segment on them for his Indonesia episode. You know, people are seriously injured, even killed, by these things every year? They fall out of the trees when they\u2019re ripe, and splat . It\u2019s like having a spiny cannonball dropped on your skull.\u201d</p><p>Zeb sniffed. \u201cThe odor is so strong that Asian governments have banned them from subways, elevators, hotel rooms, basically any enclosed space where people can\u2019t escape the smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying your position as smart guy way too much,\u201d I told him. \u201cSo, someone brought stinky fruit all the way from Indonesia to play the world\u2019s cruelest olfactory joke on me? How do I get rid of it? Burn down the house?\u201d</p><p>Zeb rolled up his sleeves and held out his hands for a brush. \u201cA little elbow grease, some borax, perhaps a nuclear device.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, that\u2019s very helpful,\u201d I said, slapping the scrubbrush into his palm.</p><p>The smell did not come out. We scrubbed for hours to deslime the porch, but apparently the wood of River Oaks is very absorbent. The project did give us quality time to spend together not talking. I resisted my natural urge to jabber and just worked. Companionable silence was sort of nice. It felt mature.</p><p>Zeb finally broke when he realized that we\u2019d nearly scrubbed the paint off my porch but hadn\u2019t made a dent in the smell.</p><p>\u201cI think we made the smell angry,\u201d Zeb said, wrinkling his nose. \u201cThe good news is that we just happen to have intimate information of a personal nature about a certain vampire who knows how to obtain a pressure washer at eleven P.M.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, I hope you mean Dick,\u201d I said as he dialed his cell phone. \u201cAnd two, whatever intimate personal information you have about Dick, please don\u2019t share it with me.\u201d</p><p>We went inside for some cold drinks. Zeb stripped his shirt off, wiping the durian remains from his hands. \u201cYou know what, I have to say the whole unkempt-workman thing is a good look for you. You should go home to Jolene right now all sweaty and manly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I smell like ...\u201d He shuddered. \u201cI can\u2019t go home to Jolene like this. I\u2019m always telling her not to come home stinky after she\u2019s rolled in something dead.\u201d</p><p>I stretched out on the porch steps, flexing my tired legs. \u201cWait, you do mean in wolf form, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, looking at me as if I was the crazy one.</p><p>\u201cYour marriage is not like other marriages,\u201d I told him. \u201cSo, how are you guys? Have you adjusted to the whole twins thing yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d he said sheepishly.</p><p>I smirked. \u201cI usually am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much of a choice in the matter. The babies are on their way, so the best thing to do is just hold on and enjoy the ride. And when you think about it, it\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d he said, pausing to take a drink. \u201cBesides, Jolene\u2019s cousin Raylene is having triplets, so it could be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go.\u201d</p><p>Zeb wiped his forehead off and considered. \u201cThis stinky-fruit drive-by is a weird thing to do to someone. Do you think Gabriel did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t really Gabriel\u2019s style. This involves a certain whimsical malice that he lacks. Besides, he\u2019s not mad at me. He just can\u2019t seem to grasp why I\u2019m mad at him, which is infuriating. And even when he was mad at me, he was much more likely to lecture me sternly or give me a spanking than leave putrid fruit paste on my porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ignore the spanking reference,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo, who do you think is the fruit bomber?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cCould be some random person in town who doesn\u2019t like vampires. Could be a member of the Chamber of Commerce who has decided they don\u2019t want me there after all. Now, that\u2019s the place for whimsical malice. Heck, this could be Dick\u2019s idea of a hilarious practical joke to lift my spirits. It could be anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not comforting.\u201d Zeb said.</p><p>Or, I thought, it could be my mysterious pen pal, hoping I would be disoriented enough from lack of sleep and olfactory overdrive to stumble out of the house in full daylight to investigate the smell.</p><p>\u201cIt sucks to be this popular,\u201d I said, reaching into the front hall to pull out my purse. \u201cWhich is why I went to the scary sporting-goods store last night and bought this.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my new stun gun out of its holster and pressed the trigger, smiling as the arc of current connected between the two prongs.</p><p>\u201cYou bought a stun gun?\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy did you buy a stun gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to smell my porch again?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere\u2019s some stuff going on right now, Zeb. I need something for protection, and I lost the mace Gabriel gave me. And I lost Gabriel. I can\u2019t depend on anybody to protect me. I think we can agree that buying a gun would be much more likely to end in my shooting myself or innocent bystanders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a vampire! You have superstrength. I\u2019ve seen you kill someone with your bare hands. Well, there was a wooden stake in your bare hands. But still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like carrying this thing around with me, either, Zeb. You know me, I only resort to violent impulses when I feel I have no option\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019re cranky or startled, or your blood sugar is low, or you have a hangnail\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off with a glare. \u201cThis will keep me doing too much damage to the other person while still giving me enough time to get away. And this will keep me from getting my hands dirty or, you know, dusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re going to end up electrocuting yourself, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s highly likely,\u201d I conceded.</p><p>As if I didn\u2019t have enough odd, emotionally hamstrung men in my life, Emery Mueller started spending a lot of time at the shop. A lot of time. Enough time that I started to consider making up with Gabriel just so he could reach into Emery\u2019s brain and wipe out any memory he had of where the shop was located. It was a skill neither Dick nor I possessed.</p><p>After seeing that I would not be closing the shop after all, Emery claimed that he wanted to keep an eye on the \u201cfamily interests.\u201d So, he spent every night at the shop, annoying the hell out of Andrea with questions about her \u201calternative lifestyle.\u201d It appeared that he\u2019d developed a bit of a crush on my favorite blood surrogate and frequently asked her to join him at church. When she refused, he blamed it on the influence of her \u201cunfortunate choice of suitors\u201d and spent most of his time giving her the moon eyes. Andrea spent most of her time trying not to be creeped out by her boyfriend\u2019s great-great-grandson\u2019s advances.</p><p>How many women could say they had that problem?</p><p>Dick stopped showing up on Wednesday nights, claiming he was calling in sick for \u201cterminal disappointment.\u201d At least he offered an excuse. Mr. Wainwright just disappeared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emery became my own personal Mr. Collins, an irritating rash in human form. And just like the supercilious, socially inept minister from Pride and Prejudice, he got bolder with every visit. First, he asked to see a copy of his uncle\u2019s will, which I happily provided, along with copies of his uncle\u2019s bank statements at the time of his death. However, I started to get annoyed when Emery demanded copies of the current books for the shop, along with inventory lists, my own financial records, and a list of any books I may have taken from the shop. He commented on the number of sales per night, on the high overhead involved in the coffee bar. Then he took up residence behind the counter and casually went through drawers he had no business opening. The more time I spent with him, the less I wanted to give him. I felt the need to protect Mr. Wainwright\u2019s possessions from his sweaty, grasping hands.</p><p>\u201cDo you happen to know a woman named Jenny McBride?\u201d I asked after he requested the contact information for Mr. Wainwright\u2019s lawyer so he could set up an appointment with him. \u201cAbout yea tall, blond, judgmental?\u201d</p><p>Hey, considering that my sister was inadvertently in cahoots with Missy the psycho Realtor, I considered it a fair question. Emery\u2019s response was an expression both confused and constipated. For some reason, his not comprehending exactly how annoying his behavior was brought all of my repressed Gabriel-related anger to the surface. I felt the need either to slap Emery or warn him that I was about to slap him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m only looking after my uncle\u2019s legacy, Jane,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve made valiant attempts to organize the stock, but, to be honest, you\u2019ve only made a small dent in the problem. You have library experience, but that doesn\u2019t make you an expert on antique or rare occult books. Frankly, I don\u2019t think you know what you have here. You could let a priceless volume walk out of this store for a song and not even realize it. I think you should shut down for a few days and let me bring in an appraiser to look over the older stock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, Emery, since your uncle left that legacy to me, it\u2019s mine to sell if I want to, at any price,\u201d I said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m not legally bound to offer you anything beyond mementos from Mr. Wainwright\u2019s personal effects, but I\u2019m trying to be nice. Now, when I took over the shop, I got a new insurance policy. And I have estimates for the value of the stock. I\u2019ll give you copies of that, but as far as giving you a complete inventory or letting you have some outsider go through the stock title by title, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not going to be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Emery demanded, his face flushing an unpleasant shade of purple.</p><p>\u201cBecause I said no,\u201d I said in my \u201ctalking to preschoolers\u201d voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why you listen to every bit of advice Andrea and that Dick character give you, but you just write off everything I have to say. They don\u2019t have the vested family interest in the store that I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re my family,\u201d I shot back, tapping into my reservoir of Gabriel-related anger. \u201cAnd they spent more time with your uncle in the last months of his life than you did in the last ten years.\u201d</p><p>Emery blanched as if I\u2019d slapped him. \u201cI think I should go somewhere else before we say anything we\u2019re going to regret.\u201d</p><p>Emery made a show of slinking out the door with a kicked-puppy-dog expression.</p><p>Andrea poked her head out of the supply closet, where she\u2019d been hiding. \u201cYou got Emery to leave after less than an hour. Can you teach me how to do that?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, by \u201csomewhere else,\u201d Emery did not mean he was leaving the shop permanently. Oh, no, he stayed and stayed and ... stayed. He sat at the coffee bar and made moon eyes at Andrea. He hung around in the stacks, claiming to be looking for a few books that held special sentimental attachment for him. (I\u2019d hidden the books with the naked-lady-bump engravings.) He annoyed newly turned vampires by trying to get them to take religious tracts. Hell, even Cindy the Goth Mascot would turn and walk out if she saw Emery. She\u2019d gone four consecutive days without a latte. I was starting to worry.</p><p>For me, the breaking point was when Emery interrupted my reading yet another letter from my \u201cconcerned and vigilant friend,\u201d this one telling me how Gabriel had taken her from an innocent, sexually inexperienced girl to a strung-out love junkie by assuring her that he enjoyed her naivet\u00e9, her unpredictability.</p> <p>I remember feeling Emery standing over my shoulder as I read:</p><p>\u201cGabriel told me that he liked not knowing what I would do or say. He said my innocence was a refreshing change. I don\u2019t have to ask whether he said the same to you. He says this to all of the women he beds. He is as skilled at lying as he is at loving. His ability to manipulate emotions through just the right mix of sweetness and feigned overprotection is unparalleled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have there, Jane?\u201d Emery asked. I ignored him.</p><p>I remember Emery clearing his throat and holding his too-soft hand out imperiously, as if I was caught reading his mail. My upper lip pulled back from my teeth in what I considered a warning expression. But Emery was oblivious to it and the hostile tension that seemed to be rolling off me in waves. I remember turning my shoulder slightly, so my back was to him, and continuing to read. Emery\u2019s fingers closed over the top of the page and pulled it out of my hands. I think I had some sort of rage blackout, because I do not remember snarling and flashing my fangs so viciously that Emery ran out of the store. But Andrea said there was a small urine stain on the carpet to prove it, so I had to believe her.</p><p>Andrea and I both made elaborate and sadistic threats against Dick if he didn\u2019t take his great-great-grandson out for some quality time. Andrea\u2019s threats were far more effective, as they apparently involved refusal of certain \u201cprivileges.\u201d So, Dick took Emery out for an evening of bonding and bowling, practically by force. I hoped Emery would end up with a really embarrassing tattoo.</p><p>With the shop cleared of Emery\u2019s presence, I yelled, \u201cOK, Mr. Wainwright, you can come out now. It\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>He materialized, looking a little chagrined.</p><p>\u201cSo, what have you been up to?\u201d I asked cheerfully, then glared at him.</p> <p>\u201cJane, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I said, narrowing my gaze but eventually smiling despite myself. \u201cYou said Emery was eccentric and personality-free. You didn\u2019t tell me that he was ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn enormous pain in the rear?\u201d Mr. Wainwright suggested.</p><p>\u201cI was going to say \u2018infuriating pustule on the butt-cheek of humanity,\u2019 but yeah. He\u2019s driving me crazy! He questions every decision I make. He insinuates himself into conversations and situations that are none of his business. It\u2019s like hanging out with my mom, only without the loving part.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wainwright put his insubstantial hand on my shoulder. \u201cHe has that effect on people. I\u2019m surprised you lasted this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph. I just don\u2019t think I can let him come around the shop anymore, Mr. Wainwright. I mean, he\u2019s chasing customers away. I just got the place up and running, and he\u2019s killing sales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means, toss him out on his sanctimonious keister. It will be good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, I thought you had a Chamber of Commerce meeting tonight?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou have it marked on the calendar in the office with little skulls and crossbones. Really, you executed an amazing amount of detail with a Sharpie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI do have a meeting. But I really don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was so proud of your joining the chamber. I had no patience for that sort of thing, really. There were too many people involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere still are,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI really don\u2019t think the chamber is for me, after all, Mr. Wainwright. Those women are just\u2014well, they\u2019re just mean! They\u2019ve called every day for the last week to remind me that as the newest member, I am responsible for bringing at least three kinds of mild cheese, wheat crackers, and four bottles of California white. And I\u2019m supposed to submit weekly progress reports on how my quest for freebies is going. When I suggested that this was excessive, I was given five demerits. I don\u2019t even know what that means! There has to be something going on. Demon possession or a man-hating cult or\u2014ooh! Witches! They could be witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of obvious?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use logic on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, you\u2019re not a quitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s just not true.\u201d</p><p>Nice Courtney was the only chamber member who was happy to see me walking through the door with my basket of yuppie goodies.</p><p>\u201cJane, honey!\u201d she cried, breaking from the pack to greet me at the door of the chamber house and relieve me of my boozy burden. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. We just got another new member. You\u2019ve got to come meet her.\u201d</p><p>A blonde in a shell-pink twin set turned when Nice Courtney tapped her on the shoulder.</p><p>Jenny gasped. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell?\u201d I finished for her.</p><p>Jenny looked around furtively and dragged me into the foyer. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI joined last month. What are you doing here?\u201d I shot back.</p><p>\u201cI joined tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a business owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she shot back, handing me her business card.</p><p>\u201cWhat, so I started a business, and suddenly you have to start one? How transparent are you?\u201d</p><p>Jenny rolled her eyes. \u201cThis has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a hell of a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to start my own business for years, and now the boys are getting older. There\u2019s a huge market out there for people who would love to create a kind of memory craft but can\u2019t so much as cut a straight line. People like you. I\u2019m just making it a little more upscale. And technically, you didn\u2019t start one, you inherited it, just like you\u2019ve inherited everything else. The house, Missy\u2019s holdings, the shop\u2014is your long-term plan based on making friends with the elderly chamber members so they remember you in their wills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no elderly chamber members. The Courtneys sacrificed them to their evil god,\u201d I growled, ignoring the confused look on Jenny\u2019s face as she searched the room for a face over forty. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to take crap off someone who was trying to smuggle valuables out of my house in her craft bag.\u201d</p><p>Jenny protested, \u201cI wasn\u2019t stealing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call taking items that don\u2019t belong to you from someone else\u2019s home without their permission? Aggressive borrowing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to have this conversation with you now, Jane. You\u2019re being ridiculous. Look, no one here has to know that we\u2019re related,\u201d Jenny said, glancing around. \u201cWe can pretend not to know each other. You can be some person I don\u2019t know that well and don\u2019t want to spend time with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine, it\u2019ll be just like school. You stay on your side, and I\u2019ll stay on mine.\u201d I turned on my heel and rifled through my bag. \u201cWhere the hell is the wine?\u201d</p><p>I stuck my fingernail in the cork and used a tiny bit of vampire strength to pop it out. I did, however, manage to resist the urge to glug straight from the bottle and snagged a wineglass instead. Full glass in hand, I stomped off to find Nice Courtney. She gave me a questioning look as I took her wine glass and drained it. \u201cDo you two know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Head Courtney called the meeting into session. I stewed while Jenny was introduced and officially welcomed into the group. There was clapping and squealing and cooing. It was a noticeably warmer reception than what I received. They even gave her a little pink rose corsage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Typical.</p><p>My sister had decided to take her love of scrapbooking to another level. The scary level. She started a company called Elegant Memories, a personalized and customized scrapbooking service using specialty handmade papers made from the hairs of Turkish virgins or something. Of course, she was accepted into the fold like a Borg returning to the Collective.</p><p>The fact that I could correctly make a reference to the Borg was probably part of the reason I was not being accepted into the Collective.</p> <p>I spent most of the meeting plotting ways of getting Jenny out of the chamber. (Shaving her head came up, or telling Head Courtney that Jenny was a natural brunette. Somehow all of my solutions were hair-related.) And then I switched to trying to find ways of getting me out of the chamber, which was less productive, since I was interrupted by\u2014</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d Head Courtney repeated sternly.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked how the prize collections were going.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Head Courtney had sent me a strongly worded e-mail listing the acceptable prize options for the Fall Festival: gift baskets, gift certificates of no less than $100 each, vacation packages. Very few businesses (that were not chamber members) were willing to give up such treasures for what was essentially a children\u2019s carnival. So far, a doctor\u2019s office had given me oversized promotional pens advertising a drug for erectile dysfunction, and I\u2019d charmed a local beauty shop out of a gift certificate for a free lip waxing.</p> <p>\u201cNot well, actually. I managed to get a few things, but with the number of participants you\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s just not going to be enough. I was thinking maybe we need to change our focus for the carnival prizes. I was thinking we might aim for smaller items, so we would have plenty of small, inexpensive prizes instead of a few big prizes. Things like stuffed animals and candy, you know, things that kids would like to win.\u201d</p><p>Since this was supposedly a kids\u2019 carnival and all.</p><p>Head Courtney\u2019s lips pressed together in a tight, pissed-off line. \u201cJane, I must not have explained your assignment thoroughly enough in the repeated e-mails I sent you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I just think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Head Courtney snapped, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to think, I told you to gather prizes for the Fall Festival.\u201d</p><p>I had a brief, colorful fantasy of latching onto her neck and drinking her dry. But I reconsidered instantly. I\u2019d read somewhere that Botox turns the blood bitter and astringent. Instead, I smiled thinly and said, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of condescending.\u201d</p> <p>Head Courtney sniffed. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re not chamber material after all, Jane.\u201d</p><p>A way out! A way out!</p><p>I started to reach for my purse, \u201cIf you really feel that way ...\u201d</p><p>Toady Courtney stood up and whispered to Head Courtney, something along the lines of, \u201cBut none of us wants to do it, either.\u201d</p><p>Dang it.</p><p>Head Courtney cleared her throat. \u201cSince you\u2019re struggling with your very simple assignment, Jenny is going to be joining your committee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jenny cried.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I yelled. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJenny has the organizational and people skills necessary to complete the task.\u201d</p><p>Damned if she didn\u2019t have a point there.</p><p>Jenny spluttered. \u201cCourtney, I don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Jenny, new chamber members are expected to make sacrifices. You want to make a good impression, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-but-but,\u201d Jenny stammered.</p><p>OK, that made me giggle a little.</p><p>Nice Courtney leaned over and whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I assured her. \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>Jenny and I were assigned a meeting schedule, a color-coded chart to record our progress, and little pamphlets with suggestions on what phrases to use to wheedle, I mean, encourage donations. If we didn\u2019t collect at least two hundred items by the next meeting, we would both be given twenty demerits.</p><p>Eventually, I was going to have to ask Nice Courtney what that meant, exactly.</p><p>9</p><p>It\u2019s normal to \u201crelapse\u201d into old patterns. The important thing is to try to avoid hurting bystanders.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>I was not invited to the McClaine clan baby shower. After my participation in Zeb and Jolene\u2019s disastrous wedding events, I was considered a bit of an event jinx by Jolene\u2019s family. So, they held it at noon, outdoors, at the McClaine family farm.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if my absence made the party better or worse for Jolene.</p><p>Apparently, because the McClaines are such a fertile family, baby showers aren\u2019t so much gift-giving occasions but a recycling of the most recent babies\u2019 clothes, blankets, and so on, for the use of the new arrival. They do wrap the items for the new mother to open, though.</p><p>There was cake. There was a corsage of roses made from tiny baby socks. There were hostile cousins who still resented Jolene as the golden child of the pack, despite her humbling experience at her wedding rehearsal, when Zeb dumped her while under the influence of posthypnotic suggestion.</p><p>It\u2019s a long story.</p><p>As Jolene\u2019s pregnancy progressed, the McClaines had stepped up their campaign to keep Zeb and Jolene\u2019s home from being built. The pack had scared off every construction crew in three counties, showing up during the day to \u201csupervise\u201d the work. When the more obtuse crews didn\u2019t pick up on the subtle intimidation, the pack would use scary subliminal wolf behavior to scare them off\u2014prolonged stares, low growls, and, in one instance, peeing on a plumber\u2019s van. The Lavelle house was basically a concrete pad and some framework that had been up for so long it was starting to buckle under the elements. Jolene and Zeb had no choice but to hire Buster Dowdy, the laziest contractor in this end of the state. He frequently spent his billable hours at the site, in the back of his truck, drinking beer and napping.</p><p>The climax of the shower was a weird diaper-related shower game in which the prize was being allowed in the delivery room when Jolene\u2019s babies were born. Jolene had not been informed of this, and she vehemently protested when her cousin Lurlene, the current president of the We Hate Jolene Club, was named the lucky winner.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing!\u201d Jolene cried later, as she told me and Andrea how she tried to explain that watching her deliver twins wasn\u2019t something Jolene was willing to raffle off. We were an odd combination\u2014the vampire, the human, and the weeping werewolf. But it felt right, somehow, for us to be sitting in the trailer\u2019s tiny guest room, sorting through baby clothes and comforting Jolene. Andrea and I were now a safety net for her.</p><p>Jolene wailed, \u201cIt\u2019s not funny! They just do not get why I don\u2019t think that was a wonderful way to end the shower. Aunt Vonnie said that they were trying to help keep me from abandoning family tradition altogether, since my human husband is insisting I go to some silly hospital instead of having a home birth, like every other woman in the family for the last thirty generations. And then Lurlene got to pretend that her feelings were hurt because I wouldn\u2019t let her \u2018share\u2019 in this moment and \u2018help\u2019 me through labor. We both know damn good and well that Lurlene doesn\u2019t give two sniffs about being there\u2014 Stop laughing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I cried, trying to stifle the giggles that were so clearly pissing off the hormonally imbalanced and extremely swollen werewolf. \u201cIt\u2019s indignant laughter ... on your behalf.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sniffed as she tried to fold a tiny pink sleeper for the fourth time, finally bunching it into a ball and tossing it into a laundry basket. \u201cAnd then Mama said they had a surprise for me, and I thought, \u2018Oh, Lord, what now?\u2019 and they covered my eyes and led me across the pasture, and surprise! There\u2019s a brand-new trailer sitting there with \u2018The Lavelles\u201d already burned onto one of those little wooden porch signs? Mama said the family wanted to help me and Zeb, since they\u2019d heard how much trouble we\u2019d been having with building the new house. They took me inside, and it was so big.\u201d She looked around the cramped confines of the camper. \u201cIt was one of those big double-wides, with a gas fireplace and a master bathroom with separate shower. They already had it all decorated, and ...\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt was so pretty and new and clean. Did I mention it was new?\u201d</p><p>Andrea smiled gently and patted Jolene\u2019s hands. \u201cA few times. So, are you going to be moving in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jolene said, fully tearing up now. \u201cBecause then they showed me the nursery, and they already had it all set up. They\u2019d already picked out all this Noah\u2019s Ark stuff, quilts and a crib set and this big mural thing on the wall. I mean, they\u2019d done everything. And they hadn\u2019t even asked me. They never ask me. They always just assume that they\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for me. Aunt Vonnie started talking about how silly it was for me to want to move off the farm anyway, since I was going to need so much help with the babies, and how it would just be so much easier for everybody this way. And I realized it was never going to change. I\u2019d be stuck there, and they\u2019d just be constantly coming in without being invited and taking over everything and treatin\u2019 Zeb bad. And I lost it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly does \u2018lost it\u2019 mean?\u201d I asked, knowing full well that werewolf family arguments usually devolved into full-scale riot situations.</p><p>\u201cI told them no. For the first time, I really, completely, no doubt about it, said no. No to the nursery, no to the trailer, no to the little wooden sign. Just no. I told them I knew that the reason we were having so much trouble finishing the house was that they were scaring off all the contractors. I told them I wasn\u2019t going to move back to the farm ever, no matter what they did. I told them they\u2019d be lucky if Zeb and I told them when we were going to the hospital to have the babies, much less allowed them to barge into the delivery room. I told them I would raise my babies how I saw fit and that if they wanted to visit after the twins were born, they would have to call before coming over, otherwise we weren\u2019t answering the door.\u201d</p><p>Andrea\u2019s jaw was hanging freely at this point. All I could do was mouth, \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed. \u201cYeah. And Mama burst into tears. Aunt Lola kept asking everybody what I really meant. Aunt Vonnie said that if I felt that way, then she guessed I didn\u2019t want their shower gifts. I told Aunt Vonnie to take her used Diaper Genie and shove it up her ass sideways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d I said, putting an arm around her shoulders. \u201cI know that was hard. But I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Andrea nodded. \u201cAnd it certainly explains why your shower haul is so skimpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take anything.\u201d Jolene sniffed, wiping at her cheeks. \u201cI just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis whole situation sucks now, but it\u2019s going to do you a lot of good in the long run. I\u2019m sure Zeb will appreciate not having to live on the farm,\u201d I said, rubbing Jolene\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never understood why people pick Noah\u2019s Ark for a nursery theme anyway,\u201d Andrea said breezily, folding a tiny pair of socks.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d I snorted. \u201cI mean, who wants reminders of a natural disaster, literally of biblical portions, on their baby\u2019s walls? What are you supposed to say, \u2018Oh, drowning sinners, isn\u2019t that precious?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked up at me through glassy eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear that a lot.\u201d</p><p>My concerned and vigilant friend\u2019s letters increased in frequency. Once a week, then twice a week. It was creepy. And they rarely varied from the theme of Gabriel hurt me, he\u2019ll hurt you. He made promises to me. Ruined me forever. You\u2019re a big fat idiot for trusting him.</p><p>OK, that last part was implied.</p><p>One night, I sat at the shop counter, sorting through them as Dick sipped an Americano and read a Tales from the Darkside comic. I tried to divide the letters into piles, based on threat level. But I kept getting the \u201cI hate him,\u201d \u201cI love him,\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019ll hurt you\u201d piles mixed up with the larger \u201cI can make your life a living hell if you don\u2019t listen to me\u201d pile. I sighed and rubbed my eyes. There was also a disturbingly large pile of photos of yours truly taken with a telephoto lens. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frankly, it was at times like this that I missed Gabriel\u2019s overprotective caveman tendencies. Even if it insulted my feminist sensibilities, it was sort of nice knowing someone was out there watching my back. Going through this without him made me feel incredibly alone, even though I\u2019d told Dick and Andrea. Going home alone each night, being unsure of what was waiting for me there, was weighing on my nerves.</p><p>I muttered, \u201cFor a stalker, this chick is all over the place. She\u2019s angry and focused in one letter and erotomanic the next. Or at least, I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s erotomanic for the sake of my pride.\u201d</p><p>Dick\u2019s face was blank. \u201cErotomanic? That sounds sexy in a way that\u2019s ... not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt means someone believes they\u2019re in a relationship with someone, but that person usually isn\u2019t aware that their so-called lover exists. You have your basic I-want-to-become-famous-by-killing-someone-famous fellas. And there are the delusionals, the ones who think Ryan Seacrest is sending them secret love messages through the television. The most dangerous ones are the people who actually know you, whom you run across in your everyday routine, because the people around you really don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re lying when you say you\u2019re not involved with your stalker. Hence my confusion. Gabriel could be the victim of a stalker, or he could be a plain old cheater. But since he\u2019s acting more like a cheater than a victim ... What?\u201d I asked when I caught the befuddled expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou read up on stalking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had someone paint \u2018Bloodsucking Whore\u2019 on my car a year ago. It merited a Google.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Dick said, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cI think the very word stalking implies that you\u2019re not supposed to like it. Otherwise, it would be called \u2018fluffy harmless observation time,\u2019\u201d I said, chewing my lip. \u201cAnd, considering that this woman might be dangerous, I don\u2019t know whether to warn Gabriel, which would mean I would actually have to talk to him. Or just let whatever\u2019s going to happen happen to him, because a tiny part of me thinks he deserves it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know my vote, Stretch,\u201d Dick said, turning his attention back to his comic.</p><p>I think the stalking talk made Dick uneasy, because he didn\u2019t want to leave the shop that night until I was safely tucked in Big Bertha. But he had what he would only call \u201cspecial plans\u201d with Andrea, and I needed to stay late to go over some Internet orders, so he had no choice.</p><p>Around one A.M., I put the stacks of letters in my purse and headed out the rear staff entrance. As I pushed the key into the deadbolt, I saw a dark male shape reflected behind me in the glass. Even if I hadn\u2019t seen it, I would have felt him. My keenly developed sense of paranoia was a wide-open channel to the towering male presence.</p><p>I snaked my hand into my purse and ran my fingers along the leather stun-gun holster. I felt the body behind me advance, so I turned, whipping the stun gun out and proceeding to shock the ever-loving hell out of my ex-boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d Gabriel screamed as the current shot through his body, dropping him to the concrete like a sack of potatoes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d I yelled as the current made his torso arch off the ground. I may or may not have held it to his chest a teensy bit longer than absolutely necessary.</p> <p>\u201cS-stop sh-shocking m-m-me!\u201d Gabriel grunted through chattering teeth.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, pulling the stun gun away to let it cool off.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have a stun gun?\u201d he demanded, hefting himself off the ground.</p><p>\u201cBecause people have been sneaking up behind me,\u201d I said, glaring at him. \u201cHonestly, why would you surprise the most spastic person you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d do something to avoid talking to me if you saw me coming,\u201d he said, dusting himself off. \u201cAnd what do you mean, people keep sneaking up behind you? Are you all right? Has someone been bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you. When you know someone will try to evade you if you try to talk to them, that\u2019s called a hint. You need to learn to interpret social cues. And sarcasm, but that\u2019s not exactly urgent to the situation at hand. Why are you here? I haven\u2019t heard from you for weeks, and you show up now? What do you want, Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Despite the tiny crack that made in the hard cement shell I\u2019d built around my heart, I kept my teeth gritted together, my tone flat and unaffected. \u201cHow sad for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d he said again, backing me against the shop door. The cold of the glass and the remaining images of that horrible Victorian corpse dream were the only weapons I had to battle against the smoky comfort of his scent, the weight of his hands on my arms.</p><p>I pushed him back, without any real heat. \u201cThat\u2019s not really my problem. And you don\u2019t miss me, you\u2019re checking up on me because you don\u2019t trust me to take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you. I miss your laugh and your voice, and I even miss your insults.\u201d He smiled, wistful, tracing the lines of my fingers with his own, up my arm to stroke the edge of my collarbone.</p><p>\u201cLook, about opening night,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou said some really hurtful things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re way better at them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk later. Right now, please, just admit it, you miss me,\u201d he said, pressing me to the glass again, using exactly the right parts to do the pressing. I didn\u2019t answer. Because, frankly, I was doing very well to stay upright and clothed at this point. Bastard.</p><p>As his mouth pressed ever so softly against mine, I forced my lips shut to keep from shouting that yes, I missed him. Yes, having his hands on me made me feel more settled than I had in weeks. Yes, his grinding me against the door was absolute heaven, and if he did it slightly to the left, it would mean the end of a disturbingly long waking-orgasm dry spell. Fortunately, Gabriel started biting my lips, which limited my speaking options even further.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s fingers stroked up my throat, trailing the tips along my jaw and into my hair. He ground his mouth down on mine, drinking in my groans as I pulled blindly at his lapels.</p><p>This was just not fair.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded between kisses. \u201cTell me you miss me.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. His brows drew together as I felt him slide what I called my \u201csensible shopkeeper\u201d skirt over my hips. His fingers slid over my panties, drawing little circles against my skin through the damp material. His hand glided over my thighs, to peel away my panties. He tucked them in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said again, pumping one and then two fingers inside me with aching slowness.</p><p>My head slid back against the glass as my vision seemed to blur. Gah! He wasn\u2019t letting me think. If I was about anything, it was the thinking. His thumb glided over my oversensitive flesh, then plucked it like a guitar string, sending a thrumming wave along my nerve endings. I whimpered.</p><p>\u201cYou can lie to me, Jane, but your body can\u2019t. I can feel how much you\u2019ve missed me, how much you want me right now.\u201d Keeping my eyes locked with his own, he brought his fingers to his lips and tasted me. He smiled. \u201cJust as much as I want you.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped as I watched him lick his fingers clean. Screw thinking.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d I whispered, hating myself as I felt his lips curve against my neck. I slid my hand between us and fumbled with Gabriel\u2019s belt buckle. Gabriel\u2019s own hand slipped along my rib cage, cupping my breast. He bent his head to press teasing little kisses over the thin fabric of my blouse before closing his mouth over my nipple.</p><p>I dropped my bag so I could slip my hands around Gabriel\u2019s neck and pull him closer. The contents spilled around his feet as he cupped his hands under my butt and hitched me higher. His kiss was the center of my universe. Without it, I would go spinning off course into the dark, seeing nothing, feeling nothing.</p><p>Through the haze in my head, I heard the faint slide of a zipper and locked my legs around his hips, crossing my ankles at the small of his back.</p><p>I grabbed the lowest rung of the fire-escape ladder for leverage as I began the long, slow slide onto him. I threw my head back, gasping, and nearly came right there. I let go of the ladder and twisted my hands in Gabriel\u2019s hair, yanking his head back, claiming his mouth with lips, fangs, and tongue. This was mine. He was mine.</p><p>I clutched at his shoulders, arching my hips in time with his. A stream of promises, profanities, and pleas poured from Gabriel\u2019s mouth against my skin. I cupped the back of his head, cradling his face against mine. I closed my eyes, inhaled his scent, and smiled, even when his fangs extended and scraped lightly across my collarbone.</p><p>If he kept doing that, keeping his mouth in sync with his movements\u2014</p><p>I howled and put my dizzying dream orgasms to shame. I writhed and convulsed around him, pulling him tight against me with all the strength I had. I may, at some point, have said some extremely dirty things in Portuguese.</p><p>Gabriel was smiling, a big, goofy grin wreathing his face as he came, as if my muttering anatomically detailed instructions in foreign tongues was some sort of gift. And for some reason, that made me laugh, which resulted in some interesting aftershocks.</p><p>Gabriel was triumphant. \u201cAnd to think you were this sweet, inexperienced librarian when I met you.\u201d He panted, pushing my hair out of my face. \u201cNow look at you, you\u2019re a goddess. You can bring me to my knees with a word.\u201d</p><p>I blinked owlishly at him. Something about that sounded familiar and wrong. Something about Gabriel. The letters, in the letters, she\u2019d said that Gabriel had enjoyed educating her from innocent to\u2014</p><p>Just as I was able to cobble a coherent thought together, Gabriel glanced down at the contents of my purse and dropped me on my barely covered butt. I would say it was undeserved, but I had just Tased him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he demanded, pointing to the linen envelopes as I scrambled to my feet.</p><p>\u201cYou dropped me,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dropped me!\u201d I repeated. \u201cOn my ass, just then. You may not have noticed, which I\u2019m starting to think may be part of our problem as a couple.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel dropped to his knees to look at the envelopes. \u201cJane, answer me. What are these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetters,\u201d I told him, plucking the papers off the concrete before he could grab them.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been writing to you?\u201d</p><p>And there it was, confirmation. My concerned friend wasn\u2019t just some crazy person with an affection for linen paper. She wasn\u2019t making up her connection to Gabriel. Gabriel knew who she was, and obviously, he didn\u2019t want me getting information from her.</p><p>I had two options here: calmly and rationally discuss my feelings of confusion and abandonment and encourage Gabriel to enter couples counseling with me ... or pitch a tantrum, demand information, and make a giant ass of myself.</p><p>Any guesses about the route I chose?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I seethed. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get to breeze back into my life, after weeks without a word, pin me to a wall with your penis, and then demand answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not demanding answers. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she, Gabriel? Tell me what\u2019s going on. This would be so much easier if you would just let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t tell you. What has she\u2014 Do you believe what she\u2019s saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe, Gabriel. I mean, she\u2019s saying some things that sound pretty familiar. Her scent is what drew you to her. It\u2019s what kept you close to her. That she was special. That you loved her. That you enjoyed her being so trainable and unpredictable, particularly in the sack. Do you know where I might have heard any of this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d he promised, edging away from me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s not what I think?

I grabbed his arm and screamed, \u201cLook at me!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face in the moonlight was a mask of misery, the shadows against his bone-white skin sharp and stark. I didn\u2019t have to be a mind reader to see that he wanted to disappear.</p><p>\u201cThis is your handiwork, Gabriel. This neurotic mess of a vampire standing here. You made me what I am. I hope you\u2019re proud.\u201d</p> <p>Looking as if he\u2019d been kicked in the gut, Gabriel backed away from me into the shadows. Hot, bloody tears spilled down my cheeks as I shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t come back! Don\u2019t watch my house. Don\u2019t come by. Don\u2019t call me. Just stay away!\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s silver-gray eyes reflected back at me in the dark. I could hear his footsteps on the pavement as he walked briskly away from me without another word.</p><p>Somehow, it seemed so much worse than the first time. I sank to my knees, crying until my eyes ran dry. I cried until I was embarrassed to be crouched in an alleyway, shedding tears for someone who obviously didn\u2019t care enough to shed them for me. I pulled myself together, grabbing my purse and straightening my rumpled clothes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d I sniffled, looking around. \u201cWhere\u2019s my underwear?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to be that friend who shows up at your door with raccoon eyes and hysterics, complaining about her love life.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t wear mascara.</p><p>Andrea opened her door, wearing Dick\u2019s \u201cVirginia Is for Lovers\u201d T-shirt and no pants, drinking a Budweiser from the can. A Wrestlemania highlights DVD was playing in the background.</p><p>\u201cBaby, who is it?\u201d Dick asked, coming out of the kitchen, wearing one of those beer-drinking helmets, jeans, and no shirt.</p><p>\u201cI take it back, you are not the same woman I met a year ago,\u201d I told Andrea.</p><p>Andrea burped noiselessly under her breath. \u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything OK, Stretch?\u201d Dick asked, taking off the helmet. He didn\u2019t, however, bother to turn down the wrestling match. Apparently, someone was about to shave Vince McMahon\u2019s head again.</p> <p>Andrea rolled her eyes at him and turned the TV off. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Jane?\u201d I tried to ignore the unsaid \u201cthis time\u201d that hung in the air.</p><p>I opened my mouth, but I just couldn\u2019t find the words to express the mishmash of frustration and plain old mad I had spinning through my head. I moved my lips. I narrowed my eyes. I made angry hand gestures. But no words came out. I started to pace, gnawing my fingernails to the quick. Fortunately, they grew back almost instantly, which meant I had an endless supply.</p><p>Andrea stopped me in my tracks by grabbing my shoulders. \u201cOK, sweetheart, I\u2019m all for nonverbal forms of communication, but you\u2019re starting to look like an extremely pissed-off mime. Use your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI Tased Gabriel!\u201d I blurted.</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d Dick shouted. Andrea shot him an annoyed look. \u201cRight, sorry.\u201d Dick tried to look remorse-stricken, but the minute Andrea\u2019s back was turned, he gave me an enthusiastic double thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with a stun gun?\u201d Andrea cried. \u201cAnd how long have I been working in close proximity to you and said stun gun without my knowledge?\u201d</p><p>I threw my hands up, exasperated. \u201cWhy is everyone so surprised that I have a stun gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen you staple your hand to a purchase order,\u201d Andrea told me.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t return the damn thing now. I used it. On Gabriel. Why can\u2019t I get a reaction on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, why did you zap Gabriel?\u201d Dick asked, his eyes gleaming. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to go into details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe snuck up behind me, and I just zapped him. It was an accident. At first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Dick crowed.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I had sex with him,\u201d I said, grimacing. \u201cBut just a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the kitchen,\u201d Dick said, beating a hasty retreat to another beer.</p><p>\u201cAnd then he dropped me!\u201d I cried, burying my face in my hands.</p><p>Andrea gasped. \u201cHe broke up with you? Again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he literally dropped me, on my ass, on the concrete!\u201d</p><p>Dick turned on his heel and flopped onto the couch. \u201cI can stay a little while.\u201d</p><p>Andrea gave him a silencing glare and patted my shoulder. \u201cSo, you had a little accidental sex, big deal. It\u2019s like falling off the wagon. I\u2019ll just take away your thirty-day Gabriel-free chip, OK? Wait, you didn\u2019t stun him again afterward, did you? Is that why he dropped you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I dropped my purse, and a bunch of the creepy letters fell out. Gabriel saw them and asked if \u2018she\u2019 was writing to me. Which means that this isn\u2019t just some random crazy. This is someone from his past, someone who sent him into some sort of Shirley MacLaine in Terms of Endearment -style panic at the idea of her communicating with me. And you know what pisses me off?\u201d</p><p>Andrea nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve got some idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just runs off, skulks away like some thief in the night. He gets me all riled up and angry, and then he leaves me all this crap to deal with, with no help from him. It\u2019s like a relationship hit-and-run.\u201d I cleared my raw, aching throat and looked up into my friend\u2019s pitying eyes. \u201cAndrea, I never thought to ask you directly, because I just assumed you would tell me. But just in case you\u2019re trying to protect him or something ... could you tell me\u2014do you know who Jeanine is? I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s my \u2018concerned and vigilant friend.\u2019 The letters say that he made her, but maybe I\u2019m being too literal. Or maybe she\u2019s just lying out her ass. Is it possible that she\u2019s Gabriel\u2019s sire? Because he won\u2019t share that story, either.\u201c</p><p>\u201cJeanine\u2019s not Gabriel\u2019s sire,\u201d Dick blurted out, clearly without thinking. And when Andrea and I turned our attention on him, he muttered, \u201cAw, crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick, who\u2019s Jeanine?\u201d Andrea asked.</p><p>Dick sighed, rubbing his hand over his face. \u201cThis is one of those \u2018it\u2019s better if I keep my big mouth shut\u2019 situations, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, damn it, Dick,\u201d I moaned. \u201cNot you, too.\u201d</p><p>Andrea\u2019s lips pursed. She crawled into his lap and made a pouty face. Dick groaned. We both knew he was powerless against Andrea\u2019s pouty face, or, really, any face that Andrea made. \u201cOK, fine, if you won\u2019t tell us who she is, tell us who she isn\u2019t. How do you know Jeanine is not Gabriel\u2019s sire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Gabriel\u2019s sire was a woman named Jessica,\u201d Dick blurted out as if he\u2019d been dosed with truth serum. He had the sense to look chagrinned but buckled when Andrea kissed his earlobe. He cleared his throat. \u201cIrish gal, sort of snooty. And she was, is ... not very nice. They met at a party hosted by my parents. I don\u2019t know how she found the party or how she chose Gabriel. But she led him away from the party into a cotton crib, had her lascivious way with him, and bit him. She didn\u2019t give him the choice. We didn\u2019t have the rules we do now. Back then, no vampire would say a word if you didn\u2019t necessarily wait for written permission to turn someone. Jessica thought Gabriel would be amusing, but she got bored waiting for him to rise. She had, well, has, a really short attention span. She walked off without thinking about what might happen if he was discovered or got hit with sunlight while he was still sleeping it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was turned against his will?\u201d I shuddered, imagining the torture such a violation would incur today. Eager to keep up a pleasant, harmless public image for vampires, the Council for the Equal Treament of the Undead enforced strict laws against forcibly turning humans. The punishment included the Trial, a combination of sunlight, silver, and sometimes a coffin full of bees, a veritable trifecta of capital punishment.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s more like she bit him and made him an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse,\u201d Dick said. \u201cHe caught up to her during WWII, feeding on orphans lodged in the English countryside. When he saw her again, when he saw what a monster she was\u2014as much as he resented her abandonment, being left to figure out this vampire thing all by himself, he knew he probably would have grown cruel and bloodthirsty with Jessica. He was grateful that he was left alone. But he knows that his turning out so ass-numbingly dull was all a matter of chance. That\u2019s part of the reason he felt he had such a responsibility to you. He wants you to have the right sort of influence, to become all that you can be, and all that.</p><p>\u201cStretch, I\u2019ve known Gabriel my whole life. For him to get this worked up over something, to put you through all this, he\u2019s got to have your best interests at heart. Just hold on for a while, let him work it out for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you two patch things up, I won\u2019t have to hear the pair of you whining all the damn time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pair of us?\u201d I asked suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking to him, too? Damn it, Dick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agreed you wouldn\u2019t speak to the enemy camp!\u201d Andrea yelled.</p><p>\u201cAll I did was go over to his house and threaten to kick his ass on your behalf,\u201d Dick said defensively. \u201cIt was after the store opening, and when I saw how hurt you were, I couldn\u2019t stand it. I went over there and told him he was getting the beat-down he\u2019d deserved since 1878. And then he cried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cried?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dick\u2019s teeth ground together, his expression disgusted. \u201cYes! He took all the fun out of it. How am I supposed to kick a man\u2019s ass when he\u2019s bawling like a baby? It was horrifying. I found myself comforting the jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI told him that whatever he was going through, you were worth\u2014 No! No, I am not going to do this,\u201d Dick said, standing and waving the pair of us off. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get caught in the middle of all this. And Gabriel swore me to secrecy ... which puts me right in the middle of this. Dang it, he\u2019s better than I thought.\u201d He pulled his beer hat back into place and yelled, \u201cI am Switzerland, do you hear me? Completely neutral. Work this stuff out yourselves. Now, could everybody please be quiet, so I can watch Macho Man Randy Savage beat the crap out of somebody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Dick\u2014\u201d Andrea cried.</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d Dick shot back, turning back to the wrestling match with a determined air.</p><p>Andrea and I watched Dick with bemused expressions. \u201cThat\u2019s my boyfriend,\u201d Andrea said, sort of meekly.</p><p>\u201cAt least yours didn\u2019t drop you on your ass,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>10</p><p>The best way to get over a messy break-up is to spend time with a supportive group of friends. The best way to chase off a supportive group of friends is to talk constantly about your messy break-up.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>To say I had some pent-up anger would be like saying Britney Spears had minor impulse-control issues. Love Bites encouraged me to channel those emotions in a positive direction, so I decided to pay Zeb\u2019s contractor a visit.</p><p>The minute there was enough twilight shadow for me to move unscathed to the future site of Casa Lavelle, I ran through the trees at full speed. Zeb said that Buster, who was known for high-quality carpentry work before his interest in a perpetual buzz outstripped his desire for a growing clientele, took off at exactly five P.M. every day, leaving a pile of empty beer cans in his wake.</p><p>The battered green Dowdy Construction truck was parked in the shade of a huge elm tree, where Jolene had talked about hanging a tire swing for the kids. Buster was dozing with his mouth open, his old faded Cardinals cap perched over his eyes. Long and lanky, he looked like a young Don Knotts, complete with droopy eyes and a twitchy lip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow the construction site looked even more depressing than the last time I\u2019d been there. The place was haunted by the ghost of \u201csupposed to be.\u201d Chalk outlines showing where the interior framework was supposed to be situated had long since faded into pale scribbles. Sitting in what was supposed to be the living room, a roll of insulation looked as if it was molding from exposure to the rain. Frayed plastic sheeting that was supposed to be protecting the framework flapped shroudlike in the breeze.</p><p>It looked as if Buster unpacked his tools every day and did just enough to make it look as if he was working, without making any actual progress. I stared at the sleeping Buster, my lip curled back. I let my fangs fully extend. This man had kept my friends dangling for months. He\u2019d made Jolene cry. This was not going to be a happy meeting for him.</p><p>With one lithe, soundless spring, I hopped into the back of the truck and sat on the lip of the bed. I cleared my throat and hollered, \u201cBuster!\u201d startling him into consciousness.</p> <p>\u201cWha!\u201d he shouted, sitting up. \u201cWhassat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up, Buster, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebbie?\u201d He yawned, scratching his head and blinking in the low purpling light of the setting sun. \u201cHoney, I told you, I\u2019m sorry I said that about your sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>Buster\u2019s eyes slowly came into focus, and he realized that I was not his angry live-in girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, Jane,\u201d he said, yawning again. \u201cWhassup?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need to talk about your timeline for completing the house, Buster. I mean, walls painted, hardware on cabinets, light switches screwed in place, everything. What\u2019s your ETA?\u201d</p><p>Buster cleared his throat and tried to use his \u201cprofessional\u201d voice. \u201cWell, it\u2019s hard to say. So much of that depends on when I can get materials and extra guys out here to do some of the work. I\u2019m just one person, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Buster. What month are you aiming for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, the McClaines explained it all to me,\u201d Buster said in a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cThey want Zeb and Jolene to give up on the house by the holidays. Jim McClaine even promised me a bonus if I could get them to move back in with Jolene\u2019s parents before her due date.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled loudly through my nostrils. One day, when Jolene\u2019s hormone levels were normal, we were going to have a long talk about her dad.</p><p>\u201cThe McClaines aren\u2019t bankrolling this project,\u201d I told him. \u201cI am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what Jim\u2014gak!\u201d Buster yelped as I yanked him up by the collar and pulled him out of the truck and into the barely framed house. Still holding his shirt, I hoisted him against the strongest of the wooden ribs and pinned him by the throat. Normally, I would be nervous around this much exposed, fractured wood, but Buster was too frightened to think about staking me. \u201cListen to me, Buster, look at me. Really look at me.\u201d</p><p>He spluttered and coughed, taking in the too-bright eyes, the pale skin, the fading light glistening off long, sharp fangs. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a vampire. I\u2019m a vampire going through a really rough emotional transition. And Zeb and Jolene are among the few people in my life who don\u2019t piss me off right now, so I\u2019d like to keep them happy. If that means checking up on you every day, beating the tar out of you to make sure you\u2019re sober and doing the work you promised, I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d</p><p>I dropped him to his feet, and he promptly sank to the ground like a sack of potatoes. \u201cBut the McClaines\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McClaines have told you it\u2019s in your best interest not to finish the house. Don\u2019t worry about that. Right now, I think you need to decide which of us scares you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do the work that I used to do,\u201d he mumbled, rubbing at his reddened throat.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the drinking? Well, consider me your own personal recovery program. The steps are, you build my friends\u2019 house\u2014on time and in good condition\u2014and then you get to keep all of your limbs. Sound fair?\u201d</p><p>Buster nodded, mute with fear. He sobered considerably as we went room to room in the shell of the house, discussing what would have to be redone, how long each phase should take. By the time I was ready to leave, Buster seemed almost excited about coming back the next day. Or, at least, excited to keep all of his limbs.</p><p>\u201cBright and early tomorrow, Buster,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd if Zeb or Jolene asks, we didn\u2019t have this conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Buster\u2019s smile was stiff, as if he couldn\u2019t remember how to be a \u201cpeople pleaser\u201d and was working to recall the skill. \u201cWhat conversation?\u201d</p><p>Eventually, Mama found the shop. The bad news was that Mama found the shop in time for the first meeting of the reconstituted chapter of the Friends and Family of the Undead.</p><p>The good news was that seeing that many vampires gathered in one place freaked Emery out so badly that he found an excuse for leaving just a few minutes after he walked in. Maybe we could hold the monthly FFOTU meetings every week ...</p><p>The FFOTU used to meet at the Traveler\u2019s Bowl, a restaurant featuring healthy \u201cglobal\u201d cuisine that spiraled into bankruptcy, not just because the owners tried to sell soy cheese to Hollow residents but because the police seized all of the \u201cglass sculptures\u201d they sold at the restaurant gift shop. It took Police Chief Don Parker several visits to recognize that they were bongs and not very complicated ashtrays. Unfortunately, it only took his son, DJ, one visit. Once you sell a bong to the offspring of a small-town police chief, it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that anyone who so much as pauses in your parking lot will be ticketed. With their handful of customers scared off, the owners had no choice but to close.</p><p>The support group consisted of twenty or so people of all races, ages, and socioeconomic classes, all of whom were bonded through the shock of knowing that (1) a loved one had died, and (2) that loved one still walked around and sometimes had violent episodes. Plus, there\u2019s the embarrassment and stigma that can come with being associated with the undead in a small rural town like the Hollow, where vampires still occasionally suffered household \u201caccidents\u201d involving pointy wooden objects. It helped new vampires and their families to be able to meet in a safe location just to talk or vent or learn that your newly turned son is not avoiding Sunday dinners because he doesn\u2019t love you anymore but because you serve said dinners with the good silver and he can no longer digest solid food.</p><p>The group operated under guidelines that were a mishmash of Alcoholics Anonymous and PFLAG. We did not reveal our last names. Personal information revealed during the meetings was confidential. We were not required to disclose whether we were vampire or human. But after a few meetings, you figured out who was eating the snacks and who wasn\u2019t. The common ground was that each member hurt. Each offered understanding and sympathy to the other members. Each tried to keep a sense of humor.</p><p>Zeb and Jolene actually met at an FFOTU meeting. Jolene was still recovering from the dusting of her recently turned childhood friend, and Zeb was still weirded out by my new dietary habits. Zeb brought me into the group a few months later.</p><p>The meeting started out well enough. I\u2019d set up complimentary drinks and snacks around the \u201clounging area\u201d as a sort of welcome gesture. I\u2019d even invited Cindy in the hopes of giving her some resources to deal with her awkward family situation. I gave her the usual latte, and she sat in the back, not attempting to socialize with anyone.</p><p>All of the regulars I\u2019d come to know were there, including DeeDee, the de facto leader of the group. DeeDee\u2019s banker husband was voluntarily turned in the midst of a midlife crisis. Instead of buying a sports car or having an affair, he decided he wanted to stop the aging process altogether. She\u2019d felt pressured to be turned herself, aging a little every day while her husband remained forever forty-seven. In the end, she had elected to remain human, and her husband left her. She was now dating a very nice accountant who fainted at the sight of blood. But she stuck around to help other people through the transition and welcomed new members to the group. And the newest addition to the group was my mother.</p><p>Stupid grocery-store community board.</p><p>I turned my back for two seconds, and there was Mama, carrying a plate of brownies and wearing a black T-shirt with the vampire rights logo on it. And a name tag that she\u2019d brought from home that said, \u201cHello, my name is: Jane\u2019s Mama!\u201d</p><p>Was it too late to change my name?</p><p>I turned on my heel, hoping to escape the room, possibly get as far as Borneo, before I heard, \u201cJanie! Baby! It\u2019s Mama!\u201d</p><p>Cringing, I turned back to where Mama had DeeDee in an arm-lock and was dragging her over to me.</p><p>\u201cNow, DeeDee, this is my daughter, Jane. She was turned last year! This is her shop, isn\u2019t it wonderful? I\u2019m just so proud!\u201d Mama cooed. \u201cJane, this is DeeDee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mama, I\u2019ve known her for a while,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMiss DeeDee, would you please excuse us for a second?\u201d</p><p>DeeDee winked at me and made her way to the bar to get a free latte.</p><p>\u201cI love your little shop, honey!\u201d Mama cooed, walking me around the lounge area like a show dog and mouthing a breathless hello to every person we bumped into. \u201cI just love what you\u2019ve done with it. The colors and the chairs and all the pretty little knickknacks. Did Andrea pick all this out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, that would be me. I did this,\u201d I informed her.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s lovely, but I probably would have gone a little lighter on the wall color. You know, Jenny says if you paint a room too dark, it\u2019s like losing ten percent of your square footage. You might have called her and asked her advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since my lawyer has advised me against speaking to her without a transcriptionist present, that might have been difficult,\u201d I said, smiling sweetly.</p><p>\u201cOh, now you\u2019re just being silly.\u201d She sighed and then saw Jolene and Zeb come through the front door. Zeb saw Mama and turned on his heel, trying to usher Jolene out for a quick escape. But there was no escape. This was the Thunderdome of parental intrusion. \u201cZeb! Oh, honey, come see what Jane\u2019s done with the shop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, he\u2019s seen it,\u201d I told her. \u201cHe\u2019s been here before. In fact, he helped me paint. I appreciate that you\u2019re being so supportive, but could you be a little less, I don\u2019t know, forceful about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Mama sniffed and then launched herself at an unsuspecting Jolene for non-consensual belly rubbing.</p><p>Andrea smirked at me. I glared at her. \u201cAm I naked? Normally, when I have this dream, I look down and I\u2019m naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s terrible. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Andrea said, barely able to control the twitching corners of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terribly, terribly sorry,\u201d Andrea promised, a snicker escaping when she turned her back to fetch a bottle of hazelnut syrup.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just humoring me because I sign the checks, aren\u2019t you? I would say I don\u2019t need your pity, but obviously, that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Zeb joined me at the bar, having abandoned his wife to Mama\u2019s pregnancy interrogation, the coward. Zeb gave me a sympathetic shoulder squeeze. \u201cI meant to tell you. DeeDee put ads on bulletin boards in the supermarkets, Walmart, the events calendar in the newspaper ...\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cI knew this community-involvement thing was going to come back and bite me on the ass. You know what we could do instead? An awareness crusade for vampires who use sunless tanner. Nothing\u2019s as obvious as an orange vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for business,\u201d Andrea told me. She shot a fierce look at Zeb as she hefted a king-size tray of fruit, veggies, and cheese cubes. \u201cI\u2019m going to go rescue your wife with a plate of nutritious, baby-building snacks, you weenie. Jane\u2019s mama doesn\u2019t scare me.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cMuch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zeb chuckled, watching as Andrea managed to insinuate herself between Mama and a grateful Jolene.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s the house coming along?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Zeb\u2019s face flushed with an incredulous smile. \u201cGreat. Buster actually started putting up interior framing this week. He\u2019s got a crew coming out to do the roof soon, and he said we might be ready for Sheetrock before next month. And when Jolene\u2019s dad came out yesterday to give Buster the stink-eye, Buster just kept his head down and worked his butt off. Even Lonnie had to admit that Buster was doing good, solid work. We might actually be moved in by Christmas. Can you believe it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d I intoned, trying to sound appropriately impressed. I kept my eyes wide and innocent. \u201cYou must have really put your foot down with Buster.\u201d</p><p>Zeb puffed his chest out a bit and tried to sound nonchalant. \u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything from my scary in-laws, it\u2019s all about tone of voice.\u201d</p><p>As everybody circled to start the meeting, I scrambled to sit next to Mama, so I could control ... um, introduce her. Mama had apparently taken the time to memorize the Pledge, a collection of five truths the group repeated before every meeting, and was louder than the rest of us combined as we promised: \u201cI will remember that a newly turned vampire is the same person with new needs.</p><p>\u201cI will remember that a loved one\u2019s being turned into a vampire does not reflect on me.</p><p>\u201cI will remember to offer my vampire loved ones acceptance and love, while maintaining healthy boundaries.</p> <p>\u201cI will remember that vampirism is not contagious unless blood is exchanged.</p><p>\u201cI will remember that I am not alone.\u201d</p><p>Before DeeDee could stand up to introduce herself, Mama bounced to her feet. \u201cWell, hello, everybody! I\u2019m Jane\u2019s mama, Sherry. I\u2019m just so happy to be here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Sherry,\u201d the group chorused, despite my attempts to pull Mama back into her seat by her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit that I went through a bit of bad patch after Jane came out, but I\u2019ve come to accept that I cannot change what Jane is,\u201d Mama said, her voice quavering. \u201cAnd I need to do whatever I can to make her feel accepted and loved by her family. Even if she tries to avoid spending time with us. And isn\u2019t speaking to some of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my Mama,\u201d I conceded.</p> <p>\u201cWell, Sherry, it\u2019s refreshing to see a parent so vocally supportive of her child after they come out,\u201d said DeeDee.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Can we talk about the fact that her \u201cbad patch\u201d involved force-feeding me pot pie and trying to give me a tan? I sulked through DeeDee\u2019s discussion of the pain and confusion of new vampires adjusting to a human world and through her preplanned talk on subconscious conversational slips that can be highly insulting toward vampires. I couldn\u2019t help but think this last topic was directed toward Mama, and I was all for it. But she was so caught up taking notes and beaming beatifically at DeeDee that I\u2019m pretty sure the clue sailed right over her head.</p><p>The group broke up to socialize, which was usually my favorite part of the meetings, but this time, I was dodging my mother with a sudden, extremely urgent search for coffee filters in the stockroom.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d I cried, jumping and whacking my head on a shelving unit.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, hon?\u201d Mama asked, cooing over my new contusion.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not,\u201d I grumbled, rubbing my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just wanted to catch you in private,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just wanted to see how you\u2019re doing, you know, since Gabriel broke up with you. Your daddy and Jolene said you took it awfully hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWha\u2014G-gabriel did not break up with me. I broke up with him. And what is Jolene doing talking to you about that? If she thinks she can deflect belly questions by baiting you with information about me, well, that\u2019s just evil and brilliant, actually. I don\u2019t think I give her enough credit ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re so silly. Now, I\u2019d like to talk to you about your grandma\u2019s birthday,\u201d Mama said breezily. \u201cYour grandma Ruthie wants to make sure you apologize to Wilbur so we can all enjoy dinner without any unpleasantness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Unpleasantness like bringing up the fact that Wilbur tried to stake me with his cane the last time I saw him?\u201d I asked. Mama made a \u201cdisappointed\u201d face.</p><p>Sometimes newly turned vampires are only given enough blood to enable them to wake from the death sleep. They have none of the vampiric strength or speed ... or charm. They\u2019re called ghouls. I only know this because my grandma Ruthie almost married one of them earlier this year. Despite the fact that Wilbur looked like Skeletor and may have bumped off several of his wives to sustain his endless after-death retirement, he and Grandma Ruthie decided to keep dating. After he tried to dust me with his cane.</p><p>It turned out that Wilbur and Ruthie were a perfect match. After all, Grandma Ruthie\u2019s four husbands and previous fianc\u00e9 all died under equally suspicious circumstances, involving a speeding milk truck, a brown recluse bite on the inside of the throat, a previously unknown allergy to Grandma Ruthie\u2019s famous strawberry-rhubarb pie, a golf-related lightning strike, and a miscalculation of Viagra dosage. Wilbur and Grandma Ruthie seemed very happy together, though I guess when you never know when your lover might facilitate your release from your mortal coil, it\u2019s important to keep up the appearance of happiness. Frankly, I was glad they were still so lovey-dovey. For me to win the \u201cdead pool\u201d with Zeb and Dick, either Wilbur or Grandma would have to meet a grisly end in a botulism outbreak next spring.</p><p>\u201cNo. Absolutely not. You all can just celebrate without me,\u201d I told Mama. \u201cI do not apologize to people who try to kill me. It sets a bad precedent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but your grandma Ruthie will be so hurt if you don\u2019t show up!\u201d Mama protested.</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t,\u201d I told Mama. \u201cYou know she won\u2019t. She\u2019ll be much happier, and things will be a lot less tense without me there. In fact, that will be my gift to her this year, not showing up.\u201d</p><p>Mama looked resigned but unhappy, which was generally how we both felt when negotiating the logistics of family gatherings. \u201cSometimes I just don\u2019t understand the things that come out of your mouth, baby,\u201d Mama said, pushing my hair back from my face.</p><p>\u201cI hear that a lot,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Mama chuckled, rolling her eyes. \u201cNow that we have that out of the way, how are you doing, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than spending an unhealthy amount of time faking answers to magazine quizzes so I get better scores, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I told her. \u201cThe shop is doing well. I have sweet, patient friends with a high tolerance for whining. Zeb and Jolene keep me involved in their never-ending baby-name debate. Dick is the older brother I never really asked for. Andrea wants to start a belly-dancing class next month. My life is very full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d Mama asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney.\u201d She sighed, tipping my chin toward her. \u201cI know it hurts right now, but whatever Gabriel did, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s sorry. And if he\u2019s not, maybe Adam Morrow is still interested ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Mama, I love you. I love that you\u2019re being supportive and that you want to put me back up in the saddle. But trust me, trust me, you don\u2019t want me dating Gabriel ... or Adam. I\u2019m better off alone right now.\u201d I kissed her cheek. \u201cBut I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said, squeezing my cheeks. She let out a cleansing breath and returned to her normal cheerful tone. \u201cMaybe it would help if I invited Adam\u2019s mama to the meetings. You know, maybe if she learned to be a little more open-minded like me, it would make it easier on the two of you if you just happen to start dating.\u201d</p><p>I thought about making a smart comment, but for the sake of this newfound bridge of mother-daughter understanding, instead I said, \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t make more connections with the guy who has a fuzzy perception of personal boundaries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re so strange sometimes,\u201d Mama said in that tone of voice that always left me unsure of whether she was going to pay attention to what I said.</p><p>The gears in my brain whirred, searching for any activity that would keep Mama occupied and safely away from Adam Morrow\u2019s mama. When all the machinery clicked into place, a wide smile spread over my face.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d I said, putting my arm around her. \u201cHow would you like to throw Jolene a baby shower?\u201d</p><p>I received a \u201creminder\u201d e-mail from Head Courtney that I had yet to submit a progress report on my collections for the prize committee. She was giving me three demerits and told me to meet with Jenny to \u201cbetter implement a synergistically creative approach\u201d to my begging freebies before a progress meeting with the Courtneys. I was going to find the person who sold Head Courtney her copy of Who Moved My Cheese? and smack them.</p><p>With an obvious expression of disdain, Jenny strolled through the shop\u2019s front door with her hand sanitizer at the ready. She seemed surprised by what she saw. She even smiled, just a tiny bit, at the fanciful little pottery dragon grinning at her from a table by the front window.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d I asked, smiling pleasantly to the point that it was hurting my face. \u201cWe just got a shipment of self-help books. Can I interest you in a copy of How to Stop Being a Raging Bitch in 30 Days ?\u201d</p><p>Jenny\u2019s lip curled back, and I could practically see the acid response forming, but she bit her lip and exhaled loudly through her nose. \u201cThis is a nice place,\u201d she conceded. \u201cGood light, nicely arranged. Probably not a color scheme I would have chosen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d My teeth were grinding as I led her to the counter. I didn\u2019t offer her coffee or a scone, despite the fact that they were arranged temptingly under a nearby glass dome. This was not a social visit. This was business. OK, fine, fine, Jenny had been making me feel unwelcome for years, and now I was having a tiny bit of revenge.</p><p>She smiled sweetly, or what passed for sweetly when you\u2019ve had enough Botox to paralyze an elephant. \u201cMr. Wainwright must have been fond of you to have left you all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Jenny shrugged, her eyes wide and not-quite-convincingly guileless. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, it must be awfully nice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I like the fact that Mr. Wainwright died?\u201d I asked coldly. \u201cDo you think I wouldn\u2019t rather he was here right now?\u201d</p><p>Technically, he was there at the moment, hovering over his favorite copy of From Fangs to Fairy Folk: Unusual Creatures of Midwestern North America . But I wasn\u2019t about to tell Jenny that.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pop out to see how your aunt Jettie\u2019s doing,\u201d Mr. Wainwright whispered.</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d I muttered. I turned back to my sister. \u201cWhy did you come here, Jenny?\u201d</p><p>Jenny tried, and failed, to look surprised by my line of questioning. \u201cCourtney told you. We have to go over our collection plan before the meeting. I wanted to talk to you about getting some of the car dealerships in town to offer some detailing packages. I think I might have an in with the owner of Nelson Ford.\u201d</p><p>I searched Jenny\u2019s face. I even thought about peeking into her thoughts, but past experience with Grandma Ruthie had shown me that only prolonged the argument, it didn\u2019t help me win it. Fortunately, I\u2019d known my sister long enough to discern the acquisitive, gleeful look in her eye when she was bordering on social triumph. And if she was really going to forge some sort of tenuous connection with the largest auto dealership in town, she would have been dancing some uptight little jig.</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cNo you didn\u2019t. We could have handled this whole thing by e-mail. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve done it so far, why change now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine. I want to talk to you about the house,\u201d Jenny said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I threw up my hands. \u201cMy lawyer said I\u2019m not supposed to talk to you about the house or its contents without him being present. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been handling this frustrating yet not at all rewarding task over e-mail!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, I think we can settle this without the lawyers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>Jenny actually had the good grace to look slightly timid, twisting her wedding band around her finger as she said, \u201cWell, your situation has changed. You need to stay close to town now that you\u2019re running the shop. And besides, you don\u2019t need that big old place, all by yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you finish that sentence, I\u2019m going to punch you in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you threaten me,\u201d she said, shoving my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me what I need,\u201d I said, shoving her back, sending her chair scooting across the floor.</p> <p>\u201cJane, you have so much stuff! I don\u2019t understand why you need everything the family\u2019s handed down! You\u2019re all alone. No one even sees all those beautiful things. They won\u2019t be appreciated in your house like they would be in mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having this discussion with you again,\u201d I told her, pushing back from the table. \u201cLet\u2019s just get through this carnival from hell, I\u2019ll find a way to fake my death and escape from the chamber, and you can fight Head Courtney to the death for her position as queen of the evil hive. And then we never have to see each other again. You can pretend I died or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did die,\u201d Jenny said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo it should be easy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just discuss this with me like a rational adult?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you going to behave like a rational adult?\u201d I shot back.</p> <p>She grunted and tossed her folder of chamber materials across the bar at me. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you when you\u2019re like this, which is all the time . I\u2019m going.\u201d She huffed and puffed while she slung her purse over her shoulder. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t over, Jane. You\u2019re going to have to deal with this sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Jenny blew back out of the shop like a bitchy hurricane, leaving a trail of scattered prize committee papers in her wake. And when she\u2019d tossed her folder at me, she\u2019d knocked a huge stack of mail off the counter.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>I ran around the shop, picking up sheets of paper detailing Jenny\u2019s campaign to wheedle free floral arrangements and colonics out of the Hollow\u2019s business community. I also cursed a rather impressive blue streak that eventually began to rhyme and was soon coming out in iambic pentameter.</p><p>Andrea had enrolled us in a poetry seminar.</p><p>And when I finally managed to assemble the papers on the bar, I was confronted with the envelope. I\u2019d been avoiding the mail for the past couple of days. Frankly, between the creepy Jeanine letters and my Visa bill, the U.S. Postal Service wasn\u2019t exactly bearing me good news lately. But I couldn\u2019t ignore today\u2019s note, the creamy linen envelope stuck between humdrum bills and catalogues.</p><p>I seriously considered tearing it up without reading it. Insight into my sire and his crazy possible ex\u2019s relationship didn\u2019t exactly make me happy. But the more I read, the more I wanted to know. Whoever this woman was, Jeanine knew exactly how much information to reveal, how much to play close to the vest, to keep me confused, wound up, and coming back for more. She should have been a mystery author or maybe run for Congress.</p><p>I took a deep yoga breath and prepared myself for whatever obsessive looniness the letter had in store for me. And as I scanned the page, one word jumped out at me: \u201cwhore.\u201d</p> <p>I really hated it when people called me that.</p><p>\u201c I saw you. I saw you with him, rutting in an alley like some common whore. I warned you, but you wouldn\u2019t listen. What do I have to do to make you understand that you have to stay away from Gabriel? Do I have to do something drastic to get my point across? You have no one to blame but yourself now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My hands trembled, and the letter fluttered to the counter. My stomach pitched, pushing the salty-sweet remnants of synthetic blood into my throat.</p><p>The fact that someone had watched me engage in intimate acts in an alleyway seemed far more pressing than the fact that she was threatening to \u201cdo something drastic.\u201d Personally, I thought the drive-by fruiting of my front porch was pretty drastic. But she\u2019d seen us? Someone had watched Gabriel and me having sex behind the shop? She\u2019d seen my sex faces? Heard the noises I made? Watched when Gabriel dropped me on my ass? I felt as if I\u2019d been doused in ice water. What if she\u2019d taken more pictures? What if she sent them to people I knew? Posted them on the Internet? What if that\u2019s what she meant by having no one else to blame?</p><p>I tried to imagine explaining nude online pictures to my mother. If she thought me becoming a vampire was embarrassing, how would she react to \u201caccidental amateur porn star\u201d? I leaned my forehead against the counter. \u201cOh, not good.\u201d</p><p>What do you do in a situation like this? I certainly wasn\u2019t going to the police, who weren\u2019t exactly helpful in cases where vampires were concerned. I\u2019d probably pressed Andrea\u2019s and Dick\u2019s nerves to the limit with my \u201cerotomania\u201d talk and the relationship hysterics. Zeb didn\u2019t need to be dragged into this, what with his procreative worries. That left one person, one man who would understand the situation, my feelings of paranoia and guilt and revulsion.</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t talking to my sire at the moment.</p><p>My computerized calendar alarm sounded from the register. Andrea had set it so I wouldn\u2019t conveniently forget my scheduled progress meeting. It was being held at Puerto Vallarta, the only restaurant in the Hollow that served Mexican food without a drive-through window. The theory was that the planning committee would build better connections and work more creatively in a social setting. Basically, it was an excuse for the Courtneys to get knee-walking drunk off half-priced margaritas on a weeknight. And because Nice Courtney wasn\u2019t a committee head, I wouldn\u2019t even have her as a social shield.</p><p>\u201cForced bonding time with inebriated Courtneys in a restaurant, where I\u2019m going to have to hide the fact that I don\u2019t eat,\u201d I groaned, flopping my head onto the counter. \u201cPeachy freakin\u2019 keen.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>If you\u2019re new to a relationship and your plans for the evening involve alcohol, consider this formula to determine your consumption: however many alcohol units it takes to get you to start complaining about your last boyfriend minus 100 percent.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>I was, of course, the first person to show up at the restaurant, because, silly me, I assumed that when a meeting starts at seven, that\u2019s when you\u2019re supposed to show up. The rest of the Courtneys, and Jenny, showed up at 7:20, just as a table for ten became available in the crowded dining room. Apparently, I was the designated table saver.</p><p>This was going to be a fun night.</p><p>Puerto Vallarta was run by the Gonzalez family, first-generation Mexican-Americans whose parents had come to Kentucky in the 1970s to find seasonal work on the tobacco farms. The three siblings served affordable, delicious Mexican cuisine with just the right amount of \u201cauthentic\u201d mariachi-ized ambience and a smile\u2014 even when the locals butchered Spanish while ordering \u201ccase-o-dillias.\u201d</p><p>Hector, the oldest Gonzalez, led us to the back room, which was set up for large parties. When Head Courtney saw the unassuming spot under crisscrossed guitars and a neon sign for Dos Equis, she shook her head and said, \u201cWe would like a different table,\u201d with loud, deliberate pronunciation. Then she repeated the phrase with big, swooping hand gestures.</p><p>Apparently, Head Courtney didn\u2019t think that Hector spoke English. But she did believe that when you speak really slowly and loudly, English automatically becomes whatever language is understood by the person you\u2019re yelling at.</p><p>\u201cWe want that table,\u201d Head Courtney said, pointing to another long table underneath huge hanging bunches of dried garlic and chili peppers. Then she added more hand gestures.</p><p>Hector, who had been the go-to grammarian for my honors English class at Half-Moon Hollow High, looked to me with a puzzled expression. I rolled my eyes and shrugged.</p><p>Several of the Courtneys seemed to be watching me as we approached the table. As we were seated, I mentally reviewed the benefits of belonging to the Chamber of Commerce. Legitimacy, contacts, free advertising. I said it over and over in my head, like a mantra to keep me from strangling one of the Courtneys with their imitation Coach purse straps.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Head Courtney said loudly. Hector nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood to see ya, Jane. I\u2019ll have a server with y\u2019all in just a few minutes,\u201d he said in his perfect, heavily-Southern-accented English. Hector, who insisted on being called Heck in school, had always looked a little like Lou Diamond Phillips and sounded a lot like Larry the Cable Guy. I winked at him.</p><p>Head Courtney looked momentarily confused but quickly forgot her ethnic profiling as she watched me settle in with a menu, ignoring the cluster of dried garlic hanging over my head. Contrary to what movies would have you believe, vampires aren\u2019t allergic to garlic. It does, however, smell to high heaven, and we have supersensitive noses. But it had been a long time since the specimens overhead had remotely resembled usable food. The smell was strong but not unpleasantly so. It reminded me of coming to Puerto when I was living. Zeb and I would come on Tuesday nights to split a carne asada platter and chat with Hector over cheap beer.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK here, Jane?\u201d Cankles Courtney asked, peeking carefully over her menu. She nodded up to the garlic. \u201cJenny said you have ... allergies.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll bet she did. I glared Jenny\u2019s way, but she seemed completely absorbed by her menu. I smiled sweetly at Cankles Courtney. \u201cThanks for asking, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Cankles Courtney gave Toady Courtney a triumphant look, as if to say, \u201cSee, I told you! She\u2019s not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, making a show of studying the menu. I missed carne asada. And chocolate. And ice cream. And lasagna. And cheeseburgers. Basically, I missed all food, except brussels sprouts. It still irked me that my last meal had consisted of potato skins and liquor. People who get the chair receive a better culinary sendoff.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to order the carne asada, because that would just be depressing, even if I used Jolene\u2019s disgusting food-craving imagery. I decided on tamales. They were mushy and messy, and it would be difficult to tell how much, if anything, I was eating. Plus, I\u2019d never liked them much, so staring at them for an hour or so without being able to eat them would be bearable.</p><p>Our server suffered through our ordering pronunciations with a brave face. When he came to me, I ordered the tamales, and whatever remaining interest the Courtneys had in my eating habits seemed to melt away. The server stared at me for a long moment and then asked, \u201cAnd to drink?\u201d</p><p>I thought about sweet, fortifying tequila, since all of the Courtneys were planning on bellying up to the margarita trough. But I wanted to keep my wits about me so I wouldn\u2019t get wrangled into cleaning up after the petting zoo or any of the other undesirable jobs Courtney had lined up.</p><p>\u201cWater\u2019s fine, thanks.\u201d The server seemed to sense a weakening in my resolve and continued staring at me. I took the bar menu from the little plastic console in the middle of the table. \u201cActually, I\u2019ll have a beer.\u201d</p><p>The Courtney on my left gasped in horror. Jenny sneered as I looked over the beer selections.</p><p>\u201cEl Torrente Sangu\u00edneo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>For a moment, I and my three years of poor Spanish instruction thought he was asking if I wanted a raincoat with that. I squinted at him. He pointed to a selection near the bottom of the menu. The little dark brown bottle on the illustration looked like any beer. I knew that Sangu\u00edneo probably had something to do with sangre , which translated to \u201cblood.\u201d And torrente probably meant \u201criver\u201d or \u201cstream.\u201d So it probably translated to something like \u201cblood stream\u201d or \u201cvein.\u201d Was he offering me synthetic blood? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked up at the server, who smiled back at me, looking a little dazzled. Now that they\u2019d been thoroughly horrified by my choice to drink beer in public, the Courtneys weren\u2019t paying attention to what I was ordering. I guess they figured vampires wouldn\u2019t drink beer and order tamales.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d I said emphatically, smiling back.</p><p>The waiter practically scrambled over the adjoining booth in his rush to get our drinks back to us. He set the brown bottle in front of me with a flourish, a slice of lime carefully balanced in the lip. I thanked him as he served the margaritas and took a long pull from the bottle.</p> <p>Ahh. Sweet, slightly spicy, a thick coating of synthetic blood rolled down my throat and soothed my nervous stomach. I was going to have to remember this brand. The waiter watched me expectantly. I wanted to smile, but I was pretty sure my teeth would be blood-stained for the next few minutes. Also, my fangs were trying to creep out of my mouth. I pressed my lips together but nodded enthusiastically. I was going to have to tip this guy in a serious way. The waiter backed away from our table but promised to be back soon.</p><p>\u201cIf Jane\u2019s done eye-flirting with the server,\u201d Head Courtney said, clearing her throat and pursing her thin, cranberry-glossed lips, \u201cwe should start the meeting.\u201d</p><p>Crap, I\u2019d totally forgotten why I was there.</p><p>It was a good thing I\u2019d elected not to drink. Courtney tried to stick me with petting-zoo clean-up, sitting in the dunk tank, and putting down the deposit on the inflatables (out of my own pocket, apparently, with the hope that the Courtneys would remember to reimburse me).</p><p>Each of the committee chairs was given a progress evaluation. Head Courtney wasn\u2019t pleased with our work. Cankles Courtney, who was in charge of food, had neglected to think of vegetarian options for the festival attendees. (Because nothing says old-fashioned family fun like a tofu dog.) Short Courtney, who was in charge of publicity, had yet to secure an interview with the local morning radio show, so that Head Courtney could educate the masses on the importance of the chamber\u2019s philanthropic efforts. Also, Short Courtney had ordered the promotional posters in an autumnal burnt orange instead of the chamber\u2019s signature pink, so five demerits for her. I was failing miserably, and I was lucky that Jenny was there to save my butt. Head Courtney placed her right hand on Jenny\u2019s shoulder while she pronounced this. Jenny tried to preen subtly but failed. I was reminded of the scene in The Omen when Damien realizes the extent of his evil power.</p> <p>Seriously, could I buy my way out of this gig? What if I just gave Head Courtney $5,000 for the animal shelter? And then moved and changed my name?</p><p>By the end of the \u201cmeeting,\u201d Head Courtney had four empty margarita glasses next to her plate and was starting to tell the other Courtneys what she really thought of them. Short Courtney needed to get her roots done. Cankles Courtney had, well, cankles. Toady Courtney had almost reined her in when Head Courtney\u2019s gaze fell on me. At this point, I\u2019d been pushing tamales around on my plate for two hours while watching my sister get fawned over. As far as I was concerned, Head Courtney could bring it on.</p><p>Head Courtney was swaying in her chair, her cornsilk-blond hair clinging to the light sheen of drunk sweat on her cheeks. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so much smarter than the rest of us. That we don\u2019t know what you really are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourtney, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re feeling very well,\u201d Toady Courtney said loudly, her brown eyes wide with alarm. \u201cThose enchiladas must have been rancid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t interrupt her, Courtney,\u201d I said, smiling and tilting my head. \u201cI think she was on a roll.\u201d</p><p>The jig, apparently, was up. And I felt a little foolish for picking at those damn tamales. Oh, well, I might as well have some fun with it.</p> <p>\u201cJenny told us all about it. You think we would have let you in if we had known?\u201d Head Courtney hissed. \u201cWe would never\u2014and now, we can\u2019t kick you out because you people sue for discrimination at the drop of a hat. We don\u2019t want you to pull a Frink on us.\u201d</p><p>Did she just call me \u201cyou people\u201d?</p><p>The whole table was suddenly quiet, as if Courtney had dropped a glass dome over us. Suddenly, it all made sense. The stupid tasks, the poor performance reviews, the general bitchiness. It wasn\u2019t just that they didn\u2019t like me. They wanted me to quit. They\u2019d managed to weed out everyone who didn\u2019t live up to their standards through intimidation and misery, but they couldn\u2019t get rid of me because I scared them. I was making them miserable by my mere presence. I smiled, letting my fangs peek out just the tiniest bit.</p><p>\u201cJenny, I\u2019m surprised at you,\u201d I said in my blandest tone. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be too ashamed to tell anybody about your sister\u2019s shameful vampire condition. I mean, really, where\u2019s the benefit in outing me? Aren\u2019t you afraid of tarnishing your reputation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShister?\u201d Head Courtney slurred. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018sister\u2019?\u201d</p><p>The silence was broken, and a rush of whispers rounded the table of Courtneys. Now it was my turn for my jaw to drop. I stared at Jenny. \u201cYou told them I\u2019m a vampire, but you didn\u2019t tell them I\u2019m your sister?\u201d</p><p>Jenny\u2019s jaw clenched. Her face turned a pasty shade of oyster gray. \u201cThere was no reason to. My sister died last year.\u201d</p><p>I waited for the twist in my chest, the pain of being rejected by Jenny once again so she could spend time with people who were better, more important than me. But it didn\u2019t come. I was used to it. She\u2019d made her feelings clear a long time ago. There was a freedom in just not giving a damn anymore. And Jenny had granted me this gift. I was free. I could walk away. Part of me wanted to, to give Jenny and the Courtneys what they wanted. I could quit and walk out the door so they\u2019d have to pay for my synthetic-blood tab. But the more perverse part of my personality was intrigued by the possibilities. So, I did something that shocked the Courtneys.</p> <p>I laughed.</p><p>Everyone at the table winced as I threw my head back and laughed like a big old donkey. I giggled until my sides ached. I laughed for every fat girl, bookworm, and wallflower who\u2019d ever felt powerless in the wake of the Courtneys of the world. I laughed because I knew that when I got up, Jenny was going to have to explain to the Courtneys why she had lied to them. She was going to be left holding the conversational bag for once. I laughed because this was such a silly high school drama to find oneself enmeshed in at the ripe old age of twenty-eight.</p><p>Once I\u2019d recovered, I wiped at my eyes, hoping that there weren\u2019t streaks of blood tears running from my lashes. Other diners had lifted their heads from their tacos and were starting to stare. I stood up, prompting another communal flinch, and tossed some bills on the table, enough to make up a 40-percent tip for my buddy the waiter.</p><p>\u201cThat is my big sister,\u201d I said loudly. \u201cAlways looking out for number one. You girls are hilarious! Courtney, what a sense of humor you have! I had a great time tonight. Thanks for asking me. I\u2019ll see you at the next meeting!\u201d</p><p>I took two steps, then turned around, prompting the entire table to press back away from me, knocking Short Courtney off her chair. \u201cBy the way, the waiter figured it out faster than y\u2019all did. And he had a hell of a lot more class about it.\u201d</p><p>I giggled all the way from the table to the front door, to the point that Hector stopped me at the door and asked if I was OK to drive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assured him. \u201cSober as a judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Judge Frye in here after about three beers.\u201d Hector snickered. \u201cHe wears a sombrero and everything. Hey, Jane, are you going to the reunion? It\u2019s coming up pretty soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know ... I haven\u2019t really thought it through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to think through?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou see some old friends, laugh at everybody who got fat and bald, get drunk off spiked punch, and go home. Come on, I\u2019ll need someone to listen to my bad jokes. I miss seeing you and Zeb around here. You used to come in all the time, you know, before ...\u201d</p><p>I winced but realized that Hector was standing as close to me as he always had. The friendly warmth in his eyes was genuine. \u201cYeah ... before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t care. I haven\u2019t been attacked by a vampire yet. I don\u2019t figure you\u2019re going to be the one to do it. I am a little hurt that you don\u2019t come in here anymore. But I figure you have your reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>Hector chuckled. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a reason. But we put that bottled-blood stuff on the menu for a reason, Jane. We don\u2019t turn away anybody\u2019s money here, dead or undead. You\u2019re always welcome. But try for Wednesdays, because I want you to see Judge Frye do what he thinks is the Mexican Hat Dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Heck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d he said, giving me a brotherly punch on the arm. \u201cAnd the reunion, think about it, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I laughed and bopped his bicep lightly.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d he said, rubbing his arm dramatically. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hit so hard in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople change,\u201d I told him, giggling as I walked out the front entrance.</p><p>Andrea and I were backed up on several days\u2019 worth of deliveries that we hadn\u2019t had a chance to open. So, we sat at the coffee bar, pretending it was Christmas.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the cookbooks I ordered,\u201d I said, taking a load of packing peanuts to the trash as Andrea picked up an Amazon.com box. \u201cApparently, some chef in New York was turned and is doing amazing things with drinkable sauces that are tasty and won\u2019t make vampires vomit. So I got a dozen of them.\u201d</p><p>Andrea bounced the package gently. \u201cIt seems kind of light for a dozen books. I think it\u2019s probably that unnatural number of Jason Statham DVDs you ordered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to have filmed a nude scene at some point in his career. I don\u2019t care how many shoot-\u2019em-up action movies I have to watch, I will find it,\u201d I said solemnly. \u201cOh, yes, I will find it.\u201d</p><p>Andrea rolled her eyes as she pressed the brass athame Mr. Wainwright used as a letter opener to the packing tape. \u201cI know money isn\u2019t really that much of a concern for you anymore, but have you ever stopped to examine some of your odder spending habits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with the balance I\u2014 Do you smell something?\u201d The back of my throat itched as Andrea sliced through the tape. She squealed when the box hissed and then spattered her face with a sheer silvery mist. I tried to call out to her, but my throat wasn\u2019t working right.</p><p>I screamed noiselessly as smoke rose from my arms. My skin crackled and burned. I think I made a very undignified, strangled screeching noise as I smacked the box off the counter to the floor.</p><p>Dick emerged from the back room, coughing.</p><p>I heard Andrea screaming, \u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d while I dropped to my knees and gave hoarse, choking, rattling coughs. My throat was closing up. I didn\u2019t have to breathe, but the inability to draw in air was even more painful than the slow flames of pain licking at my face. I was going to die. For real this time, I could feel it. My strength was ebbing out of my limbs, and I could feel my body shutting down.</p><p>Gabriel. I would never fix things with Gabriel. Until that moment, I hadn\u2019t realized I had expected that I would. As the edges of my vision began to darken and blur, I struggled to tell Andrea to find Gabriel, to tell him how sorry I was.</p><p>\u201cGet it out of here!\u201d Dick yelled as he swooped behind the counter. \u201cKeep the door open.\u201d</p><p>Andrea, still wiping frantically at her cheeks, tossed the box out through the front door. Dick propped me up against his chest and dragged a fingernail across his wrist. \u201cCome on, sweetheart. Come on, Jane, please, calm down and drink.\u201d Dick coughed slightly as he pressed his wrist to my mouth. He hissed in pain as my mouth touched his skin. The flesh against my lips sizzled and turned black as his skin reacted to the silver on my face. He murmured soothing words as I struggled to swallow. \u201cGood, good. You need this. It will help. There\u2019s a girl. Long, slow sips.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite the fact that our organs are no longer functioning, vampire cells actually reproduce at a rapid rate. When we\u2019re injured, tendrils of tissue and muscle reach out to each other to replicate the previous alignment, which is why we don\u2019t gain weight or age. Drinking the blood of another vampire, particularly an older one, speeds the process along. The blood pouring down my throat was a balm. The comfort was almost instantaneous. My skin stopped smoking; the burning subsided. My throat relaxed, allowing Dick\u2019s blood to soothe and heal.</p><p>And laced through it all, like a gold ribbon streaking through the pain, I felt love. Dick really did love me, in a sweet, brotherly manner that sent his thoughts scattered in a million directions. Images whizzed by without rhyme or reason. Our meeting in the parking lot at the Cellar. Dick coming to River Oaks and realizing that Gabriel was my sire. Me introducing him to Andrea. Dick bickering with Gabriel while I refereed. His trailer exploding. Dick spending time with Zeb. Andrea and Dick dancing at Zeb\u2019s wedding. Sitting with Andrea at her kitchen table. All of these little scenes were tenuously connected to his knowing me. He saw his life as being better after he met me. He didn\u2019t want to lose that.</p><p>Aww.</p> <p>I broke away from him and let him wrap his arms around me, hugging me close. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again, do you understand?\u201d Dick demanded, his voice rough. I nodded, squeezing his shoulders, before he released me and checked the damage to my face. I didn\u2019t mention the visions, even though we both knew what I\u2019d seen. Dick wasn\u2019t much for big emotional displays.</p><p>Gently, he leaned me against the cabinet. I pressed tentative fingers against the raw, ravaged skin of my cheeks as Dick rummaged for a wet rag. \u201cWhat. The. Hell. Was. That?\u201d I wheezed.</p><p>Rubbing his wrist as the flesh reformed and healed, Dick said, \u201cYou were having the vampire version of a bad allergic reaction. Can you explain to me how you managed to release aerosol silver directly into your own face? What\u2019s next for you, stake juggling?\u201d</p><p>And with that, Dick had recovered from his fit of fraternal devotion.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we assuming that I did this to myself?\u201d I growled, my voice still hoarse. Dick gave me a flat stare. \u201cIt was worth a shot,\u201d I said, swiping the rag across my cheeks. \u201cAndrea! Andrea opened the box. Is she OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, peering over the counter, rubbing her own face with a dust rag. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even hurt. I\u2019m sorry I screamed. It just freaked me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, just promise you\u2019ll let me have the panic attack next time we\u2019re accosted by the mail.\u201d</p><p>Dick seized Andrea\u2019s shoulders and hugged her long and hard. \u201cDick ... can\u2019t ... breathe,\u201d she wheezed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, delayed reaction to you using your panicked voice. I love you like crazy, woman. It does strange things to me,\u201d he said before kissing her. He winced as the silver sizzled against his lips. He pulled away, carefully sniffing her face.</p><p>\u201cThat was so sweet,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cUntil you sniffed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColloidal silver,\u201d he announced. \u201cA pretty strong dose of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe health-supplement stuff?\u201d I said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised that you know what it is?\u201d Andrea grumbled, rinsing her face under the coffee-bar tap. \u201cOK, geek girl, would you mind filling in the people who don\u2019t memorize everything they read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically microscopic clusters of silver particles in liquid. New-age types use it for everything from burns to eye infections, because it supposedly keeps germs from being able to metabolize. Hundreds of health-supplement Web sites sell it. It\u2019s perfectly safe for humans, with the exception of people who take too much over a long period of time. They have a tendency to turn blue. But obviously, it seriously screws with vampires.\u201d Andrea stared at me, her expression amazed and amused. I shrugged. \u201cI saw it on Oprah .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did it get sprayed at us from what was supposed to be a box of books?\u201d Andrea griped. \u201cWhat supervillain did you piss off this time, Jane?\u201d</p><p>Dick examined the box carefully. \u201cIt looks like a pretty simple device. Once the tape was ruptured and the box top split, a lever compressed on this spray can and sent the silver into the air. In fact, if that had happened in a room full of humans, it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem. But obviously, someone thought there would be a good chance you would be opening the box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have to figured that out awfully fast,\u201d I commented dryly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a common trick if you\u2019ve pissed off a vampire,\u201d Dick said. I narrowed my eyes at him. He gave me his best impression of an innocent person\u2019s indignant protest. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve ever done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, basically, we\u2019re looking for the Unabomber or MacGyver,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhy is someone always trying to kill me? This never happened to me when I was alive.\u201d</p> <p>12</p><p>Don\u2019t be afraid to be vulnerable. Sometimes we have to bare our souls to our vampire mates and say, \u201cYes, I\u2019m invincible and immortal, but you can still hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>We\u2019d underestimated how far the silver had sprayed. I could see faint misting spatters of the grayish liquid along the far wall of the shop. Suddenly very weary, I wondered how long it would take to clean up the mess. Not that I was much help in that department, anyway. Andrea and Dick forced me to sit across the room, farthest from \u201cground zero,\u201d with an ice bag on my cheeks, while Andrea wet-vacuumed the carpet. Dick was wearing a surgical mask and elbow-length rubber gloves to wipe down the bar with disinfectant.</p><p>I sat there, feeling sort of useless, as Gabriel came roaring through the front door, his eyes wild. From the panicked, crazed look on his face, I thought he\u2019d finally snapped and was going to go to all bunny-boiler on me. But when his eyes connected with mine, there was such powerful relief there that I couldn\u2019t be afraid. He bounded across the room and tenderly cradled my blistered face between his palms, poring over the damaged skin. Even though I was still mad at him, even though I still had enough of my pride to sting at the thought of him seeing me in full Freddy Krueger mode, I threw my arms around him and buried my face in his neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK.\u201d I sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed into Gabriel\u2019s arms and let him rock me gently back and forth. I knew things weren\u2019t settled yet. We were going to have to have a lot of long, long talks about trust, fidelity, communication, and not dropping one\u2019s sexual partner\u2019s naked ass onto concrete. But for the moment, I was willing to skip it all. I just wanted someone to care whether my face disintegrated or not. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a violation of feminist principles.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he doing here?\u201d Andrea demanded, giving Gabriel the Glare of One Thousand Suns.</p><p>\u201cI called him,\u201d Dick muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Andrea cried.</p><p>Gabriel lifted his head from my shoulder and growled at Dick, \u201cHow could you let this happen?\u201d</p><p>Dick looked sheepish. \u201cI can\u2019t watch her every minute, son. How was I supposed to know she\u2019d be attacked by ground shipping?\u201d</p><p>The two of them shared a look over my head. Gabriel made several threatening faces. Dick responded with rude gestures. Eventually, they looked like two inebriated mimes having a dance-off.</p><p>\u201cWould someone clue the scabby girl in on the conversation?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cDick was supposed to be watching you,\u201d Gabriel admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s been watching you for me for a while now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains why you\u2019ve spent so much time at the shop!\u201d I took a swipe at Dick, who lithely stepped out of the way toward Andrea. She smacked him in my stead. \u201cI do not need the Dick and Gabriel Secret Service Detail!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gabriel whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t trust you to take care of yourself. Between the letters and the pranks, I was scared. I just wanted to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is probably what put me in danger. Jackass,\u201d I said, halfheartedly slapping at his arm.</p><p>\u201cI love you. Love you so much,\u201d he whispered into my neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done if you\u2019d been ... I am a huge jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sweetest thing you\u2019ve ever said to me,\u201d I told him, ignoring Andrea when she said, \u201cThat\u2019s just sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Dick said. \u201cReally, Gabe. She\u2019s going to be OK. She\u2019s a tough little nut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick saved me,\u201d I told Gabriel. \u201cWithout him, I would be a little pile of Jane ashes waiting to be vacuumed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gabriel told Dick. Dick seemed to be waiting for a punchline, so Gabriel repeated it. \u201cI mean it. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dick would have blushed if he was capable. Instead, he made a study of the floor.</p><p>\u201cCan I see the device?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>Dick retrieved the box, which we had wrapped in a clear plastic bag.</p><p>\u201cThe label was intact, undamaged,\u201d Dick said, showing Gabriel the address flap. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even tell the box had already been taped once until you took off the second layer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, whoever it was would have had to monitor our Dumpster closely enough to wait for a barely damaged Amazon.com box with an intact label to be thrown away?\u201d I made a face and then winced at the pressure on my burnt cheeks. \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019m more upset by that than I am the silver thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe silver is very pure,\u201d Gabriel observed. \u201cI can smell it, even from here. Colloidal silver tends to be higher in concentration than the mix used in defense sprays, and this seems to be a particularly potent batch. If this had sprayed you directly in the face, instead of Andrea, you might not have survived. It would be like someone who is allergic to bee stings stepping on a hive. Your healing ability would have been overwhelmed, and you would have been stripped down to the bone. Young vampires rarely come back from injuries like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say your new friend Courtney runs a sterling-silver shop?\u201d Dick asked.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Courtney?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cI met her at the Chamber of Commerce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou belong to the Chamber of Commerce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I haven\u2019t been sitting around moping after you. I am a very busy and important woman.\u201d Andrea gave me a smirking yet disapproving look. I amended, \u201cI moped a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Dick rolled his eyes. \u201cSomeone who runs a jewelry business would be pretty well versed in the different forms of silver, especially high-concentration stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, guys, don\u2019t do this,\u201d I whined. \u201cI really like Courtney. Well, that one, at least. I just want one normal human friend without a frightening agenda. Please don\u2019t take that from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that hurts my feelings,\u201d Andrea muttered.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I think we all know who\u2014\u201d I was interrupted as Emery sauntered from the rear of the shop. He stopped and sniffed delicately at the harsh disinfectants, shuddering.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell? It smells like burnt popcorn in here,\u201d he said, gagging.</p><p>\u201cEmery, how long have you been here?\u201d Andrea asked.</p><p>\u201cI just arrived, Andrea, dear,\u201d he said, offering her an overly gooey smile. \u201cI came in the staff entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was locked,\u201d Dick noted, his jaw set as he pulled Andrea just a little bit closer.</p><p>\u201cI borrowed a key,\u201d Emery said in the dismissive tone he always used when talking to Dick.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to give that back now,\u201d I told him, not bothering to disguise the irritation in my voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emery ignored me, his eyes sweeping over the disheveled room. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone sent Jane a can of aerosol silver, which sprayed all over the shop,\u201d Dick said, watching Emery carefully for a reaction.</p><p>\u201cDid it get on any of the more important books?\u201d Emery demanded with a shriek. \u201cDoes liquid silver stain? Have you contacted your insurance agent?\u201d</p> <p>Sadly, that was exactly the reaction I\u2019d expected. I sincerely looked forward to the day when Dick revealed their blood connection to Emery ... and then Dick took his great-great-grandson out to the woodshed for an old-fashioned ass-whoopin\u2019.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d I muttered. I felt a low growl rumble deep in Gabriel\u2019s chest. I placed a restraining hand across his shoulders. As much as I appreciated Gabriel\u2019s indignant response, Emery couldn\u2019t help that he was raised to be a socially clueless tool. Plus, spilling Emery\u2019s blood would probably damage more books.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, I\u2019m concerned for you, Jane, but obviously, you\u2019re fine,\u201d Emery said, giving another delicate shudder at the sight of my ravaged face. \u201cBut who knows what kind of damage this little prank has done? Who knows how many books have been ruined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not really worried about that right now, Emery,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cWe\u2019re just grateful that Jane\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you are. You\u2019re such a good friend, Andrea.\u201d Emery pressed Andrea\u2019s hands between his. Dick\u2019s eyes narrowed into dangerous little slits.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start checking the books just as soon as we have all this cleaned up,\u201d Dick told him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you head on home to the boardinghouse or the malt shop or wherever you wholesome types spend your evenings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can help,\u201d Emery protested. \u201cYou probably want to clean the silver off the books as soon as possible if you\u2019re going to salvage them. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t do for poor Jane to stumble across a book soaked in silver months from now, would it? We can\u2019t have those sorts of hazards just lurking around the shop for her or our vampire customers. I\u2019m willing to examine every single book if it means making the shop safe for Jane ... and her friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea and I can handle it,\u201d Dick told him.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to have an extra pair of hands helping you?\u201d Emery countered. He gave Andrea a long simpering look. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s obvious that Andrea is shaken by the incident. I\u2019d like to pitch in and help her however I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmery, look.\u201d I stood on wobbly legs. My head swam, and the floor tilted toward me. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going home,\u201d Gabriel told me as he caught my elbows and kept me from smacking my head on the floor. \u201cDick, would you mind closing up?\u201d</p> <p>I was too dazed to object or hear Dick\u2019s response. Dick and Andrea could figure out what to do with Emery. I let Gabriel lead me to his car and tuck me into the passenger side.</p><p>I stared out the window, unsure of what to say, as he drove me to River Oaks. When we got there, he let Fitz out to run and took me to the upstairs bathroom, where he carefully stripped me out of the silver-laced clothes. While Gabriel ran bathwater, I caught a glimpse of my face in the mirror and was relieved to see that it no longer looked like raw hamburger. I had a few shiny, pale pink patches across my cheeks and nose, like a human recovering from a bad sunburn.</p><p>Gabriel let me slip in under the bubbles, and I closed my eyes to avoid looking at him while he ran a sponge down my still-healing arms and legs. He poured some of my \u201cfancy\u201d antifrizz shampoo into his palm and massaged it through my hair. Apparently, he didn\u2019t expect me to talk about my feelings or how awkward it was for me to let him see me naked again, especially with my fabulous shiny pink healing burns. It was just as well. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about him seeing me naked again, with or without shiny pink healing burns.</p><p>When he tilted my head back to rinse my hair, I caught him staring at my face. You\u2019d expect someone in his situation to be sneaking looks about eight inches south, but he was wholly concentrated on my face. The burns must have been worse than I thought.</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s bad,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re almost completely healed. I just\u2014I\u2019m trying to take in as much as I can before you\u2019re strong enough to drop-kick me out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so sweet?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re letting me,\u201d he said, a sad little lopsided smile tilting his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI missed you, too. But I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, ergo no apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can live with that.\u201d He nodded, gently pouring warm water over my head. \u201cI would like you to consider moving to my house for a while, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that. It would feel weird. And I don\u2019t think living together would be right for us at the moment. There\u2019s too much going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then move into Andrea\u2019s place, at least until the threats stop.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows arched, the new skin around them stretching tight. \u201cAndrea\u2019s place, where Dick lives? You must be scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. And I\u2019ll be much more careful when I open the mail, I promise.\u201d He gave me a withering fatherly look. \u201cI\u2019ll let Andrea open the mail from now on?\u201d When that didn\u2019t satisfy him, I huffed. \u201cI\u2019ll take it to the airport and have it X-rayed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be spending a lot more time at the shop with you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to acknowledge my presence. I will just sit in the back and watch you, to make sure you\u2019re safe. Wherever you go, I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a stalker.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes. Jane, I don\u2019t care what capacity you let me have in your life. I just want to be there. And if that means I have to keep my distance, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. If ever there was a time for me to lay all my cards on the table, this was it. Naked, wounded, and vulnerable. \u201cSo, here\u2019s my basic problem with us, the reason I can\u2019t seem to relax into a relationship with you, the reason I find problems where none exist and I push you away. I\u2014I can\u2019t figure out why you\u2019re with me!\u201d I exclaimed, clapping my hand over my mouth. I hadn\u2019t meant for that part to come out. I had meant to say, \u201cYou lie and hide things from me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pried my fingers away from my lips. My hands trembled as stuff I\u2019d been feeling for months tumbled from my tongue. \u201cI know that makes me neurotic and sad, but I can\u2019t figure out why you want to be with me. Every other woman in your life is exotic and beautiful and has all this history. And I\u2019m just some drunk girl you followed home from a bar, some pathetic human you felt your usual need to protect, and you got stuck with a lifetime tie to her because she was dumb enough to get shot. I can\u2019t stand the idea that you feel obligated to me. I know I\u2019m insecure and pushy and spastic, desperately inappropriate at times and just plain odd at others. And I can\u2019t help but wonder why you would want that when there are obviously so many other options. I can\u2019t help but feel that I\u2019m keeping you from someone better.\u201d</p><p>I let out a loud, long breath. It felt as if some tremendous weight on my chest had wiggled loose and then dropped away. No more running. No more floating along and waiting. My cards were on the table. If Gabriel and I couldn\u2019t have a future after this, it wasn\u2019t because I held back from him. Now I could only hope it didn\u2019t blow up in my face in some horrible way.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure my face could handle much more.</p><p>Gabriel sighed and cupped my chin, forcing me to look him in the eye. \u201cI didn\u2019t follow you that night because I wanted to protect you. I followed you that night because you were one of the most interesting people I\u2019d met in decades. You had this light about you, this sweetness, this biting humor. After I\u2019d only known you for an hour, you made me laugh harder than I had since before I was turned. You made me feel normal, at peace, for the first time in years. And I didn\u2019t want to lose that yet. Even if it was just watching over you from a mile away, I didn\u2019t want to leave your presence. I followed you because I didn\u2019t want to let you go. Even then, I saw you were one of the most extraordinary, fascinating, maddening people I would ever know. Even then, I think I knew that I would love you. If you don\u2019t love me, that\u2019s one thing. But if you do, just stop arguing with me about it. It\u2019s annoying. \u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I conceded. \u201cWhy the hell couldn\u2019t you have told me this a year ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to. You weren\u2019t ready to hear it.\u201d</p><p>The water cooled. Gabriel helped me out of the tub and wrapped my robe around me. I snuggled up under the covers and pulled him under with me. He held me close for a long, silent moment before I finally said, \u201cTell me about Jeanine. Tell me everything. I won\u2019t get mad, no matter how bad it is.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel turned me to face him, stroking my hair. \u201cI met Jeanine on one of my first visits to Paris. Her family had old money, very old. Her parents died when she was young, leaving her to be raised by a criminally indulgent grandmother. Jeanine\u2019s mother had been prone to \u2018spells\u2019 during which her grandmother attended to her every need. So Jeanine learned early on that being weak and sickly was the fastest way to get attention. Batteries of doctors, nurses, and maids catered to her every whim around the clock. And yet they could never find exactly what was ailing her. Her symptoms shifted like the sands, leaving her grandmother frantic that she would lose another beloved girl. Jeanine was never forced to study subjects she found boring, never forced to meet family or social obligations she found unappealing, never made to do anything that didn\u2019t suit her down to her stamping little foot. The end result was a girl with a woefully limited education, little empathy, and no apparent conscience.</p><p>\u201cShe spent so much time pretending to be ill that she convinced herself she was. The whole of Paris society spoke in quiet admiration of this \u2018pale rose\u2019 who only braved the trials of public appearances every so often for the opera or an important party. She was beautiful. Mahogany hair, always curled into the latest fashions. Bottomless eyes the color of bluebells. Her skin was so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. She made tuberculosis hot,\u201d I said crossly. \u201cOn with the story.\u201d</p><p>In a slightly less admiring voice, Gabriel assured me, \u201cI found her to be manipulative, spoiled, and not nearly as wan or silly as she wanted us to believe. She was what you would have quite freely called a pain in the ass. But she was also very clever. Most of her \u2018incapacitation\u2019 was spent reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said she didn\u2019t study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she read what suited her. Romance novels, Gothic horror. Unfortunately, some of her library included Gothic romance tales, Varney the Vampire and Carmilla. \u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are pretty hard-core books for the time,\u201d I commented. \u201cSurely, well-bred and invalid young ladies did not read lurid lesbian vampire fantasies.\u201d Gabriel arched an eyebrow at me. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve read them ... Moving on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, her grandmother was indulgent. She would go to any lengths to lift poor Jeanine\u2019s spirits, including discreetly procuring naughty books. Jeanine recognized what I was right away. She approached me, throwing herself in my path wherever I went, the ballet, parties, even a late-night card game at a friend\u2019s home. It was becoming a joke among my friends. Her grandmother encouraged the infatuation, because she seemed to think that whatever got Jeanine out of bed and into the world was a good thing. One night, Jeanine cornered me at a ball and told me she knew my secret, but not to worry, she wouldn\u2019t tell a soul. All I had to do in return was to make her what I was.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe wanted to be turned?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel muttered, \u201cFor someone who spent so much time on her deathbed, she was terrified of death. The idea of becoming old and not having the choice of being confined and ill was horrible to her. She thought by becoming a vampire, she would finally be free from illness, stronger, able to get out from under the control of her grandmother, whom she began resenting long before. I refused, told her she was mistaken. I even used my burgeoning powers to wipe all thoughts or memories she had pertaining to my being a vampire. But her obsession ran deeper than my reach. Within a few weeks, she was back again and more determined. She was everywhere. I switched hotels endlessly to dodge her. She excelled at knowing my schedule before I did. Everywhere I went, there was a note from her, cajoling, wheedling, promising me her undying devotion, endless love, and companionship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds vaguely familiar,\u201d I said dryly.</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cFinally, she found the hotel where I was staying. I came home one morning to find her on my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFully clothed with both wrists slashed,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was on the brink of death. She had just enough breath to whisper, \u2018Help me, please.\u2019 I knew it was wrong\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, being unable to pass up a damsel in distress\u2014which is a bit of a pattern with you, by the way\u2014you intervened,\u201d I said, cupping his chin in my hands.</p><p>\u201cYes. I felt it was my fault she had done this. I hadn\u2019t been forceful enough in dissuading her. I could have done more. There was no blood left to take from her, but I gave her my own. Afterward, I felt used, angry, helpless. I\u2019d panicked and turned someone who was going to be an undead terror. I was ashamed of what I\u2019d done. I knew what sort of evil she would be capable of, and yet I still couldn\u2019t bring myself to destroy her, to keep her from rising and walking the earth.</p><p>\u201cI slept\u2014on the floor of the hotel room\u2014and when I rose that night, I took her to the home of a friend, a fellow vampire. A woman, Violette, who was three hundred forty years old at the time and less likely to be manipulated by Jeanine. I hoped that when she arose, Violette would prove to be a mentor, a stabilizing influence. By that time, I\u2019d booked passage to China.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDramatic,\u201d I noted.</p><p>\u201cNecessary,\u201d Gabriel countered. \u201cJeanine is a prime example of a vampire who changed not at all after she was turned. She\u2019s just as neurotic and self-absorbed now as she was then. She\u2019s the only hypochondriac vampire I\u2019ve ever met. She travels with a humidifier, for God\u2019s sake. She\u2019s so convinced that every place she goes will be her \u2018final resting place\u2019 that she carries all of her possessions with her in a moving van.\u201d</p><p>I snickered, but he continued, \u201cAnd when vampirism didn\u2019t change the way she looked at herself, the way she felt, she blamed me. She believes she\u2019s a lesser vampire. She said that I didn\u2019t turn her properly. She believes she\u2019s still weak and sickly, so, obviously, she didn\u2019t get enough of my blood. She wants me to try to turn her again .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that even possible?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOnce your transformation is complete, that\u2019s the way you\u2019ll remain for the rest of your existence. The point is that I did turn Jeanine completely. I gave her more than enough of my blood. She refuses to believe me. I\u2019ve tried to talk some sense into her, to teach her restraint, but when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants, her tantrums turn out to be massacres. She became convinced that the only \u2018cure\u2019 for her condition was the blood of those who had lived in high altitudes, so she drained every nun in a convent in Tibet. She\u2019s butchered hospitals\u2019 worth of doctors because they can\u2019t find any way to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s spent almost one hundred years trying to track me down, doing what she can to isolate me, ruin my friendships, my relationships with women. She\u2019ll become dormant for a few years, while she \u2018recuperates\u2019 at a mineral spring or a monastery or some other supposedly curative location. And then she\u2019ll get restless and start up again. When it became clear that she was beyond my help, my focus became keeping her away from the people, the places I cared about. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve spent so much time bouncing between the Hollow and, well, the rest of the world for the last century. She says I owe her, that I made her, and now I\u2019m responsible for what she\u2019s become. And she\u2019s right. She\u2019s my creation. The blood of every person she\u2019s ever killed is on my hands.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pressed his face against my shoulder, cringing as if he expected me to start screaming and hitting him. I waited a beat before saying, \u201cSo, really, I\u2019m not the craziest girl you\u2019ve ever dated. That\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grasp of the weight of this situation is amazing,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... you\u2019re not angry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m angry!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m freaking furious with you right now. If I was up to full strength, I would kick your ass from here to Sunday. I can\u2019t believe that this is what you kept from me all these months. I thought you cheated on me! You let me suffer and mope and go months without seeing you because of some issue with a bratty childe? You and your stupid overactive conscience! From now on, you are going to gauge the severity of your actions by answering the question, \u2018Would Dick think this was a good idea?\u2019 and if the answer is no, that\u2019s when you know you\u2019ve done something really, really wrong. Either way, just tell me about it so we avoid these dramatics. If you had told me about this months ago, I would have helped you track her down and lock her in some vampire nut ward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I didn\u2019t tell you. I didn\u2019t want you to know what I\u2019d let happen, that I wasn\u2019t even trying to stop her anymore, just outrun her. I shouldn\u2019t have lied to you. And it kills me that I hurt you in a misguided attempt to protect you, especially when it seems that isn\u2019t doing any good. All I can say is that I panicked. I was ashamed. I was trying so hard to cover my tracks that I lost sight of what was important\u2014you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you ashamed?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He lifted my chin, meeting my eyes. \u201cI was a coward. If this had happened to you, you would have stopped her. You would have gone after her with both barrels and talked her into submission. And when you left me in that hotel room, I was torn between wanting to drop to my knees, tell you everything, and beg your forgiveness and wanting you to leave, to get away so you would be far from Jeanine and her madness. I thought I\u2019d feel better once you were home, but I was decimated. I sat in that hotel room for a week, unsure of what to do, where to go, how to feel, all the while hoping you would come back but knowing that you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, decimated means \u2018the reduction of a military force by one-tenth,\u2019\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I love it when you do that.\u201d He sighed, pressing his face into my hair. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone to correct me or fill my head with useless trivia for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou poor soul,\u201d I muttered, smiling despite myself. \u201cBesides, I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re a coward. You pushed a tree on top of a guy for me.\u201d I laced my arms around his waist and pulled him against me. \u201cSo, you were wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was absolutely, unequivocally, undeniably, one-hundred-percent wrong,\u201d he agreed, accenting each word with a soft kiss on my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhich would mean ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you were absolutely, unequivocally, undeniably, one-hundred-percent right,\u201d he said, again with the kissing.</p><p>\u201cYou know, a woman waits her whole life to hear those words.\u201d I sighed. I straightened, lifting my head. I looked up into his face and caught a flicker of uncertainty. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s with the face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can believe Jeanine sent you letters,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd maybe even rubbing your house with exotic, unpleasant fruit. But the silver, that seems rather aggressive for her. She\u2019s absolutely phobic of any sort of silver, claims she\u2019s more sensitive to it than most vampires because of her delicate constitution. For her to send it to you, she must be getting desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither that, or I have another stalker,\u201d I wisecracked. \u201cOh, crap. You said you\u2019ve turned three people including me. Who was the third?\u201d I poked him when he didn\u2019t respond. \u201cTotal honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a much shorter story. I met Brandley in the 1950s in London. He was a young medical student, brilliant. He spent most of his time in a lab, studying vaccines. From the moment I met him, I could tell that he was very ill. There was a taint to his scent, an undercurrent of decay. Leukemia. But when I thought of what he could accomplish, how he could benefit mankind when he had unlimited time to conduct his research, I gave him a choice: impending natural death or everlasting life. He took it. I was so careful turning him, staying with him until he rose, coaching him through those first few days. And at first, it was wonderful to have a companion, someone to hunt with, to talk to. Like yours, Brandley\u2019s learning curve was quite steep. He adjusted beautifully to his new life. But unlike you, Brandley had an enormous aptitude for cruelty. He had no interest in study or science when he could spend his nights drowning in the blood of his victims. I tried to teach him patience, pity for his food, but for him, the meal seemed incomplete if they survived.\u201d</p><p>I chewed my lip. \u201cShould we worry about Brandley coming after us, because I don\u2019t want to go through this whole bratty demon stepchilde thing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandley\u2019s dead. He was killed by an angry Welsh mob who objected to his tendency of feeding off their very young daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s dead?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, they cut his head off, so, yes.\u201d</p><p>I was quiet for a long moment. \u201cYou have really, really bad luck when it comes to vampire children, don\u2019t you? I mean, how could you have worked up the nerve to turn me? Because it could have gone just horribly, horribly wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say it hasn\u2019t?\u201d Gabriel muttered. \u201cAnd stop using adverbs twice, it\u2019s insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, why would you put yourself through that when you\u2019d had such terrible experiences as a sire?\u201d</p><p>He kissed me, pressing his lips ever so softly against mine. \u201cBecause you were different. When I told you that your goodness and your innocence set you apart, I meant it. I\u2019d had reservations when I turned Jeanine and some reluctance about turning Brandley. But when I saw you, bleeding and dying, I knew without a doubt that you deserved a second chance, that you would make the most of your vampire life, without cruelty, without being petty or selfish. You\u2019re the best part of me, Jane, the gift I could give the world to make up for past wrongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s either incredibly beautiful or a lot of pressure to put on me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel snorted. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a lover I\u2019ve met as a human and known as a vampire. I\u2019ve never made love to someone I sired. I didn\u2019t count on my feelings of love and concern and responsibility twisting into such a confusing mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m your first?\u201d</p><p>He seemed startled by the question. \u201cYes! The last thing on my mind was sex with Jeanine, and, well, Brandley was a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve never ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I threw up my hands. \u201cHey, vampires are hypersexual creatures. Our boundaries are not like those of humans. And then, of course, there\u2019s all that tension between you and Dick. You can\u2019t really blame me for thinking\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJane!\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cOK. You\u2019re totally heterosexual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying my discomfort right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cImmensely,\u201d I told him, snickering as I bit down on his bottom lip. \u201cThis is my proposal, simple and to the point: we track this Jeanine twit down and kick her ass.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sighed again, burying his face in my hair. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>I would have gotten into a long-term relationship years ago if someone had told me about the almighty power of makeup sex.</p><p>We talked long into the night about our months apart. We seemed to see it as a competition, who missed whom more. I described my bathrobe-encased moping. He countered with the fact that he let Zeb take him to karaoke night at the Cellar to sing sad break-up songs, including \u201cThere\u2019s a Tear in My Beer.\u201d I told him about my evening of drinking with Dick, carefully omitting the bar fight, for Dick\u2019s sake. Gabriel confessed to keeping one of my T-shirts in bed with him so he could smell me while he slept.</p><p>\u201cYou are now officially a sixteen-year-old girl.\u201d I giggled, stroking his back. \u201cWait a minute, what did you do with the panties you stole in the alley?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s best we don\u2019t discuss that,\u201d he said, nuzzling my collarbone. \u201cWe\u2019ve already established that I missed you more than you missed me. Let\u2019s leave it at that. I am the truly pathetic winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it winning, per se,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cBut I think I have you beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can be more pathetic than sexually objectifying your New Kids on the Block T-shirt?\u201d he asked, arching a brow.</p><p>I rolled, letting his weight pin me pleasantly against the mattress as I held his face over mine. \u201cMy body craved you so much that I couldn\u2019t sleep for all the sex dreams I was having. Full-color, surround-sound, waking up in the middle of multiple-orgasm extravaganzas that tortured me every single night. I didn\u2019t know whether to be angry at my subconscious for not being able to let you go or grateful that I was able to hold on to you even in that empty, barely satisfying way.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s mouth went slack, and I think I heard his brain shatter like glass. He wheezed, \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>I launched into detailed descriptions of my dreams, because I figured, why suffer alone? I told him about what was basically a reimagining of my losing my virginity in college, only it was Gabriel hiking me up against the stacks of the Russian folklore section of the university library. And we ended up christening the special-collections room as well as the reference section. He groaned when I told him about the one where he was my boss and I had to be \u201cdisciplined\u201d against his desk for improperly filing a report. I recounted the scenario involving him and a pint of Chocolate Overload ice cream just to be mean. When I got to the Victorian dream, I left out the bloodier, upsetting aspects to focus on the setting and the fancy clothes. I stumbled over the, um, oral exam, because I was new to the dirty talk and couldn\u2019t seem to find the balance between sexy-dirty and gross-dirty. Seriously, Naughty Jane can only keep up the fa\u00e7ade for so long.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop now,\u201d Gabriel said, his eyes dark and slightly unfocused. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how this one ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing,\u201d I confessed, suddenly wanting the bed to open up and swallow me. I\u2019d gone from wet and ready temptress to stuttering novice in three seconds flat. If I could have blushed, my face would have lit up like a flame. \u201cI will say that you kissed me somewhere that you\u2019ve never kissed me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike in the backseat of a car?\u201d he asked, his tone teasing.</p><p>\u201cYes, you kissed my Honda.\u201d I snickered, slapping at his shoulder as he spread kisses in the valley between my breasts, the little dip in my belly button. When he nudged the tip of his nose to the lace waistband of my panties, my hips bucked up from the bed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I want to know how this one ends,\u201d he said, peeling my underwear away. I let out a slow, jittery breath as the cool air hit my damp, trickling flesh. I made a noise between a yelp and a sigh when Gabriel\u2019s tongue made that first long, achingly slow slide against me. Gabriel murmured, \u201cHow will we know if the dream was accurate unless we let it play out?\u201d</p><p>My hips bucked up, pressing me against his mouth as his lips danced across my center. His hands slipped under my butt and lifted me closer, my legs slipping over his back. He nipped and kissed and teased while my body pitched. Hot spikes of pleasure coiled in my belly, stretching each nerve until every stroke of his mouth was almost painful. And just like my dream, the moment the tip of his tongue flicked at that little elusive pearl of nerves, I came, howling.</p><p>Pushing my thighs apart and settling between them, Gabriel slid up the length of my body, kissing and nipping until he reached my mouth. As his tongue, still tasting of my own arousal, swept into my mouth, he filled me to the hilt. Whatever breath we had left was released in one long sigh.</p><p>He spread my knees wide, tucking my ankles around the small of his back as he withdrew. I whimpered just as he snapped his hips and drove deeper. He brought me to my peak over and over and then pulled back, drawing out our release. I lost track of time, of rhythm, of anything but the delicious friction. Gabriel brushed his lips over my closed eyelids. My eyes fluttered open as his fangs peeked over his lips. He smiled, bending his head to my throat and delicately scraping his sharp teeth against my skin. I arched my neck. He sank his fangs into my skin, drawing blood to the wound with insistent, gentle pressure. I turned my head toward the palm cupping my face, biting down on the skin just below his wrist as his movements became more frantic.</p> <p>He gasped as I swallowed the first mouthful of blood. The connection, the flow of blood seemed to open up some little window between us. I\u2019d never caught so much as a hint of what Gabriel was thinking before. And now I could feel everything he felt\u2014the love he had for me, his relief at being able to touch me again, the pleasure I was giving him. It was all laid open for me. And when I thought, \u201cI love you, too,\u201d he gasped again, as if he heard me. The thought sent him toppling over the edge and dragged me with him.</p><p>In my head, the lesser, dream version of Gabriel was sent packing with his stupid tuxedo jacket thrown after him.</p><p>13</p><p>There comes a time to accept that some relationship patterns will never change. The problem with being a vampire is that it can take hundreds of years for that time to come.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>Mama had outdone herself.</p><p>With little effort or prompting on my part, my mother had pulled together a baby shower that would have made Martha Stewart turn chartreuse with envy.</p><p>\u201cOh. ... my.\u201d Jolene sighed as I helped her waddle through the front door of my parents\u2019 house.</p><p>Since the ultrasounds had been unclear as far as the twins\u2019 gender, Mom had kept things charmingly gender-neutral. A hand-sewn banner shouting \u201cCongratulations!\u201d in appliqu\u00e9d pink and blue letters hung over the foyer table. On the table, guests could \u201csign in\u201d by autographing a little baby album for Jolene and offering her an invaluable piece of parenting wisdom. To our left, the parlor\u2019s chairs were arranged in a circle around a small pile of beautifully wrapped presents. A clothesline was strung on one side of the room, artfully hung with little gender-neutral baby outfits, matching socks, and hats I knew Mama wouldn\u2019t have been able to resist buying for the twins. To our right, Mama had dressed the dining table with little votives of wildflowers between plates of rattle-shaped cookies and candy-colored petit-fours.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all so beautiful.\u201d Jolene sighed again. \u201cAnd no one\u2019s naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s not a baby shower prerequisite, it should be,\u201d I said, shuddering as Mama came into the dining room with a huge bowl of her special strawberry \u201cshower punch.\u201d I groaned. Every Southern woman prides herself on her own special shower-punch recipe, whether it\u2019s combining lime sherbet and ginger ale or creating a frozen ring of pulverized pineapple in a bundt pan and letting it slowly melt in a punchbowl full of orange juice. Mama had never revealed her secret punch formula to me. Personally, I\u2019d never understood the appeal of combining bizarre ingredients in unnecessarily complicated ways when popping the top of a Coke can was so much easier.</p><p>That\u2019s probably why I wasn\u2019t in charge of the shower.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mrs. Jameson, it\u2019s so ... thank you.\u201d Jolene sniffled, throwing her arms around Mama\u2019s neck. Mama, who was not familiar with werewolf strength, winced in Jolene\u2019s grip but patted her on the back.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I\u2019m happy to do it. Zeb means a lot to John and me. That means you do, too,\u201d she said, gently peeling Jolene\u2019s arms away so she could breathe. \u201cNow, Jane said you\u2019d had a pretty hearty appetite lately. So I made you a little snack to pick at before everybody gets here. Why don\u2019t you go make yourself at home in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow as Jolene followed her nose into the kitchen. Through the door, I heard her squeal, \u201cShe baked me a ham!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeb told me Jolene could go through a lot of food,\u201d Mama said, carefully placing the punchbowl on the table. \u201cYou sure do have an interesting group of friends, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mama,\u201d I said, kissing her cheek. \u201cReally, it\u2019s beautiful. Hey, what did you mean by \u2018everybody\u2019? It\u2019s just going to be me, Gabriel, Dick, Andrea, you guys, Aunt Jettie, and Mr. Wainwright. You\u2019ve put together a gorgeous spread for a bunch of people who don\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>Both Jolene\u2019s and Zeb\u2019s relatives were conspicuously absent from the guest list. I think we can all agree that was for the best.</p><p>\u201cI may have invited a few more people,\u201d Mama said. \u201cThere are a lot of parents who know Zeb from school, people my age who knew him when he was little, who want to help him celebrate the babies. Plus ... I may have sent invitations to all your aunts and cousins, making it sound like Jolene was somehow related to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had to go to all their showers and their daughters\u2019 showers,\u201d she huffed, looking slightly embarrassed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to need one, so I\u2019m calling in all your chips for Jolene. No one can remember half of the names in this family anyway. They\u2019ll show up, give her a present, and walk away thinking they\u2019ve done their duty for a distant relation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ...\u201d I laughed. \u201cActually kind of brilliant. I underestimate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConstantly,\u201d Mama told me. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t want you to worry about the boys. Your daddy\u2019s got a card table set up out back with enough beer and poker chips to keep them entertained for hours. He\u2019s actually pretty excited about spending some time with Dick and Gabriel. He has this list with all kinds of questions about the Civil War. And I\u2019m so glad you and Gabriel have come to your senses, honey. You\u2019re perfect for each other. All you have to do now is get him to put that ring on your finger ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019m not legally allowed to get married,\u201d I told her. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be much point in our getting engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I know this is a sore subject. I would just feel better if I knew you were settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019m going to live forever, and so is my boyfriend. I think that\u2019s about as settled as you could expect, considering the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Mama considered that for a moment and seemed satisfied.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I think we have a more immediate problem. As much as I appreciate you planning this expanded shindig for Jolene, what are we going to do about the extra guests? What if people don\u2019t want me around because of the undead issue? This would be the first time I\u2019ve seen a lot of the aunts and cousins since ... Oh, wait, is Grandma Ruthie coming?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI decided it was best not to invite your grandma,\u201d Mama said, carefully adjusting the folds of a chair cover. \u201cAnd honey, if anybody has a problem with you being here, they can get the hell out of my house.\u201d</p><p>I blinked back the mysterious moisture gathering at the corners of my eyes. \u201cThanks, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s ready for some Texas Hold \u2019Em?\u201d Daddy boomed as he came downstairs in his silly translucent green dealer\u2019s visor. It went well with his lucky rainbow suspenders.</p> <p>Dick was going to eat my father alive.</p><p>\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t playing for money, right?\u201d I asked.</p><p>I will admit to sweating a little when the doorbell rang.</p><p>The first guest to arrive was Iris Bodeen, a distant relative of one of my step-grandpas and an avid \u201cband mom\u201d when Zeb and I were in the Marching Howler Band. She handed Jolene a case of diapers and told her what a catch she\u2019d snagged.</p><p>\u201cZeb was always good to my Jessica, even when she was going through her awkward phase,\u201d Mrs. Bodeen said of her daughter, who had developed debilitating acne our sophomore year. \u201cHe was kind, even when it would have been easier not to be. He\u2019s going to be a wonderful father.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene beamed at her.</p><p>Nina Tipton, whose rambunctious twins had made Zeb\u2019s life hell his first year of teaching, almost cried when she talked about Zeb\u2019s patience with them. \u201cA lot of teachers would have just washed their hands of my boys ... especially after the clown incident. But your husband worked and worked until they were able to sit still for a whole day without punching or kicking or trying out new wrestling moves. They would have been expelled from elementary school if it wasn\u2019t for Zeb Lavelle.\u201d</p><p>And on and on it went. It was a shame that Zeb couldn\u2019t hear these testimonials, as he was sequestered on the back porch. An avid fan of the Gambler movies, Daddy was doing his best riverboat-dealer shtick for Dick, Gabriel, Zeb, and Mr. Wainwright. I frequently snuck to the back window to check on the \u201cmenfolk.\u201d Mr. Wainwright seemed to be floating silently behind Gabriel giving Dick clues about Gabriel\u2019s hand. I sent Aunt Jettie outside to even the playing field.</p><p>So far, I\u2019d managed to stay under the radar, helping Andrea keep the plates filled while Mama handled hosting duties. The guests I did come across didn\u2019t seem surprised or alarmed to see me. Well, my cousin Junie was making it a point not to speak to me. But that had far more to do with my discussing her stripping career near a microphone at a family funeral the year before than any vampire issues.</p><p>\u201cJanie, honey, how have you been?\u201d asked Loralee Warner, who worked with Mama at A Stitch in Time. Loralee\u2019s usual mode at any party was to camp next to the buffet and watch the proceedings from there. She was a fan of tiny food she didn\u2019t have to cook herself.</p><p>I lifted an eyebrow and searched for potential double meanings in Loralee\u2019s words. I couldn\u2019t find any.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Miss Loralee. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my hair\u2019s grayer, and my butt\u2019s bigger, but what else is new?\u201d She snorted. \u201cYou know, your mama told me about your, um, big changes that you\u2019ve been going through.\u201d</p><p>I could only imagine what Mama and Loralee talked about while trapped in the quilt shop for hours. On Mama\u2019s frustrated days, I doubted I came across in a flattering light. \u201cI\u2019m sure she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, my sister\u2019s boy, Jason, he was turned last year.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBut it turned out to be the best thing for him. He actually had to think about what he did before he did it. Was it safe for him to leave the house? Did he have enough blood to get him through the week? Was he talking smart to a vampire who was older and stronger than he was? He had to do a lot of growing up. He\u2019s almost tolerable to be around now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s something to strive for,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cYour friend Jolene,\u201d Loralee said quietly. \u201cShe\u2019s not quite human, either, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anybody,\u201d I whispered, looking to see if the other guests overhead her. They were far too engrossed in Jolene\u2019s opening what appeared to be a vibrating musical baby swing with five speeds.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Loralee said. \u201cThe way I see it, you vampires and whatever Jolene is, you\u2019re just making things more interesting for the rest of us. Are there any more sausage balls?\u201d</p> <p>And with that dizzying change of subject, the conversation was over. No one in this crowd, it seemed, cared that I was a vampire. These were people who had known me since the day I was born. Their children had attended my birthday parties. They\u2019d attended all of my step-grandpas\u2019 funerals. Being with them now was no different from when I was a human. As long as I kept the frothy punch flowing, I was welcome. Now, that wasn\u2019t to say that I would be welcome in any crowd. There was a good chance that for the next fifty years, I would walk into any conversation with a human who knew me before I was turned expecting some sort of insult or rejection\u2014which was a result of my own neurotic nature, really. Humans were neither all good nor all bad. And just as in my interactions with vampires, I would have to approach each of them on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The fact that it had taken me this long to come to this \u201cstunning\u201d conclusion made me a little sad.</p><p>I wiped my hands on a tea towel and made my way over to Jolene, who was cooing over the double bassinet Andrea and Dick had given her.</p><p>\u201cDick wanted to buy you a breast pump.\u201d Andrea snorted. \u201cI learned never to take him into a baby store. Ever. He snickered every time he heard the word \u2018nipple.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what you get for dating a giant twelve-year-old,\u201d I told her, sitting on Jolene\u2019s left.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, they\u2019re all that way,\u201d my mother\u2019s best friend, Carol Ann Reilly, told me in a world-weary tone.</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s all smug and secure now that she\u2019s made up with her boyfriend,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend is more of a giant fourteen-year-old,\u201d I muttered. \u201cJust as emotionally immature but somehow more dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, they\u2019re all that way, too,\u201d Carol Ann assured me again.</p><p>It was far from the small family shower I had planned, but Jolene was positively glowing with every exchange. We cooed and awed appropriately over every little outfit, crib sheet, and stuffed animal. Hell, I got a little emotional over Jolene\u2019s shiny new wipes warmer.</p><p>By the end of the evening, my relatives were convinced that they remembered Jolene from family reunions when she a little girl. She was invited to join several Mommy and Me groups and a sewing circle. Mama considered her baby-shower-related social debts settled.</p><p>The boys were allowed back into the house after the ladies left, trailing cigar smoke and chip crumbs in their wake. Considering what Gabriel and I had been up to, I fully expected to burst into embarrassed flames at being in the same room with both him and my father. Let\u2019s just say that we\u2019d spent several evenings experimenting, and we\u2019d figured out that I could read Gabriel\u2019s mind if I was drinking his blood during exactly the \u201cright moment\u201d during sex. Unfortunately, his thoughts tended toward the possessive grunty male part of his personality. We were still working on deeper, more meaningful communication, hence the spontaneous combustion of parental shame.</p><p>I focused on helping Mama with the dirty-dish patrol. The heavily pregnant Jolene, despite having eaten her weight in sausage balls during the shower, tucked into a heaping bowl of ice cream and Canadian bacon. Daddy, Andrea, and Zeb made a furtive grab at whatever food Jolene hadn\u2019t claimed.</p><p>When Daddy finally took a break from grilling Dick and Gabriel about their nineteenth-century childhoods, Gabriel took Dick into the parlor and handed him a little leather portfolio containing the deed to the Cheney family manse. Considering that they\u2019d spent the evening gambling, I took this as a bad sign. But it seemed to be something that Gabriel had been thinking about for a long time.</p><p>\u201cI want you to have it back,\u201d he told Dick. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can ever really repay you for being the kind of friend Jane needed, but I can give you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Dick protested. \u201cYou know what that bet cost us. To take it back now would just make it all pointless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to be rude, but it was all pointless,\u201d I noted from across the room. Four eyes narrowed at me. \u201cWhat? I said not to be rude. That\u2019s like saying \u2018God bless them\u2019 right after you say bad things about someone. It means it doesn\u2019t count!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d Daddy whispered, clearly fascinated.</p><p>\u201cDid Dick win at cards tonight?\u201d I asked Daddy. Daddy nodded. \u201cWell, he tended to play drunk when he and Gabriel were human, so he usually lost. Dick lost his family\u2019s house to Gabriel. The pair of them are so stubborn that it\u2019s taken them this long to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Daddy couldn\u2019t have been happier than a desperate housewife watching her favorite \u201cstories.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel cleared his throat. I had the good sense to seem sheepish and mouth, \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all you\u2019ve done for Jane, it\u2019s the least I can do,\u201d Gabriel said, pressing the portfolio into Dick\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, son. I\u2019m sorry we let it get this far. I\u2019ve missed having you around the last hundred or so years,\u201d Dick said, looking the most human he had since I\u2019d met him. He looked younger somehow, more vulnerable. He took the portfolio but then looked up, his eyes pleading. \u201cCan I still irritate the hell out of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do if you didn\u2019t,\u201d Gabriel said honestly. \u201cI think you would sicken and die.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands and gave each other manly punches on the arm. Dick announced to Andrea that they were moving up in the world, to a deluxe antebellum home that she could redecorate to her heart\u2019s content. Then he lovingly fed her a deviled egg. Andrea blushed, especially when Dick tried to kiss her afterward. Deviled eggs are not a sexy food.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean that we\u2019re going to be double-dating now?\u201d I asked. Andrea rolled her eyes.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s grin was wicked. \u201cYes, because I think it\u2019s only fair that since Dick got my girlfriend into a bar fight, I should be able to take his girlfriend out on the town and put her in danger while he watches. Maybe we can go to a biker convention.\u201d</p><p>Dick growled. \u201cHey, Jane fared better in that fight than I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t involved in the fight with Walter,\u201d Gabriel said, his brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cNot that one, the other one, with Todd. The one ... you don\u2019t know about.\u201d Dick grimaced. \u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got her into another bar fight?\u201d Gabriel exclaimed. \u201cYou were supposed to be looking out for her, not putting her in harm\u2019s way! That\u2019s it. Dick, Jane, from now on, all of your play dates are supervised. Andrea, sweetheart, I\u2019m taking you sky-diving. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p><p>Daddy laughed and headed into the kitchen for another round of beers. Andrea climbed into Dick\u2019s lap and suggested alternative activities, such as bull riding, swimming the Ohio River during peak barge traffic, motocross racing without helmets, and letting me cook for her. Dick\u2019s scowl grew deeper with each suggestion. Having finished the world\u2019s most disgusting sundae, Jolene was propped up against Zeb\u2019s side, both of their hands gravitating to her enormous belly. Jettie was distracted from inventorying Jolene\u2019s loot with a fond pat on the cheek from Mr. Wainwright.</p><p>I had a family. A family that loved me, without judgment, without reserve. And my parents had somehow fallen right into this motley crew and were enjoying themselves. Sure, there were blood relatives out there who couldn\u2019t stand the sight of me, but I could fall back on these people. They would fight for me, kiss my booboos, take me out for tequila shooters when life got me down. I didn\u2019t need more than that. All was right with my world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, it made sense that my grandma Ruthie chose this moment to come storming through the door.</p><p>\u201cJane Enid Jameson!\u201d she thundered, slamming the door behind her. Grandma was in a fine froth, her snowy white hair frazzled and her cheeks flushed. She was dressed in a pink and orange plaid pantsuit, the kind of thing that would send Aunt Jettie into a giggle fit when she was living. Apparently, it worked its wonders after death, too, because my ghostly aunt was laughing her invisible ass off. And she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cEnid?\u201d Dick snickered.</p> <p>I ignored Dick\u2019s low laughter as Grandma screeched, \u201cHow could you embarrass your sister that way? She told me what you did at the Chamber of Commerce meeting. How could you? You know how important her public image is with this new business she\u2019s starting. How dare you attempt to sabotage her by telling prominent members of our community that she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelated to me?\u201d I tried to keep my voice calm as I said, \u201cGrandma Ruthie, as you can see, I have guests. Maybe we can have this discussion at another time.\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me when and where I can talk to you, young lady!\u201d she yelled. \u201cThis is your mother\u2019s house. I\u2019ll come and go as I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, what is all this fuss about?\u201d my mother asked as she came out of the kitchen. \u201cJust calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down, Sherry,\u201d Grandma Ruthie snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that you\u2019ve continued to let Jane into your home, but now you\u2019re letting her drag her undesirables into your living room? Hosting parties for them? This foolishness has gone on long enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that in front of my friends,\u201d I told my grandmother.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t mind us,\u201d Jolene said, transfixed by the family feud unfolding in front of her. I\u2019m sure it was a novelty for her, considering that most McClaine family disputes ended in both parties phasing and proving their werewolf fighting skills. Usually naked.</p><p>\u201c These are your friends?\u201d Grandma Ruthie sneered, observing my motley group, my chosen family. \u201c These are the type of people you spend time with under your great-great-grandfather\u2019s roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it, Grandma,\u201d I warned her, seeing the expression of insult on Andrea\u2019s face. Dick, on the other hand, was used to that sort of comment and remained unperturbed.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s all just calm down,\u201d Mama said in a different tone from the one she normally used during these confrontations. She wasn\u2019t trying to placate Grandma. She was just trying to keep us from coming to blows in her parlor. That was weird.</p><p>Grandma drew herself up to her full height and used her matriarch voice. \u201cI will speak my mind, Jane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, you\u2019ll speak it in the kitchen.\u201d I put my hand under Grandma\u2019s elbow and not-quite-gently led her through the kitchen\u2019s swinging door.</p><p>Mama warned, \u201cNow, Jane, be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019m not going to hurt her.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I know that,\u201d Mama assured me. \u201cIt\u2019s just that all of my nice dishes are sitting out on the counter. Try not to break anything.\u201d</p><p>I barked out a laugh. \u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s had it coming for years,\u201d Daddy told me. \u201cYour mama\u2019s just not ready to do it herself yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d Mama promised. \u201cShe can\u2019t keep talking to you that way. I\u2019ve let it go on for far too long. Maybe if I\u2019d stood up to her years ago, we\u2019d have a better relationship. You and I might have had a better relationship. I\u2019m trying to set some boundaries with her, honey, but she\u2019s so old. And I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared of her?\u201d I suggested.</p> <p>Mama nodded. \u201cGive her hell, baby.\u201d</p><p>That said, I squared my shoulders and marched into the kitchen to face off with my tiny septuagenarian foe.</p><p>\u201cBe as rude to me as you\u2019d like,\u201d I told her. \u201cBut don\u2019t ever insult the people in that room in my presence, do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you talk to me that way,\u201d Grandma snapped. \u201cYou were raised to have respect for your elders, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was raised to have respect for people who show respect to me. That\u2019s something you have never done. Now, why don\u2019t you go home to your half-dead fianc\u00e9 and let me and Jenny figure out our issues for ourselves?\u201d</p><p>Grandma stamped her size-six orthopedic shoe. \u201cYou will apologize to your sister, Jane. And you will end this foolishness with the lawsuit and give Jenny her share of the Early legacy. I command it.\u201d</p><p>I goggled at the raging geriatric before me and then burst out laughing so loudly that Gabriel stuck his head through the doorway to check on me. I waved him away as I leaned against the counter for support and let the bloody tears roll down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, giggling. \u201cDid you just command me to do something? Have we met? Has that ever worked for you? Jenny got her share of the \u2018Early legacy.\u2019 She took it, out of the house one piece at a time, without asking. And so did you. You\u2019ve been smuggling valuables out of that house since Aunt Jettie\u2019s funeral. Don\u2019t pretend otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you something about your precious aunt Jettie,\u201d Grandma spat.</p><p>In the corner of my eye, I could see Aunt Jettie squinting at the dry-erase marker Mama kept on her refrigerator. She grasped it and began to scrawl on the front of the fridge. Ruthie\u2019s face froze in horror as an invisible hand eked out, \u201cRuthie ... This is Jettie ... I need ... to tell you ... you\u2019ve gotten fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re doing that, but stop it. It\u2019s morbid,\u201d Grandma scolded, her face paling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m telepathic, not telekinetic. Aunt Jettie, maybe you shouldn\u2019t ...\u201d</p><p>Aunt Jettie winked at me. \u201cHoney, she\u2019s had this coming for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, stop that right now!\u201d Grandma yelled as Jettie called her a \u201cnatural brunette,\u201d underlining \u201cnatural\u201d three times.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s Jettie,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s been haunting the house ever since she died. I wasn\u2019t able to see her until I was turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf all the sick jokes,\u201d Grandma Ruthie spat. \u201cHow dare you use my sister\u2019s memory this way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, you can believe in vampires but not in ghosts?\u201d</p><p>Grandma Ruthie sneered at me.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWhat if I told you something that only Jettie would know?\u201d I asked as Jettie leaned in to whisper in my ear.</p><p>Grandma\u2019s mouth flapped open like a beached guppy\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m not going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Jettie says that if you don\u2019t cut me some slack, she\u2019s going to visit your mother and tell her all about what you were doing in Edgar Oliver\u2019s backseat when you were supposed to be at Bible study.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie blanched. \u201cHow could you\u2014my mother\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Jettie can go over to the Half-Moon Hollow Women\u2019s Clubhouse anytime she wants and visit Grandma Bebe. That\u2019s the way ghosts work. They can haunt wherever they choose, move from place to place. They even visit each other.\u201d</p><p>OK, that last part was a total bluff. Grandma Bebe was a sweet old lady who had no unfinished needlework, much less unfinished business, when she died. She moved into the light a long time ago. But Ruthie didn\u2019t know that. And I told her that so I could tell her this: \u201cJettie\u2019s even visited Grandpa Fred a few times. He\u2019s haunting the golf course.\u201d</p><p>Jettie cackled with glee as Ruthie\u2019s cheeks drained of color. \u201cYou tell her to stay away from my Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her yourself, Grandma. She can hear you. Much better, in fact, than she could in life. Besides, you\u2019re engaged. Why should you care? And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s your Fred anymore. Remember till death do us part? He\u2019s dead. You\u2019ve parted. Grandpa Fred\u2019s on the market again.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie turned a sickly white under her artfully applied Elizabeth Arden powder. \u201cYou lifeless Jezebel! You stay away from my Fred!\u201d</p><p>At this point, it seemed a moot point to note that Aunt Jettie had actually broken up with Grandpa Fred earlier this year to take up with Mr. Wainwright. Aunt Jettie, obviously enjoying Grandma\u2019s discomfort, seemed to think so, too.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t ... all be yours. Though you ... certainly had more ... than your share,\u201d Jettie scribbled out in surprisingly legible script.</p><p>\u201cDried-up old maid!\u201d Ruthie yelled.</p><p>\u201cBlack widow!\u201d the refrigerator spat back.</p><p>\u201cUnclean spirit!\u201d Ruthie gasped.</p><p>\u201cVaricose-veined ho!\u201d Jettie scrawled, prompting an indignant gasp from Grandma.</p><p>\u201cI will not stand here in my daughter\u2019s home and be insulted!\u201d Ruthie shrieked. \u201cJane, you tell your great-aunt that I will not set foot in River Oaks until she can keep a civil tongue in her skull\u2014which, by the way, never had the bone structure I have. And she was always jealous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door slammed in dramatic fashion.</p><p>\u201cHear you.\u201d I finished.</p><p>Jettie slumped to the floor, clearly exhausted by her telekinetic efforts.</p><p>\u201cThat was awesome,\u201d I marveled. \u201cTelling Grandma everything you\u2019ve ever thought about her doesn\u2019t mean you have closure and you\u2019re moving on, does it? I was just getting used to having you around.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Jettie reached up to stroke her transparent hand along my cheek. \u201cNo, I could have insulted Ruthie while I was living. I\u2019m sticking with you, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d I chuckled. \u201cMy relationship with Grandma isn\u2019t ever going to change, is it?\u201d</p><p>Aunt Jettie led me over to the swinging door, where my friends were crowded, listening. \u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s not. You and Ruthie have exactly the kind of relationship you want with each other. It was the same with us. Ruthie and I chose not to like each other. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s right, but it\u2019s the way things are. There\u2019s no law that says families have to be best friends. You can choose your own family, which you have. Of course, you can also choose to want a better relationship with people you were born to. It\u2019s up to you. Until then, sit at the fountain of my experience and learn Ruthie\u2019s weak points.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Vericose-veined ho\u2019 was one I hadn\u2019t heard before,\u201d I admitted as we pushed through the door, gently popping an eavesdropping Dick in the side of the head.</p><p>Dick cursed. Aunt Jettie shrugged. \u201cYou leave the TV on during the day. I\u2019ve watched a lot of Maury Povich .\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>When you\u2019ve taken all you can, walk away. Be the bigger person. Or at least find a bigger person, and use your vampire strength on them. It\u2019s the sporting thing to do.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>G iven my history with my sister, it was inevitable, really, that we would end up wrestling in the mud, beating each other senseless with pieces of foam rubber.</p><p>The Half-Moon Hollow High parking lot was carefully organized into a carnival grid: flaccid, half-inflated bouncy houses in the south quadrant, food booths in the east, and no fun to be had in either.</p><p>At a normal Hollow charity carnival, the signs were hand-painted posterboard affairs. The games consisted of tossing pool rings over two-liter bottles or softballs into bushel baskets. You paid too much for a corn dog and a stuffed bear, you felt as if you contributed to your community, you went home.</p><p>This Halloween hell hole involved professionally screen-printed signs and catered low-carb treats. I\u2019d suggested a cotton-candy machine, and Head Courtney gave me a look that would have vaporized lesser women. And forget any preconceived notions of streamers or balloons. This was strictly a Martha affair, pumpkins as far as the eye could see, artfully arranged with corn and various raffia accoutrements. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God help us all.</p><p>The spookiest thing about this extravaganza was all of the women in matching pink sweatshirts manically scrambling to make the parking lot into a Halloween casbah, each terrified that Head Courtney would find her efforts wanting and put her on cleanup duty. Given Head Courtney\u2019s less-than-enthusiastic response to the prize boxes I was unloading from Big Bertha and the fact that the rest of the Courtneys had shunned me following my \u201couting,\u201d I already knew who was going to be manning that stupid push broom all night.</p><p>Gabriel had wanted to accompany me to the carnival, but I asked him not to come, just in case I ended up stuck in the dunking booth. I didn\u2019t want him to witness my humiliation. Fortunately, this carnival didn\u2019t have dunking booths. Or clowns, which, for me, was another bright side.</p> <p>Andrea was covering the shop for me while I served my carnival sentence. She and Dick would have the place to themselves for the evening. Emery had announced his intentions to attend a Christian-themed haunted house called \u201cHell House\u201d weeks before. Emery had been spending less and less time at the shop lately. Andrea hoped that meant he\u2019d found a girl to go to prayer meetings with.</p><p>We didn\u2019t have time to overanalyze that possibility\u2014or to consider warning the girl\u2014because we were expecting a big Halloween-night crowd. Adults seeking a safely scary atmosphere. Teenagers looking for supplies to summon the Blair Witch. Having Emery standing in the aisles, trying to hand the customers religious tracts, would probably spoil the ambience.</p><p>Andrea was dressed up like Glinda the Good Witch, covered in pink sparkles from head to toe. The voluminous tulle skirt of her rented costume barely fit behind the coffee bar. Somehow she\u2019d managed to talk Dick into wearing a Scarecrow costume. He looked like an extremely embarrassed Raggedy Andy doll and planned to stay in the stockroom for most of the night.</p><p>\u201cQuit trying to put off going to the carnival,\u201d Andrea had told me, filling a bowl with those rock-hard peanut taffy candies wrapped in orange wax paper. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, I\u2019m going,\u201d I muttered, sliding into my Pepto Bismol pink Chamber of Commerce sweatshirt.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I hope that you realize that as a witch, I am claiming double overtime for you making me work on a religious holiday,\u201d she said, gesturing to her girlie ensemble.</p><p>\u201cWatch it, or I\u2019ll drop a house on you.\u201d I sneered as I walked out the door.</p><p>Since Jenny had yet to show up, Nice Courtney was helping me unload and distribute the prizes to the various game booths. Zeb was pitching in, too, but I think he was just there to get first crack at the funnel cakes. Imagine how sad he was when he found out that this wasn\u2019t that kind of carnival. The closest thing he could get to junk food was a sugar-free caramel apple. Nonetheless, he\u2019d promised to come running, yelling that Jolene was in labor and we had to leave right away, if things got bad with the Courtneys.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s still pretty much a high school parking lot,\u201d I said, hefting a box of free tote bags out of the trunk. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure after everything is inflated, it will be a magical autumn wonderland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep telling yourself that.\u201d Nice Courtney snickered. \u201cWhere do you want the popcorn balls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever Head Courtney won\u2019t see them,\u201d I muttered, throwing a blanket over the individually wrapped offerings from the A&amp;P. \u201cDon\u2019t you know this is a no-carb charity carnival?\u201d</p> <p>Nice Courtney giggled. \u201cI\u2019ll smuggle them to the kids under the guise of giving them their complimentary hand sanitizer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a bad influence on you,\u201d I said, gasping in mock surprise. When I made my escape from the chamber, I hoped that Nice Courtney and I could keep in touch. If nothing else, she\u2019d proven to me that just because people are shiny and preppy, that didn\u2019t make them automatically evil. It was entirely a matter of choice. She\u2019d single-handedly undone a lot of damage that had been inflicted in high school.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d Judging from the look on Jenny\u2019s face as she barreled across the parking lot, I guess she\u2019d heard about my visit with Grandma Ruthie. And being Grandma\u2019s favorite and confidante, it was up to her to set me straight.</p><p>Speaking of shiny and evil personal choices.</p><p>\u201cOh, what now?\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think you are? Are you out of your mind, scaring Grandma like that?\u201d she yelled, her face only inches from mine. \u201cHow could you do that to your own grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You\u2019re yelling at me for my behavior during a conversation with Grandma Ruthie, in which Grandma Ruthie yelled at me for how I behaved during a conversation with you?\u201d I sighed. \u201cDo you two organize a \u2018be a pain in Jane\u2019s ass\u2019 schedule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could have had a heart attack!\u201d Jenny insisted.</p> <p>\u201cOh, please, Ruthie\u2019s an unstoppable force of nature, like the Black Plague or Richard Simmons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Jenny growled through her clenched teeth. \u201cStay away from my family. Mama, Daddy, Grandma, the kids, everybody. You obviously don\u2019t care about us or what we think. So, just stay away from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been lobbying for this since the day I was brought home from the hospital, but you can\u2019t kick me out of our family, Jen,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018our family,\u2019\u201d she spat. \u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell do you think you are?\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t pretend you care about being a part of this family.\u201d She sneered, snagging a foam-rubber \u201ccombat hammer\u201d from the jousting game Head Courtney had banned from the midway. She jabbed it into my chest, backing me into the inflatable bouncy house. The giant clown head that hovered over the entrance leered down at me, and my latent coulrophobia forced me to change directions toward a muddy patch behind the staging area. But not before I was able to grab a foam weapon of my own.</p><p>Jenny poked me again with the hammer. \u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting to get away from us for years. We\u2019re not smart enough for you, not sophisticated enough. Do you think we don\u2019t notice when you make your little jokes under your breath? You\u2019ve wanted to get out of the Hollow for years. Why don\u2019t you just go? We certainly don\u2019t want to keep you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know that I want to leave?\u201d I demanded, smacking her arm with the foam. \u201cHow the hell do you think you come close to knowing how I feel about anything?\u201d Jab to her chest. \u201cFrom our long heart-to-hearts? All those nights you came over to watch Sex and the City ?\u201d Smack to her other arm. \u201cDo you realize that the last time you and I had a conversation that ranged beyond the weather and whatever misinformation Mama\u2019s fed you was at Aunt Jettie\u2019s funeral luncheon? And I think you\u2019d had too many toddies to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re just all about the open, sisterly communication, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She landed a respectable blow to my face, knocking me on my butt into the mud.</p><p>Considering my vampire strength and speed, that was just embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cWhen have you ever made an effort to spend time with me? To get to know me?\u201d She hit my head to punctuate each point. \u201cOh, no, you\u2019re just so freaking above it all, you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to stop sniping for five minutes and just be my sister. Boring old Jenny with her husband and kids. Lame Jenny who likes to play Pictionary with her friends on Friday nights. Silly little Jenny and her silly little hobbies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad because I won\u2019t scrapbook with you?\u201d I asked, dumbfounded, though I\u2019m sure it was more from the ringing blow to my skull after she managed to rip the foam off the plastic bar that supported it. I shook it off and jumped to my feet.</p><p>\u201cEven when we were kids, you thought you were so much better than me!\u201d Jenny yelled, panting as we circled the mud pit. A crowd had gathered, cheering us on. \u201cI never had to worry about you copying me like a normal little sister. No, you wouldn\u2019t lower yourself to my level. I didn\u2019t like the right books. I didn\u2019t like the right music. I wasn\u2019t sarcastic enough for you. Not good enough for Jane. And then you get turned into a freaking vampire! I have to hear from Mama about your fabulous undead makeover, about your undead rights group and your hundred-and-fifty-year-old boyfriend. How can I compete with that?\u201d Each sentence was punctuated with an impressive smack upside my head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad because I\u2019m cooler than you?\u201d I guessed again, but Jenny was too worked up to notice I\u2019d said anything. With a cry that would have made Xena proud, she swept my leg. My feet went flying out from under me, and I landed with a wet thwap on my back.</p><p>She growled. \u201cYou\u2019re always saying that I\u2019m the favorite, that you get treated like a child. You\u2019re always bitching about Mama bringing food over to your house and folding your laundry. Do you know how many times she\u2019s brought dinner over to my house? Twice. After each of the boys was born. I had to go through twenty-three hours of labor without drugs just to get a damn pot pie! You think Daddy ever just drops by my house for a chat and some pizza? You think Mama calls me before I leave for work or checks on me at night when I\u2019m home alone? No, because \u2018Jenny can take care of herself. She never needs any help,\u2019\u201d she cried, throwing her head back and screaming at the sky. I used her distraction to knock her back on her butt and pummel her repeatedly. Jenny, on the other hand, had resorted to flinging mud at me. Literally.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re perfect!\u201d I yelled, throwing a glob of muck into her face. \u201cDo you think it was easy growing up with the Jenny Early as your older sister?\u201d</p><p>Jenny spluttered as she spit the mud out and landed an impressive clump in my hair, considering that she couldn\u2019t see. \u201cDo you think I ever walked into a classroom where the teacher didn\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re Jenny Early\u2019s sister, we know what to expect from you?\u2019 I have to live up to the example of a woman who color-codes her underwear drawer. \u2018Jenny\u2019s so responsible. Jenny\u2019s house is always immaculate. Jenny cooked an entire Thanksgiving dinner and still had time to make place cards out of acorns and rice paper!\u2019 Don\u2019t blame me because you\u2019ve had to live up to your own hype.\u201d</p><p>I pushed up onto my feet, scraping several layers of mud from my face. \u201cAnd frankly, I\u2019m tired of hearing \u2018Oh, that\u2019s just the way Jenny is\u2019 and \u2018She didn\u2019t do it to hurt your feelings, she just likes things a certain way.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have I ever hurt your feelings?\u201d She gasped, trying and failing to stand. She slumped to the ground and looked up at me, squinting through the blood and sweat dripping in her eye.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see, holidays, birthdays, graduations, family dinners, baby showers, church functions, school plays. You put me at another family\u2019s table at your wedding reception, Jenny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want Grandma Ruthie to drive you crazy with questions about when you were going to get married,\u201d Jenny protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd because I embarrass you,\u201d I said, wiping a clod of dirt from my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t embarrass me! You annoy me. You irritate me. You drive me up the damn wall. But OK, wait, the vampire thing, that did embarrass me a little bit. But still, I don\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>Awkward silence. I looked into the future and saw the two of us, fighting and sniping at each other like Grandma Ruthie and Aunt Jettie. Though, obviously, I was immortal, ageless, and way hotter than septuagenarian Jenny. I didn\u2019t want that. I chose not to have that kind of relationship with her. But I didn\u2019t know how to fix it.</p><p>Fortunately, Jenny did.</p><p>\u201cSo, I hurt your feelings?\u201d she asked, the corners of her mouth lifting slightly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to look so dang pleased about it,\u201d I muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not, I just, I didn\u2019t know I could have that effect on you,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou seem ... unflappable sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all a clever ruse,\u201d I said, blowing my bangs out of my face. \u201cI\u2019m extremely flapped most of the time.\u201d</p><p>Jenny wiped at her eyes, but I think that had more to do with her impromptu facial than emotion. \u201cYou\u2019re going to outlive my boys, Jane. And their children, and their children. Don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve thought of that? When my grandchildren are lying in the nursing home, you\u2019re going to be the one packing up everything they own and deciding who gets what. You\u2019re the sole survivor, no matter what any of us does. You\u2019re going to outlast us all. I think that\u2019s why I went so crazy about all those family heirlooms. I figured, it\u2019s going to come to you in the end anyway, so why don\u2019t you let us just borrow it for a little while? And when you said no, I don\u2019t know what came over me ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, the stuff doesn\u2019t matter that much to me, Jenny. I just like to screw with you, and this seems like the only way to get you. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been a little petty about the heirlooms. I just wish you would have told me things like this before, you know, I died,\u201d I offered.</p><p>More awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d I asked, hesitantly sitting next to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, sinking back into the mud, clearly exhausted by her emotional unburdening.</p><p>\u201cYou could stop being such a hag at every single family gathering,\u201d I suggested.</p> <p>She lifted her head to glare at me.</p><p>\u201cToo soon?\u201d I asked. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, we could stop sniping at each other and focus our anger where it belongs,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d Jenny asked. I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be like this forever,\u201d Jenny promised, placing a tentative hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I sniffled. \u201cSomeday Grandma Ruthie will be locked safely away in a home for the elderly/criminally insane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJane!\u201d</p><p>I brightened. \u201cCan I pick the home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has been good,\u201d Jenny said, laughing. \u201cI feel ... lighter somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what a little foam battering can do,\u201d I said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing we stopped where we did, \u2019cause I was this close to kicking your ass.\u201d</p><p>I nodded to the mutilated grass behind us. \u201cWe can always jump back into the mud pit and settle things once and for all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is one of those things where I\u2019m just going to assume you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed, wincing at the sting in my lip as it healed. \u201cProbably for the best.\u201d</p><p>Jenny watched as my skin closed and the bruising faded away. \u201cThat is really cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one of the perks,\u201d I said, grinning as I pulled her to her feet.</p><p>Head Courtney came running over to the foam and mud wreckage. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust settling some family issues.\u201d Jenny chuckled, wiping a spot of blood from her nose.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you two! This is a children\u2019s carnival! You\u2019re ruining everything. Do you realize what you\u2019re going to have to do to work off this many demerits? Never in the history of the Chamber of Commerce\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zeb came running up, frantic. \u201cJane! Jane! We\u2019ve got to go! Jolene\u2019s mom just called. She\u2019s in labor!\u201d</p><p>Head Courtney seemed supremely annoyed at the interruption, but her laser-beam gaze did not falter from its target. My head.</p><p>\u201cZeb, it\u2019s not a big deal. You don\u2019t really have to fake Jolene being in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not faking!\u201d he screamed, his voice reaching an alarming soprano octave.</p><p>Turning my back on Courtney, I forced Zeb to bend over and take some deep breaths. \u201cZeb, calm down. Do you have the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s in the car. Jolene packed in June. She wouldn\u2019t let me help.\u201d</p><p>I reached to pat his shoulder, but when I saw how muddy my hands were, I pulled away. \u201cI think we can all agree that was a wise choice. How about I drive to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I can handle it,\u201d he said, showing me what he thought was a set of keys.</p><p>\u201cZeb, that\u2019s a pair of pliers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should drive,\u201d he conceded.</p><p>\u201cJane, where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Head Courtney thundered. \u201cI\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend is in labor. I\u2019m going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not excuse you!\u201d Head Courtney shrieked. \u201cYou still have duties here at the carnival. There are balloons to be blown up. Garlands to be hung. Lights to be strung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy. Friend. Is. In. Labor,\u201d I repeated very slowly. \u201cI\u2019m going to be with her.\u201d</p><p>Courtney put a restraining hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving. Abandoning an assignment at a special event will result in an automatic suspension, Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? Detention? Expulsion? Firing squad? I don\u2019t have time for this. I\u2019m leaving,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Head Courtney turned an apoplectic purple. \u201cIf you walk out now, I\u2019ll assign you to scoop horse poop after every Founders\u2019 Day parade for the next twenty years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Courtney? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m chamber material after all. So, you can take your precious Fall Festival and shove it up your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, we\u2019ve got to go!\u201d Zeb yelled from the car.</p><p>\u201cDang it, I was really looking forward to that one. Courtney, I quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what I get for letting some filthy bloodsucker into the Chamber of Commerce!\u201d Courtney howled. \u201cWe\u2019re going to destroy your bony, pasty ass, do you understand me, you undead bitch? When we get done with you, you won\u2019t be able to sell so much as a\u2014\u201d</p><p>I had stepped forward, ready to belt Head Courtney in the manner she deserved. But I was cut off by Jenny, who had cocked her fist back and knocked Courtney onto her ass, into a crate full of stuffed Spongebobs.</p><p>\u201cJenny!\u201d I laughed, staring at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNobody talks to my sister that way,\u201d Jenny said, rubbing her knuckles gingerly.</p><p>\u201cYou talk to me that way,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s different. I\u2019m your sister. I\u2019m allowed, but no one else is.\u201d</p><p>Tears sprang into my eyes, and I threw my arms around her. \u201cThanks, sis.\u201d</p><p>Jenny stiffened, then relaxed and squeezed me back. \u201cOh, well, anytime.\u201d</p><p>Zeb cleared his throat. \u201cI hate to interrupt this beautiful family moment, but my wife is having babies . Jane, get in the car!\u201d</p><p>We arrived at the hospital to find Mama Ginger attempting to wrestle her way past a formidable-looking nurse into the maternity ward. Unfortunately for Mama Ginger, the nurse was obviously a John Cena fan and maneuvered Mama Ginger into some sort of pretzel arm-lock position in which she was powerless.</p><p>At the sight of his mother, Zeb stopped in his tracks and muttered several of the seven words you\u2019re not supposed to say in polite company.</p><p>\u201cHow did she know Jolene was here?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t going to call her until a few days after the babies are home from the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zeb said, at this point on the cusp of tears. \u201cShe must have staked out our house! I thought I saw her car driving up and down our road yesterday, but I told myself even Mama wasn\u2019t that crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, you haven\u2019t paid attention for the last thirty or so years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get to Jolene,\u201d Zeb said, his eyes scanning the hall wildly. \u201cIf Mama sees me, I\u2019ll never get past her in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down. This is why Jolene appointed me waiting-room bouncer,\u201d I told him. \u201cBecause I\u2019m willing to do things like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d I shoved Zeb behind the admissions desk, out of Mama Ginger\u2019s sightline.</p><p>\u201cMama Ginger, what are you doing?\u201d I called, waving excitedly.</p><p>Mama Ginger whirled at the sound of my voice, no longer struggling with the hospital\u2019s linebacker. With Mama Ginger distracted, Zeb slunk around the admissions desk, behind her back, and into the maternity ward. She didn\u2019t look pleased to see me, but I did provide the excuse to complain about her treatment in a really loud voice.</p><p>\u201cThis silly woman says they don\u2019t have a patient named Jolene Lavelle listed here, but I know she\u2019s here! I saw her mother\u2019s car out in the parking lot!\u201d she cried, her voice reaching hysterical levels. Several nurses poked their heads into the hallway, but seeing who it was, they ducked back into the patients\u2019 rooms.</p><p>\u201cJolene must be listed as a private patient, Mama Ginger,\u201d I said, keeping my voice soothing. She shied away when I tried to loop my arm through hers, so I took her elbow and led her into the waiting room. \u201cThat means the nurse can\u2019t tell you if she\u2019s here. It\u2019s against the law.\u201d</p><p>When we walked into the waiting room, Jolene\u2019s entire pack was waiting there. It was fortunate that very few women in town seemed destined to have Halloween babies, because there would have been nowhere for their expectant families to sit. Jolene\u2019s aunts, uncles, and cousins were lounging on every available surface. Jolene\u2019s male relatives had that healthy, hearty, but blank look about them. Yes, they were nice to look at, but all hotness aside, I\u2019d like to spend my time with someone who doesn\u2019t live his life according to tenets set forth on Walker, Texas Ranger . The aunts were convened in a corner, eyes darting from one side of the room to the other, absorbing it all. They all seemed to be enjoying the novelty of the experience, with the exception of Aunt Vonnie, whose mouth was puckered and unhappy.</p><p>Mimi and Lonnie McClaine, the only McClaines who liked me, were pacing the room, their stances defensive and agitated. Lonnie McClaine was picking a giant bouquet of carnations to shreds. But fortunately, there were backups. It looked as if the babies were about to be coronated. The room was absolutely packed with flowers and stuffed animals. Half of the flowers were pink, the other half were blue. They had teddy bears wearing tutus and bears wearing baseball uniforms. And a ham, which I guessed was gender-neutral.</p><p>Nothing like covering all of your bases.</p><p>Now that Jolene\u2019s presence in the labor room was confirmed, Mama Ginger started screeching, \u201cI have a right to see my grandchildren born!\u201d</p><p>The entire pack flinched at once. I threw myself on top of Mama Ginger, both to keep her from launching herself toward Jolene\u2019s delivery room and to serve as a shield\u2014just in case Jolene\u2019s relatives still held grudges about Mama Ginger\u2019s wedding-related sabotage. From the floor, I looked up to find a circle of emotionally high-strung werewolves glaring down at us.</p><p>\u201cMimi?\u201d I called. \u201cCould you keep your family from, you know, committing public homicide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, y\u2019all, calm down,\u201d Mimi chided, rolling her eyes. \u201cMy baby\u2019s having babies, I can\u2019t take time to bail your asses out of jail.\u201d</p><p>The pack let out a collective huff and backed down. Because Mimi was the alpha female and they pretty much had to.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my grandbabies,\u201d Mama Ginger whined. \u201cI belong in that delivery room! I\u2019ve been waiting Zeb\u2019s whole life for this. I have the right to be in there with him!\u201d</p><p>Mama Ginger tried to push up off the floor, and I forced her back down. Please, Lord, don\u2019t let someone I know see me wallowing all over the hospital floor on top of Mama Ginger. Or the cops, who would probably assume I was trying forcibly to drain her. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t, Mama Ginger. Whosoever\u2019s hoo-ha is on display, that\u2019s the person who decides who gets to be in the room. And Jolene didn\u2019t even ask her own mother to be in the room, so that should tell you something. Zeb will come and get us when they\u2019re good and ready to see us. Now, just sit down and read a damn magazine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mama Ginger flopped onto a couch and petulantly flipped through a year-old copy of Redbook . In the choice between sitting with Jolene\u2019s extended family, most of whom didn\u2019t like me much better than Mama Ginger, or with Mama Ginger herself, I chose to lean against the wall. This proved to be a good call, as I had to launch myself after Mama Ginger from time to time whenever she made a break for the delivery rooms.</p><p>I could only fly-tackle a fifty-year-old woman so many times before I started losing my sense of humor, so I was grateful when my sensitive vampire ears picked up the sound of two strong cries down the hall.</p><p>15</p> <p>The element of surprise is vastly overrated in any relationship.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>J olene had two perfectly healthy babies, in a perfectly normal delivery, in a perfectly normal hospital room.</p><p>It was a McClaine family first.</p> <p>After the inevitable squabble between Mimi and Mama Ginger over who held the babies first (Mama Ginger was lucky she lost the struggle and not, say, a finger) and the pack was allowed to sniff the babies to their hearts\u2019 content, I finally made it back to Jolene\u2019s recovery room. An exhausted, beaming Zeb handed me a squirming pink bundle, and I fell in love. Little Janelyn, my namesake. The daughter I would never have. The baby I could love and spoil and then immediately hand back to her real mother. Now I knew how Aunt Jettie must have felt, to love a child so completely, to want to be a part of her life, even if you weren\u2019t a parent.</p><p>When Zeb placed a sleeping baby Joe in my hands, it seemed like an embarrassment of riches.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful,\u201d I told Jolene, who was fighting hard not to doze off in her hospital bed. Jolene smiled, her contentment so complete that she didn\u2019t have to respond. My eyes pricked with hot, happy tears as Janelyn studied me with her big blue eyes. Her little hand crept out from under the blanket and wrapped around my finger.</p><p>\u201cHello, little baby,\u201d I cooed. \u201cI\u2019m Auntie Jane. When your mama says it\u2019s OK, I\u2019m going to take you guys to the library and museums and movies. I\u2019ll feed you food that\u2019ll make you hyper and nauseous, and then I\u2019ll bring you straight home. I\u2019ll help you hide your first tattoo. We\u2019re going to have a great time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Jolene muttered, her mouth quirked into a tired smile. I snickered.</p><p>I stroked a finger along the curve of Joe\u2019s downy-soft cheek, and for a moment, I felt a keen sense of loss for not being able to have a baby of my own.</p> <p>Janelyn, who seemed incredibly strong for a newborn, even in my limited experience with babies, pulled my finger to her mouth. Chomp!</p><p>The moment passed.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d I exclaimed. I gently pulled the baby\u2019s lip back to find a full set of perfect, tiny white teeth with particularly sharp-looking canines. \u201cWhat the?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wolf thing,\u201d Zeb said, looking completely unperturbed by his babies\u2019 having more teeth than their paternal grandfather.</p><p>Jolene, whose eyes were still closed, raised her hand and waggled her finger at me. \u201cLet that be a lesson on what happens when you plan on interferin\u2019 with responsible parentin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo biting the namesake, kid,\u201d I told the unrepentant infant. \u201cEspecially when the namesake has fangs.\u201d</p><p>Jolene yawned. \u201cThat just means she\u2019s happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she\u2019s never happy to see you when you\u2019re nursing,\u201d I muttered. Jolene opened her mouth to protest. \u201cIf you launch into some story about the miracle of werewolf nipples, I will leave.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene rolled her eyes and snuggled into Zeb\u2019s side. He wrapped his arm around her and cleared his throat. \u201cSo, we wanted to talk to you about something. We wanted to wait until the babies were here safely, because we didn\u2019t want to jinx ourselves.\u201d</p><p>I noted with pride how right it seemed now for Zeb to use the word we when it came to him and Jolene. And now he had two more little people to add to that unit. When he\u2019d first found Jolene, it bothered me. I\u2019d felt left out, abandoned. Zeb and I used to be a we. We were the we. But now, Zeb had the we he was meant to have. And I had my own we with Gabriel. This was the way it was supposed to be; growing, changing, finding your own we.</p><p>I really needed some sleep.</p><p>\u201cWe would like you to be godmother to the twins,\u201d Zeb said. \u201cWe\u2019ve thought this over very carefully. And we can\u2019t imagine asking anyone else ... so, no pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not all that religious, Zeb. You should probably appoint someone who, you know, hasn\u2019t been tossed out of their church for being an unholy monster, to head the kids\u2019 spiritual development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more of a guardianship thing,\u201d Zeb assured me. \u201cIf anything ever happened to me or Jolene, we would want to know that you would be there for the kids. No one would take care of them like you, love them like you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the least crazy person available for the job,\u201d the barely conscious Jolene added.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s sort of sad,\u201d I told them.</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Zeb admitted. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make it untrue.\u201d</p><p>I peered down at the sleeping bundles in my arms. The burden of their weight seemed just a little bit heavier. Could I accept this kind of responsibility? Despite working with children for most of my adult life, I\u2019d never really taken care of any. I didn\u2019t have the kind of life that was conducive to child-rearing. I slept all day. There was rarely solid food in my house. There were lots of pointy, breakable objects down at child-eye level. I wanted to travel, to spend time with Gabriel, to run my shop. Was I really willing to turn all of that upside down if something happened to Zeb and Jolene? Could I raise two kids?</p><p>Baby Joe wrapped his little fingers around another of mine, mirroring his twin. I stared down at them.</p><p>Yes, I could.</p><p>I placed the babies on either side of Jolene and threw my arms around Zeb. \u201cI will do everything I can to give the kids the kind of childhood we never had, Zeb,\u201d I promised. \u201cUnconditional love, holidays without drunken nudity, and birthday parties where they don\u2019t end up crying. Of course, we\u2019ll have to go underground to get away from your families. But I\u2019m sure Dick can forge the necessary paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Zeb squeezed me back. \u201cYou know, when I pictured us having this conversation, I didn\u2019t think nudity and forgery would come into it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed heavily. \u201cAnd you think you know me so well.\u201d</p><p>I basked in the new parents\u2019 happy glow for a few more minutes before I excused myself. I wanted to call Gabriel, to ask why he and Dick and Andrea hadn\u2019t made it down to the hospital yet. But when I walked out into the waiting room, Gabriel was waiting for me. I threw myself into his arms, gave him a smacking kiss on the lips. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been wondering where you guys were. You finally dragged yourselves down here to see the babies?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face was blank, taut. He had that look in his eye, the \u201cI have bad news, and I\u2019m trying to think of a way to break it gently\u201d thing that always sent me into a panic. A nervous bubble of laughter escaped my throat, even as it constricted. \u201cGabriel, what is it?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel swallowed hard, reaching out to take my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s Andrea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s Andrea? Is she hurt? Did something happen?\u201d I babbled, panic racing through my chest.</p><p>My brain reeled through a number of horrible scenarios. Car accident. Robbery at the store. Halloween prank gone awry. The last thing I\u2019d said to her was, \u201cWatch it, or I\u2019ll drop a house on you.\u201d And she\u2019d laughed. Oh, God, what if she was dead and those were my last words to her?</p><p>\u201cDick was at the store with her, and he went to run an errand right before closing. When he came back, Andrea was gone. Her car was missing. But the cash register was full. And Dick could smell ...\u201d</p><p>By now, tears were streaming down my cheeks. \u201cWhat? Gabriel, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick could smell blood, Andrea\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t remember much about Gabriel driving us to the shop. The darkened streets of downtown passed by in a blur as my mind raced. Where could Andrea be? I tried to convince myself that it was perfectly reasonable to think that she might have simply hurt herself at the shop, that she\u2019d driven herself to get help. It was so much better than the alternative, that someone had taken Andrea, dragged her, bleeding, out of the shop in her silly pink ballgown. What if it was one of us? I\u2019d been so stupid. I put her right in the line of fire, working in a vampire shop when her rare blood type called out to the undead like a fine, irresistible wine. I wiped at my eyes, knowing it was pointless to try to stop the tears from falling.</p><p>\u201cDick called the police,\u201d Gabriel said, his voice bleak. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting at the shop for them.\u201d</p><p>I moaned softly, leaning my head against the seat. For Dick to be willing to call the police, the situation had to be desperate.</p><p>We would have been better off calling Barney Fife.</p><p>Gabriel dropped me off at the shop. He thought his time would be better spent contacting the local Council members and various underworld characters who might have information about Andrea. So far, I had a lot more faith that he might find her than in the combined forces of the Half-Moon Hollow Police Department.</p><p>To say that the police were not exactly concerned about finding a woman who worked in an occult shop and lived with her vampire boyfriend would be a grand understatement. Sergeant Russell Lane, whom I\u2019d gone to school with for thirteen years, seemed far more interested in treating us like suspects than in taking down any information about Andrea.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your boss die under strange circumstances here last year?\u201d Sergeant Lane asked, as he scribbled notes in his duty notebook. He looked at Dick and me with a gleam of distrust, even malice, in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t consider a seventy-nine-year-old man having a heart attack while moving heavy boxes to be strange,\u201d I said, struggling to keep calm. I was a giant, exposed, twitching nerve just standing there, waiting for news, trying to keep from flashing my fangs at Lane.</p><p>Lane shrugged. \u201cI just think it\u2019s kind of a weird coincidence that your boss dies in the store, and a year later, your employee disappears from the store,\u201d he said, giving me a long, appraising look. \u201cAndrea Byrne was a registered blood surrogate, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d Dick growled.</p><p>\u201cAnd you would be?\u201d Lane asked.</p><p>\u201cDick Cheney. I live with Ms. Byrne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat name sounds familiar,\u201d Lane said, scratching it in his little notebook for future reference. \u201cSo, let me get this straight. She lives with a vampire, works for a vampire, and spends her free time letting vampires feed from her.\u201d</p><p>Sergeant Lane closed his little notebook. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll keep an eye out for her. But we can\u2019t do much until an official missing-person report is filed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was filing a missing-person report. I know a person who is missing, and I\u2019m reporting it to you,\u201d I said, placing a restraining hand on Dick when he took a menacing step toward the officer.</p><p>\u201cLook, she could have run out to the grocery store for all you know. Or gone to a costume party,\u201d Lane said. \u201cIt\u2019s Halloween. It\u2019s a busy night for us. We\u2019re not going to be able to do much for you, anyway. Why don\u2019t you wait twenty-four hours and come down to the department to file a report if she doesn\u2019t turn up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she could be anywhere!\u201d I cried. \u201cLook, my friends and family members have been abducted before, I know the signs when I see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that being associated with you has its problems.\u201d He ignored the enormous amount of stink-eye I was sending his way. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do anything about a woman who just decided to flake out of work. Besides, she\u2019s a grown woman; if she wants to take off for a while, she can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I opened a door into Sergeant Lane\u2019s brain and saw three things. One, he seemed to think that Dick and I had drained Andrea dry and stashed the body and were reporting her missing to cover our tracks. Two, if we had killed Andrea, or even if she was legitimately missing, he thought she probably got what she\u2019d deserved. What could a girl expect when she hung out with this kind of crowd? He planned to go back to the station, make a joke about it at roll call, and forget Andrea ever existed. And three, he had been staring at my boobs through the entire interview. At this point, I\u2019ve come to expect this of human men and realize that it has nothing to do with me. They want to see all women naked. Except for their mothers.</p><p>\u201cAndrea doesn\u2019t just flake out,\u201d I told him. \u201cThis is completely out of character for her. If you think we did something to her, then take us to the station and question us so you can get that out of the way and you can start looking for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t exactly hook you up to a lie detector when your heart doesn\u2019t beat, now, can I?\u201d Sergeant Lane pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cPardon me for being blunt, but she\u2019s a missing pretty young woman,\u201d I told him. \u201cWe both know there\u2019s going to be a CNN van parked outside any minute. And I\u2019m going to be more than happy to tell the nice reporters all about your lack of interest in finding my friend.\u201d</p><p>Lane was smug now. \u201cI think once they hear about Ms. Byrne\u2019s background, they won\u2019t be all that surprised.\u201d</p><p>I growled. \u201cIs it uncomfortable to have your head jammed that far up your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d Dick said, locking his fingers around my wrist, to keep me in place.</p><p>\u201cYou two have a Happy Halloween, now.\u201d Lane sneered and ambled out of the shop.</p> <p>I let loose a stunning string of profanities and chucked the pewter fairies across the room, shattering one of the little tableside reading lamps. I expected Dick to be having the same reaction, but when I turned, he was sitting on the floor, rubbing a hand over his chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this,\u201d he said, his sea-green eyes round and wet. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t take not knowing. What if she\u2019s hurt? What if she\u2019s scared? What if this is my fault? What if someone I made one of my stupid back-alley deals with came here and took her to get back at me? I shouldn\u2019t have left her alone. But I wanted to\u2014it seemed so important to surprise her.\u201d</p><p>His hands shaking, Dick took a little blue velvet box out of his back pocket and opened it. Inside was a simple white gold band set with a little heart-shaped ruby. It was obviously old and worn but had recently been cleaned. \u201cI went to pick this up. I thought I\u2019d go the whole traditional, down-on-one-knee route. I thought she\u2019d think it was funny, getting a proposal while she was all dressed up like a princess. When I got back, she was gone.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my happy ever after, Jane,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhat am I going to do without her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about that,\u201d I told him. I was trying so hard to keep my voice upbeat, hopeful, that my throat seemed to burn. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>Dick\u2019s face crumpled in on itself, for the briefest of moments. He sniffed and pushed to his feet. \u201cI have to go somewhere, do something, or I\u2019m going to go crazy. You just stay here, OK? In case she calls or the police ... Wait for me or Gabriel to call you. You call me if you hear anything . Got it?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cDick ...\u201d</p><p>He kissed my forehead and disappeared out the shop door.</p><p>Sitting at the counter staring at the phone was making me crazy. I needed to do something with my hands. I cleaned up the mess I\u2019d made of the broken lamp and put the damaged fairies in my office. I wiped down shelves, restocked the coffee bar. I found a pile of unclaimed special orders under the counter with a note from Andrea: \u201cFor Jane, reshelve using your \u2018crazy system.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Caught between laughing and bursting into tears, I hauled the books to the shelves, replacing them in the stock one by one. Zombies: Fact vs. Fiction, On the Hunt for the Wendigo, Chupacabra and Other Demons of the Southern Hemisphere, and finally, Rituals and Love Customs of the Were . I ran a finger down the worn spine of the final title.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap.\u201d I sighed, thinking of the box of Mr. Wainwright\u2019s books I\u2019d culled from my personal library all those months ago. With everything that was going on, I\u2019d put them in my trunk and forgotten about them. I grabbed my keys and retrieved the box from Big Bertha, finally realizing how early it was when I saw the pink streaks of dawn creeping across the horizon. There was no time to make it home, and I didn\u2019t want to leave the shop at this point, anyway. I wondered idly how sun-safe the storage room was, flipping through the book covers on my way back into the shop.</p><p>I shelved Rituals and Love Customs of the Were with our other copy and took The Spectrum of Vampirism over to the special-collections display case. When he\u2019d given it to me, Mr. Wainwright had said it was a particularly rare volume, written by a respected Harvard academic, meaning that I felt even worse about leaving it in my trunk for so long. I carefully wiped off the cover with a soft cloth and unlocked the display case.</p><p>The sheer violent force of the blow to my back sent me crashing into the case, splintering the glass. I landed with a thump on the carpet, razor-sharp shards jutting from my arms. One of them must have hit an artery, because my blood was forming a rather large pool on the carpet.</p><p>Ow.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve had it the whole time?\u201d an indignant voice above me growled.</p><p>Through the gray haze of pain, I looked up and tried to focus on Emery\u2019s face. He sneered down at me, just as pasty as ever but not quite as sweaty. In fact, there was a subtle radiance to his pale, round face. His eyes were no longer dusty brown but a clear, liquid amber color. And his teeth were brilliant, white, and ... pointy.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I shouted, \u201cEmery, who the hell was dumb enough to turn you into a vampire?\u201d</p><p>I tried to push up from the floor, but the itching torment of my skin expelling thousands of tiny glass slivers left my arms weak. I glared up at him. I knew that eventually, the shock of Emery\u2019s betrayal would catch up with me, but for now, keeping up a sarcastic, condescending front seemed for the best.</p><p>\u201cMy mistress, Jeanine, only granted me the gift a few short days ago. First, I had to prove I was worthy.\u201d Emery sighed. \u201cShe found me. She showed me the truth about the world, about vampires. She gave me answers I\u2019d been looking for all my life. She saved me. And she asked so little of me. And I failed!\u201d</p><p>Emery kicked out like a preschooler having a tantrum at Wal-Mart. His foot caught me in the ribs, knocking me back against the counter. Dazed, I followed his line of sight to the book still clutched in my hand. Even through the sharp throb of pain, my brain spun. The break-in. Emery\u2019s overzealous interest in the inventory. His need to search through every single title. He\u2019d been looking for one specific book all this time. And I\u2019d had it in my trunk. If I hadn\u2019t been bleeding profusely, I might have laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an evil henchman, Emery? Seriously? You broke into the shop while I was out of town? Why would you do that? And why the big charade with arriving weeks later all scruffy and jet-lagged? I would have given you anything you asked for. Why are you doing this?\u201d I asked. I wasn\u2019t sure what made this situation worse, my stupidity or the choking regret over my stupidity. I\u2019d felt sorry for this doorknob, guilty for not being nicer to him. And he\u2019d been working for Jeanine since the moment I\u2019d met him. He\u2019d deceived us all, turned on his only family to help that crazy bitch terrorize me. I felt my fangs extend over my lips as I ground my teeth together. The anger felt good. It felt clear compared with a muzzy confusion of pain and worry.</p><p>Emery smiled down at me. In a patient voice, he said, \u201cI need that book, Jane. I need The Spectrum of Vampirism to restore Mistress Jeanine to her full health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything except that,\u201d I spat, rising to my feet. Glass tinkled to the floor from my sleeves. \u201cNow, tell me where Andrea is.\u201d</p><p>Emery shoved me back down onto the floor, which, given the woozy feeling in my head, was probably where I needed to be anyway. Still holding on to the book, I crawled behind the bar to the fridge. Emery followed, seemingly undisturbed by the blood trail I was leaving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a new man, Jane. Capable of things I never dreamed of,\u201d he intoned with a faraway expression. \u201cMistress Jeanine touched me with her dark wisdom. I worship at her feet. I lick the ground where she treads.\u201d</p><p>I took three bottles of Faux Type O from the fridge and poured one after another down my throat. Wiping my mouth, I peered up at him. My vision was starting to clear. My wounds closed. I was able to flex my arms. My legs felt stronger. I was practically Popeye the freaking Sailor. I hefted myself to my feet. \u201cAdolescence left deep, deep scars on you, didn\u2019t it? I think you need to meet this guy I went to high school with. Name\u2019s Adam. I think you\u2019d get along,\u201d</p><p>The dreamy note vanished from Emery\u2019s face. He\u2019d just realized his mistake, not taking the book from me immediately. Being so new, he didn\u2019t realize how quickly we recovered with the help of an infusion. He took a menacing step toward me; my hands tightened around the cover. \u201cI need that book. The mistress demands it. If I don\u2019t bring it to her, she will plant her heel on my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want to hear about your sexcapades with Crazy Jeanine,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I am not worthy of the mistress\u2019s attentions,\u201d he said in a hushed, reverent tone.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you keep calling her \u2018mistress\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she controls everything I do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I eat, when I sleep, how long I\u2019m allowed to go without\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the picture, Emery. Please don\u2019t give me details. And stop talking about her feet, it\u2019s icking me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finally coming into my own, Jane,\u201d he growled. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like, living your whole life, waiting for it to start? Knowing that there\u2019s something out there for you, something that will complete you, but not knowing what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m is hearing is \u2018blah, blah, blah, I\u2019m a loony tune enjoying my moment,\u2019\u201d I told him. \u201cNow, tell me where Andrea is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t give me that book, Jane, I\u2019m going to have to take it,\u201d Emery said, drawing himself up before rushing at me. Fully charged from my bloody snack, I punched him in the forehead with all the force I had. And now that he\u2019d lost the element of surprise, Emery wasn\u2019t that much of a fighter.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he cried, collapsing in a heap on the floor.</p><p>\u201cEmery, please don\u2019t do this. You\u2019re Mr. Wainwright\u2019s family. As much as I hate what you\u2019ve done, I don\u2019t want to\u2014dang it.\u201d I sighed as he charged me again, and I punched him in the forehead. Again. \u201cStay down, Emery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that book,\u201d Emery demanded.</p><p>\u201cHmmm ... No ,\u201d I roared.</p><p>\u201cJane, you leave me no choice.\u201d Emery pulled a large wooden crucifix out of his jacket.</p><p>I gave him an acidic smile. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m kind of at peace with the whole Christianity thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might say that.\u201d Emery pressed the center of the crucifix, and a stake snicked out. He raised the stake and charged me again. And I punched him in the forehead. Again.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you learning from this?\u201d I grunted, staring down at Emery\u2019s crumpled body.</p><p>I almost felt bad about the whole thing, right up until I got knocked unconscious. One minute, I was looking down at Emery, and the next, white-hot pain sliced through the back of my neck, paralyzing every muscle in my body. My legs folded under me, and I crashed to the floor, my breath wheezing out in a weak \u201cuhhf\u201d just before my eyelids slid shut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And for the record, yes, my own stun gun was used to incapacitate me.</p><p>16</p><p>Change is inevitable.

But most of the time, it just plain sucks.</p> <p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>When I came to, I was tied up in the basement of a very old home. My mouth tasted like old pennies. And the back of my neck was stinging like crazy. I sat up. But the swishing sensation in my head made me flop back to the stone floor. The ceiling above was solidly constructed and oddly familiar. I looked around, recognizing several of the old boxes and crates.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>I\u2019d been abducted and taken to River Oaks. This was just embarrassing.</p> <p>I made another attempt at sitting up, wincing at the raw hemp rope binding my wrists and ankles. Double crap. I leaned against a box of old Christmas decorations and squinted toward the low, small cellar window. It was dark outside. What time was it? Had I been out all day? Where was Emery? Where was Gabriel? He had to be frantic by now.</p><p>Through the fuzzy sensations lingering in my head, I tried to remember if I kept anything down here that could cut through the ropes. I scanned the room for the outline of gardening tools or a saw. In the dark, I could make out the faint pink glow of a polyester Halloween costume.</p><p>\u201cAndrea!\u201d I whispered at her prone form. \u201cAndrea, are you OK? Please, answer me. Andrea?\u201d</p><p>Andrea was clothed, thank goodness, and lying on an old table of my grandpa\u2019s. Her clothes were stained with old blood. She looked as if she was sleeping, but there was no breath, no pulse that I could hear. She was so pale and small. My heart caught in my throat, the edges of my vision tinged a bright, angry crimson. Something was cutting into my lip. It took me a few seconds to recognize that it was my fangs and the blood welling into my mouth was my own, stoking an already scorching hatred for Emery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid our Andrea is indisposed,\u201d Emery said fondly, emerging from a corner to sit at Andrea\u2019s shoulders. \u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful, like a princess in a fairy tale.\u201d He chuckled, stroking her hair. \u201cOnly, the prince\u2019s kiss is what put her to sleep.\u201d Emery\u2019s smile was sudden, sharp, and vicious. \u201cShe was delicious, your Andrea. Well, she\u2019s my Andrea now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d I promised.</p> <p>Emery\u2019s cool, calm Lestat demeanor changed at my harsh tone. \u201cI did it for her!\u201d he hissed. \u201cFor my mistress! To prove that I am worthy of her dark gift.\u201d He seemed to compose himself. \u201cTo hurt you. Oh, how she loves to hurt you.\u201d He smiled to himself. \u201cAndrea was my very first kill. It was so much easier than I thought it would be. After drinking that horrible bottled blood, it was a pleasure. You must know. You have to have tasted her, at least once. Giving her my own blood wasn\u2019t as easy, though. The mistress is right, it\u2019s quite exhausting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turned her?\u201d The division of my feelings tore a hole through my chest, shock and horror that Andrea had been forced out of her human life, relief that she wasn\u2019t entirely gone, grief for Dick.</p><p>\u201cThe mistress promised her to me,\u201d he said, running his hand along her still, white cheek. He smiled up at me. \u201cAnd she said I could have you, as well. I have needs, Jane, needs I\u2019ve denied for far too long. And since I\u2019m not worthy of the mistress\u2019s attentions ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just back up the crazy truck, there, Foot Boy. There will be no having . Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have such a ... unique way with words, Jane.\u201d A soft, feminine voice chuckled in the darkness. Cindy, our latte-loving teen good-luck charm, stepped into the dim light. The green was washed out of her now-dark hair. It was drawn back into a high, Victorian style, oddly in sync with her ornately embroidered black skirt and white silk blouse. She wasn\u2019t wearing makeup, and her black nail polish had been removed. My instinct to protect the girl I\u2019d grown so fond of jumped ahead of my logical thinking skills.</p><p>\u201cCindy, get out of here!\u201d I cried. \u201cYou could get hur\u2014oh, for God\u2019s sake, you\u2019re one of them, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She tsk ed and shook her head sympathetically. \u201cPoor Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted you. I was nice to you. I gave you free coffee!\u201d</p> <p>She smiled and pinched my cheek. \u201cYes, and it gave me time to watch you, to listen to you whine and complain to your friends when you thought I was reading. It\u2019s amazing what people will say when they think no one\u2019s listening. It made writing those letters so much easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, you\u2019re Jeanine?\u201d I gasped. \u201cBut I saw inside your head. You\u2019re a newborn!\u201d</p><p>Jeanine took out a vial of rewetting drops and moistened her eyes. She dabbed delicately with a lacy handkerchief. She flashed a simpering smile my way as Emery reverently lowered a red velvet ceremonial cape onto her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m a very talented actress. I could have been one of the great ladies of the theater, if Grandmama had allowed me to pursue it. But theater people were barely better than circus folk at the time, you see. Really, you were disappointingly easy to fool. I knew you\u2019d try to read my mind, so I came up with that story about poor little Cindy, the misunderstood, lonely newborn, looking for a place to belong. I let you see that much. I knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to turn me away. You never even suspected me. Of course, at the end of the day, I had to flush the toxins from your wretched coffee out of my system, but it was worth it. I learned so much about you, Jane, and it helped me direct Emery in how to best ... instruct you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly did you two meet up, psychoticsingles.com ?\u201d</p><p>Jeanine\u2019s hand snaked out from under her cape, forcing the stun gun against my arm. The quick metallic sting of the current locked my jaw muscles. \u201cOw!\u201d I grunted.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be rude, Jane. I don\u2019t see why the two of us can\u2019t be friends,\u201d Jeanine said, smiling guilelessly. \u201cI mean, honestly, we have so much in common. A love of reading, complicated relationships with our mothers, loving the same man. With Gabriel as a sire, we\u2019re practically sisters. So let\u2019s talk, the two of us. Just a couple of girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not braiding your hair,\u201d I growled.</p><p>In a cheerful voice, she said, \u201cI\u2019m just a good Catholic girl at heart, Jane. I\u2019m very comfortable in churches, convents, monasteries. After Gabriel had so callously rejected my latest round of calls and letters, I traveled all the way to Guatemala, to rest in a little seminary high in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. And one day, I wandered into the chapel to find Emery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was an answer to my prayers. I thought she was an angel.\u201d He sighed. \u201cMy dark angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I just threw up a little bit in my mouth,\u201d I muttered, wincing when Jeanine gave me a light zap with the stun gun.</p><p>\u201cEmery was so eager to please,\u201d she said, stroking her fingers along the curve of his face. He leaned into her caress like an adoring spaniel. \u201cSo considerate. He promised to do anything he could to restore my health, even when it meant bringing me the blood of every student in the seminary. Imagine my shock when I found out he was from Half-Moon Hollow, the birthplace of my dear sire. Emery told me about his uncle\u2019s bookshop, about a book he remembered from his boyhood, which described a ritual to \u2018revampirize\u2019 an ailing immortal.\u201d She lifted the copy of The Spectrum of Vampirism, stained with my blood. \u201cIt was fate, you see, the book, Emery, Gabriel, all circling this silly little town. I wanted to leave immediately, but then he got a message from you, saying that his uncle had died. And he learned that you\u2019d been given the store and all of its contents. That complicated matters for us. So, we waited and we watched.\u201d</p><p>Her lip curled. \u201cAnd I saw you with him, with my Gabriel. How could I help but reach out to him? You took my sire away. He stopped thinking about me when you came along.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, thinking of all the stress she\u2019d put Gabriel through. \u201cHe stopped thinking about you a long time before that.\u201d I let out a loud \u201cGah!\u201d when she shocked me again. \u201cOK, I will admit that was not a constructive thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve guessed what my special ability is, have you, Jane?\u201d She preened, as if she hadn\u2019t just sent thousands of volts into my body. \u201cYou might call it having a \u2018one-track mind.\u2019 If I focus on someone hard enough, I can find them anywhere. No matter where they are, no matter how hard they try to hide, I just have a knack for guessing where they\u2019ll turn up next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour special power is you\u2019re a supernaturally gifted stalker?\u201d I panted. \u201cGabriel really did screw up by turning you.\u201d</p><p>She ignored me, possibly because the stun gun still had to recharge after the last round. \u201cI\u2019ll admit Gabriel\u2019s given me a challenge over the last few decades. He\u2019s become very skilled at keeping his plans vague, at bouncing between this horrible little shanty town and the rest of civilization. I was always guessing with him. But you, oh, Jane, you were very easy to follow. You were a considerable help to me while Gabriel dragged you from city to city, hotel to hotel. You were practically a homing beacon. I didn\u2019t even have to try, which was fortunate for me. I find travel to be so draining. It was all I could do to write those notes and leave them at your hotels before collapsing into a tea-tree and eucalyptus bath. They\u2019re very restorative, you know. You might try it sometime, Jane. You\u2019re looking a bit tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired, I\u2019m concussed.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, making calf-eyes at Emery as he lit several oil hurricane lamps I\u2019d kept in storage for power outages. \u201cMeanwhile, Emery stayed here. He wasn\u2019t very happy with you either, Jane. You took over the store. You were handed everything his uncle had left in this world. He wanted to punish you. It\u2019s another interest we share. So, I let my Emery indulge his need for petty revenge. I helped him learn to guard his thoughts around you. I let him play his little games with you. I even fed him a few ideas. Rifling through your purse and finding that silly little can of vampire mace was particularly inspiring.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the disappearance of my mace made a lot more sense, though I had to wonder what sort of evil vampire ninja skills Jeanine had employed to get at my purse without anyone seeing. I grunted, wanting to smack myself on the forehead. I\u2019d told her to help herself to coffee whenever she needed a refill. My purse was under the counter.</p><p>No more trusting teenagers, ever.</p><p>I smiled nastily. \u201cWell, it backfired, because sending me a box full of silver is what brought Gabriel and me back together. So ... thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>A black sneer flickered across her features before she forced them back into her mask of serene control. I waited for her to shock me again, but the sting didn\u2019t come. When I opened my eyes, Jeanine was holding the book in her hand, poring over whatever ritual she was convinced would turn her into a real girl.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is the right book?\u201d she demanded as Emery cowered before her.</p><p>\u201cOf course, mistress,\u201d he simpered.</p><p>She growled. \u201cBut there\u2019s hardly anything in here. There\u2019s no special ceremony for re-turning a vampire, just a footnote about whether it\u2019s possible. The footnote says, \u2018Highly unlikely.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Emery blanched at her tone, spluttering, \u201cB-but-but I didn\u2019t make any guarantees, mistress, I said I vaguely remember reading something as a child\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said a little more than that, Emery. As I recall, you seemed sure that you knew how to cure me. You promised!\u201d She stamped her foot.</p><p>I hissed out a hoarse laugh. \u201cEmery is your go-to guy in this scenario? You\u2019re the worst nemesis I\u2019ve ever had. Mama Ginger has better plotting skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmery,\u201d she said absentmindedly. Emery reached out and backhanded me, his fingers striking my jaw with bone-buckling force. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ow.</p><p>As I stretched my aching jaw, I realized Jeanine was trying to prevent hurting me too badly. The stun gun was enough to keep me in line, but she didn\u2019t trust herself to really lash out. She needed me. And the only reason I could think of for keeping me alive would be to\u2014</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d I groaned. \u201cYou want Gabriel here for whatever weirdo ritual you have planned. I\u2019ve been relegated to bait. This is insulting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be insulted, Jane,\u201d she said, her lip drawn up into a bewildered pout. \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment, really. Gabriel cares for you. He\u2019s almost obsessed with your safety and happiness. As soon as he realizes you\u2019re not at the shop, he\u2019ll come running here looking for you. And your ... predicament is just the incentive he needs to cooperate. Do you realize that I\u2019ve been trying to contact him for decades, but the first time he ever responded in any way was when I told him I was going to talk to you, to hurt you? Personally, I don\u2019t see the attraction.\u201d Her rosebud features grew dark, petulant. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. He cared enough to turn you completely, to make sure you could take care of yourself, fend for yourself. He turned me into less. He made me into a ghoul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not a ghoul. You\u2019re a hypochondriac. You travel with a humidifier, for goodness sake.\u201d When a lightning-quick flash of insane fury crossed Jeanine\u2019s features, I had an idea. If there was no bait, there was no trap, no reason for Gabriel to be here. Jeanine would be left with no big evil plan. She wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt him. And with me gone, Jenny would finally get the house. Now that my life seemed to be finally, truly coming to a close, I found I didn\u2019t mind so much. Annoying her didn\u2019t seem so important now. It really sucked that I was reaching some level of emotional maturity moments before imminent death.</p><p>I snickered loudly, making my voice as condescending and Courtney-like as possible. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have the guts to come after me yourself. You had Foot Boy do your dirty work for you.\u201d</p><p>Jeanine rolled her eyes but didn\u2019t respond. I dug deeper into the bitchy-insult well, lowering my voice to a sly, sneering tone. \u201cYou know, Gabriel told me all about your little crush on him, when you were human. Following him around like a little puppy dog, making a nuisance of yourself. I pointed out that not much has changed, since you\u2019re still doing pretty much the same thing. And we laaaaaaaughed. Did I mention we were lying in my bed, naked, at the time?\u201d</p><p>Jeanine\u2019s teeth ground together as she barked out, \u201cEmery!\u201d</p> <p>Emery turned and really walloped me. Unfortunately, he did it at just the right angle, so that my temple barreled into the corner of a china crate. I slumped to the ground, my head spinning, blood seeping through the neck of my sweatshirt. I was vaguely aware of my arms being pinned under my back, the ropes biting into my wrists. So, instead of dying to protect my beloved, I was going to wake up with a headache and a serious case of pins-and-needles in my arms.</p><p>Overall, not my most well-thought-out plan.</p><p>As unconsciousness tinged the edge of my vision, I glared up at Jeanine. \u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>Jeanine grinned, patting my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got that out in the open.\u201d</p><p>From the dark, bottomless pit of oblivion, I heard shouting. I blinked a few times. I heard Dick\u2019s pained howl and his voice moaning, \u201cNo, baby, no,\u201d over and over. When my eyes could focus, I saw him in the corner, Andrea\u2019s body pressed against his chest, his face buried in her neck.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s voice was louder, stern. \u201cStay down, Emery!\u201d</p> <p>I sat up, wincing at the numbness in my arms. I shook my head, trying to fling away the last fuzzy spots in my head.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d I peered up, seeing Gabriel choking Emery against a wall as Jeanine stood nearby, wringing her hands. She looked so helpless and panicked. It seemed that faced with the object of her obsession and fury, our mutual sire, all of her high-flown evil plans had evaporated, and she was reduced to dithering like a flustered schoolgirl. I almost felt sorry for her.</p><p>But not really.</p><p>Gabriel dropped a barely conscious Emery at the sound of my hoarse whisper. Emery slumped against a stack of crates, toppling them over. I heard Jeanine gasp as one of the unlit hurricane lamps shattered near her feet, soaking her cloak in the lamp oil.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d he murmured, probing my temple gently with his fingertips. Between the barely healed cuts on my arms, the head wound, and the drying maroon blood soaked into my sweatshirt, I imagined I wouldn\u2019t be winning any beauty contests soon. Sadly, at this point, I think Gabriel was used to seeing me this way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this. Emery got me from behind.\u201d I groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s not what it sounds like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBored and annoyed, a little worried about Emery\u2019s mental state. But yeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I grumbled, trying to push to my feet. \u201cNope, I was wrong, my head really hurts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome upstairs,\u201d he said, taking my arm and supporting my weight. \u201cJeanine, I\u2019ve called the Council here. You\u2019ve gone too far this time. When they see ...\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice broke as he took in the sight of Dick huddled protectively over Andrea. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Jeanine mewled. \u201cYou and I have a long-owed debt to settle, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything,\u201d he growled, pushing past her and dragging me with him.</p><p>\u201cAll of this is your doing! Your fault. You made me what I am!\u201d</p><p>The pitiful voice, the sight of Jeanine\u2019s twisted baby-doll visage, were playing Gabriel\u2019s guilt strings like a virtuoso. I could see the conflict play out on his face. After everything, he wanted to try to find a way to help her. He turned, leaving me to stand as my sense of equilibrium returned. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you alone, Jeanine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for that. But I was afraid of you, afraid of the things you would do. I was ashamed of you. I thought that you would listen to Violette, that she could teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t teach me anything!\u201d Jeanine pouted. \u201cIt was just more rules! More rules than my Grandmama had. Don\u2019t feed from the weak. Don\u2019t kill for the sake of killing,\u201d she said, mimicking a heavy French accent. \u201cIt was so much worse than my life. You left me with that. I didn\u2019t have anyone to turn to. Please, just give me more of your blood. Make me whole. The Council will understand that I was sick and not in my right mind, that I had no choice but to do what I\u2019ve done, especially when you talk to them.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cI won\u2019t do that, Jeanine. I won\u2019t speak for you and I won\u2019t give you another drop of my blood. There\u2019s no such thing as a re-turning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is!\u201d Jeanine screamed.</p><p>\u201cJeanine,\u201d he growled.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cGabriel, let\u2019s not antagonize the crazy with the stun gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, don\u2019t help. Wait\u2014she has your stun gun?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders, my expression apologetic.</p><p>\u201cI can make you happy, Gabriel, if you just give me the chance. But now that you have her, you don\u2019t even think of me,\u201d Jeanine begged, her voice reedy and desperate. \u201cCan\u2019t you see what she\u2019s done to me, by coming between us? I need you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord, it was Gabriel\u2019s kryptonite, a lady in distress. But instead of reaching out to Jeanine, he simply shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep living like this,\u201d Jeanine cried, real tears of blood streaming down her cheeks now. \u201cI won\u2019t keep living this half-life. I want the gift of immortality or no life at all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you the gift of immortality,\u201d Gabriel said, his voice cold now. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve wasted it.\u201d</p><p>With a mad cry, Jeanine sparked the stun gun and moved it to the hem of her cloak. \u201cI\u2019ll end it now. I\u2019ll take you all with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t do it. You\u2019re terrified of death,\u201d I told her. I thought reminding her of the immediate dusty consequences would make her drop the stun gun, but Jeanine seemed to take my words as a challenge. She sneered and pressed it down, the arc of electrical energy combusting the lamp-oil-soaked cloth with a bright orange glow. Within seconds, her clothes were engulfed. Gabriel threw me behind him. But Jeanine stood perfectly still, a shocked look freezing her face in a mask of horrified regret, as if she couldn\u2019t believe what she had done in a toddler\u2019s fit of temper. Her panicked hands beat at the flames as they licked up her clothes, toward her face. There was a horrible scream as Jeanine\u2019s body seemed to disintegrate before our eyes. Her face turned gray, then black, then crumbled into dust. The flaming cloak crumpled to the floor.</p><p>I watched as the puddle of oil caught, the fire inching toward the piles of boxes and wooden crates. The flames speared higher and higher, until I thought they might be brushing against the ceiling. We would be trapped. River Oaks would burn. The cellar was going to catch like a Roman candle if\u2014</p><p>I shrieked as a blue-white cloud exploded in my face. Dick was standing over Jeanine\u2019s remains with the fire extinguisher I kept near the cellar steps. With tears streaking down his deadened, inanimate face, he sprayed foam over the remaining hot spots, dropped the red tank with a clang, and shuffled back to Andrea without a word.</p><p>The cold blast from the fire extinguisher seemed to revive Emery, who slowly pushed himself up from the floor. Gabriel sprang to his feet, putting himself between Emery and me.</p><p>\u201cMistress?\u201d Emery mumbled. His dull, unfocused eyes caught sight of the pile of ashes and the red cape, absorbing what it meant. He howled, \u201cNo! No !\u201d</p><p>Emery scanned the room for signs of Jeanine, for an explanation of what had happened. Seeing Dick crouched over Andrea, Emery cried, \u201cThat is my mate!\u201d When he advanced on them, Dick looked up with what can only be called a predatory snarl and roared. Even I jumped back. Gabriel\u2019s grip tightened around my arm.</p><p>\u201cEmery, I think you should back away and sit still until the Council gets here,\u201d Gabriel seethed.</p><p>Emery\u2019s brow furrowed, even as he circled Andrea, trying to find a weakness in Dick\u2019s defenses. \u201cWhat council?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Council for the Equal Treatment of the Undead. The governing body of vampires who are going to lower the boom on you after what you\u2019ve done,\u201d I said.</p><p>Emery snorted derisively. \u201cWe\u2019re vampires, Jane. We\u2019re above the law, the constraints of human society. There are no rules for us anymore. It\u2019s why I wanted to be a vampire in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, there\u2019s a whole butt-load of rules, Emery. The Council has rules for everything, especially when it comes to abducting and forcibly turning humans. It\u2019s bad for our public image. All those months at the bookshop, and you never bothered reading anything, did you? You bought into Jeanine\u2019s promise of a \u2018dark gift\u2019 without even thinking about it. And now, you\u2019re going to get the Trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Trial?\u201d Emery asked, his bravado suddenly gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve done to Andrea is going to pale in comparison.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Ophelia arrived at the top of the cellar with her Council posse: gaunt and grumpy Peter Crown, a Colonel Sanders lookalike improbably named Waco Marchand, and cool blond Sophie. I was never so glad to see bureaucrats in all my life. It was like a pale, elegant cavalry. Emery had lost all nerve at this point and was cowering behind a junk pile.</p><p>Ophelia, a 300-year-old teenager who was wearing skinny dark-wash jeans and a Jonas Brothers T-shirt, took in the sight of Andrea\u2019s crumpled body, the pile of ashes on the floor, and my bloodied, chainsaw-massacre-survivor look.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do this time, Jane?\u201d she demanded, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis time, it really wasn\u2019t me,\u201d I protested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou always say that,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt was this newborn, Emery Mueller,\u201d Gabriel said, dragging Emery up by the collar and pushing him toward Peter. \u201cHe kidnapped Andrea Byrne and turned her against her will. Under the direction of his sire, Jeanine, he also attempted to kill Jane with aerosol silver weeks ago, then assaulted and kidnapped her tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite the rap sheet for a newborn,\u201d Ophelia said, nudging Jeanine\u2019s remains with her toe.</p> <p>Gabriel cleared his throat. \u201cWhen Dick ... when he\u2019s able to speak, he will corroborate my story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, mulling that over as she scraped the ashes from her hot-pink Converse sneakers. \u201cAnd I take it this is Jeanine?\u201d Gabriel nodded curtly. \u201cWhen I told you to take care of the matter, Gabriel, I didn\u2019t mean to set her on fire.\u201d</p><p>I raised my hand for permission to speak. \u201cActually, she did that to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said that before, too,\u201d Ophelia noted. I groaned, hoping Ophelia wasn\u2019t going to sic Sophie on me. I\u2019d just gotten over Sophie\u2019s brain-scraping brand of interrogation from our last encounter at a Cracker Barrel.</p><p>Mr. Marchand nudged her with his elbow. \u201cShe\u2019s never lied to us before, Ophelia. She\u2019s no good at it.\u201d</p> <p>Ophelia sighed, \u201cFine. Emery Mueller, I hereby take you into the custody of this tribunal on the charge of forcibly creating a vampire. Your Trial is scheduled in two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a hearing?\u201d Emery whispered. He seemed caught between being terrified of Ophelia and wanting to kiss her feet.</p><p>Peter smiled nastily. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Emery whimpered as Peter and Sophie dragged him away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to say I hope I don\u2019t see you for a while, Jane, but somehow, I don\u2019t think it will work out that way,\u201d Ophelia said.</p><p>\u201cThat seems fair,\u201d I grumbled.</p> <p>Ophelia cast a long glance at Dick, a puzzled expression marring her beautiful face. \u201cLet me know if you need ... help over the next few days.\u201d</p><p>With that, the Council swept out of the room in silence. I honestly didn\u2019t care whether I ever saw Emery or Ophelia again. Gabriel and I slowly approached Dick. I laid a hand on his shoulder. Dick inhaled sharply, but he didn\u2019t snap at us when we gently pried Andrea away from him. Dick allowed Gabriel to carry Andrea upstairs to one of the guest rooms. I washed her neck and face, trying to remove any traces that Emery might have left behind. When she woke, I didn\u2019t want her to smell him. I cut the bloodied costume from her body and slipped a soft cotton nightgown over her head. Even though I knew I would be talking to her, laughing with her again soon, it still felt like funeral preparations.</p><p>I went downstairs and found Dick and Gabriel in my kitchen, an open bottle of Faux Type O between them. I had to try to swallow the lump in my throat twice before I could manage, \u201cDick, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my fault. If I\u2019d just\u2014I didn\u2019t even suspect Emery. I was so self-centered. I thought Jeanine was focused on me. It didn\u2019t occur to me that she would go after my friends like this.\u201d</p><p>Dick\u2019s voice was raw, a harsh whisper between sips. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have guessed, Jane. None of us did. We\u2019re going to lay blame at Emery\u2019s feet, where it belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I was dead drunk when I was turned,\u201d Dick said quietly, staring into his glass. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a thing. I just woke up, and there I was\u2014no pulse, no breath. I, um, I need to know, Jane, does it hurt? To die, I mean? Does it hurt? Did she suffer?\u201d</p><p>His eyes pinned me, tears slipping down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just like falling asleep,\u201d I told him, tucking his hair behind his ear and giving him a sisterly kiss on the cheek. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here for a few days if that\u2019s OK,\u201d Dick said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to move her again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll lay out some sheets and some towels for you.\u201d</p><p>I pushed away from the counter to do just that, but my arms and legs were suddenly so tired. I stumbled against the kitchen table and felt Gabriel\u2019s hands on my arms, steadying me. \u201cSorry, I think the blood loss and head injuries are catching up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself, Stretch,\u201d Dick said. \u201cGabe, take her upstairs, and make her get some sleep. I don\u2019t care what you have to do to convince her, I just don\u2019t want to hear anything.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the half-hearted insinuation. To joke about my sex life, Dick must be feeling a little better. I let Gabriel lift me bridal-style and carry me up the stairs. Now it was my turn to be undressed and tucked into bed. When he slid under the sheets behind me, pulling me to his chest, I turned to him and buried my face against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d I told Gabriel, wiping at my eyes. \u201cWhen I said it doesn\u2019t hurt to die. I lied. It\u2019s agony. It was like drowning on dry land, being crushed, not being able to breathe. It hurts. But I couldn\u2019t tell Dick that. I lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart,\u201d he said, brushing his lips along my brow. \u201cI remember. Even without the added pain of being shot, taking that last breath, it hurts. But sometimes we have to lie to protect the ones we love.\u201d I narrowed my eyes at him. He cleared his throat. \u201cThough obviously, I will never be doing that again. But you did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will this affect Dick?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWill it be weird for him to be with a vampire he hasn\u2019t sired?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not a requirement. There are lots of vampires in very successful relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they going to be OK or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a violation,\u201d Gabriel agreed. \u201cDick will be reminded of it every day. He\u2019ll feel he failed her somehow, that he didn\u2019t protect her. But he loves her. He will set it all aside to be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems my life is just as uncertain and out of control as when I was human. I thought I\u2019d changed, learned. I thought I was more in control. I\u2019m scared of what\u2019s to come, what I don\u2019t understand yet.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes as Gabriel murmured, \u201cJane, you can\u2019t worry about the future so much that you miss out on the present. And I\u2019ll be with you. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>I slept that deep sleep that requires that you wake up with a patch of drool drying on your face. Vaguely, I remembered falling asleep with Gabriel, waking at one point when it was dark outside, and finding him awake next to me. I was hungry but far too tired to leave the bed, so he held his wrist to my lips and let me drink from him. There were a few more \u201csleepy patches,\u201d in which I woke, fed, and went back to sleep. But now I was just confused and had serious bed hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I asked, squinting in the twilight.</p><p>Gabriel stroked a thumb down my temple, where the flesh was smooth and unmarred now. \u201cSix P.M. On Thursday.\u201d</p><p>I bolted out of bed. \u201cHoly crap, I slept for three days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were exhausted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you had a lot of healing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea?\u201d I asked, slipping into some clean jeans.</p><p>\u201cRose late last night,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cShe was ravenous. She went through your entire supply of synthetic blood and the Hershey\u2019s syrup. Dick says he owes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll let it slide this once.\u201d I snorted. \u201cJust pry Dick off of my couch before tomorrow morning. I don\u2019t want him getting too comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel followed, laughing, as I tore out of bed and down the stairs. Andrea was standing in my living room, balancing my coffee table on one hand. There was a huge grin on her pale, angelic face. Dick looked like a human who\u2019d been staring at the sun for too long, dazzled and dazed. I launched myself at her, knocking the table right onto Dick\u2019s head as I hugged her. Dick was still smiling, even as he threw the wreckage over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She giggled, punching me on the arm. Gabriel, who had followed at a less frantic pace, snickered at Andrea\u2019s display of newfound strength.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d I rubbed my arm and glared at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to like you having superstrength ... or being all giddy. It\u2019s disconcerting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, let\u2019s be honest. My entire life was leading to this. I\u2019m lucky it didn\u2019t happen long before. Of course, I would have much rather that you or Dick turned me when I had, you know, a choice in the matter. But when I think about it, what was I staying human for, anyway? Emery made the choice I should have made a while ago. My family doesn\u2019t speak to me. Everyone I love is going to live forever. And how would my relationship with Dick work out in the long term without a change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really OK with this?\u201d I asked, giving her a long, appraising look. She\u2019d been merely beautiful in life. She was stunning now. Her skin was a perfect creamy pearl color that set off the fiery red of her hair. Her lips were soft and pink and full, curving over glistening white teeth. I searched her face for some sign of regret, of sorrow, but found nothing. There was a new exuberance to Andrea. It was if she\u2019d finally figured out what she\u2019d been missing all these years: fangs. \u201cBecause I had some ... adjustment issues that you don\u2019t seem to be having.\u201d</p><p>Andrea shuddered delicately. \u201cWell, the blood thing is gross. Even after spending so much time with you, I have to admit it\u2019s weird drinking it myself. But look at all the pros. I can climb walls and lift tables, and, frankly, my ass has never looked better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to eternity, Jane,\u201d she said, sliding onto Dick\u2019s lap. \u201cBesides, at least now, vampires won\u2019t see me as a snack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw you as a snack, baby doll.\u201d Dick chuckled, kissing her neck.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she cooed, crushing him to her.</p><p>\u201cMe, too, honey. Me, too.\u201d Dick stroked his fingers over Andrea\u2019s. I noticed that she was wearing the little ruby engagement ring he\u2019d shown me on Halloween night. I felt a rush of relief for both of them. Emery may have turned Andrea, but Dick had marked her forever. She was his. It was that simple. And I felt sorry for whoever said otherwise.</p><p>But instead of giving voice to these emotionally mature thoughts, I took the \u201cdisgusted teenager\u201d route. I groaned. \u201cUgh, are you two going to go through some sort of gross honeymoon phase? Because you\u2019re going to have to do that somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should consider another trip,\u201d Gabriel suggested. \u201cThe Southern Hemisphere should be far enough away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, calm down, both of you,\u201d Andrea said, smirking. \u201cYou might as well get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to write a \u2018PDA in the workplace\u2019 policy for the shop,\u201d I muttered to Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cNow that all the newborn angst is settled\u201d\u2014Andrea shot me a stern look\u2014\u201ccan we talk about why you don\u2019t need a stun gun?\u201d</p><p>I put up my hands in a defensive stance. \u201cOK, in hindsight, it was not my wisest purchase.\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>Love is about facing fear. The fear of rejection, the fear of intimacy, the fear of being hurt. With vampire relationships, the fear quotient tends to be a little higher.</p><p>\u2014Love Bites: A Female Vampire\u2019s Guide to Less</p><p>Destructive Relationships</p><p>W hen Gabriel helped me out of his car, I fussed with his tie, straightening the blue-gray silk before giving his bottom lip a nipping kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I kissed him again and adjusted the straps of my own blood-red silk party dress. \u201cFor guaranteeing that I will no longer be remembered as \u2018Planed Jane\u2019 by my classmates.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do I get the feeling that I\u2019m being used for my pretty face?\u201d he asked as we passed under a white and blue balloon arch and a banner that read, \u201cWelcome Back, Howlers! Class of 1998!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush up, arm candy,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Half-Moon Hollow High School\u2019s gym smelled exactly the same, like BO and anxiety. The reunion committee had tried valiantly to transform the gym into an Enchanted Paradise using the same props they used at our prom ten years before. Let\u2019s see, transparent plastic palm trees lined with twinkle lights? Check. Giant papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 volcano with fake flame streamers blowing out? Check. Giant parachute billowing artfully from the ceiling to give the impression that we were extremely well-dressed castaways under an impromptu shelter? Check. Ignoring the fact that said parachute\u2019s storage closet was rumored to be the conception site of Coach Kelly\u2019s love child with Mindy Noonan? Check.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a rite of passage?\u201d Gabriel asked, eyeing the faux volcano. \u201cWhat exactly does this signify?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, let\u2019s go,\u201d I said, turning on my heel and making what would have been a brilliant dash for the door if Gabriel hadn\u2019t caught my arm.</p><p>\u201cWe agreed this was an important part of your emotional development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did we agree to that?\u201d I demanded as he dragged me toward the registration table.</p><p>\u201cYou said it, I agreed to it. It\u2019s similar to a verbal contract.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a nice man,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve established that,\u201d he said as he planted me firmly in front of the table, where a brunette in a cantaloupe-colored suit turned to me with pasted-on smile. I searched her face. Huh. I was expecting to be confronted with someone who\u2019d tortured me in the cafeteria or mocked me in math. But I had no idea who this person was.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey ...\u201d I zeroed in on her name tag. I didn\u2019t even recognize the little senior photo that was laminated next to her name. Like so many of us who graduated from HHHS in the 1990s, she suffered from poufy bangs combined with the horrid plaid flannel of the grunge period. (Pop-culture influence had only so much sway over Hollow girls. We could not be persuaded to put away our curling irons.) I scanned the name. \u201cMary Beth. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know me.\u201d She chuckled as she handed me my name tag. I winced, because, no, I didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m always busy. I\u2019m just so glad to see you here. You look great. And who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my boyfriend, Gabriel,\u201d I said as she scribbled out a guest name tag with a Sharpie.</p> <p>Mary Beth winked broadly at him. \u201cWell, you better watch her, Gabriel. She was always one of the sassiest girls in the class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much has changed,\u201d Gabriel informed her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to find the two of you later so we can catch up,\u201d she cooed.</p><p>\u201cSee? That woman seemed very happy that you\u2019re here,\u201d he said as we walked away. \u201cShe said you were sassy and seemed to think it was a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea who that woman is,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cIt still counts. So, that\u2019s what you looked like in high school?\u201d he asked, staring at the tiny yearbook photo embossed on my name tag.</p><p>I pinched his arm. \u201cI went through an unfortunate-hair era. Don\u2019t judge me. You used to wear stockings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were in fashion at the time,\u201d he protested.</p> <p>\u201cSo were the permed bangs. Thank God for cruel college girls and a roommate who read Cosmo .\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t seen most of my classmates in a while. Some of them had actually managed to escape the Hollow and establish life on the outside. And the ones who did live in town had daytime schedules, so our paths didn\u2019t cross often. Everybody looked ... smaller. Not weightwise, because a few people had packed on some pounds. But somehow I remember these people as giants, looming over me. Most of them were smiling, making polite conversation. And the social boundaries that had defined us ten years ago seemed to have melted away. The former jocks were mixing with the AV club, the Homecoming queen had an affectionate arm around the softball captain. We ambled past a display of photos, surrounded by white votive candles. In glittery silver letters, it said, \u201cWe Remember Fondly ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the memorial board!\u201d I gasped. \u201cI thought I took care of that! I RSVP\u2019d, for goodness sake. Dead people don\u2019t RSVP!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least they remembered you fondly,\u201d Gabriel said, trying to find a silver lining.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d I huffed.</p><p>\u201cIt says fondly!\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jane, it\u2019s so nice to see you back from the dead,\u201d I heard Jolene drawl from behind me. Jolene was dressed in a simple sleeveless red dress, backlit by the low votives on the tables. Even with a baby tucked in her arms, her hotness was undeniable. She was smirking, obviously enjoying the premature reports of my demise.</p><p>\u201cYou brought the kids?\u201d I asked, taking Janelyn from her.</p><p>\u201cZeb sort of insisted on it,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. She nodded to where Zeb stood with Joe, surrounded by girls who wouldn\u2019t have given him the time of day in school. They were all cooing and making funny faces at the baby. I couldn\u2019t help but think he was trying to show them what they had missed by turning him down as a prom date.</p><p>\u201cSomething about proving to the jerks from wood shop that his \u2018boys swim.\u2019 And we weren\u2019t the only ones.\u201d She gestured to several other couples bouncing uncomfortable-looking babies in their Sunday best.</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cWell, the twins are obviously the best-looking babies here.\u201d</p><p>She smiled adoringly at Janelyn. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a good time?\u201d I asked a grinning Zeb as he hefted the baby on one hip.</p><p>\u201cThis is awesome!\u201d he cried as another group of women flocked around his beautiful children, cooing and ahhing. He handed Joe to me, taking Jolene\u2019s arm and dragging her toward Adam Morrow, Rick Mullen, and most of the former baseball team. \u201cI think some of the guys over there haven\u2019t seen Jolene yet.\u201d</p><p>Adam spotted me from across the room, and a smile lit up his perfect, even features. He straightened his tie and was two steps toward me when Gabriel slid his arm around my waist and commented on how fetching I looked with babies in my arms. Adam blanched, seeming to size Gabriel up in one long look, and took two steps back toward safety. I snickered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>I considered telling him, but I remembered Gabriel had threatened to literally put a boot up Adam\u2019s ass the previous year. I didn\u2019t think an introduction would go over very well.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing. Here, can you take one?\u201d I said, awkwardly shifting both babies in my arms.</p><p>\u201cEr, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified\u2014OK, then.\u201d Gabriel grimaced as I tucked Janelyn into the crook of his elbow. He looked into her little face and cleared his throat. \u201cUm, how do you do?\u201d He seemed offended when I laughed at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never held a baby before! It\u2019s not something men did in my time. Even if they were your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re doing beautifully,\u201d I promised, kissing him.</p><p>\u201cHey, cut that out, there are impressionable children present,\u201d Dick said, taking Joe from my arms and making silly faces. Joe, who thought Dick was the funniest person alive\u2014in his limited worldview\u2014gurgled hysterically.</p><p>Dick had been in high spirits for the last week or so. With Andrea\u2019s almost seamless transition into vampirism and his renewed friendship with Gabriel, the only thorn in his side was Emery\u2019s sentencing. Of course, Ophelia had lifted that burden a few days before, when she arrived at the shop, looking for a copy of the latest Michele Bardsley novel. Dick had asked her what the Council had decided to do with Emery. She gave him a razor-thin smile and said, \u201cThere is no Emery.\u201d And then she flounced out of the shop in her usual unsettling manner. Knowing that Emery had suffered hideously at the hands of the Council had given Dick and Andrea some measure of closure. Dick and Mr. Wainwright mourned the end of their bloodline but, given Emery\u2019s example, agreed it was probably for the best.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you qualify as impressionable anymore, Dick,\u201d Gabriel said dryly. \u201cBut the child label certainly fits.\u201d</p><p>Dick responded with a hand gesture that was also inappropriate for underage viewing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked. Dick had a tag on his chest declaring that he was Martin Gruber, president of the Chess Club and the Latin Society. Even in the short-sleeved plaid shirt and Clark Kent glasses (complete with white tape around the nose piece), Dick looked nothing like poor, gangly, bespectacled Martin. \u201cAnd what are you going to do if Martin actually shows up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaim identity theft. There was no way I was going to miss this.\u201d Dick snickered. \u201cZeb said there was a distinct possibility you might freak out and smack some people around. Maybe even a cheerleader. You know how I love it when you do that!\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and focused on Janelyn, who was spitting up on Gabriel\u2019s jacket. The twins giggled and drooled, oblivious to the fact that they were surrounded by monsters. Seriously, werewolves on one side of the family, vampires on the other. What were these kids going to be afraid of?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always clowns,\u201d I muttered to myself, shuddering.</p><p>Jolene swooped in as I struggled to keep Janelyn still and mop up the mess on Gabriel\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cUm, something\u2019s leaking from somewhere,\u201d I said, holding Janelyn at arm\u2019s length as she dribbled from her tiny rosebud mouth.</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby,\u201d Jolene cooed, tucking the baby into her arms and producing a wet wipe from her purse.</p><p>\u201cThat is the best part. I can give them back,\u201d I told Gabriel quietly.</p><p>Gabriel asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Andrea?\u201d</p><p>Dick nodded to the stunning pale redhead standing by the punchbowl, chatting with Hector Gonzalez and a girl I used to take French with. Andrea was pretending to be Dora Grady. Overweight, cursed with bad skin and a shock of unruly red frizz, Dora was our very own Carrie White, without the telekinetic revenge. While I didn\u2019t exactly participate in the locker-room abuse of Dora, my social paralysis, my failure to do anything to help her, still haunted me years later. If anyone deserved to reemerge as slim, beautiful Andrea, it was Dora. I wondered where she was and hoped that she\u2019d found some measure of happiness, that she wasn\u2019t here tonight because she\u2019d decided her former classmates weren\u2019t worth her time.</p><p>And that she wasn\u2019t lurking in the eaves of the gym, waiting to trap us inside and kill us in a well-deserved inferno.</p><p>I shook off these thoughts. Andrea was adjusting to vampire life far faster than I had. She was already used to nighttime hours. She didn\u2019t have the moral confusion I did about feeding from donors, having been in their shoes. And she and her vampire boyfriend, now fianc\u00e9, had settled most of their issues before she was turned. I could only hope that she wouldn\u2019t ask me to be a bridesmaid.</p><p>I thought back to my plan for a Brave New Jane. Andrea would never need one, but so far, I\u2019d made impressive headway on mine.</p><p>Normal, healthy relationship? As normal and healthy as I was ever going to get, so: Check.</p><p>Fulfilling career? Check.</p><p>Loving, nonjudgmental family? I\u2019d created my own and managed to include a few blood relatives, so: Check.</p><p>Plan for world peace? I\u2019d get right on it.</p><p>I was standing there, admiring my friend, when Gabriel tapped me on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201d he asked, leading me away from the punchbowl, oozing infants, and our friends.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked as we quietly left the gym and headed for the electives building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo sneak around the campus for a little bit in the dark.

The horror movies where loving couples are killed by maniacs wielding farm implements. Please don\u2019t tell me that after all this, you\u2019re leading me to my death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re already dead, and I\u2019ve gotten used to having you around.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. \u201cRight back atcha, sweetheart. But seriously, what are we doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave your sister a present today,\u201d he said, slipping his hand into mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dragging me out in the hall to tell me you gave my sister a present? This is just like my sixteenth birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing you out here to tell you that I went to your sister earlier tonight and offered her the deed to my house.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cYou mean the deed to one of your nicer rental properties?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo my house on Silver Ridge Road. I asked if she would like to have it, and she accepted. Actually, I\u2019d barely uttered the word \u2018deed,\u2019 and she\u2019d accepted. She\u2019d like to move in as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>I found that didn\u2019t bother me as much as I thought it would. Our muddy catharsis seemed to have exorcised the old, almost instinctual resentments toward Jenny, though it was sort of weird to be around her now that we\u2019d called an unofficial truce. I was so used to automatically rejecting any invitation to family gatherings that I stumbled over telling Mama that, yes, I\u2019d come to Thanksgiving and to tell Jenny that I\u2019d bring my own dessert blood. When we talked, Jenny couldn\u2019t figure out where to put her hands. It was like a bad commercial audition. Also, now that she wasn\u2019t openly knocking me to Grandma Ruthie anymore, I don\u2019t think they were spending as much time together as they used to. Mama was beside herself with joy, even though I still turned down half her invitations.</p><p>I said that Jenny and I had reconciled, not that I\u2019d gone crazy.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a huge part of your family history. Why would you give it up?\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cEh, I\u2019ve lived there for a hundred and fifty years. I was getting bored with it. Besides, nobody will take better care of the place than Jenny. And I suspect she\u2019ll let your mother put the house on the Historical Society\u2019s Spring Tour of Homes, which will indirectly cement your mother\u2019s affections for me even further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re basically homeless now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I still have the houses in\u2014\u201d Gabriel caught himself. \u201cYes, yes, I am.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cSo, where do you plan on living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was thinking I might move in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait to be asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d be waiting forever,\u201d he muttered. In a very deliberate motion, he squared my shoulders in front of his and clasped my arms. \u201cI know I could never ask you to leave River Oaks. It means a lot more to you than my family\u2019s house means to me. Your aunt Jettie is there. It\u2019s your home. I would like it to be my home, too. I want to make a life with you, and for most people, that means living in the same house.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel kissed me, as gentle as an angel\u2019s wing brushing across my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re my bloodmate in every sense of the word, the person I choose to spend the rest of my immortal life with, if you can stand me that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what that means?\u201d My forehead wrinkled in concentration, and I tried to remember the first time I\u2019d hear that word. \u201cWait, you told Missy the crazy Realtor that she\u2019d suffer dire consequences if she hurt your \u2018bloodmate.\u2019 That was more than a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew even then. You\u2019re it for me, Jane. You\u2019re my eternity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, why couldn\u2019t you have told me?\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>Gabriel shrugged. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to hear it yet,\u201d I finished for him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d But as the enormity of what Gabriel had just said sunk in, a huge grin split my face. I brought it under control, so I could narrow my eyes at him. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you will tell me everything now. You won\u2019t try to protect me or keep me in the dark. You\u2019ll trust me to make a rational decision about bad news after I have my inevitable, initial panic attack?\u201d</p><p>He nodded solemnly. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when I have my spastic fits of insecurity, when I make inappropriate jokes and wonder aloud why you love me, you\u2019ll understand that this has nothing to do with you but years and years of conditioning by my mother?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you agree never to accept invitations issued by my family unless you check with me first?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>I giggled, throwing my arms around him and kissing him deeply. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, it\u2019s my turn,\u201d he said, cupping my face so I was locked in that bottomless gray gaze of his. \u201cDo you promise to trust that I want to be with you and no one else? That I\u2019m not going anywhere? Will you promise to stop trying to find problems in our relationship where there are none, to give us time to work on the problems we do have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat problems?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel huffed out a breath. \u201cJane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promised.</p><p>\u201cWill you quit trying to push me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you promise never to let Dick move into our house?\u201d</p><p>I snickered. \u201cI will ... but, um, there\u2019s one last thing.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we wait on telling my mother that you\u2019re moving in? As much as she likes you, she has this thing about \u2018living in sin.\u2019 The minute she finds out, the pressure for you to make an honest woman of me will start. She\u2019s already making noises about us getting engaged. I think this would just fuel her fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could always propose,\u201d he suggested, kissing my cheek.</p><p>Suddenly, my mouth went dry. As much as I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without Gabriel, I knew that neither one of us was ready for the rice-and-veil route just yet. We\u2019d only reconciled a few weeks before. As sure as I was of his love, I needed more time before I could accept a ring from him.</p><p>What can I say? I\u2019m a contrary soul.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m not ready yet,\u201d I told him. Gabriel tried and failed to tamp down the flash of disappointment on his face. \u201cI won\u2019t marry anyone but you, Gabriel Nightengale. But for now, let\u2019s just see if we can live together without anyone getting hurt. And the family thing, it won\u2019t be that big of a deal. It just means you can\u2019t leave any evidence of you living there lying around where my family can see it, like clothes or personal items or your car. It\u2019s just for the next few decades, until, you know, they die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You can face down psychotic vampires and legions of anal-retentive entrepreneurs, but you\u2019re afraid to tell your parents that I\u2019ll be living with you before marriage?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to talk about this,\u201d Gabriel said dryly.</p><p>\u201cBut hey, between Jenny\u2019s new attitude and having you present at Christmas, I may be able to escape the holidays unscathed.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel blanched, his face even paler in the moonlight filtering through the window. \u201cChristmas? With your relatives?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, my fangs nicking my lip. \u201cWelcome to the family, honey.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled back and kissed me, long and deep. \u201cI can live with that.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
