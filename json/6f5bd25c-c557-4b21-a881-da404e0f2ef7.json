Carnage he\u2019d helped create.</p><p>Torches flickered orange and gold, twining with shadows along the stone walls. Walls that were now spattered with vivid red, dripping...pooling. The sandy floor was thick like paste, wet and colored black. Half an hour ago it had been honey brown, grains sparkling and scattering as they\u2019d marched. Now bodies littered every square inch of the small corridor, the scent of fatality already rising from them.Nine of his enemy had survived the attack. They\u2019d already been stripped of their weapons, hustled into a corner and bound with rope. Most trembled in fear. A few had their shoulders squared, their noses in the air, hatred in their eyes, refusing to back down even in defeat. Damned admirable.</p><p>Too bad that bravery had to be quashed.</p> <p>Brave men didn\u2019t spill their secrets, and Sabin wanted their secrets.</p><p>He was a warrior who did what needed to be done, when it needed to be done, no matter what was required of him. Killing, torturing, seducing. He didn\u2019t hesitate to ask his men to do the same, either. With Hunters\u2014mortals who\u2019d decided he and his fellow Lords of the Underworld made good whipping boys for the world\u2019s evil\u2014victory was the only thing that mattered. For only by winning the war could his friends finally know peace. Peace they deserved. Peace he craved for them.</p><p>Shallow, erratic rasps of breath filled Sabin\u2019s ears. His, his friends\u2019, his enemies\u2019. They\u2019d fought with every ounce of strength they possessed, each of them. It had been a battle of good versus evil, and evil had won. Or rather, what these Hunters considered evil. He and his brothers-by-circumstance thought otherwise.</p><p>Yeah, long ago they\u2019d opened Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the demons from inside. But they had been punished eternally, each warrior cursed by the gods to host one of those vile fiends inside himself. Yeah, they\u2019d once been slaves to their new, demonic halves, destructive and violent, killers without a conscience. But they had control now, human in all the ways that mattered. For the most part.</p><p>Sometimes the demons did fight...did win...did destroy.</p> <p>Still. We deserve to live, he thought. Like everyone else, they suffered if their friends were hurt, read books, watched movies, gave to charity. Fell in love. Hunters, though, would never see it that way. They were convinced the world would be a better place without the Lords. A utopia, serene and perfect. They believed every sin ever committed could be laid at a demon\u2019s feet. Maybe because they were dumb as shit. Maybe because they hated their lives and were simply looking for someone to blame. Either way, killing them had become the most important mission of Sabin\u2019s life. His utopia was a life without them.</p><p>Which was why he and the others had relinquished the comforts of their Budapest home to spend the past three weeks searching every godsforsaken pyramid in Egypt for ancient artifacts that would lead to the recovery of Pandora\u2019s box\u2014the very thing Hunters planned to use to destroy them. Finally, he and his friends had hit the jackpot.</p><p>\u201cAmun,\u201d he said, spotting the soldier in a far, dark corner. As usual, man blended perfectly with shadow. Sabin motioned toward the captives with a grim shake of his head. \u201cYou know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Amun, keeper of Secrets, nodded forbiddingly before striding forward. Silent, always silent, as if afraid the terrible secrets he\u2019d gleaned over the centuries would spill from him if he dared utter a single word.</p><p>Seeing the hulking warrior who\u2019d ripped through their brethren like a knife through silk, the remaining Hunters took a collective step backward. Even the brave ones. Wise of them.</p><p>Amun was tall, leanly muscled, with a stride that was somehow both purposeful and graceful. Purpose without grace would have made him seem normal, like any other soldier. The combination allowed him to exude the kind of quiet savagery usually found in predators used to bringing their prey home between their jaws.</p> <p>He reached the Hunters and stopped. Scanned the thinned crowd. Then shoved forward and grabbed the one in the center by the throat, lifting him so that they were eye to eye. The human\u2019s legs flailed, his hands clutching Amun\u2019s wrists as his skin blanched.</p><p>\u201cLet him go, you filthy demon,\u201d one of the Hunters shouted, jerking on his comrade\u2019s waist. \u201cYou\u2019ve killed countless innocents, ruined so many lives already!\u201d</p><p>Amun was unmoved. They all were.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d another cried. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to die. Especially at the hands of such evil!\u201d</p><p>Gideon, the blue-haired, kohl-eyed keeper of Lies, was at Amun\u2019s side in the next instant, batting the protestors away. \u201cTouch him again, and I\u2019ll kiss the hell out of you.\u201d He withdrew a pair of serrated knives, still bloody from his most recent clashes.</p><p>Kiss equaled beat in Gideon\u2019s upside-down world. Or was it kill? Sabin had lost track of Lies\u2019s code.</p><p>A moment passed in confused silence, the Hunters trying to figure out what exactly Gideon meant. Before they could decide, Amun\u2019s hostage stilled, wilting completely, and Amun dropped him to the ground in a motionless heap.</p><p>Amun remained in place for a long while. No one touched him. Not even the Hunters. They were too preoccupied with reviving their fallen cohort. They didn\u2019t know that it was too late, that his brain had been wiped, Amun the new owner of all his deepest secrets. Perhaps even his memories. The warrior had never told Sabin how it worked, and Sabin had never asked.</p> <p>Slowly Amun turned, his body stiff. His black gaze met Sabin\u2019s for a bleak, tormented moment in which he couldn\u2019t mask the pain of having a new voice inside his head. Then he blinked, hiding his pain as he had a thousand times before, and strode to the far wall while Sabin watched, resolute. I will not feel guilty. This has to be done.</p><p>The wall looked the same as any other, jagged stones piled on top of each other and rising at a slant, yet Amun placed one hand on the seventh stone down, fingers splayed, then his other hand on the fifth up, fingers closed. Moving in sync, he twisted one wrist to the left, one to the right.</p><p>The stones pivoted with him.</p><p>Sabin observed the proceedings with awe. Never ceased to amaze him, what Amun could learn in a few heartbeats of time.</p><p>Once the stones settled into their new positions, a crack formed in the center of each, branching up, down, aligning with a streak of space Sabin hadn\u2019t noticed before. A section of the wall pulled back...back, and finally began to inch to the side. There would be a gaping doorway when it finished, wide enough for an army of hulking beasts like himself.</p><p>As it continued to widen, cool air blustered through the catacombs, causing the torches to sputter and crackle. Hurry, he projected to the stones. Had anything ever moved with such agonizing slowness?</p><p>\u201cAny Hunters waiting on the other side?\u201d he asked, sliding his Sig Sauer from his waist and checking the clip. Three bullets left. He dug a few more from his pocket and reloaded. The custom silencer remained in place.</p><p>Amun nodded and held up seven fingers before standing guard at that ever-widening chasm.</p><p>Seven Hunters against ten Lords. He didn\u2019t count Amun because the man would soon be too distracted by the new voice in his head to fight. But gods knew Amun would still (silently) demand to be included in the action. Still. Poor Hunters. They didn\u2019t have a chance. \u201cThey know we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>A shake of that dark head.</p><p>No cameras watching their every move, then. Excellent.</p><p>\u201cSeven Hunters is child\u2019s play,\u201d Lucien, keeper of Death, confirmed as he slumped against the far wall. He was pale, his mismatched eyes bright with...fever? \u201cGo on without me. I\u2019m fading. I\u2019ll soon have souls to escort, anyway. And then I\u2019ll have to flash our prisoners to the dungeon in Buda.\u201d</p><p>Thanks to the demon of Death, Lucien could move from one location to another with only a thought and was often forced to usher the dead into the hereafter. That didn\u2019t mean he himself was immune to destruction. Sabin frowned over at him. Studied him. The scars on his face were more pronounced, his nose out of joint. There was a bullet wound in his shoulder, one in his stomach, and from the looks of the crimson stain spreading from his lower back, his kidney.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, man?\u201d</p><p>Lucien smiled wryly. \u201cI\u2019ll live. Tomorrow, though, I\u2019ll probably wish I hadn\u2019t. A few organs are shredded.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Been there, had to recover from that. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to regenerate a limb.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw Amun flash hand signs.</p><p>\u201cNot only are there no cameras installed, but they\u2019re in a chamber with soundproof walls,\u201d Sabin interpreted. \u201cThis was an ancient prison and the masters did not want anyone to hear their slaves screaming. The Hunters are completely oblivious to our presence, which should make it easy to ambush them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me for a simple ambush. I\u2019ll stay behind with Lucien,\u201d Reyes said, sliding to his ass and propping his back on a stone to hold himself up. Reyes had been paired with the demon of Pain. Physical agony brought him pleasure and being injured actually strengthened him. While fighting. When the fight ended, however, he weakened like anyone else. Right now, he was more battered than the rest of them, with a cheek so swollen his line of vision had to be shit. \u201cBesides, someone needs to guard the prisoners.\u201d</p><p>Seven against eight, then. Poor Hunters. Actually, Sabin suspected Reyes wanted to stay behind to guard Lucien\u2019s body from the enemy. Lucien could take it with him to the spirit world only when he was strong enough, which he probably wasn\u2019t now.</p><p>\u201cYour women are going to give me hell,\u201d Sabin muttered. The two had recently fallen in love, and both Anya and Danika had asked only one thing of Sabin before the warriors left for Egypt: bring my man back safely.</p><p>When the boys arrived home in this damaged condition, Danika would shake her head at Sabin in disappointment as she rushed to soothe Reyes and Sabin would feel slimier than the mud on his boots. Anya would shoot him exactly as Lucien had been shot, then comfort Lucien, and Sabin would feel pain. Lots and lots of pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sighing, Sabin eyed the rest of the warriors, trying to decide who was good to go and who needed to remain behind. Maddox\u2014Violence\u2014was the fiercest fighter he\u2019d ever known. Right now the warrior was as blood-soaked as Sabin and panting for breath, but he\u2019d already moved beside Amun, ready for action. His woman wasn\u2019t going to be any happier with Sabin than the others.</p><p>Slight shift, and the lovely Cameo came into view. She was the keeper of Misery, as well as the only female soldier among them. What she lacked in size she made up for in ferocity. Besides, all she had to do was start talking, all the sorrows of the world in her voice, and humans were likely to kill themselves without her ever having to lay a finger on them. Someone had sliced at her neck, leaving three deep grooves. It didn\u2019t seem to slow her down as she finished cleaning her machete and joined Amun and Maddox.</p><p>Another shift. Paris was the keeper of Promiscuity and once upon a time, he\u2019d been the most jovial among them. Now he seemed harder, more restless with every day that passed, though Sabin couldn\u2019t fathom what had caused the change. Whatever the reason, he currently loomed in front of the Hunters, huffing and growling and so keyed for war he vibrated with brutal energy. And though there were two gushing holes in his right leg, Sabin didn\u2019t think the warrior would be asking to rest anytime soon.</p> <p>Beside him was Aeron, Wrath. Only recently had the gods freed him from a curse of bloodlust where no one around him had been safe. He\u2019d lived to hurt, to kill. At moments like these, he still did. Today he\u2019d fought as though that lust still consumed him, hacking at and mauling anyone within his reach. That was good, except...</p><p>How much worse would that bloodlust be when the next fight ended? Sabin feared they would have to summon Legion, the tiny, blood-hungry demon who worshipped Aeron like a god and was the only one who could calm Aeron during his darker moods. Unfortunately, she was currently doing surveillance work for them in hell. Sabin liked to keep up-to-date on Underworld happenings. Knowledge was power and one never knew what one would be able to use.</p><p>Aeron suddenly slammed a fist into a Hunter\u2019s temple, sending the human to the floor in an unconscious heap.</p><p>Sabin blinked at him. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was about to attack.\u201d</p> <p>Doubtful, but just like that, Paris cut whatever invisible tether had been holding him in place and swooped through the rest of the huddle, methodically punching the Hunters until every single one of them was down.</p><p>\u201cThat should keep them calm as Amun for the time being,\u201d he rasped darkly.</p><p>Sighing, Sabin switched his attention yet again. There was Strider, Defeat. The man couldn\u2019t lose at anything without enduring debilitating pain, so he made sure to win. Always. Which was probably why he was digging a bullet out of his side in preparation for the battle to come. Good. Sabin could always count on him.</p><p>Kane, keeper of Disaster, walked in front of him, ducking as a shower of pebbles fell from the ceiling, plumes of dust spraying in every direction. Several warriors coughed.</p><p>\u201cUh, Kane,\u201d Sabin said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here, too? You can help Reyes watch the prisoners.\u201d A flimsy excuse and they all knew it.</p><p>There was a pause, the only sound to be heard the scrape of stone against sand as the doorway continued that slow glide. Then Kane gave a clipped nod. He hated being left out, that much Sabin knew, but his presence sometimes caused more problems than it solved. And as always, Sabin placed victory above his friends\u2019 feelings. It wasn\u2019t something he enjoyed doing, wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d do in any other situation. But someone had to act with cold-blooded logic or else they\u2019d always lose.</p> <p>With Kane out, that made the coming battle seven against seven. Totally even. Poor Hunters. They still didn\u2019t stand a chance. \u201cAnyone else want to stay behind?\u201d</p><p>A chorus of \u201cNo\u201d circled the chamber, eagerness dripping from the different timbres. An eagerness Sabin shared.</p><p>Until Pandora\u2019s box was found, these skirmishes were a necessity. But it couldn\u2019t be found without those damn godly artifacts to show the way. And as one of the four relics was supposedly here in Egypt, this particular skirmish was more important than most. He would not allow Hunters to claim a single artifact, for that box could destroy Sabin and everyone he held dear, drawing the demons out of their bodies and leaving only lifeless shells.</p><p>Despite his confidence that he would win this day, he knew he would have to work for victory. Led as the Hunters were by Sabin\u2019s sworn enemy, Galen, a demon-possessed immortal in disguise, those \u201cprotectors of all that was good and right\u201d were privy to information humans should not have been privy to. Such as the best way to distract the Lords...the best way to capture them...the best way to destroy them.</p><p>Finally the stone ceased sliding, and Amun peeked inside. He waved a hand to signal it was safe to enter. No one stepped forward. Sabin\u2019s men and Lucien\u2019s had only just resumed fighting together, having been separated for over a thousand years. They hadn\u2019t yet learned the best formation.</p><p>\u201cWe going to do this or just stand here and wait for them to find us?\u201d Aeron grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you, all unenthusiastic and shit,\u201d Gideon said with a smirk. \u201cI\u2019m not impressed.\u201d</p><p>Time to take charge, Sabin mused. He considered the best strategy. These last few centuries he\u2019d gotten nowhere with the Hunters, rushing heedlessly into battle with only a single thought: kill. But the enemy\u2019s numbers were growing, not shrinking, and to be honest, their determination and hatred were growing, as well. It was time for a new way of battle, of cataloging his resources and weaknesses before charging ahead.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first since I\u2019m the least injured.\u201d He curled his finger under the trigger of his gun before reluctantly sheathing it. \u201cI want you staggered, a less injured man paired with a more injured one. You\u2019ll work together, most injured acting as backup while the healthier takes out the target. Leave as many as you can alive,\u201d he commanded. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to, that it goes against every instinct you possess. But don\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll die soon enough. Once we ferret out the leader\u2014and learn his secrets\u2014they\u2019ll be useless to us and you can do what you want to them.\u201d</p><p>The trio blocking his path broke apart, allowing him to sail inside the narrow hallway without pause, then everyone filed behind him, their footfalls offering only the slightest whisper. Battery-powered lamps illuminated the hieroglyph-covered walls. Sabin allowed his gaze to rest on those glyphs for only a second, but that was long enough to burn the images into his mind. They showed one prisoner after another being ushered to a cruel execution, hearts removed while they still beat inside their chests.</p><p>Human scents coated the stale, dusty air: cologne, sweat, an assortment of foods. How long had the Hunters been here? What were they doing here? Had they already found the artifact?</p><p>The questions skated through his mind, and his demon latched on to them. As Doubt, it couldn\u2019t help itself. Clearly they know something you do not. It might be enough to topple you. Your friends could very well take their last breaths this night.</p><p>Doubt could not lie, not without causing Sabin to pass out cold. It could only use derision and supposition to topple its victims. He\u2019d never understood why a fiend from hell couldn\u2019t utilize deceit\u2014best he could come up with was that the demon carried a curse of its own\u2014but he\u2019d long since accepted it. Not that he\u2019d allow himself to topple this night. Keep it up and I\u2019ll spend the next week sequestered in my bedroom, reading so I can\u2019t think too much.</p><p>But I need to feed, was the whined reply. The worry it caused was its greatest nourishment.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Hurry.</p><p>Sabin held up his hand, stopped, and the warriors behind him stopped as well. There was a chamber up ahead, its doorway already open. The sound of voices and footsteps echoed, perhaps even the buzz of a drill.</p><p>The Hunters were indeed distracted and begging for an ambush. I\u2019m just the man to give it to them.</p><p>Are you, really? the demon began, Sabin\u2019s threat unheeded. Last time I checked\u2014</p><p>Forget about me. I\u2019ve supplied you with food as promised.</p><p>There was a gleeful exclamation inside his head, and then Doubt was opening its mind to the Hunters inside the pyramid, whispering all manner of destructive thoughts. All for nothing...what if you\u2019re wrong...not strong enough...could soon die...</p><p>Conversation tapered away. Someone might even have whimpered.</p><p>Sabin held up a finger, then another. When he raised the third, he and the warriors jumped into motion, a war cry echoing.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>GWENDOLYN THE TIMID SHRANK against the far wall of her glass cell the moment the horde of too-tall, too-muscled, too-bloody warriors charged into the chamber she\u2019d both loved and hated for over a year. Loved, for being inside of it would have meant she was out of her cell, freedom a possibility. Hated, for all the torturous deeds that had taken place there. Deeds she\u2019d witnessed and feared.</p><p>The very men who had performed those deeds gave startled cries, dropping their Petri dishes, needles, vials and various tools. Glass shattered. Savage roars boomed, the intruders leaping forward with practiced menace, their arms slashing, their legs kicking. Down, down their targets fell. There was no question about who would win this fight.Gwen trembled, unsure what would happen to her and the others when things settled. The warriors were clearly inhuman, like her, like all the women locked in the cells surrounding hers. They were too hard, too strong, too everything to be mortal. Exactly what they were, however, she didn\u2019t know. Why were they here? What did they want?</p><p>She\u2019d known so many disappointments this last year that she didn\u2019t dare hope they\u2019d come on a rescue mission. Would she and the others be left here to rot? Or would these men try and use them as the detestable humans had done?</p><p>\u201cKill them!\u201d one of the captured shouted to the new warriors, the sound of her hard, angry voice causing Gwen to draw her arms around her middle. \u201cMake them suffer as we have suffered.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The glass that kept the women removed from the outside world was thick, impenetrable by fist or even bullet, yet every heartbreak inside the chamber and cells was a blast inside Gwen\u2019s ears.</p><p>She knew how to block the noise, something her sisters had taught her to do as a young child, but she desperately wanted to hear her captors\u2019 defeat. Their grunts of pain were like midnight lullabies to her. Soothing and sweet.</p><p>But strong as the warriors obviously were, they never once delivered a deathblow. Oddly, they merely wounded their prey, knocking them unconscious before focusing on the next opponent. And after what seemed too-short seconds but had probably been minutes, only one human was left standing. The worst of the lot.</p> <p>One of the warriors stepped forward, approaching him. Though all the newcomers had possessed lethal skill, this one had fought the dirtiest, going for the groin, the throat. He raised his arm as if to render the final blow, but then Gwen\u2019s wide-eyed gaze caught his and he paused. Slowly he lowered his arm.</p><p>Her breath caught. Brown hair soaked with blood was plastered to his head. His eyes were the color of brandy, deep and dark, and they, too, were threaded with crimson. Impossible. Surely she imagined the wild glow. His face, so roughly hewn it could only have been carved from granite, promised destruction in its every line and hollow, though there was something almost...boyish about him. A startling contradiction.</p><p>His shirt had been slashed to ribbons, rope after rope of sun-kissed muscle visible every time he moved. Oh, the sun. How she missed it, craved it. A violet butterfly tattoo wrapped around his right rib cage and dipped into the waist of his pants. The points of its wings were razored, making it appear at once feminine and masculine. Why a butterfly? she wondered. Seemed odd that such a strong, vicious warrior would have chosen it. Whatever the reason, the mark somehow comforted her.</p><p>\u201cHelp us,\u201d she said, praying the immortal could hear through soundproof glass as she could. But if he heard her, he gave no indication. \u201cFree us.\u201d Still no reaction.</p><p>What if they leave you here? Or worse, what if they\u2019re here for the same reason as the humans?</p> <p>The thoughts filled her head suddenly, and she frowned, perhaps even paled. The fears weren\u2019t out of place; she\u2019d wondered the exact same things only a short while ago. But these were somehow different...foreign. They were not her own, not spoken in her own inner voice. How...what...?</p><p>Sharp white teeth sank into the man\u2019s bottom lip as he clawed at his temples, clearly infuriated.</p><p>What if\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he snarled.</p><p>The thought forming inside her head halted abruptly. She blinked in confusion. The warrior shook his head, scowl intensifying.</p><p>Distracted as the immortal clearly was, her human tormentor decided to act, closing the remaining distance between them.</p> <p>Gwen straightened, calling, \u201cLook out!\u201d</p><p>Attention remaining fixed on Gwen, the granite-faced warrior reached out an arm and grabbed the human by the neck, choking and stopping him at the same time. The man\u2014Chris was his name\u2014flailed. He was young, perhaps twenty-five, but still leader of the guards and scientists here. He was also a man she despised more than captivity.</p><p>Everything I do, I do for the greater good, he was fond of saying, just before he raped one of the other women right in front of her. He could have artificially inseminated them, but had preferred the humiliation of forced intercourse. I wish this was you, he had often added. Every one of these females is a substitute for you.</p><p>Despite his desires, he\u2019d never touched her. He was too afraid of her. They all were. They knew what she was; they\u2019d seen her in action the day they came for her. Unintentionally maul a few humans to death, and a girl gained a reputation, she supposed. Rather than eliminate her, however, they\u2019d kept her, experimenting with different drugs in the ventilation system in the hopes of knocking her out long enough to use her. They hadn\u2019t yet succeeded, but they hadn\u2019t given up, either.</p><p>\u201cSabin, no,\u201d a beautiful, dark-haired female said, patting the once again red-eyed warrior on the shoulder. Her voice was so laden with sorrow, Gwen cringed. \u201cLike you told us, we might need him.\u201d</p><p>Sabin. A strong name, reminiscent of a weapon. Fitting.</p><p>Were the two lovers?</p><p>Finally that all-consuming gaze left her, and she was able to breathe. Sabin dropped Chris and the bastard fell to the ground, unconscious. She knew he still lived because she could hear the rush of blood in his veins, the crackle of air filling his lungs.</p> <p>\u201cWho are these women?\u201d a blond warrior said. He had bright blue eyes and a lovely face that promised compassion and safety, but he was not the one Gwen suddenly imagined herself curling next to and sleeping beside peacefully. Deeply. Safely. Finally.</p><p>All these months, she\u2019d been afraid to sleep, knowing Chris would have loved to take her unaware. So she\u2019d slumbered in short, shallow spurts, never relaxing her guard. Sometimes she\u2019d had to refrain from simply giving herself to the evil man in exchange for the prospect of closing her eyes and sinking into dark oblivion.</p><p>A black-haired, violet-eyed mountain stepped forward, eyeing the cells surrounding Gwen\u2019s. \u201cDear gods. That one is pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is that one.\u201d This speaker had multicolored hair, pale skin and eyes as brilliant a blue as his blond friend\u2019s, though this man\u2019s were rimmed with a darker shade. \u201cWhat kind of bastards keep pregnant females in these conditions? This is low even for Hunters.\u201d</p><p>The females in question were banging on the glass, begging for help, for freedom.</p><p>\u201cAnyone hear what they\u2019re saying?\u201d the mountain asked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Gwen answered automatically.</p><p>Sabin turned to her. That brown gaze no longer sleeked with red once more honed in on her, probing, searching...perusing.</p><p>A shiver danced the length of her spine. Could he hear her? Her eyes widened as he strode to her cell, sheathing a knife at his waist. Heightened as her senses were, she caught the barest hint of sweat, lemon and mint. She inhaled deeply, savoring every nuance. For so long, she\u2019d smelled nothing but Chris and his overpowering cologne, his pungent drugs and the terror of the other females.</p><p>\u201cYou can hear us?\u201d Sabin\u2019s timbre was as rough as his features and should have grated her nerves like sandpaper, but somehow soothed her like a caress.</p><p>Tentatively, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cCan they?\u201d He pointed to the other prisoners.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He, too, shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m reading your lips.\u201d</p><p>Oh. That meant he\u2019d been\u2014was\u2014watching her intently, even when his head had been turned. The knowledge was not unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cHow do we open the glass?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her lips pressed in a stubborn line, and she dared a quick look at the heavily armed, blood-coated predators behind him. Should she tell him? What if they planned to rape her fellow prisoners, just as the others had done? Just as she\u2019d feared?</p><p>His harsh expression softened. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come to harm you. You have my word. We just want to free you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know him, knew better than to trust him, but pushed to shaky legs anyway and lumbered to the glass. Up close like this, she realized that Sabin towered over her and his eyes were not brown as she\u2019d supposed. Rather, they were ringed with amber, coffee, auburn and bronze, a symphony of colors. Thankfully, the glow of red was still gone. Had she imagined it those times?</p><p>\u201cWoman?\u201d he said.</p><p>If he opened the cell as promised...if she could gather her courage and not freeze in place as was her habit...escape would finally be possible. The hope she\u2019d denied earlier sprang to life, unstoppable and tantalizing, tempered only by the thought that she might cruelly and brutally destroy these possible saviors without meaning to.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry. Unless they try to harm you, your beast will remain caged. One wrong move from them, though...</p><p>Worth the risk, she thought, saying, \u201cStones.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cBones?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing the lump in her throat, she lifted one of her nails\u2014a claw when compared to a human\u2019s\u2014and carved the word STONES in the glass. Each etching would hold only long enough for her to finish a letter before wiping clean. Damned godly glass. She\u2019d often wondered how the humans had acquired it.</p><p>A pause. A frown, his attention remaining fixed on her too-long, pointed nail. Was he wondering what type of creature she was?</p><p>Then, \u201cStones?\u201d Sabin asked, gaze once more meeting hers.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He spun in a circle, eyeing the entire chamber. Though the look-over lasted only a few seconds, Gwen suspected he\u2019d cataloged every inch of the place and could have found his way out of it in the dark.</p><p>The warriors lined up behind him, all staring at her expectantly. Mixed with the expectation, however, was curiosity, suspicion, hatred\u2014for her?\u2014and even lust. One step, two, she backed away. She\u2019d take hate over lust any day. Her legs trembled so violently she feared her muscles would give out. Stay calm. You cannot panic. Bad things happen when you panic.</p><p>How did one combat the desire of others? There was nothing she could do to cover herself more than she already was. Upon her imprisonment, her jeans and T-shirt had been replaced with a white tank and short skirt her captors had given her\u2014easier access that way. Bastards. One of the tank straps had ripped months ago and the shirt now gaped. She\u2019d had to tie it under her arm to keep her breast covered.</p><p>\u201cTurn away,\u201d Sabin suddenly growled.</p><p>Gwen spun without thought, long red hair swaying at her sides. Breath sawed in and out of her mouth, and sweat beaded over her brow. Why had he wanted her back? To better subdue her?</p><p>There was another of those heavy pauses. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean you, woman.\u201d This time, Sabin\u2019s voice was soft, gentle.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on,\u201d someone said. She recognized the rich, irreverent tone of the male with the blond hair and blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring her.\u201d</p><p>Gwen peeked over her shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut she\u2014\u201d the heavily tattooed one began.</p><p>Once again Sabin interjected. \u201cYou want answers or not? I said turn!\u201d</p><p>A few groans, the shuffling of feet.</p> <p>\u201cWoman.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she pivoted back around. All of the warriors had turned as Sabin commanded, giving her their backs.</p><p>Sabin placed a palm against the glass. It was large, unscarred and steady, but streaked with blood. \u201cWhich stones?\u201d</p><p>She pointed to a grouping in a case beside him. They were small, about the size of a fist, and each had a different way to die painted on the front. The highlights: a beheading, limb removal, a stabbing, a pike through the gut and a wildfire climbing the body of a man nailed to a tree.</p><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s good. But what do I do with them?\u201d</p> <p>Now panting with the need to be free\u2014close, so close\u2014she pantomimed the placing of a stone into a hole, like a key into a lock.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter which stone goes where?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then pointed to each particular stone and which cell it opened. She\u2019d come to dread the use of those stones, as it meant she would be forced to witness another rape. Sighing, she began to scratch the word KEY into the glass when Sabin slammed a fist into the stones\u2019 case, shattering the outer shell. It would have taken the strength of ten humans to do such a thing, yet he made it look effortless.</p><p>Several cuts branched from his knuckles to his wrists. Beads of crimson appeared, but he wiped them away as if they meant nothing. By that time, the injuries were already in the process of healing, torn flesh weaving back together. Oh, yes. He was something far greater than mortal. Not fae, for his ears were perfectly rounded. Not vampire, for he didn\u2019t possess fangs. A male siren, then? His voice was rich enough, delicious enough, yes, but perhaps too harsh.</p><p>\u201cGrab a stone,\u201d he called, never taking his focus from her.</p><p>Instantly the warriors spun on their booted heels. Gwen purposely kept her gaze on Sabin, afraid that looking at the others would cause her fear to spike. You\u2019re in control, doing good. She couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014falter. Already she carried too many regrets.</p> <p>Why couldn\u2019t she be like her sisters? Why couldn\u2019t she be brave and strong and embrace what she was? If necessary, they would have cut off a limb to escape\u2014and they would have done it long before now. They would have pounded a fist through the glass, then Chris\u2019s chest, and eaten his heart in front of him, laughing all the while.</p><p>She experienced a pang of homesickness. If Tyson, her former boyfriend, had told them of her abduction\u2014which he probably hadn\u2019t, scared as he was of her sisters\u2014then they were looking for her and they wouldn\u2019t give up until they found her. Despite her weaknesses, they loved her, wanted the best for her. But they would be so disappointed in her when they learned of her captivity. She\u2019d failed herself, as well as her race. Even as a child she had run from conflict, which was how she\u2019d earned the degrading moniker \u201cGwendolyn the Timid.\u201d</p><p>Her palms were damp, she realized, and she rubbed them on her thighs.</p><p>Sabin directed the men, telling them which stone belonged in which hole. He got a few of the placements wrong but she wasn\u2019t worried. They\u2019d figure it out. He was correct about hers, though, and when one man, a blue-haired, pierced punk, tried to pick up the appropriate stone, Sabin\u2019s strong, tanned fingers banded around his wrist, stopping him.</p><p>The blue-haired one locked eyes with Sabin, who shook his head. \u201cMine,\u201d he said.</p><p>The punk grinned. \u201cHating what we see, are we?\u201d</p><p>Sabin just frowned at him.</p><p>Gwen blinked in confusion. Sabin hated looking at her?</p> <p>One by one the women were freed, some crying, some attempting to hurry out of the chamber. The males didn\u2019t let them get far, catching them and surprising Gwen by cradling them gently, even when the women fought violently. In fact, the most beautiful man in the group, he of the multicolored hair, approached the women one by one, softly muttering, \u201cSleep for me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Shockingly, they obeyed, sagging in the warriors\u2019 protective arms.</p><p>Sabin crouched and palmed Gwen\u2019s stone, the one that showed the man burning alive. When he straightened, he tossed it in the air, caught it easily. \u201cDon\u2019t run. All right? I\u2019m tired and I don\u2019t want to chase you, but I will if you make me. And I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll accidentally hurt you.\u201d</p><p>You and me both, she thought.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...free her,\u201d Chris suddenly sputtered. How long had he been awake? He lifted his head and spit out a mouthful of dirt. Bruises had already formed under his eyes. \u201cDangerous. Deadly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameo,\u201d was all Sabin said.</p><p>The female warrior knew what he wanted and stalked to the human, grabbed him by the back of his shirt and easily lifted him to his feet. With her free hand, she placed a dagger at his carotid. Either too weak or too frightened, he didn\u2019t struggle.</p><p>Gwen hoped it was fear that held him still. Hoped it with every fiber of her being. She even stared at the tip of the knife, willing it inside the bastard\u2019s throat, piercing skin and bone and causing unforgettable agony.</p><p>Yes, she thought, entranced. Yes, yes, yes. Do it. Please, do it. Cut him, make him suffer.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do with him?\u201d Cameo asked Sabin.</p><p>\u201cKeep him there. Alive.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment caused Gwen\u2019s shoulders to sag. But with the disappointment came a startling realization. Her emotions were under control, yet she was very close to releasing her inner beast anyway. All those thoughts of pain and suffering were not her own. They couldn\u2019t be. Dangerous, Chris had said. Deadly. He\u2019d been right. You have to stay in control.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to hurt him a bit, though,\u201d Sabin added, his eyes narrowing on Gwen. Was he...angry? At her? But why? What had she done?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t set the girl free,\u201d Chris repeated. A tremor rocked his entire body. He backed away, but Cameo, obviously stronger than she appeared, jerked him back into place. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should leave the redhead in her cell,\u201d the tiny warrior woman said. \u201cFor now, at least. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>Sabin raised the stone, stopping just short of inserting it into the hole beside Gwen\u2019s cage. \u201cHe\u2019s a Hunter. A liar. And I think he hurt her, but doesn\u2019t want her able to tell us.\u201d</p><p>Gwen blinked over at him in shock and awe. He wasn\u2019t angry at her, but at Chris\u2014a hunter?\u2014for what he might have done. He truly meant what he\u2019d said. He wouldn\u2019t harm her. Wanted her free. Safe.</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Sabin asked her. \u201cHe hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Cheeks heating in mortification, she nodded. Emotionally, he\u2019d destroyed her.</p><p>Sabin ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cHe\u2019ll pay for that. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>Slowly the embarrassment faded. Her mother, who had disinherited her almost two years ago, would rather see her dead than weakened, but this man\u2014this stranger\u2014thought to avenge her.</p><p>Chris swallowed nervously. \u201cListen to me. Please. I know I\u2019m your enemy, and I won\u2019t lie and pretend you\u2019re not mine. You are. I hate you with every fiber of my being. But if you let her go, she\u2019ll kill us all. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you try and kill us, little red?\u201d Sabin asked her, even more gently than before.</p><p>Used to being called \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cwhore\u201d by the men here, Gwen felt the sweet endearment drift through her mind with the potency of a rose-scented summer breeze. In their few minutes together, this man had managed to gift her with the very thing she\u2019d dreamed about since being locked up: a white knight, determined to slay her dragons. Sure, she\u2019d once thought that white knight would be Tyson or even the father she\u2019d never known, but still. It wasn\u2019t every day a dream came true.</p><p>\u201cRed?\u201d</p><p>Gwen snapped to attention. What had he asked? Oh, yeah. If she would try and kill him and his friends. She licked her lips and shook her head. If her beast overtook her, she wouldn\u2019t just try. She would succeed. I have control. For the most part. They\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d With a flick of his wrist, Sabin drove the stone home. Her heart thundered in her chest, nearly cracking her ribs. Gradually the glass lifted...lifted...soon...soon...And then there was nothing between her and Sabin but air. The scent of lemon and mint strengthened. The coldness she\u2019d grown used to gave way to a blanket of heat that seemed to wrap around her.</p><p>She smiled slowly. Free. She was truly free.</p><p>Sabin sucked in a breath. \u201cMy gods. You\u2019re incredible.\u201d</p><p>She found herself stepping toward him, reaching out, desperate for the contact she\u2019d been denied all these months. A single touch, that\u2019s all she needed. And then she would leave, go home. Finally.</p><p>Home.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Chris shouted, struggling against Cameo\u2019s hold. \u201cStay away from me. Keep her away from me. She\u2019s a monster!\u201d</p><p>Her feet halted of their own accord, and her gaze swung to the wretched human responsible for all the distress, all the anguish, she\u2019d endured for the past year. Not to mention what he\u2019d done to her cell mates. Her nails elongated to razor points. Tiny, seemingly gossamer wings sprang from her back, ripping at the cotton, fluttering frantically. Her blood thinned in her veins, rushing through every part of her, fast, so fast, and her vision tunneled to infrared, colors fading as body heat became her only focus.</p><p>In that instant, she realized she\u2019d never had any sort of control over her beast. Her darker side. It had swirled inside her all along, mostly quiet as it waited for the opportunity to strike...</p><p>Only Chris, only Chris, please gods only Chris. The chant rang through her mind, hopefully penetrating the bloodlust of her vengeful beast. Only Chris, leave everyone else alone, attack only Chris.</p><p>But deep down, she knew there would be no stopping the death toll now.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>FROM THE FIRST MOMENT Sabin had seen the lovely redhead in the glass cell, he\u2019d been unable to remove his gaze from her. Unable to breathe, to think. Her hair was long and curled wantonly, blond streaked with thick locks of ruby. Her eyebrows were a darker auburn, but just as exquisite. Her nose was buttoned at the end, her cheeks rounded like a cherub\u2019s. But her eyes...they were a sensual feast, amber with striations of sparkling gray. Hypnotic. Black lashes spiked around them, a decadent frame. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Halogens hung from hooks in the walls and drowned her in bright light. While that would have revealed another\u2019s flaws and did in fact expose the dirt streaking her skin, it gave her a healthy glow. She was petite, with small, round breasts, narrow hips and legs long enough to wrap around his waist and hold on through the most turbulent of rides.Don\u2019t think like that. You know better. Yeah, he did. His last lover, Darla, had killed herself and he\u2019d vowed not to get involved again. But his attraction to the redhead had been instant. So had his demon\u2019s, though Doubt wanted her for another reason. It had sensed her trepidation and had purposely targeted her, wanting inside her mind, pouncing on her deepest fears and exploiting them.</p><p>But she was not human, they\u2019d both soon realized, and therefore Doubt had been unable to hear her thoughts unless she voiced them. That didn\u2019t mean she was safe from its evils. Oh, no. Doubt knew how to size up a situation and spread its poison accordingly. More than that, the demon relished a challenge and would work harder to learn this girl\u2019s nuances and ruin any faith she might have.</p><p>What was she? He\u2019d encountered many immortals over his thousands of years yet he couldn\u2019t place her. She certainly appeared human. Delicate, fragile. Breakable. Those amber-silver eyes gave her away, though. And the claws. He could imagine those digging into his back....</p> <p>Why had the Hunters taken her? He feared the answer. Three of the six newly liberated females were clearly pregnant, which brought to mind only one thing: the breeding of Hunters. Immortal Hunters, at that, for he recognized two sirens with scars along the column of their necks where their voice boxes had obviously been removed, a pale-skinned vampire whose fangs were gone, a gorgon whose reptilian hair had been shaved and a daughter of Cupid who had been blinded. To prevent her from ensnaring an enemy in her love spell, Sabin supposed.</p><p>How cruel the Hunters had been to these lovely creatures. What had they done to the redhead, the loveliest of them all? Though she wore a tiny tank and skirt, he could see no scars or bruises to indicate mistreatment. That didn\u2019t mean anything, though. Most immortals healed quickly.</p><p>I want her. Intense fatigue radiated from her, yet when she\u2019d smiled at him in thanks for freeing her...he could have died from the sheer glory of her face.</p><p>I want her, too, Doubt piped up.</p><p>You can\u2019t have her. Which meant he couldn\u2019t either. Remember Darla? As strong and confident as she was, you still managed to break her down.</p> <p>Gleeful laughter. I know. Wasn\u2019t it fun?</p><p>His hands fisted at his sides. Fucking demon. Eventually everyone caved under the intense worries his other, darker half constantly threw at them: You aren\u2019t pretty enough. You aren\u2019t smart enough. How could anyone love you?</p><p>\u201cSabin,\u201d Aeron\u2019s cold voice called. \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and motioned the girl over with a wave of his fingers. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>But his redhead had backed herself against the far wall, her body trembling in renewed fear. He\u2019d expected her to beat feet, despite his warning of the consequences. He hadn\u2019t expected this...terror.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWe mean you no harm.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth opened, but no sound emerged. And as he watched, the golden glow of her eyes deepened, darkened, black bleeding into the whites.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is\u2014\u201d</p><p>One minute she was before him, the next she wasn\u2019t, gone as if she\u2019d never been. He spun, gaze scanning. Didn\u2019t see her. But the only Hunter still standing suddenly belted out an agonized scream\u2014a scream that halted abruptly as his body sagged, collapsing on the sandy floor, blood pooling around him.</p><p>\u201cThe girl,\u201d Sabin said, palming a blade, determined to protect her from whatever force had just slain the Hunter he\u2019d planned to interrogate. Still he did not see her. If she could disappear with only a thought like Lucien, she would be safe. Out of his reach forevermore, but safe. But could she? Had she?</p><p>\u201cBehind you,\u201d Cameo said, and for once she sounded more shocked than miserable.</p><p>\u201cMy gods,\u201d Paris breathed. \u201cI never saw her move, yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t...did she...how could she have...\u201d Maddox scrubbed a hand down his face, as though he didn\u2019t believe what he was seeing.</p><p>Again, Sabin spun. And there she was, back inside her cell, sitting, knees drawn to her chest, mouth dripping with blood, a...trachea?...clutched in one of her hands. She\u2019d ripped\u2014or bitten?\u2014the man\u2019s throat out.</p> <p>Her eyes were a normal color again, gold with gray striations, but they were completely devoid of emotion and so faraway he suspected the shock of what she\u2019d done had numbed her mind. Her expression was blank, too. Her skin was now so pallid he could see the blue veins underneath. And she was shaking, rocking back and forth and mumbling incoherently under her breath. What. The. Hell?</p><p>The Hunter had called her a monster. Sabin hadn\u2019t believed it. Then.</p><p>Sabin stepped inside the cell, unsure of what to do but knowing he could neither leave her like this nor lock her back up. One, she hadn\u2019t attacked his friends. Two, swift as she was, she could escape before the window closed and do serious damage to him for breaking his word.</p><p>\u201cSabin, man,\u201d Gideon said, grim. \u201cYou might not want to rethink going in there. For once, a Hunter was lying.\u201d</p><p>For once. Try once more. \u201cKnow what we\u2019re dealing with here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes. \u201cShe\u2019s not a Harpy, the spawn of Lucifer who did not spend a year unfettered on earth. I haven\u2019t dealt with them before and I don\u2019t know that they can kill an army of immortals in mere seconds.\u201d</p><p>As Gideon couldn\u2019t tell a single truth without soon wishing he were dead, his entire body wrapped in agony and riddled with suffering, Sabin knew everything he said was a lie. Therefore, the warrior had encountered a Harpy before\u2014and he clearly didn\u2019t mean the word in a derogatory sense\u2014and those Harpies were the spawn of Lucifer and could destroy even a brute like himself in a blink.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Gideon understood his meaning. \u201cRemember when I wasn\u2019t imprisoned?\u201d</p><p>Ah. Gideon had once endured three months of torture at Hunter hands.</p><p>\u201cOne didn\u2019t destroy half the camp before a single alarm could be sounded. She didn\u2019t take off, for whatever reason, and the remaining Hunters didn\u2019t spend the next few days cursing the entire race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on. Harpy? I don\u2019t think so. She isn\u2019t hideous.\u201d That little nugget came from Strider, the king of stating the obvious. \u201cHow can she be a Harpy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know as well as we do that human myths are sometimes distorted. Just because most legends claim Harpies are hideous doesn\u2019t mean they are. Now, everyone out.\u201d Sabin began tossing his weapons on the ground behind him. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with her.\u201d</p><p>A sea of protests arose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He hoped.</p><p>You might not be...</p><p>Oh, shut the hell up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing with us,\u201d he said, cutting Maddox off. He couldn\u2019t leave her behind; she was too valuable a weapon, a weapon that could be used against him\u2014or used by him. Yes, he thought, eyes widening. Yes. \u201cAnd she\u2019s coming alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a Harpy anywhere near Ashlyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw what she did\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now Maddox cut him off. \u201cYes, I did, and that\u2019s exactly why I don\u2019t want her near my pregnant human. The Harpy stays behind.\u201d</p><p>Another reason to eschew love. It softened even the most hardened of warriors. \u201cShe has to hate these men as much as we do. She can help our cause.\u201d</p><p>Maddox was undeterred. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be my responsibility, and I\u2019ll make sure she keeps her claws and teeth sheathed.\u201d Again, he hoped.</p><p>\u201cYou want her, she\u2019s yours,\u201d Strider said, always on his side. Good man. \u201cMaddox will agree because you never pressure Ashlyn to go into town and listen to conversations Hunters might have had, no matter how badly you want to.\u201d</p><p>Eyes narrowed, Maddox popped his jaw. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to subdue her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll handle her.\u201d Sabin didn\u2019t like the thought of anyone else touching her. In any way. He told himself it was because she\u2019d most likely been tortured, used in the most horrendous way, and might react negatively to anyone who tried, but...</p><p>He recognized the excuse for what it was. He was attracted to her, and a man attracted couldn\u2019t turn off the possessive thing. Even when that man had sworn off women.</p><p>Cameo approached his side, attention riveted on the girl. \u201cLet Paris deal with her. He can finesse the cruelest of females into a good mood. You, not so much, and we clearly need this one in a perpetual good mood.\u201d</p><p>Paris, who could seduce any woman, anytime, immortal and human alike? Paris, who needed sex to survive? Sabin\u2019s teeth ground together, an image of the couple flashing through his mind. Naked bodies tangled, the warrior\u2019s fingers gripping the Harpy\u2019s wild fall of hair, bliss coloring her expression.</p><p>Would be better for the girl that way. Would probably be better for them all, as Cameo had said. The Harpy would be more inclined to help them defeat the Hunters if she was fighting by her lover\u2019s side\u2014and Sabin was now determined to have her help. Of course, Paris couldn\u2019t bed her more than once, would eventually cheat on her because he needed sex from different vessels to survive, and that would probably piss her off. She might then decide to aid the Hunters.</p><p>Bad idea, all the way around, he decided, and not just because he wanted it to be.</p><p>\u201cJust...give me five minutes. If she kills me, Paris can have a turn with her.\u201d His dry tone failed to elicit a single chortle of laughter.</p><p>\u201cAt least let Paris put her to sleep as he did the others,\u201d Cameo persisted.</p><p>Sabin shook his head. \u201cIf she were to wake early, she would be scared and she might attack. I\u2019ve got to get through to her first. Now get out. Let me work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A pause. A shuffling of feet, heavier than usual as the warriors were carrying the other women out. And then he was alone with the redhead. Or strawberry blond, he supposed the color was called. She was still crouched, still mumbling, still holding that damn trachea.</p><p>Such a bad little girl, aren\u2019t you? the demon said, tossing the words straight into the Harpy\u2019s mind. And you know what happens to bad little girls, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Leave her alone. Please, he begged the demon. She cut through our enemy, preventing them from searching for\u2014and finding\u2014the box.</p> <p>At the word box, Doubt cried out. The demon had spent a thousand years inside the darkness and chaos of Pandora\u2019s box and did not want to return. Would do anything to prevent such a fate.</p><p>Sabin could no longer exist without Doubt. It was a permanent part of him and much as he sometimes resented it, he would rather give up a lung than the demon. The first he could regenerate.</p><p>Just a few minutes of quiet, he added. Please.</p><p>Oh, very well.</p><p>Satisfied with that, Sabin stepped the rest of the way inside the cell. He bent down, placing himself at eye level with the girl.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she chanted, as though she sensed his presence. She didn\u2019t face him, though, just continued to stare ahead, unseeing. \u201cDid I kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Poor thing didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d done or what she was saying. \u201cYou did a good thing, destroyed a very bad man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad. Yes, I\u2019m very very bad.\u201d Her arms tightened around her knees.</p><p>\u201cNo, he was bad.\u201d Slowly, he reached out. \u201cLet me help you. All right?\u201d His fingers lightly pried at hers, opening them up. The bloody remain fell from her grasp, and he caught it with his free hand, tossing it over his shoulder, away from her. \u201cNow, isn\u2019t that better?\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, his action didn\u2019t send her into another rage. She merely released a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>Still moving at an unhurried pace, he brushed a strand of hair from her face and hooked it behind her ear. She leaned into his touch, even nuzzled her cheek against his palm. He allowed the caress to linger, savoring the softness of her skin when deep down he recognized the thin ledge of danger he walked. To encourage his attraction, to crave more of her, was to condemn her to utter misery as he\u2019d done Darla. But he didn\u2019t pull away, even when she gripped his wrist and guided his hand through the silkiness of her hair, clearly wanting to be petted. He massaged her scalp. She practically purred.</p><p>Sabin couldn\u2019t recall a time he\u2019d been so...tender with a woman, not even with Darla. Much as he\u2019d cared for her, he\u2019d placed more importance on victory than on her well-being. But at that moment, something about this girl drew him. She was just so lost and alone, feelings he knew well. He wanted to hug her.</p><p>See? You\u2019re already craving more. Frowning, he forced his arm to fall to his side.</p><p>A slight cry of despair escaped her, and maintaining what little distance there was between them became even harder. How could this needy creature have so savagely slain the human? Didn\u2019t seem possible, and he wouldn\u2019t have believed it had the story simply been relayed to him. He\u2019d had to see it. Not that there had been much to see, given how quickly she\u2019d moved.</p><p>Perhaps, like him, like his friends, she was captive to a dark force inside her. Perhaps she was helpless to stop it from treating her body as a puppet. The moment those thoughts struck him, he knew he\u2019d guessed correctly. The way her eyes had changed color...the horror she\u2019d exuded when she had realized what she\u2019d done...</p><p>When Maddox slid into one of his demon\u2019s violent rages, the same changes overtook him. She couldn\u2019t help what she was and probably hated herself for it, the little darling.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, red?\u201d</p> <p>Her lips edged into a frown, a mimic of his. \u201cName?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Name. What you\u2019re called.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat I\u2019m called.\u201d The shallow rasp in her voice was fading, leaving a dawning awareness. \u201cWhat I\u2019m\u2014oh. Gwendolyn. Gwen. Yes, that\u2019s my name.\u201d</p><p>Gwendolyn. Gwen. \u201cA lovely name for a lovely girl.\u201d</p><p>Traces of color were returning to her face, and she blinked again, this time dragging her attention to him. She offered him a hesitant smile, one that spoke of welcome, relief and hope. \u201cYou\u2019re Sabin.\u201d</p><p>Exactly how sensitive were her ears? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me. Even when I...\u201d There was wonder in her voice, wonder tinged with regret.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d He wanted to add, Nor will I, but he wasn\u2019t sure that was true. In his single-minded quest to defeat the Hunters, he\u2019d lost a good man, a great friend. He\u2019d healed from countless near-fatal injuries and had buried several slain lovers. If necessary, he would sacrifice this little bird to the cause as well, whether he desired her or not.</p><p>Unless you soften, Doubt suddenly piped up.</p><p>I won\u2019t. It was a vow, because he refused to believe otherwise. And it was a reinforcement of what he\u2019d already known: he wasn\u2019t an honorable man. He would use her.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s gaze skittered past him, and her smile vanished. \u201cWhere are your men? They were right here. I didn\u2019t...I...did I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t hurt them. They\u2019re just outside the chamber, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders sagged as a sigh of relief escaped her. \u201cThank you.\u201d She seemed to be speaking to herself. \u201cI\u2014oh, heavens.\u201d</p><p>She had just spotted the Hunter she\u2019d slain, he realized.</p><p>She paled again. \u201cHe\u2014he\u2019s missing\u2014all that blood...how could I...\u201d</p><p>Sabin purposely leaned to the side, blocking her view and consuming her entire line of vision. \u201cAre you thirsty? Hungry?\u201d</p><p>Those unusual eyes swung to him, now lit with wild interest. \u201cYou have food? Real food?\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in his body tightened at the sight of that interest. There was an almost euphoric edge to it. She could be toying with him, pretending to be excited by what he offered in order to relax his guard for an easier escape. Must you be like your demon and doubt everyone and everything?</p><p>\u201cI have energy bars,\u201d he said. \u201cNot sure they can be classified as food, but they\u2019ll keep you strong.\u201d Not that she needed any more strength.</p><p>Her lashes drifted closed, and she sighed dreamily. \u201cEnergy bars sound divine. I haven\u2019t eaten in over a year, but I\u2019ve imagined it. Over and over again. Chocolate and cakes, ice cream and peanut butter.\u201d</p><p>A whole year without a crumb? \u201cThey gave you nothing?\u201d</p><p>Those dark lashes lifted. She didn\u2019t nod or reply in the affirmative, but then, she didn\u2019t have to. The truth was there in her now-grim expression.</p><p>As soon as he finished interrogating the Hunters, every single one he\u2019d found in these catacombs was going to die. By his hand. He\u2019d take his time with the kills, too, enjoy every slash, every drop of blood spilled. This girl was a Harpy, spawn of Lucifer as Gideon had said, but even she did not deserve the gnawing torture of starvation. \u201cHow did you survive? I know you\u2019re immortal, but even immortals need sustenance to remain strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey put something in the ventilation system, a special chemical to keep us alive and docile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t fully work on you, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her little pink tongue slashed over her lips hungrily. \u201cYou mentioned energy bars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to leave this chamber to get them. Can you do that?\u201d Or rather, would she do it? He doubted he could force her to do anything she didn\u2019t want to without ending up cut and broken, maybe dead. He wondered how the Hunters had trapped her. How they had gotten her here and lived to tell the tale.</p><p>A slight hesitation. Then, \u201cYes. I can.\u201d</p><p>Once again moving slowly, Sabin clutched her arm and helped her to her feet. She swayed. No, he realized, she snuggled up next to him, seeking closer contact with his body. He stiffened, poised to pull away\u2014keep her at a distance, have to keep her at a distance\u2014when she sighed, her breath trekking through the slashes in his shirt and onto his chest.</p><p>Now his eyes closed in ecstasy. He even wound an arm around her waist, urging her closer. Utterly trusting, she rested her head in the hollow of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about this, too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo warm. So strong.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the sudden lump in his throat, felt Doubt prowling the corridors of his mind, rattling the bars, desperate to escape, to obliterate Gwen\u2019s ease with him.</p><p>Too much faith, the demon said, as if that were some sort of disease.</p><p>The perfect amount, if Sabin were being honest with himself. He liked that a woman was looking at him as if he were a prince of light rather than a king of darkness, someone she needed to run screaming from. He liked that she\u2019d allowed him to soothe her torment.</p><p>Foolish of her, though, he had to admit. Sabin was no one\u2019s hero. He was their worst enemy.</p><p>Let me talk to her! the demon demanded, a child denied a favorite treat.</p><p>Quiet. Causing Gwen to doubt him could very well rouse the feral Harpy, placing his men in danger. That, Sabin would not allow. They were too important to him, too necessary.</p><p>Distance, as he\u2019d realized before, was needed. He dropped his arms and stepped away. \u201cNo touching.\u201d The words were a croak, harsher than he\u2019d intended and she blanched. \u201cNow come. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>THE WOMAN WAS GOING TO KILL HIM, and not because she was stronger and more vicious than he was. Which, if he thought about it, she was. He\u2019d never ripped a man\u2019s throat out with his teeth, and he was damned impressed that Gwen had. She\u2019d made the Lords of the Underworld look like marshmallows.</p><p>Two full days had passed since Sabin and his crew had rescued her from the pyramid. The only time she\u2019d seemed content was at her first glimpse of the sun. Since then, she had not relaxed. Or eaten. The energy bars she\u2019d so wanted, she had merely gazed at with utter longing before shaking her head and turning away. She hadn\u2019t even showered in the portable stall he\u2019d had Lucien fetch her.She didn\u2019t trust them, didn\u2019t want to risk poisoning or the vulnerability of unconsciousness or nakedness, and that was understandable. But damn it, he was seething with the need to force her to do those things. For her own good. Without the shit that had been pumped into her cell, she had to be feeling every bit of her starvation. She had to be exhausted and dirty as she was\u2014from the past two days, as well as her confinement, which was strange because the other women had been clean\u2014she couldn\u2019t possibly be comfortable. Forcing her, however, was not an option. He liked his trachea where it was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Only thing she\u2019d taken from him was clothing. His clothing. A camouflage tee and military fatigues. They bagged on her, even though she\u2019d rolled the arms, waist and legs, but there wasn\u2019t a female who\u2019d ever looked better. With that wild fall of strawberry curls...those take-me-to-bed lips...she was utter perfection. And knowing the material she wore had once touched his body...</p><p>I need to end my self-imposed celibacy. Soon.</p><p>The moment he returned to Buda, that\u2019s what he\u2019d do. Find a willing woman who wanted only a good time and, well, show her a good time. No one would get hurt because he wouldn\u2019t be sticking around. But maybe then his head would clear and he\u2019d figure out how to deal with Gwen.</p> <p>Something else that bothered him was the way Gwen had planted herself in the corner and watched him no matter who entered his tent. Him. As if he were the biggest threat to her now. He\u2019d snapped at her that day in the cavern, yeah, telling her not to touch him, but he\u2019d also ensured that she remained on her feet on the trek through the desert to set up camp. He\u2019d stayed with her, guarded her while the other warriors went back to the pyramid to search for anything they might have missed the first go-round. Did he really deserve the death glares?</p><p>Maybe...</p><p>Shut up, Doubt! I don\u2019t need your opinions.</p><p>Don\u2019t know why you care what she thinks. You\u2019ve never been good for women, now have you? Funny that I now need to remind you about Darla.</p><p>Crouched on the sandy floor, Sabin closed the lid of his weapon case with a forceful snap, locked it and turned to the bag of food he\u2019d had Paris bring him.</p> <p>Darla, Darla, Darla, the demon sang.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, you can shut the hell up, you dirty piece of shit. I\u2019ve had all of you I can take.\u201d</p><p>Gwen, still in the far corner, jerked as though he\u2019d screamed. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d lived among mortals for a long time and had trained himself to converse with Doubt inside his head. That he\u2019d forgotten his training now, in the presence of this skittish yet deadly woman...mortifying.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t speaking to you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Paler than usual, she drew her arms around her middle. \u201cThen to whom were you speaking? We\u2019re alone.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer. Couldn\u2019t. Not without lying. Since Doubt\u2019s inability to lie had long ago spread to Sabin, he had to stick to the truth, evade, or he\u2019d be sleeping for the next few days.</p><p>Thankfully, Gwen didn\u2019t press the issue. \u201cI want to go home,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Yesterday, Paris had questioned all the freed women about their confinement. They\u2019d indeed been kidnapped, raped, impregnated and told their babies would be taken from them and trained to be defenders against evil. Afterward, Lucien had flashed all but Gwen\u2014who had told Paris nothing\u2014to their families, who would hopefully hide them from Hunters in the peace and comfort that had been denied them during their captivity.</p><p>Gwen had asked to be taken to a deserted stretch of ice in Alaska, of all places. Lucien had reached out to take her hand, despite her failure to cooperate, and Sabin had stepped between them.</p><p>\u201cLike I said in the cavern, she stays with me,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>Gwen had gasped. \u201cNo! I want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Not gonna happen.\u201d He\u2019d refused to face her, afraid he\u2019d cave and release her despite the fact that her strength, speed and savagery could win him this war, thereby saving his friends.</p> <p>By gods, he\u2019d dreamed of an end, a victorious end, for too many years to count; he couldn\u2019t put Gwen\u2019s needs and wants before that victory.</p><p>Too badly did he want Galen, the person he hated most in this world, defeated and imprisoned.</p><p>Galen, the once forgotten Lord, was the very man who had convinced the warriors to help steal and open Pandora\u2019s box. He was also the man who had secretly planned to kill them all, then capture the demons they\u2019d freed, becoming a hero in the eyes of the gods. But things hadn\u2019t worked out as the bastard hoped, and he\u2019d been cursed to house a demon\u2014Hope\u2014right alongside the other warriors.</p><p>If only that had been the end of things. But as further punishment, they\u2019d all been kicked out of the heavens. Galen, still determined to destroy the men who\u2019d called him friend, had quickly assembled an army of outraged mortals, the Hunters, and this endless blood feud had erupted. A feud that only intensified with every year that passed. If Gwen could aid Sabin in even the smallest way, she was too valuable to release. She, however, thought differently.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she had begged. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you home one day, but not now,\u201d he\u2019d told her. \u201cYou could be useful to us, to our cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to help with any cause. I just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Like I said, it\u2019s not gonna happen any time soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she\u2019d muttered. Then she\u2019d frozen, as if she hadn\u2019t meant to say that aloud and now thought he would launch forward and beat her. When he didn\u2019t, she\u2019d calmed a bit. \u201cSo I\u2019ve traded one captor for another, is that it? You promised you wouldn\u2019t harm me.\u201d Soft, so soft. Even sadly resigned, and that had...hurt him. \u201cJust let me go. Please.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, the girl was afraid. Of him, his friends. Of herself and her deadly abilities. Otherwise, she would have tried to ditch him or bargained for her release. But not once had she done so. Did she fear what they would do to her if they caught her? Or what she would do to them?</p><p>Or, as Doubt liked to whisper in the dark of night, did she have more sinister plans? Was she Bait, a very convincing trap laid by the Hunters? A trap meant to ruin him?</p><p>Not possible, he retorted every time. Such timidity couldn\u2019t be faked. The trembling, the refusal even to eat. Which meant her fears, whatever they were, were real. And the more time she spent with him, the more those fears and doubts would grow. They would become all that she knew, all that she thought about. She would question every word out of her mouth, every word out of his mouth. She would question every action.</p><p>Sabin sighed. Others here were already questioning his actions, and not because of his demon. At her plea, Lucien\u2019s expression had hardened\u2014a rare thing, for Lucien was always careful to contain his emotions. After ordering Paris to guard her, he\u2019d whisked Sabin to the home they\u2019d rented in Cairo, where they could talk away from the others. Away from Gwen.</p><p>A ten-minute argument had ensued. And because flashing always sickened him, causing his stomach to churn, he hadn\u2019t been at his best.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Lucien had begun.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, so are we. Only difference is, she\u2019s better at it than we are.\u201d</p><p>Lucien frowned. \u201cHow do you know? You\u2019ve only seen her kill one man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you would ban her from our home for that very killing\u2014despite the fact that it was our enemy she killed. Look, Hunters know our faces. They\u2019re always on the lookout for us. But the only ones who knew her are now dead or locked up. She\u2019s our Trojan horse. Our own version of Bait. They\u2019ll welcome her and she\u2019ll slaughter them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr us,\u201d Lucien had muttered, but Sabin could tell he was considering the point. \u201cShe just seems so...fainthearted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround you, that will only get worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, I know,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cThen how can you think to use her as a soldier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve weighed the pros and cons. Fainthearted or not, spirit broken down by me or not, she has an innate ability to destroy. We can harness that for our own benefit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSabin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming with us, and that\u2019s that. She\u2019s mine.\u201d He hadn\u2019t wanted to claim her, not that way. He didn\u2019t need another responsibility. Especially a beautiful, apprehensive female he could never hope to possess. But it had been the only way. Lucien, Maddox and Reyes had brought females into their home, therefore they could not deny entrance to his.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have done that to her, should have just let her go for both their sakes. But as he\u2019d reminded himself already, he\u2019d placed his war with the Hunters above everything else, even his best friend, Baden, keeper of Distrust. Now dead, gone forever. He could make no exceptions for Gwen. She was coming to Budapest, like it or not.</p><p>First, though, he was going to feed her.</p><p>Crouching a few feet in front of her, putting them at eye level, Sabin began unwrapping Twinkies and unsealing Lunchables. He poked a straw in a juice box. Gods, he missed the home-cooked meals Ashlyn prepared and the gourmet cuisine Anya \u201cborrowed\u201d from Buda\u2019s five-star restaurants.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been inside an airplane?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cWh-what do you care?\u201d She lifted her chin, yellow fire snapping in her eyes. But that hot gaze wasn\u2019t on him. It was on the food he was spreading on the paper plate beside him.</p><p>A show of spirit. He liked it. Definitely preferred it over the stoic acceptance she\u2019d displayed earlier. \u201cI don\u2019t. I simply want to ensure you\u2019re not going to\u2014\u201d Shit. How could he phrase this without reminding her of what she\u2019d done to the Hunter?</p><p>\u201cAttack you out of fear,\u201d she finished for him, cheeks heating with embarrassment. \u201cUnlike you, I don\u2019t lie. You take me on a plane that isn\u2019t headed to Alaska and there\u2019s a very good chance you\u2019ll meet my...darker half.\u201d The last words were choked.</p><p>His eyes slitted dangerously, his mind caught on the beginning of her speech. He wadded up the plastic wrappers scattered around him and shoved them into the cloth trash bag. \u201cWhat do you mean, unlike me? I\u2019ve never lied to you.\u201d That he was still conscious proved it.</p><p>\u201cYou said you meant me no harm.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in his jaw. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeeping me here is harming me. You said you\u2019d free me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did free you. From the pyramid.\u201d He shrugged, sheepish. \u201cAnd as long as you\u2019re uninjured physically, I consider you unharmed.\u201d A sigh slipped from him. \u201cIs it really so bad, being around me?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed into a thin line.</p> <p>Ouch. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re gonna have to get used to me. The two of us will be spending a lot of time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? You said I could be useful; I haven\u2019t forgotten that. What I don\u2019t understand is what you think I can do.\u201d</p><p>Why not tell her everything? he thought. It could soften her toward him and his cause. Or it could frighten her even more and finally send her running. Would he be able to stop her?</p><p>Not knowing what he wanted of her had to be torture, though, and she\u2019d suffered enough. \u201cI\u2019ll supply you with any piece of information you want,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2014I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Sabin lifted the plate, circled it around. She followed every movement as though entranced. Sure that he had her attention, he lifted one of the Twinkies and bit into half.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she said again, though she sounded exactly as she looked: entranced.</p><p>He swallowed before licking away any remaining cream. \u201cSee. Still alive. No poison.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, as though she simply couldn\u2019t help herself any longer, Gwen reached out. Sabin placed the dessert in her hand, and she immediately snatched it to her chest. Several minutes ticked by in silence, and she did nothing but eye him warily.</p><p>\u201cSo this food is payment for listening to you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He would not allow her to think bribery was acceptable. \u201cI just want you healthy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, clearly disappointed.</p><p>Why disappointment?</p><p>Doubt nearly danced with the urge to crawl out of Sabin\u2019s head and into Gwen\u2019s. Much longer, and he\u2019d lose his hold. One wrong suggestion from the demon, however, and Sabin knew she would throw the tiny morsel to the ground.</p><p>Eat it, he projected. Please eat it. It wasn\u2019t the most nutritious of snacks, but at this point he would have been happy if she\u2019d eaten a pile of sand.</p><p>Finally, she lifted the golden cake and tentatively nibbled on the edge. Those long, dark lashes closed, and a tiny smile appeared. Absolute ecstasy radiated from her\u2014the kind that usually arrived on the heels of an orgasm.</p><p>His body reacted instantly, every muscle hardening. His heartbeat picked up speed; his palms itched to touch. My gods, she\u2019s lovely. Quite possibly the most exquisite thing he\u2019d ever beheld, all carnal pleasure and blissful decadence.</p><p>The rest of the cake was inside her mouth a second later, her cheeks puffing with its mass. As she chewed, she reached out, silently commanding him to give her another. He did so without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cShall I take half?\u201d he asked before letting go.</p> <p>Black began to swirl in her eyes, obliterating gold.</p><p>Maybe not. He raised his hands, palms out, and she stuffed the second cake into her mouth. The black faded, the gold returning. Crumbs fell from the corner of her lips.</p><p>\u201cThirsty?\u201d He held up the juice box.</p><p>Again she reached out, fingers waving him to hurry.</p><p>Within seconds, every drop of juice was gone.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, or you\u2019ll make yourself sick.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, the black returned to her irises. At least it didn\u2019t bleed into the whites as it had moments before she\u2019d slain the Hunter. Sabin pushed the plate to her, and she polished off the rest of the food.</p><p>When she finished, she settled back into the tent, that contented smile making another appearance. Rich pink painted her cheeks. And before his eyes, her body filled out. Her breasts overflowed. Her waist and hips flared perfectly, sinfully. His cock, still hard and aching, twitched in response.</p><p>Stop. Now. His erection would probably terrify her, so he remained in the crouch, his knees together, his chest hunched.</p><p>What if she liked it? What if she asked you to close the distance and kiss her? Touch her?</p><p>Zip it.</p><p>But then Gwen began to pale. Her smile fell, becoming a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Without a word, she jerked up the bottom tent flap, leaned outside and retched, heaving, every drop and crumb leaving her. Sighing, he pushed to his feet and gathered a rag. After soaking it with the contents of a water bottle, he shoved it into her fingers. She eased the rest of the way into the tent and wiped her mouth with a trembling hand.</p><p>\u201cKnew better,\u201d she mumbled, returning to her former position. Arms locked around her legs, holding them to her chest.</p><p>Knew better than to eat too quickly? Well, yeah. \u2019Cause he\u2019d warned her.</p><p>Sabin cleared his throat and decided to feed her again once her stomach had settled. For now, they could finish their conversation. After all, she\u2019d lived up to her side of the bargain. She had eaten.</p><p>\u201cYou asked what I needed you to do. Well, I need your help finding and killing the men responsible for your...treatment.\u201d Tread carefully. Don\u2019t rouse her dark side with painful memories. But there was no way around it. \u201cThe others, they told us what had been done. The fertility drugs, the rapes. How there were other women once locked in those cages. Women who were raped as well, their babies taken away from them. A few seemed to think this has been going on for years already.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s back was pressed against the sand-colored tent flaps, yet she tried to scoot backward, as though she needed to escape from his words and the images they evoked.</p><p>Sabin himself had cringed, hearing the stories. He might be half demon, but he had never done anything as terrible as what had been done to the women in that cavern.</p><p>\u201cThose men are vile,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d One of her arms fell from her legs, and she drew little circles in the dirt beside her hip. \u201cBut I...wasn\u2019t.\u201d The words were so softly spoken, he had to strain to hear them.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t, what? Raped?\u201d</p><p>Nibbling on her bottom lip\u2014a nervous habit of hers?\u2014she shook her head. \u201cHe was too afraid to open my cage, so he left me alone. Physically, at least. He...took the others in front of me.\u201d There was guilt in her tone.</p><p>Ah. She felt responsible.</p><p>Sabin felt only relief. The thought of this fae-like creature being held down, her legs pried apart while she cried and begged for mercy, mercy that would never have been given...He anchored his hands on his thighs, his nails elongating into claws and cutting past fatigues.</p><p>When he returned to Budapest, the Hunters in his dungeon would suffer untold agonies, he thought for the thousandth time. He\u2019d tortured men before, considered it a necessary part of war, but this time he would truly enjoy it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he keep you, then, if he was afraid of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he hadn\u2019t given up hope that the right drugs would make me biddable.\u201d</p><p>Blood beaded where claw met skin. She\u2019d lived in terror, he was sure, of that very thing happening. \u201cYou can avenge yourself, Gwen. You can avenge the other women. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lifted, the sand she played with clearly forgotten, and then those amber orbs were probing all the way to his soul. \u201cSo can you. Avenge us, I mean. Obviously those men did something to you. You came here to fight them, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they did something to me and mine, and yes, I came here to fight them. That doesn\u2019t mean I can destroy them on my own.\u201d Otherwise, he would have done so by now.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey murdered my best friend. And they hope to murder everyone else I hold dear, all because they believe the lies of their leader. I\u2019ve been trying to obliterate them for centuries,\u201d he admitted. The fact that the Hunters continued to thrive was like a dagger in his side. \u201cBut I kill one, and five more take his place.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t blink at the word centuries, he realized she knew he, too, was immortal. But did she know what he was?</p><p>No way she\u2019s guessed. Like most every other woman in your life, she would despise what you are. How could she not? And look at her now. So sweet, so gentle. No evidence of hatred. Yet. The last emerged in a singsong.</p><p>Doubt. His constant companion. His cross to bear.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you aren\u2019t one of them?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHow do I know this isn\u2019t simply another way to try and gain my cooperation? I\u2019ll help you fight your enemy and you\u2019ll rape me. I\u2019ll get pregnant, and you\u2019ll steal the child from me.\u201d</p><p>Doubts. Courtesy of his demon?</p><p>Before he could think up a reply, she added tightly, \u201cI watched you fight those men. You hurt them, claim to hate them, but you didn\u2019t kill them. You let them live. That isn\u2019t the action of a warrior who wants to annihilate his enemy.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, an idea sprouted. A way to prove himself. \u201cAnd if we\u2019d killed them, you would have been convinced of our hate for them?\u201d</p><p>More nibbling on that lush bottom lip. Her teeth were white and straight and a little sharper than a human\u2019s. Kissing her would probably draw blood, but part of him suspected every drop would be worth it. \u201cI\u2014maybe.\u201d</p><p>Maybe was better than nothing. \u201cLucien,\u201d he called without removing his attention from her.</p><p>Her eyes widened, and again she tried to scoot back. \u201cWhat are you doing? Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucien stalked through the front flaps, glancing between them expectantly. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me a prisoner from Buda. I don\u2019t care which.\u201d</p><p>Lucien\u2019s brow furrowed in curiosity, but he didn\u2019t reply. He simply disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you, Sabin,\u201d Gwen said, sounding agonized. Imploring him to understand. \u201cI really can\u2019t. There\u2019s no reason to do whatever it is you\u2019re about to do. I shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you the way I did. All right? I admit it. I shouldn\u2019t have insulted you with my doubts. But I seriously can\u2019t fight anyone. I freeze up when I\u2019m scared. And then I black out. When I wake up, everyone around me is dead.\u201d She gulped, squeezed her eyes shut for several seconds. \u201cOnce I start killing, I can\u2019t stop. That\u2019s not the kind of soldier you can rely on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill me,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how I pulled myself back. That\u2019s never happened before. I wouldn\u2019t know how to do it a-gain.\u201d She paled.</p><p>Lucien had reappeared, a struggling Hunter at his side.</p> <p>Reaching behind his back, Sabin withdrew a dagger and stood.</p><p>When Gwen saw the glinting silver, she gasped. \u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas this man one of your tormentors?\u201d Sabin asked the now trembling female.</p><p>Silent, her gaze moved from one man to another in dread. She clearly knew what was coming, but this wasn\u2019t the heat of battle. It would be straight-up murder.</p><p>The Hunter kicked and punched at Lucien. That failed to gain him his freedom, so he began sobbing. \u201cLet me go, let me go, let me go. Please. I only did what I was told. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt the women. It was all for the greater good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut it,\u201d Sabin said. This time he\u2019d be the one to show no mercy. \u201cYou didn\u2019t save them either, now did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop trying to kill you. I swear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwendolyn.\u201d Sabin\u2019s voice was hard, uncompromising, a roar compared to the Hunter\u2019s pleading. \u201cAn answer. Please. Was this man one of your tormentors?\u201d</p><p>She gave a single nod.</p><p>Without word or warning, he cut the Hunter\u2019s throat.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>SABIN HAD MURDERED a man in front of her.</p><p>Several hours had since passed and they\u2019d even switched locations, but the bloody image of that human falling to his knees, then to his face, gurgling then silent, so silent, refused to leave her mind.Gwen had known that kind of fierceness churned inside of Sabin\u2014the same kind of fierceness that had driven her to murder. She\u2019d known he was hard and harsh and untouched by softer emotion. His eyes gave him away. Dark and cold, utterly calculating. The moment he\u2019d led her out of her cell those two days ago, she\u2019d begun to notice the way he surveyed the scene around him and decided who and what he could use to his advantage. Everything else was debris.</p><p>She must have been debris. Then. Now he wanted her help.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t forget that he\u2019d pushed her away at their first meeting. Oh, that had embarrassed her. One simple brush of his callused fingertips and she\u2019d glued herself to the side of a man who wanted nothing to do with her. But he\u2019d been so warm, his skin buzzing with energy, and she\u2019d been without contact for so long that she hadn\u2019t been able to help herself.</p><p>No touching, he\u2019d said, and he\u2019d looked capable of slaying her if she dared reach out again.</p><p>His cruel treatment had reminded her that her rescuers were strangers to her, that their intentions could be every bit as nefarious as her captors\u2019. So she\u2019d kept her distance, using the past two days to study them and eavesdrop on their most private conversations. Her mental ear blocks were back in place, noise levels at a bearable pitch, allowing her to listen to men who didn\u2019t want to be listened to without grimacing and giving herself away.</p><p>One of those conversations, which had taken place this very morning, constantly replayed through her mind.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been here nearly a month with no sign of an artifact. How many pyramids do we have to search before we find it? I thought we\u2019d hit the jackpot with that last pyramid, since Hunters were there, but...\u201d</p> <p>Again, the men had referenced a hunter. It\u2019s what they\u2019d called Chris. Why?</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. All that work, and we\u2019re no closer to finding the box.\u201d</p><p>Artifact? Box?</p><p>\u201cShould we pack up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well. Until our Eye gives us another clue, we\u2019re directionless.\u201d</p><p>Strange phrasing. Their eye could offer clues? To what? And whose eye were they referring to? Maybe the one called Lucien; she\u2019d noticed he had one blue eye and one brown.</p><p>\u201cHopefully Galen hasn\u2019t found anything, either. Well, other than a pike through the heart. That, I\u2019d like to help him find.\u201d</p><p>Who was Galen? Did it matter? These warriors were...odd. Half of them spoke as though they\u2019d stepped straight from the pages of Medieval Times magazine. The other half could have been members of a street gang. They loved each other, though, that much was clear. They were solicitous of each other\u2019s needs, either joking and laughing together or fiercely guarding each other\u2019s backs.</p><p>Three men and the female warrior, Cameo, had sneaked inside Sabin\u2019s tent while Sabin was off speaking with Lucien. Each of them had delivered the same message to her: Hurt the warrior and suffer. They hadn\u2019t waited for her reply, but had stomped out. The woman\u2019s voice...Gwen shuddered. She had suffered just listening to it.</p><p>As much time as she\u2019d spent alone in the tent, she could have escaped. Probably should have tried. But mile after mile of desert, glaring sun and who knew what else surrounded her, and fear had held her in place.</p><p>Even though she\u2019d grown up in the ice-mountains of Alaska, she could have dealt with the sand and the sun. She hoped. It was the unknown that intimidated her. What if she stumbled upon a vicious tribe? Or a pack of hungry animals? Or another group of treacherous men?</p><p>Besides, striking out on her own to follow her then-boyfriend Tyson to another state had been the catalyst to her ending up the unwilling guest of that glass cage. Still. Had the warriors hurt her, she would have risked it. Again, she hoped. But they hadn\u2019t touched her, not in any way. And she was happy about that. Really. The fact that Sabin had kept his word\u2014no touching\u2014was like a gift from the heavens. Really.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d The warrior named Strider plopped down in the plush leather seat beside hers. They were inside a private jet, high in the sky, and there was quite a bit of turbulence.</p><p>Surprisingly, that didn\u2019t faze her.</p><p>Gwen suppressed a bitter laugh. A shadow could send her into hiding, but rattle-your-bones, fall from the sky instability made her yawn. Maybe because she herself could fly\u2014kind of\u2014though she hadn\u2019t attempted the skill in forever. Maybe because as much as she\u2019d been through this past year, crashing seemed like child\u2019s play.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pale,\u201d he added when she remained silent. He whipped a pack of Red Hots from his pocket, downed a mouthful, then offered some to her. She smelled cinnamon, and her mouth watered. \u201cYou need to eat.\u201d</p><p>At least she didn\u2019t cower from him. Still. What was with these men and their need to shove junk food in her face? \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019m fine.\u201d She hadn\u2019t yet recovered from the Twinkies.</p><p>Oh, she didn\u2019t regret eating them. The sugary taste...the fullness of her stomach...it had been heaven. For those few precious seconds, anyway. But she\u2019d known better than to eat food freely given to her. Cursed by the gods, like all Harpies, she could only eat food that she had stolen or earned. It was penance for crimes her ancestors had committed and completely unfair, but there was nothing she could do about it.</p><p>Well, she could starve.</p><p>She was too afraid of the consequences to steal from these men, as well as too afraid of what they\u2019d make her do to earn a few precious morsels.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked, then tossed a few more of the candies in his mouth. \u201cThese are small, but they pack a hell of a punch.\u201d Of all the men, he\u2019d been the most gentle with her. The most concerned with her care. Those bright blue eyes never regarded her with disdain. Or fury, as was sometimes the case with Sabin.</p><p>Sabin. Always her mind returned to him.</p><p>Her gaze sought him. He reclined in the lounge across from her, his eyes closed, spiked lashes casting shadows over the hollows of his sharp cheeks. He wore fatigues, a silver chain necklace and a leather man-bracelet. (She was pretty confident he\u2019d want the \u201cman\u201d distinction.) His features were relaxed in slumber. How could someone look at once harsh and boyish?</p><p>It was a mystery she wanted to solve. Maybe when she did, she\u2019d stop seeking him out. Five minutes couldn\u2019t pass without her wondering where he was, what he was doing. This morning, he\u2019d been packing his things, preparing for this trip, and she\u2019d imagined her nails digging into his back, her teeth sinking into his neck. Not to hurt him, but to pleasure her!</p><p>She\u2019d had a few lovers over the years, but those kinds of thoughts had never plagued her before. She was a gentle creature, damn it, even in bed. It was him, his I-don\u2019t-care-about-anything-but-winning-my-war attitude that was causing this...darkness inside her. Had to be.</p><p>She should have been disgusted by what he\u2019d done, slicing the human\u2019s neck as he had. At the very least, she should have screamed for him to stop, protested, but part of her, that darker side, the monster she couldn\u2019t escape, had known what was about to happen and had been glad. She\u2019d wanted the human to die. Even now, there was a spark of gratitude inside her chest. For Sabin. For the wonderfully cruel way he\u2019d dispensed justice.</p><p>That was the only reason she\u2019d willingly stepped onto this plane. A plane headed not for Alaska but Budapest. That, and the respectful distance the warriors had maintained from her. Oh, and the Twinkies. Not that she could give in to their sweet temptation again.</p><p>Maybe she should, though. Maybe she should strap on her big girl panties and steal one, risking punishment. Her skills were rusty, but now that she was out of the cell, her hunger pangs were strong, her body growing weaker. Too, if the warriors hurt her that would finally spur her into action. Going home.</p><p>She\u2019d have to decide quickly, though. Pretty soon, she wouldn\u2019t have the strength or clarity to appropriate a fallen crumb, much less an entire meal, and she definitely wouldn\u2019t have the strength to leave. What made it worse was that she wasn\u2019t simply battling hunger, she was also battling lethargy.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t cursed to stay awake forever or anything like that, but sleeping in front of others was against the Harpies\u2019 code of conduct. And with good reason! Sleeping left you vulnerable, open to attack. Or, say, abduction. Her sisters didn\u2019t live by many rules, but they never deviated from that one. She wouldn\u2019t either. Not again. Already she\u2019d embarrassed them enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But without food and without sleep, her health would continue to decline. Soon the Harpy would take over, determined to force her into wellness.</p><p>The Harpy. While they were one and the same, she considered them separate entities. The Harpy liked to kill; she didn\u2019t. The Harpy preferred the dark; she preferred the light. The Harpy enjoyed chaos; she enjoyed tranquility. Can\u2019t let her out.</p><p>Gwen gazed around the plane, searching for those Twinkies. Her eyes, however, stopped on Amun. He was the darkest of the warriors, and someone she\u2019d never heard speak a word. He hunched in the seat farthest from her, his hands over his temples, moaning as though in great pain. Paris, the one with the brown and black hair\u2014the seductive one, as she\u2019d come to think of him, with his azure eyes and pale skin\u2014was beside him, staring pensively out the window.</p> <p>Across from them was Aeron, the one covered from head to foot in tattoos. He, too, was silent, stoic. The three of them could have been spokesmen for misery. And I thought I had it bad. What was wrong with them? she wondered. And did they know where the Twinkies were?</p><p>\u201cGwendolyn?\u201d</p><p>Strider\u2019s voice pulled her from her thoughts with a jolt. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Had he asked her something?</p> <p>The plane hit another bump. A lock of sandy hair fell over Strider\u2019s forehead, and he brushed it aside. Another cinnamon-scented breeze followed the motion. Her stomach grumbled. \u201cI know you won\u2019t eat,\u201d he said, \u201cbut are you thirsty? Would you like something to drink?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Please, yes. Her mouth watered even more, but she said, \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least accept a bottle of water. It\u2019s capped, so you don\u2019t have to worry that we\u2019ve done something to it.\u201d He produced a glistening, ice-cold bottle from the cup holder beside him and waved it in front of her face. Had it been there the entire time?</p><p>Inside, she wept. Looked so good...\u201cMaybe later.\u201d The words were croaked.</p><p>He shrugged as if he didn\u2019t care, but there was disappointment in his eyes. \u201cYour loss.\u201d</p><p>Surely there was something nearby that she could steal. Once again, she searched the plane. Her gaze snagged on the half-drunk cherry-flavored water beside Sabin. She licked her lips. No, it will be Sabin\u2019s loss. Soon as Strider left her, she\u2019d go for it, damn the consequences.</p> <p>Maybe. No, she would. But he was here now, and she might as well get some answers out of him. She could also use the time to build her courage. \u201cWhy are we flying?\u201d she asked. \u201cI saw the one called Lucien disappear with the other women. We could have reached Budapest in seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of us don\u2019t handle flashing all that well.\u201d His eyes darted pointedly to Sabin.</p><p>\u201cSo some of you are babies?\u201d The words were out before she could stop them. It was something she would have said to her sisters, the only people in the world she could be herself around without fear of recrimination. Bianka, Taliyah and Kaia understood her, loved her and would do anything to protect her.</p><p>Rather than offend Strider, however, her words amused him. He barked out a laugh. \u201cSomething like that, though Sabin, Reyes and Paris prefer to think they catch a virus whenever they\u2019re flashed somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Twins Bianka and Kaia were the same way. They\u2019d rather believe they were stricken by infirmity than cop to a limitation. Taliyah, cold as ice and twice as hard, simply didn\u2019t react to anything.</p><p>Slowly Strider\u2019s merriment faded and he studied Gwen intently from head to toe. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re different than I expected.\u201d</p><p>Hold your ground. Don\u2019t squirm. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...wait, will what I say offend you?\u201d</p> <p>And cause her to erupt, was what he was really asking. Seemed he was as afraid of her dark side as she was. \u201cNo.\u201d Maybe.</p><p>His intense stare probed all the deeper as he weighed the legitimacy of her claim. He must have seen the determination in her features because he nodded. \u201cI think I\u2019ve said this before, but from what little I know, Harpies are hideous creatures with misshapen faces, sharp beaks and the lower half of a bird. They\u2019re spiteful and pitiless. You...you\u2019re none of those things.\u201d</p><p>Had he so easily forgotten what she\u2019d done to Chris?</p><p>She glanced over at Sabin, who hadn\u2019t budged. His breathing was deep, even, his lemon and mint scent wafting to her. Hadn\u2019t he reminded Strider that not all legends were completely true? \u201cWe have a bad rap, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s more than that.\u201d</p><p>For her, yeah. Not that she could tell him. Her sisters\u2014lucky as they were\u2014had shape-shifter fathers. Taliyah\u2019s was a snake, the twins\u2019 a phoenix. Hers, on the other hand, was an angel\u2014a fact she was forbidden to talk about. Ever. Angels were too pure, too good for her kind to respect, and Gwen had enough weaknesses. As always, the thought of her father had her flattening a palm over her heart.</p><p>While Harpies were mainly a matriarchal society, fathers were allowed to see their children if they so wished. Both of her sisters\u2019 fathers had chosen to be part of their daughters\u2019 lives. Gwen\u2019s hadn\u2019t gotten the chance. Her mother had forbidden it. She\u2019d merely given Gwen a portrait of him to warn Gwen of what she would become\u2014too morally superior even to steal her own food, unable to lie, concerned about others rather than herself\u2014if she wasn\u2019t careful. And after Tabitha had washed her hands of Gwen, labeling her a lost cause, Gwen\u2019s father still hadn\u2019t tried to make contact. Did he even know she existed? A tide of longing swept through her.</p><p>All her life she\u2019d had dreams of her father fighting any and everything to reach her, to whisk her into his arms and fly her away. Dreams of his love and devotion. Dreams of living in the heavens with him, protected forevermore from the world\u2019s evil and her own dark side.</p><p>She sighed. Only one name was to be mentioned when speaking of her lineage and that was Lucifer. He was strong, wily, vengeful, violent\u2014in short, a poor enemy to have. People were less likely to mess with her, with any of them, if they thought the prince of darkness would be gunning for them.</p><p>And, to be honest, claiming him as family wasn\u2019t technically a lie. Lucifer was her great-grandfather. Her mother\u2019s grandfather. Gwen had never met him, for his year on earth had ended long before her birth, and she hoped they never crossed paths. Even the thought made her shudder.</p><p>Carefully considering her next words, she breathed deeply, taking in Strider\u2019s aroma of wood smoke and all that delicious cinnamon. Sadly, even that lacked the decadence of Sabin\u2019s scent. \u201cHumans place a negative connotation on everything they cannot understand,\u201d she said. \u201cIn their minds, good always conquers evil, so anything stronger than they are is evil. And evil is, of course, ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true.\u201d</p><p>There was a wealth of understanding in his tone. Now was as good a time as any to determine just what he understood, she supposed. \u201cI know you are immortal, like me,\u201d she began, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t figured out exactly what you are.\u201d</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably, glancing at his friends for support. Everyone listening quickly looked away. Strider sighed, an echo of the one she\u2019d released earlier. \u201cWe were once soldiers for the gods.\u201d</p><p>Once, but no longer. \u201cBut what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d he asked, cutting her off.</p><p>Gwen wanted to protest the abrupt change of topic. Instead, coward that she was, she weighed the pros and cons of admitting the truth, asking herself the three questions every Harpy mother taught her daughters: Was it information that could be used against her? Would keeping it secret award her some type of advantage? Would a lie serve just as well, if not better?</p><p>No harm, she decided. No advantage, either, but she didn\u2019t mind. \u201cTwenty-seven.\u201d</p><p>His brow puckered, and he blinked over at her. \u201cTwenty-seven hundred years, right?\u201d</p><p>If he were speaking to Taliyah, yes. \u201cNo. Just twenty-seven plain, ordinary years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean human years, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean dog years,\u201d she said dryly, then pressed her lips together. Where was the filter that was usually poised over her mouth? Strider didn\u2019t seem to mind, though. Rather, he seemed stupefied. Would Sabin have had the same reaction were he awake? \u201cWhat\u2019s so hard to believe about my age?\u201d As the question echoed between them, a thought occurred to her and she blanched. \u201cDo I look ancient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Of course not. But you\u2019re immortal. Powerful.\u201d</p><p>And powerful immortals couldn\u2019t be young? Wait. He thought she was powerful? Pleasure bloomed inside her chest. In the past, that word had only been used to describe her sisters. \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m still only twenty-seven.\u201d</p><p>He reached out\u2014to do what, Gwen didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t care\u2014and she shrank back in her seat. While she\u2019d craved Sabin\u2019s touch from the beginning\u2014why, why, why?\u2014and had even pictured herself doing those very wicked things to him this morning, the thought of anyone else putting their hands on her held no appeal.</p><p>Strider\u2019s arm dropped back to his side.</p><p>She relaxed, her eyes once again seeking Sabin. He was now red-faced, his jaw clenched. Bad dreams? Did all the men he\u2019d killed clamor inside his head, tormenting him? Perhaps it was a blessing Gwen wasn\u2019t allowing herself to sleep. She had experienced those types of nightmares herself and hated every second of them.</p><p>\u201cAre all Harpies as young as you?\u201d Strider asked, reclaiming her attention.</p><p>Was this information that could be used against her? Would keeping it secret award her some type of advantage? Would a lie serve just as well, if not better? \u201cNo,\u201d she answered truthfully. \u201cMy three sisters are quite a bit older. Prettier and stronger, too.\u201d She loved them too much to be jealous. Much. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have been captured. No one can make them do anything they don\u2019t want. Nothing scares them.\u201d</p><p>Okay, she needed to shut up now. The more she spoke, the more her own failures and limitations were brought to light. It\u2019d be better if these men assumed she had some cojones. But why can I not be like my sisters? Why do I run from danger when they race to it? If one of them had been attracted to Sabin, they would have viewed his distance as a challenge and seduced him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wait. Stop. That was craziness. She wasn\u2019t attracted to Sabin. He was handsome, yes, and she\u2019d even imagined herself making love to him. But that stemmed from a sense of gratitude. He\u2019d set her free and slain one of her enemy. And yeah, she was also baffled by him. He was all that was violent and hard, yet he hadn\u2019t once hurt her. But admit to an attraction to the immortal warrior? Never.</p><p>When Gwen started dating again, she would pick a kind, considerate human who didn\u2019t rouse her darker side in any way. A kind, considerate human who preferred board meetings over swordplay. A kind, considerate human who made her feel cherished and accepted, despite her faults. Someone who made her feel normal.</p><p>That\u2019s all she\u2019d ever wanted.</p> <p>SABIN\u2019S ATTENTION WAS zeroed on Gwen. Had been since they\u2019d boarded the plane. Okay, fine. Since the moment he\u2019d met her. He\u2019d thought she refused to relax because he intimidated her, so he\u2019d pretended to sleep. He must have been right because she\u2019d let down her guard and opened up. To Strider.</p><p>A fact that irritated the hell out of him.He didn\u2019t dare \u201cwake up,\u201d though. Not even when he\u2019d heard Strider try to touch her, and Sabin had wanted to drive his fist into his friend\u2019s nose, smashing cartilage into brain tissue. Their conversation fascinated him.</p><p>The girl\u2014and that\u2019s what she was, a girl, only twenty-seven fucking years old, which made him feel like Father fucking Time\u2014considered herself a failure in every possible way, and her sisters paragons. Prettier? Not likely. Stronger? He shuddered. They wouldn\u2019t have been captured? Anyone could be taken unaware. Himself included. Nothing scared them? Everyone had a deep, dark fear. Again, even Sabin. He feared failure as much as Gideon feared spiders.</p><p>Timid as Gwen was and as shocked as she\u2019d been that day in the cavern, he\u2019d known she had doubts about her own strength and her feral abilities, but he\u2019d had no idea how deep they actually ran. The way she compared herself to her sisters proved she had doubts on top of doubts. Girl was riddled with them. And being around him would only make them worse.</p><p>All of his past lovers had been confident, self-reliant women. (Aged thirty-five and up, damn it.) He\u2019d chosen them for that very reason, their confidence. But they\u2019d quickly changed, his demon sinking sharp claws of uncertainty through them and cutting deep. A few, like Darla, had even committed suicide, unable to bear the constant scrutiny of their appearance, their wit, the people around them. After Darla, he\u2019d given up on females and relationships once and for all.</p> <p>Then he\u2019d seen Gwen. He desired\u2014oh, did he desire. He could maybe allow himself one night with her and be able to justify it in some way, he thought. But he doubted one night would be enough. Not with her. There were too many ways to take her, too many things he wanted to do to that curvy little body.</p><p>Her lush beauty fired his blood every time he glanced at her, made his mouth water and his body ache. Her insecurity roused his protective instincts as much as his demon\u2019s destructive urges. Her sunshine scent, buried underneath the grime she\u2019d yet to wash off, continually wafted to him, summoning him closer...closer still...</p><p>To give in was to destroy her. Don\u2019t forget.</p><p>Perhaps I\u2019ll be good. Perhaps I\u2019ll leave her alone.</p><p>At the sweet cajoling, Sabin bit his tongue, drawing blood. The demon wanted him to doubt its malicious intent. I fell for that once. I won\u2019t again.</p><p>\u201cYou do that a lot,\u201d Strider said now to Gwendolyn, pulling Sabin from his musings.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her voice was breathless, raspy. At first, Sabin had thought her fatigue responsible for such a timbre. But no, that hoarseness was all her. And pure sex.</p><p>\u201cWatch Sabin. Are you interested in him?\u201d</p><p>She gasped, obviously outraged. \u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>Sabin tried not to scowl. A little hesitation would have been nice.</p><p>Strider chuckled. \u201cI think you are. And guess what? I\u2019ve known him for thousands of years, so I\u2019ve got dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she sputtered.</p><p>\u201cSo. I don\u2019t mind spilling. I mean, I\u2019d be acting as a friend to both of you if I changed your mind about him.\u201d</p><p>Your friend undermines you, Doubt said, perhaps wants her for himself. Trusting him after this might not be wise.</p> <p>Sabin experienced a moment of unease before he shook the feeling off. He warns her away for her own good. For my own good. Just as he claimed. Now shut it.</p><p>\u201cI want nothing to do with him, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t care if I leave you without telling you what I know.\u201d Through his narrowed eyes, Sabin watched Strider push to his feet.</p><p>Gwen grabbed his wrist and jerked him back down. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Sabin had to grip the arms of his seat to stop himself from leaping up and separating them.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said, and released the warrior of her own accord.</p><p>Slowly Strider eased back into his chair. He was grinning. Even as limited as Sabin\u2019s line of sight was, he could see the bright gleam of Strider\u2019s teeth. He suddenly wanted to grin himself. Gwen was curious about him.</p><p>Probably wants to learn the best way to kill you.</p><p>Shut up, damn it!</p><p>\u201cAnything particular you\u2019d like to know?\u201d Strider asked her.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he so...distant?\u201d She was still looking over at him, her gaze burning him, probing deep. \u201cI mean, is he like that with everyone or am I just a lucky girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not you. He\u2019s like that with all females. He has to be. See, his demon is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemon?\u201d Gwen gasped out. Her back jerked ramrod-straight, and her face leeched of color. \u201cDid you just say demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh...did I say that?\u201d Strider once again glanced around the plane helplessly. \u201cNo, no. I think I said seaman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you said demons. Demons. Demons and Hunters and that butterfly tattoo. I should have guessed the moment I saw that tattoo, but you seemed so nice. I mean, you didn\u2019t hurt me, and thousands of people have butterfly tattoos.\u201d She, too, gazed around the plane, studying the warriors through new, wild eyes. On her feet a second later, she jumped away from Strider and backpedaled toward the bathroom. She extended her arms, as though the puny action could keep everyone at bay. \u201cI\u2014I get it now. You\u2019re the Lords, aren\u2019t you? Immortal warriors the gods banished to earth. M-my sisters told me bedtime stories about your evils and conquests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Strider said. \u201cCalm down. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed Pandora. An innocent woman. You burned ancient Greece to the ground, filling the streets with blood and screams. You tortured men, removed their limbs while they still lived.\u201d</p><p>Strider\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cThose men deserved it. They killed our friend. Tried to kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she screams, wonderful things are going to happen,\u201d Gideon said, grim, easing to Strider\u2019s side. \u201cDon\u2019t try and knock her out, and I won\u2019t help, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Before we do any manhandling and maybe lose our throats, let\u2019s try something else. Paris!\u201d Strider barked, his gaze never leaving Gwen. \u201cYou\u2019re needed.\u201d</p><p>A determined Paris approached just as Sabin gave up the pretense of sleeping and popped to his feet. \u201cGwen,\u201d he said, hoping to cajole her to calm before Paris could work his wiles. But she was having trouble catching her breath, hysteria curtaining her features. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons...all around me.\u201d She opened her mouth and screamed. And screamed and screamed and screamed.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>DEMONS. LORDS OF THE UNDERWORLD. Once beloved soldiers of the gods, now reviled plagues of earth. Each man carried a demon inside his body, a demon so vile that even hell had been unable to contain it. Demons like Disease, Death, Misery, Pain and Violence. And I\u2019m trapped inside a small aircraft with them, Gwen thought, her hysteria reaching new heights.</p><p>The plane, on the other hand, was shuddering and tilting, losing altitude at an alarming rate. That didn\u2019t stop the Lords. They were closing in around her, encircling her, pinning her. Her heart drummed heavily in her chest, causing blood to surge through her veins and roar in her ears. If only that roar dulled the wild screech of the Harpy...No such luck. There was a tumultuous symphony inside her head, clanging, tolling, wiping away her sanity, tossing her down...down...into a black void where only death and destruction reigned.Brutal and powerful as these warriors were, she should have suspected they were possessed by demons. The red eyes the first time she\u2019d seen Sabin...the jagged butterfly tattoo on his ribs...</p><p>I\u2019m so stupid.</p><p>Though Gwen had been watching these men the past few days, she must have been too tired, too hungry, too relieved by her liberation to notice the tattoos on the others, wherever they were. That, or she\u2019d been too caught up in Sabin\u2019s appeal. Actually, now that she thought about it, the warriors had always been fully dressed in her presence, as if they\u2019d sympathized with what she\u2019d been through and hadn\u2019t wanted to frighten her by showing too much skin. But now she knew the truth. They\u2019d simply been hiding their marks.</p><p>What demon possessed Sabin? she wondered. What demon had she observed, fascinated by every word and action? What demon had she imagined herself kissing and touching, clawing and writhing against?</p><p>How could her sisters adore these princes of evil? Well, the idea of them, anyway. To her knowledge, they\u2019d never met. Who would have survived if they had? They were men without mercy or remorse, capable of any dark deed, and they were engaged in a never-ending war that stretched from past to present, sea to sea, death to death.</p><p>Each time she\u2019d been told about them, her fear of predators skulking in the night and fiends hiding in the sunlight had multiplied. That was when she\u2019d begun to fear the predator inside herself, for that was why she\u2019d been told those stories. So that she might emulate the warriors. Even as Gwen had recoiled at the thought, the Harpy had soaked up every word, ready to prove itself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have to escape. Can\u2019t stay here any longer. Nothing good can come of it. Either they\u2019ll kill me next or my Harpy will fight all the harder to be like them. She might have been better off in the hands of their dastardly enemy.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop screaming, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>The harsh, familiar voice penetrated the chaotic mire flooding her mind, but still the shrieks persisted.</p> <p>\u201cShut her up, Sabin. My fucking ears are bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot helping, asshole. Gwendolyn, you have to calm down or you\u2019ll hurt us. Do you want to hurt us, darling? Do you want to kill us after we saved you, sheltered you? We might harbor demons, but we aren\u2019t evil. I think we\u2019ve proven that to you. Did we not treat you and the others better than your captors? Have I touched you in anger? Forced myself on you? No.\u201d</p><p>What he said was true. But could she trust a demon? They loved to lie. So do Harpies, a voice of reason piped up. Part of her did want to trust them; the other part of her wanted to jump from the plane. The still shuddering, still plummeting plane.</p><p>Okay, time to think logically. She\u2019d been with them for two days. She was alive and well, with not even a scratch. If she continued to panic, the Harpy would break free from her hold, controlling her, hungry to wreak havoc. She\u2019d most likely take out the pilot\u2014perhaps even herself\u2014in the inevitable crash. How foolish would she be, having survived captivity and the Lords only to end up offing herself?</p><p>Logic achieved.</p> <p>As calm nudged its way into her mind, her high-pitched screams faded. Everyone stood frozen. In, out she breathed\u2014or tried to, her throat felt swollen, blocked\u2014now hearing the frantic alarm coming from the cockpit. Before she could work up another panic, the plane evened out and then everything quieted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl. Now back off, guys. I\u2019ve got her.\u201d Sabin didn\u2019t sound confident, just determined.</p><p>Light winked into her awareness, and colors quickly followed suit, real life painting itself around her. Holy hell. Her vision had gone infrared, and she hadn\u2019t even known it. The Harpy had been close, so damn close, to breaking free. It was a miracle that she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Gwen was still standing in the back of the plane, a grouping of red leather chairs around her. Only Sabin remained in front of her. The others had moved away, but they hadn\u2019t turned their backs. Afraid to? Or were they protecting their leader?</p><p>Sabin\u2019s chocolate gaze was leveled on her, fiercer than it had been even inside the catacombs, his daggers thrusting at men she now knew were Hunters. He had his hands raised, empty, palms out. \u201cI need you to calm some more.\u201d</p><p>Did he? she thought dryly. Maybe she would if she could draw enough air through her nose or mouth, but she still couldn\u2019t manage it. Dizziness was creeping up on her, black once again sneaking into her line of vision.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I do to help you, Gwen?\u201d There was a shuffle of footsteps as he closed the rest of the distance between them. His heat seeped into her.</p><p>\u201cAir,\u201d she was finally able to force past the knot in her throat.</p><p>Sabin\u2019s hands settled atop her shoulders, gently pushing. Her legs were too weak to offer any type of resistance, so she tumbled down\u2014straight into one of those chairs. \u201cI need air.\u201d</p><p>With no hesitation, Sabin dropped to his knees. He inserted his big body between her legs and cupped her face, forcing her to focus on him. Intense brown eyes became the new center of her world, an anchor in a turbulent storm.</p><p>\u201cTake mine.\u201d His callused thumb caressed her cheek, abrading lightly. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Take his...what? she wondered, and then she didn\u2019t care. Her chest! Constricting, pinching bone and muscle together. A sharp pain tore through her ribs and slammed into her heart, causing the organ to skitter to a momentary halt. Gwen jerked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning blue, darling. I\u2019m going to place my mouth over yours, give you my breath. All right?\u201d</p><p>What if this is a trick? What if\u2014</p> <p>Shut up! Even in her haze, she knew the eerie, ghostly whisper was not her own. Thankfully, it heeded her command and quieted. Now, if only her lungs would open up. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed me. Let me do this.\u201d If he feared her response, he gave no indication. One of his hands trailed to the base of her neck and drew her forward, even as he leaned into her. Their lips pressed together, a heated tangle. His hot tongue pried her teeth apart, and then warm, minty air was sliding down her throat, soothing.</p><p>Her arms wound around him of their own accord, holding him captive, meshing them together chest to chest, hardness to softness. His necklace was cold, even through her shirt, and made her gasp. She greedily took his breath. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate. He blew inside her mouth, and another warm, calming breeze moved through her. Little by little the dizziness faded; her head cleared, darkness once more giving way to light. The frantic dance of her heart slowed to a gentle waltz.</p><p>A need to kiss him, truly kiss him and learn his taste, filled her. His origins, forgotten. His past, of no consequence. Their audience, vanished as if they\u2019d never been present. Only the two of them existed. Only the here and now mattered. He\u2019d calmed her, saved her, gentled her, and now, here in his arms, real life slipping away, the fantasy she\u2019d had of him, of them, played through her mind. Bodies wrapped around each other, straining. Skin slick with sweat. Hands roaming. Mouths seeking.</p><p>She threaded her fingers through the silkiness of his hair and tentatively brushed her tongue against his. Lemon. He tasted of sweet lemons and a hint of cherry. A moan escaped her, reality so much more decadent than she could have dreamed. So heady...so...heavenly. Pure and good and everything a girl could want from a lover. So she tilted her head and did it again, sinking deeper, silently demanding more.</p><p>\u201cSabin,\u201d she breathed, wanting to praise him. Maybe thank him. No one had ever made her feel so protected, cherished, safe, needy, so needy. Not with something as simple as a kiss. A kiss that left no room for fear. Perhaps she could let go, even be herself, and not worry about her dark side...about hurting him. \u201cGive me more.\u201d</p><p>Instead of obeying, he jerked his head away and tugged her arms from him until there was no longer any physical link between them. \u201cTouch me again!\u201d she wanted to shout. Her body needed him, needed contact.</p><p>\u201cSabin,\u201d she repeated, studying him. He was panting, trembling, his face pale\u2014but not from passion. Fire didn\u2019t dance in his eyes, determination did.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t kissed her back, she realized. Her own desire-haze faded, just as the dizziness had done a bit ago, leaving the harsh realities she\u2019d foolishly forgotten. Voices clamored around her.</p><p>\u201c\u2014didn\u2019t see that one coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the kiss, idiot. The calming. Her eyes had turned, and her claws had emerged. She was poised to strike. I mean, hello. Am I the only one who remembers what happened to the Hunter who tangled with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Sabin\u2019s a portal to heaven like Danika,\u201d someone said dryly. \u201cMaybe the Harpy saw a few angels while receiving mouth-to-mouth.\u201d</p><p>Male chuckles abounded.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s cheeks heated. Half of what they\u2019d said escaped her understanding. The other half mortified her. She\u2019d kissed a man, a demon, who clearly wanted nothing to do with her\u2014and she\u2019d done it in front of witnesses.</p><p>\u201cIgnore them,\u201d Sabin said, his voice so guttural it scraped against her eardrums. \u201cFocus on me.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes clashed together, brown against gold. She scooted as far back in her chair as she could, putting as much distance between them as possible.</p><p>\u201cAre you still afraid of me?\u201d he asked, head tilting to the side.</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cNo.\u201d Yes. She was afraid of what he made her feel, afraid that what he was would again cease to matter. Afraid he\u2019d never crave her the way she suddenly craved him. Afraid that the wonderfully protective man in front of her was nothing more than a mirage, that evil waited just below the surface, ready to devour her whole.</p><p>Such a coward you are. How the hell could she have kissed him like that?</p><p>One of his brows arched. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be lying, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never lie, remember?\u201d Ironically, that was a lie.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now listen closely, because I don\u2019t want to have this discussion again. I have a demon inside my body, yes.\u201d He gripped her armrests so tightly his knuckles slowly blanched. \u201cIt\u2019s there because centuries ago I stupidly helped open Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the spirits inside. As punishment, the gods cursed me and all the warriors you see on this plane to carry one inside ourselves. In the beginning, I couldn\u2019t control that demon and did some...bad things, as you said. But that was thousands of years ago, and I now have control. We all do. Like I told you in that cell, you have nothing to fear from us. Got me, red?\u201d</p><p>Red. Earlier, during her panic attack, he\u2019d called her something else. Something like...sweetheart? No. Tyson used to call her sweetheart. Dearest? No. But close. Darling? Yes! Yes, that was it. She blinked in surprise. In delight. This hard warrior who could cut a man\u2019s throat without hesitation had referred to her as precious treasure.</p><p>So why hadn\u2019t he kissed her back?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve reached our destination, guys,\u201d an unfamiliar voice dripping with relief said over the intercom. The pilot, she figured, and experienced a wave of guilt for the trouble she had caused. \u201cPrepare for descent.\u201d</p><p>Sabin remained in place, an indomitable rock between her legs. \u201cDo you believe me, Gwen? Will you still willingly travel to our home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never willing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never tried to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I have braved a strange land by myself, with no provisions?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve seen for myself how skilled you are. And we\u2019ve offered you provisions time and time again. For whatever reason, part of you wants to be with us or you wouldn\u2019t be here. You know it, and I know it.\u201d</p><p>Logic she couldn\u2019t deny. But...why? Why would part of her want to stay? Then or now? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You know the answer to that, though you\u2019ve tried to deny it. Him. Sabin. Not attracted to him? Ha! She studied him, noting the thin lines of strain branching from his eyes, the spiky shadows cast by his lashes, the muscle twitching in his jaw. The erratic pound of his pulse, now so loud in her ears. Maybe he was just as attracted to her, but was fighting it, as she was. The thought pleased her.</p><p>Did he have a woman waiting for him in Budapest? A wife?</p><p>Gwen\u2019s hands fisted, the nails digging deep, cutting. She was no longer pleased. This doesn\u2019t matter. You shouldn\u2019t want him.</p> <p>\u201cGwen. Will you?\u201d</p><p>The way he said her name was a slap and a caress at the same time, jarring her, making her shiver. She liked that he sought her cooperation, though she suspected he would try and force her to his will if she declined. \u201cMaybe I should have run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what? A life of regrets? A life of wishing you had acted against the ones who hurt you? I\u2019m offering you a chance to help me kill Hunters. And just so you know, killing them won\u2019t be the only benefit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you control your beast the way I control mine. I can help you channel it for a good cause. Don\u2019t you want to be in control?\u201d</p> <p>All her life, she\u2019d wanted only three things: to meet her father, earn her family\u2019s respect and learn to control her Harpy. If Sabin could deliver on that promise, she would finally, after all these years, have achieved one of the three. He was probably overreaching and destined to fail, but it was a temptation she couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll help you as best I can.\u201d</p><p>Relief pulsed from him as he closed his eyes and smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>That smile relaxed the stark edges of his face, making him appear boyish once again. As she drank him in, the plane jolted abruptly. Sabin was pushed back; she was propelled forward. To her delight\u2014dismay\u2014the distance between them never widened.</p><p>\u201cOn one condition,\u201d she added when they settled.</p><p>His relief hardened into something cruel. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to invite my sisters.\u201d Maybe not right away. She was embarrassed by her circumstances and didn\u2019t want her sisters to see her like this, to know what had happened to her. But she missed them like crazy, and knew her homesickness would soon outweigh her embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cInvite your sisters? You mean you want me to have to deal with more of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat had better be happiness in your tone, not disgust,\u201d she said, offended. \u201cMy sisters have castrated men for less.\u201d</p><p>Sabin pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cSure. Invite them. Gods save us all.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>PARIS SLOUCHED in the backseat of an Escalade, Strider at the wheel and completely unaware of speed limits. Though the sun was shining on downtown Budapest, you couldn\u2019t tell it from where Paris was sitting. The windows were tinted so thickly the interior was cast in gloomy shadows. Anya, Lucien\u2019s lover and the minor goddess of Anarchy, had stolen the vehicle from gods knew where\u2014along with a matching second and a Bentley for herself\u2014just before they\u2019d left for Egypt.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to thank me, she\u2019d said, smiling beatifically. Your horrified expressions are gift enough. The cars are very upscale gangster, if I do say so myself. And let\u2019s face it. You guys were in serious need of a makeover and these wheels do the job.Unfortunately, Paris had gotten stuck in the same car as Amun, who was gripping his head as if it was about to explode; Aeron, who couldn\u2019t stop glowering\u2014dude needed his little demon friend, Legion, like, stat\u2014as well as Sabin and his Harpy.</p><p>Sabin couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off the dangerous, throat-eating woman, and hadn\u2019t lost his hard-on since kissing her on the plane. Understandable, sure. She was incomparably lovely, with golden eyes almost diamondlike in their purity, lips as red as Eve\u2019s apple had probably been and a body that defined the word temptation. And that strawberry hair was a miracle all its own. But she was a Harpy who\u2019d been found in the enemy\u2019s camp and therefore not to be trusted for any reason.</p> <p>Maybe she\u2019d been abused like the other prisoners. Maybe she despised the Hunters as much as he did. Maybe...</p><p>But maybe wasn\u2019t good enough to earn his trust. Not anymore. She could be Bait, a pretty trap the Hunters had set and the Lords had welcomed with open arms.</p><p>Paris didn\u2019t want Sabin ending up like him: craving an enemy with every fiber of his being but unable to have her.</p><p>A minute, an hour, a month, a year ago\u2014he didn\u2019t know, time no longer mattered to him\u2014he\u2019d been ambushed by Hunters and imprisoned. Because he played host to the demon of Promiscuity, he needed sex to survive. Sex every day, at least once, but never with the same woman. In that cell, strapped to a gurney, he\u2019d grown so weak opening his eyes had become a chore. Not wanting to kill him before they found Pandora\u2019s box\u2014without it, the death of his body would have freed his demon, allowing it to wander the earth, crazed, unfettered\u2014they\u2019d sent her in. Sienna. Plain, freckled Sienna with her elegant hands and untapped sensuality.</p><p>She\u2019d seduced him, strengthening him exponentially. And for the first time since his possession, Paris had gotten hard for the same woman twice. In that moment, he\u2019d known she belonged to him. Known that she was his\u2014his reason for breathing. The reason he\u2019d been spared death all these thousands of years. But her own people had shot her down as Paris absconded with her.</p><p>She\u2019d died in his arms.</p><p>Now Paris was still forced to bed a new woman every day, and if he couldn\u2019t find a woman, he had to find a man, even though he\u2019d never been attracted to his own sex. A fuck was a fuck to the demon of Promiscuity. A fact that had long since plunged him down a spiral of shame.</p><p>Yet nowadays, no matter who his bed partner was, he had to picture Sienna\u2019s face to get hard. He had to picture her face to finish the job, because every cell in his body knew the person underneath him was wrong. Wrong scent, wrong curves, wrong voice, wrong texture. Wrong everything.</p><p>Today would be the same. Tomorrow, as well. And the next day and the next. For an eternity. There was no end in sight for him. Except death, but he didn\u2019t deserve death yet. Not until Sienna was avenged. Would she ever be?</p><p>You didn\u2019t love her. This is madness.</p><p>Wise words. From his demon? Himself? He didn\u2019t know anymore. Could no longer distinguish one voice from the other. They were one and the same, two halves of a whole. And both of them were at the breaking point, ready to snap at any moment.</p><p>Until then...</p><p>Paris patted the bag of dried ambrosia in his pocket and let out a sigh of relief. Still there. He now carried the potent stuff with him wherever he went. Just in case he needed it. Which, more often than not, he did.</p><p>Only when the ambrosia was mixed with human wine did the alcohol do what it was supposed to do and numb him. If only for a little while. Every day, though, it seemed like he had to add more to achieve the same buzz.</p><p>He\u2019d just have to ask his friend to steal more. Gods knew he deserved a few hours of peace, a chance to lose himself. Afterward, he would be refreshed, stronger, ready to fight his enemy.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that now. Soon as he reached the fortress, he had a job to do. That came first; it had to. He forced his eyes to focus on his surroundings, his mind to blank. Gone were the multihued palaces, humans traipsing from one side of the streets to another. In their place were thickly treed hills, abandoned, forgotten.</p><p>The SUV popped a rocky ledge and ascended one of those hills, dodging trees and the little presents he and the others had left for any Hunter stupid enough to come gunning for them. Again, that is.</p><p>About a month ago, they\u2019d stormed inside and blasted the hell out of his home, a home he\u2019d lived in for centuries, forcing the warriors to patch up quickly before heading out on another trip, another battle. New furniture had been needed. New appliances. He didn\u2019t like it. There\u2019d been so much change in his life lately\u2014women in residence, the return of an old frienemy, the eruption of the war\u2014he couldn\u2019t handle much more.</p><p>The fortress came into view, a towering monstrosity of shadow and stone. Ivy climbed the jagged walls, blending home into land and making it nearly impossible to differentiate between the two. The only thing that set them apart was the iron gate that now surrounded the structure. Another addition.</p><p>Eagerness suddenly saturated the cool air. Bodies tensed, mouthfuls of oxygen were held. So close...</p><p>Torin, who watched them from inside the fortress on monitors and sensors, opened that gate. As they meandered toward the tall, arching front doors, Aeron squeezed his armrest so tightly it snapped.</p><p>\u201cA wee bit excited, are you?\u201d Strider asked, glancing at him from the rearview mirror.</p><p>Aeron didn\u2019t reply. There was a good chance he hadn\u2019t even heard the question. His tattooed face registered determination and anger. Not the usual indulgent expression he wore when about to see Legion.</p><p>When the vehicle stopped, the entire group jumped out. Glaring sunlight beat down on his body, making him sweat under his T-shirt and jeans. Gods, was it even this hot in hell?</p><p>Soon as she emerged from the car, the little Harpy stepped to the side, delicate arms around her middle, eyes wide, face pale. Sabin tracked her every movement, not even looking away when he jerked out a bag and another toppled to his feet.</p><p>How could something as vicious as a Harpy be so timid? It just wasn\u2019t possible; it didn\u2019t fit. She was like two pieces of two different puzzles, and now Paris was thinking the girl should have been blindfolded on the way to the fortress.</p><p>Hindsight. They could always cut out her tongue to keep her from talking, he supposed. Maybe cut off her hands to keep her from signing or writing.</p><p>Who are you?</p><p>Before Sienna, he would have been the one fighting to protect the female. That he wasn\u2019t now, that he actually wanted her injured, should have filled him with guilt. Instead, he was angry that he hadn\u2019t done a better job of guarding his friends against her. All possible threats had to be eliminated. Throughout the years, the other warriors had tried to convince him of that but he\u2019d always resisted. Now, he understood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was too late to do anything to her, though. Sabin wouldn\u2019t allow it. Guy was wasted. Even before the rift that tore Lucien\u2019s group from Sabin\u2019s, Paris didn\u2019t recall ever seeing Sabin this intent on a woman. Which wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. If the girl\u2019s timidity wasn\u2019t an act, then Sabin would destroy her, one bit of her self-esteem at a time.</p><p>Maddox emerged from the second Escalade, a dark slash in Paris\u2019s periphery. The keeper of Violence didn\u2019t bother grabbing his bag but pounded swiftly up the porch steps. The doors swung open and his pregnant female flew outside, laughing and crying. Ashlyn leapt into his arms, a blur of gold, and he swung her around. They were locked in a heated kiss seconds later.</p><p>It was tough to imagine the savage Maddox as a father\u2014even if the baby ended up half demon like the Lords.</p> <p>Next came Danika, who halted in the doorway and scanned the crowd for Reyes. The lovely blonde spotted him and squealed. As if that squeal was a mating call of some kind, Reyes palmed a dagger and stalked to her.</p><p>Possessed as he was by the demon of Pain, Reyes could not feel pleasure without physical suffering. Before Danika, the warrior had had to cut himself twenty-four/seven to function. During their stay in Cairo, he hadn\u2019t had to injure himself once. Being away from Danika was pain enough, he said. Now that they were reunited, he\u2019d have to cut himself again, but Paris didn\u2019t think either of them minded.</p><p>With a growl, Reyes swept her into his arms and the two disappeared inside the fortress, Danika\u2019s giggling the only remaining evidence they\u2019d been nearby.</p><p>Paris rubbed at a sudden ache in his chest, praying it would go away. He knew it wouldn\u2019t, though. Not until he\u2019d had his ambrosia. Every time he was around these couples so obviously in love, the ache sprouted and stayed, a parasite that sucked the life right out of him, until he drank himself into a stupor.</p><p>There was no sign of Lucien, who had flashed home rather than endure the long plane ride. He and Anya were probably locked inside their room. One small favor, at least.</p> <p>He noted that the Harpy had watched the couples as intently as he had. Because she was fascinated or because she hoped to use the information against them?</p><p>No other females were in residence, thank the gods. No one Paris could seduce and eventually hurt when he screwed her over for someone else. Gilly, Danika\u2019s young friend, now lived in an apartment in town. The kid had wanted her own space. And they\u2019d pretended to give it to her, not telling her that her home was wired to Torin\u2019s surveillance systems. Danika\u2019s grandmother, mother and sister had left, as well, and were now back in the States.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Sabin said to the Harpy. When she failed to comply, he motioned her to his side.</p><p>\u201cThose women...\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre happy.\u201d Confidence layered every syllable. \u201cHad they not been so eager to be reunited with their men, they would have greeted you personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know...?\u201d Once again, she had trouble finishing her sentence.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes. They know their men are possessed by demons. Now come.\u201d He waved his fingers.</p><p>Still she hesitated. \u201cWhere will you take me?\u201d</p><p>Sabin pinched the bridge of his nose with his free hand. He was doing that a lot lately, it seemed. \u201cCome inside or don\u2019t, but I\u2019m not waiting out here for you to make up your mind.\u201d Angry footsteps, the slam of the door.</p><p>Anyone else he simply would have picked up and thrown over his shoulder, Paris suspected. Her, he allowed to choose. Smart of him.</p><p>The Harpy glanced left and right, and Paris braced himself to give chase. Not that he thought he could catch her if she decided to kick it into hyperdrive as she\u2019d done inside that cavern. But he was prepared to fight her if necessary.</p><p>Another red flag started waving in his mind. She could get away, here and now. Even earlier, before they\u2019d boarded the plane. Hell, she could have escaped while they camped in the desert. Why hadn\u2019t she? Unless she was Bait, as he\u2019d suspected, here to learn everything she could about them.</p><p>Though she had denied it, Sienna had been Bait. She\u2019d kissed him even as she\u2019d poisoned him\u2014and she\u2019d merely been human. What kind of damage could this Harpy do?</p><p>Let Sabin worry about this one for now. You have enough on your plate o\u2019 fuck.</p> <p>Finally, she decided to follow Sabin and headed inside, her steps tentative.</p><p>\u201cThe prisoners are in need of interrogating,\u201d Paris said to no one in particular.</p><p>Cameo flipped her dark hair over one shoulder and bent to grab her bag. No one tried to help her. They treated her like one of the guys because she preferred it that way. At least, that\u2019s what he\u2019d always told himself. He\u2019d never tried to treat her as anything else because he\u2019d never wanted to sleep with her. Perhaps she would have liked to be pampered upon occasion.</p><p>\u201cMaybe tomorrow,\u201d she said, her tragic voice nearly making his eardrums bleed. \u201cI need to rest.\u201d Without another word\u2014thank the gods\u2014she marched inside.</p><p>As well as Paris knew women, he knew beyond any doubt that she was lying. There\u2019d been a sparkle in her eyes, a rosy flush to her cheeks. She\u2019d looked aroused, not tired. Who did she plan to meet?</p><p>She\u2019d been hanging with Torin a lot lately and...Paris blinked. No, surely not. Torin couldn\u2019t touch another being skin to skin without infecting it with disease\u2014as well as everyone that person encountered, causing a plague to sweep the land. Not even an immortal was safe from harm. That immortal wouldn\u2019t die, but would become like Torin, unable to know the caress of another without severe consequences.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter what they were up to, really. He had work to do. \u201cAnyone?\u201d Paris said to those remaining. He wanted this shit over with, like, now. The sooner he finished beating information out of the Hunters, the sooner he could barricade himself inside his room and forget he was alive.</p><p>Strider whistled under his breath, pretending not to hear him as he edged toward the front door.</p><p>What the hell? No one appreciated violence better than Strider. \u201cStrider, man. I know you heard me. Help me with the interrogation, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on! At least wait until tomorrow. Not like they\u2019re going anywhere. I just need a little me time to recover. Like Cameo, I\u2019ll be ready to go bright and early. Swear to the gods.\u201d</p><p>Paris sighed. \u201cFine. Go.\u201d Were Cameo and Strider a couple, then? \u201cWhat about you, Amun?\u201d</p><p>Amun nodded his assent, but the action tossed his equilibrium into the shitter and he collapsed on the bottom step of the porch with a moan.</p><p>Barely a second later, Strider was at his side and wrapping an arm around his waist. \u201cUncle Stridey is here, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d He hefted the usually stoic warrior to his feet. Would have carried him if it had been necessary, but with Strider as a crutch Amun was able to throw one foot in front of the other, only stumbling occasionally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help with the Hunters,\u201d Aeron said, stepping up to Paris. The offer surprised the hell out of him, truth be told.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Legion? Girl probably misses you.\u201d</p><p>Aeron shook his head. His hair was cropped to his scalp and that scalp glistened in the sunlight. \u201cShe\u2019d be on my shoulders right now if she were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d No one knew better than Paris how it felt to miss a female. Though he had to admit he\u2019d been surprised to discover the wiry little demon was a female.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d A veined hand scrubbed Aeron\u2019s tired face. \u201cSomething\u2019s been...watching me. A presence. Powerful. Started about a week before we left for Cairo.\u201d</p><p>Paris\u2019s stomach tightened in dread. \u201cFirst, you have a nasty habit of keeping that kind of information to yourself. You should have told us the first time you noticed it, just as you should have told us what happened with the Titans the moment you returned from your heavenly summons all those months ago. Whoever\u2019s watching you could have alerted the Hunters about our trip. We could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, and I\u2019m sorry. But I don\u2019t think it, whatever it is, works for the Hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Paris demanded, unwilling to let it go.</p><p>\u201cI know the feel of those hateful, judging eyes on me and this isn\u2019t like that. This one is...curious.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed somewhat. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Legion isn\u2019t afraid of the gods but she\u2019s damn afraid of whoever this is. That\u2019s one of the reasons she\u2019s so amenable to going to hell for Sabin\u2019s recon work. She told me she\u2019d return when the presence was gone.\u201d</p><p>There was worry in the guy\u2019s tone. Worry Paris didn\u2019t understand. Legion might have been a tiny demon with a penchant for tiaras\u2014which they\u2019d discovered not long ago, when she\u2019d stolen one of Anya\u2019s and paraded around the fortress in it, proud as could be\u2014but she could take care of herself.</p><p>Paris turned in a circle, intent. \u201cIs your shadow here? Now?\u201d Like they needed another enemy. \u201cMaybe I can seduce whoever, whatever, it is away from you.\u201d And kill it. No telling what it had learned already.</p><p>A single shake of Aeron\u2019s head. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think it means us harm.\u201d</p><p>He paused, slowly released a pent-up breath. \u201cAll right, then. We\u2019ll deal with that later. Just let me know when it returns. Right now, we\u2019ll take care of the dungeon full of shitheads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound more human every day, you know that?\u201d Aeron had said that before, but for once, he didn\u2019t sound disapproving. There was a whistle as he unsheathed a machete from the loop at his back. \u201cMaybe the Hunters will resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if we\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>TORIN, KEEPER OF DISEASE, sat at his desk, but he faced the door of his bedroom rather than the monitors that linked him to the outside world. He\u2019d watched the SUVs pull into the driveway and had instantly grown hard. He\u2019d watched the warriors emerge and had had to palm himself to assuage the sudden ache. Watched as one by one they\u2019d entered the fortress.

She flipped the lock, and for several ticks of the clock, kept her back to him. Long dark hair tumbled to her waist, curling at the ends.Once, she\u2019d allowed him to twirl a few of those ends around his gloveless finger, careful, so careful not to touch her skin. It had been his first true contact with a woman in hundreds of years. He\u2019d almost come, just from the feel of those silky strands. But that small touch was all she\u2019d permitted, all she could ever permit and all he could ever risk.</p><p>Actually, he was surprised they\u2019d risked even that much. With his gloves on, sure. The chance of infecting her was nil. But tendrils against skin, silk against warmth, female against male? That required bravery and trust on her part and desperation and foolishness on his. Hair wasn\u2019t skin, but what if he\u2019d slipped? What if she\u2019d fallen against him? For some reason, neither of them had been able to make the consequences matter.</p><p>Last time he\u2019d touched a woman, an entire village had been wiped out. Black Plague, they\u2019d called it. That\u2019s what was inside him, swirling in his veins, laughing in his mind. For years afterward, Torin had scrubbed his skin until the black blood poured from him. Cleansing himself of the virus proved impossible, however.</p> <p>Over the ensuing centuries, he\u2019d learned to suppress the constant feeling of being dirty, tainted, hiding it with smiles and wry humor, but never had he suppressed the longing for what he couldn\u2019t have: companionship. Cameo, at least, understood him, knew what he was dealing with, what he could and could not do, and didn\u2019t ask for more.</p><p>He wished she would ask for more, and he hated himself for it.</p><p>Slowly she turned to him. Her lips were red and wet, as if she\u2019d been chewing them, and her cheeks were flushed to a dusty rose. Up and down her chest lifted and fell in quick, shallow pants. His own breath blistered his throat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back,\u201d she said on a wispy catch of breath.</p><p>He remained seated, arching a brow as if he hadn\u2019t a care. \u201cYou\u2019re unharmed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Take off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Since the caressing of her hair those few months ago, they\u2019d become best friends. With benefits. Pleasuring-themselves-at-a-distance-while-watching-the-other-do-the-same benefits, but benefits all the same. It complicated the hell out of everything. The here and now...the future. One day she\u2019d want a lover who could truly touch her, make love to her, pound in and out of her, kiss her and taste her and wrap himself around her, and Torin would have to step aside and not kill the bastard.</p><p>Until then...</p><p>She hadn\u2019t obeyed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t clear,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to take off your clothes.\u201d</p> <p>Later, she\u2019d punish him for ordering her around. He knew her well, knew how diligently she fought to prove she was just as powerful as her male counterparts. Now, need was upon her. He could smell the sweetness of her arousal. She wouldn\u2019t be able to resist much longer.</p><p>Sure enough, shaky fingers curled around the hem of her shirt and tugged it over her head. A lacy black bra. His favorite.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl,\u201d he praised.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, zeroing in on the erection straining past the waist of his pants. \u201cI told you to be naked when I got here. You were not a good boy.\u201d</p><p>Used to her sorrowful voice, he didn\u2019t flinch as the others always did. Inwardly or outwardly. That voice was a part of who she was\u2014warrior to her core, beautiful disaster...unintentional nightmare. To him, it was a soulful melody, one that echoed within his own soul.</p><p>Torin pushed to his full height, his muscles coiled, his bones taut. \u201cWhen am I ever good?\u201d</p><p>Her pupils dilated fully, her nipples hardened. She liked it when he challenged her. Maybe because she knew the value of a prize increased the more you had to work for it.</p><p>He only wished he had the fortitude to win a battle with her\u2014once, just once. In the end, she always won. He had little experience with women, was too desperate for what transpired here. But he always made a good showing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll strip when you\u2019re bare,\u201d he said, voice hoarse. \u201cNot a moment before.\u201d Strong words he couldn\u2019t possibly see through.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see...\u201d Black hair swished as she sauntered to his dresser. She kicked one booted foot on the chair in front of her, gaze devouring him. Never had the unlacing of shoes been so sexy an act. The first boot she threw at him, he dodged with only a slight head tilt. The second he allowed to smack him in the chest. Tearing his gaze from her to avoid impact, even for a second, was not an option.</p><p>Ziiip. Down went the pants. She stepped out of them.</p><p>Black lace panties to match her bra. Perfection. Weapons, everywhere. Delightful.</p><p>Her breasts were small and pert and he knew her nipples were like rosebuds. She had an oval-shaped mole on her right hipbone. What he would have given to lick it...But what drew the hottest fires of his fascination was the glittery butterfly tattoo wrapped around her hips.</p><p>If studying only one side of her, or even the front of her, it was almost impossible to tell what the shimmery, incandescent design was. Only when she had her back to him did the shape take form. Oh, how he longed to trace his tongue over every sharp peak and hollow.</p><p>He had a matching tattoo on his stomach, though his was onyx framed in crimson. Actually, all the warriors here had a butterfly tattoo, but no one\u2019s demon mark resided in the same location. And not once had he ever yearned to have his hands, lips and body on the other men\u2019s brands.</p><p>When Cameo finished removing her weapons, a small pile rested beside her. She arched a brow at him. \u201cYour turn.\u201d There was a tremor to her words, as if she were more affected by what was about to happen than she wanted him to know.</p><p>He took selfish comfort in that. \u201cYou aren\u2019t bare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be.\u201d</p><p>He should put a stop to this, send her on her way, something, because they both knew this was as far as it could ever go and that it would never be enough for either of them, but...he stripped.</p><p>Cameo gasped as she always did at this point, gaze locked on his swollen erection. \u201cTell me everything you want to do to me,\u201d she commanded, already cupping her breasts. \u201cDon\u2019t leave anything out.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed, and her fingers acted as his, moving over her own body. Only when she\u2019d come twice did he touch himself, his fingers acting as hers. But not once did he forget that this was all he could ever have, that more would never be his.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cI WANT A ROOM of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cJust like that? No hesitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re staying here.\u201d The words with me weren\u2019t said, but then, he didn\u2019t have to say them. His meaning was clear. \u201cI haven\u2019t lived in Buda long, haven\u2019t stayed in this room much, but it\u2019s mine.\u201d As are you. Again, unsaid but there.</p><p>Gwen sat on the edge of an unfamiliar yet opulent bed in an unfamiliar yet terrifyingly masculine bedroom in an unfamiliar yet massive fortress with a very familiar yet fascinating man she had kinda sorta kissed and wanted to kiss again but couldn\u2019t because he wanted nothing to do with her. And really, it wasn\u2019t her that craved the kiss but the Harpy. At least, that\u2019s what she told herself. The Harpy liked dangerous and dark, and demonic Sabin certainly fit the bill.</p><p>Gwen liked staid bordering on boring.</p><p>She watched as the completely unstaid Sabin unpacked his bag, his movements as stiff as his tone had been. His distance is for the best, she told herself. For the Harpy\u2019s benefit, of course. Kissing the intoxicating and infuriating Sabin again would not have been wise. He was too intense, too much a mystery for her peace of mind. But damn, he was sexy\u2014the act of unpacking, even as torqued as he clearly was, practically foreplay. The way his muscles moved...</p><p>Stop watching him. Not like you can start a relationship with him. Who\u2019d said anything about starting a relationship? As afraid as she was of her dark side, Gwen had always been the get-in-get-what-you-want-and-get-out type of girl. Her six-month commitment to Tyson had been an anomaly.</p><p>What was Tyson doing now? Was he with someone else? Married, even? And how would she feel if he was? Did he ever think of her? Ever wonder where she was or why she\u2019d been abducted? She should probably call him.</p><p>Mind on the task at hand. \u201cWhy do I have to share your room?\u201d she asked Sabin.</p><p>\u201cSafer this way.\u201d</p><p>For who? Her? Or his friends? The thought depressed her. Oh, it was good that the men feared her. They\u2019d leave her alone. But demons finding her too lethal to hang with? It should have been laughable. \u201cI already promised to stay in Budapest. I\u2019m not going to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on him, her lashes fusing together. His clipped replies were annoying. \u201cDo you have a girlfriend like the others? A wife?\u201d Bitch, she couldn\u2019t help but think. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll have something to say about this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. And if I did, it wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him, positive she had misheard. \u201cWouldn\u2019t matter? Why? Your girlfriends aren\u2019t worthy of your kindness or consideration?\u201d</p><p>His knuckles were tight around a velvet bag of...throwing stars? They clanged together ominously as he walked them to a chest and locked them inside. A second velvet bag he left anchored at his waist. \u201cI\u2019ve never cheated on a lover. I\u2019m faithful, always. But the war comes before anyone\u2019s feelings. Every time.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Battle before love. Without a doubt, he was the most unromantic male she\u2019d ever met. Even more so than her great-grandfather, who had laughingly burned her great-grandmother to death after she\u2019d given birth to Gwen\u2019s grandmother. Gwen\u2019s head tilted to the side as she studied Sabin more intently. \u201cWould you cheat on your girlfriend if it helped you win the war?\u201d</p><p>Back at his suitcase, he lifted a pair of combat boots. \u201cWhat does that matter?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen yes.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise. One, he hadn\u2019t sounded apologetic. Two, he hadn\u2019t hesitated. \u201cYes, as in you would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I would. If cheating meant gaining a victory, I would cheat.\u201d</p> <p>Double wow. His honesty...depressed her. He was a demon, but she\u2019d somehow expected\u2014wanted?\u2014more from him. No way would she be able to date a man who might cheat. Not that she planned to date Sabin.</p><p>Gwen wanted to be the one and only. Always. Sharing had never been easy for her; it went against every instinct she and the others of her race possessed. That\u2019s why she\u2019d finally pushed past her fears and accepted a relationship with Tyson.</p><p>To her knowledge, he had been faithful to her. The sex had been good, if tame, because, while she might have convinced herself she could handle a relationship, she\u2019d known losing herself to pleasure would be disastrous. He\u2019d loved her, at least, and she thought she\u2019d loved him. Now, thanks to all these months apart, she realized she\u2019d only loved what he\u2019d represented: normalcy. Plus, they were very similar. He worked for the IRS and was hated by his peers. She was a Harpy who despised confrontation and was pitied by her race. Similarity, though, was not a good enough reason to stay together. Not forever.</p><p>Gwen had a feeling she would be able to let go\u2014somewhat at least\u2014with Sabin. He hadn\u2019t backed down from her Harpy either in the cavern or on the plane. And strong as he was, he could take more than a human. But even though he was both brave and immortal, she doubted he could take everything she dished. No one could.</p><p>Still, she found herself wondering what he\u2019d be like in bed. Not tame, that much she could guess. He\u2019d get down and dirty and insist on the same from his lover. How much could he take from her?</p> <p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have a wife, but are you currently single?\u201d she asked, the words a croak. She couldn\u2019t imagine anyone being crazy enough to date him. Yeah, he was handsome. Yeah, his kisses alone would take a woman to the gates of heaven. But momentary pleasure with him would only result in heartbreak. Surely she wasn\u2019t the only one to realize that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust filling the silence.\u201d A lie. It seemed she was full of them lately. She\u2019d been\u2014was still, despite everything\u2014beyond curious about him, this warrior who had saved her.</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with silence,\u201d he grumbled, head nearly inside his bag.</p><p>\u201cAre you single or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked you better when you were afraid of, well, everything,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>She had been less timid around him than usual, she realized. Seeing the love his friends possessed for their women must have empowered her somehow. For the moment, at least. \u201cWell? Single?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, clearly giving up. \u201cYes, I\u2019m single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can believe it,\u201d she muttered. His last girlfriend had probably dumped him on his ass. \u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t mean we can bunk together. You\u2019ll have to find somewhere else to sleep because I\u2019m taking the bed.\u201d Brave words. She just hoped he didn\u2019t call her bluff.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be on the floor.\u201d He threw several wrinkled shirts into the laundry basket beside the closet. A demonic warrior sorting laundry; now there was something you didn\u2019t see every day.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t trust you to remain there?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and it was a cruel sound. \u201cToo bad. I\u2019m not leaving you alone all night.\u201d</p><p>Not comforting. He hadn\u2019t vowed to stay away from her, and he hadn\u2019t claimed to want nothing to do with her sexually.</p><p>Did he?</p> <p>And did she want him to?</p><p>She studied his profile, gaze traveling the length of his nose. It was a little longer than what was considered average, but regal because of it. His cheekbones were sharp, his jaw square. Overall, a very rough-looking face, with no hint of the boyishness she\u2019d sometimes imagined.</p><p>His eyes, though, were heavily, almost femininely, lashed. She hadn\u2019t noticed that before, she realized, but those lashes were so thick his eyes appeared lined in soot.</p><p>Drawing her arms around her middle, she tore her gaze from that intriguing face and focused on his body. All those muscles...Again she found herself fascinated by them. Veins throbbed in his biceps as he lifted a shaving kit. The black leather and metal links of his man-bracelet hugged the thickness of his wrist. His long legs ate up the distance to the bathroom. Hopefully he\u2019d take off his shirt and she\u2019d get another peek at those ropes of muscle. Maybe see more of that butterfly tattoo that stretched along his ribs and disappeared into the waist of his pants.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to question you,\u201d he said from the bathroom doorway. He propped a shoulder against the frame. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you run? Or tried to, at least. I know you said you didn\u2019t want to face the unknown out in that desert. That, on some level, I get. But then you discovered our dirty little demon secret and still you stayed. Even said you\u2019d help me.\u201d</p><p>Good question. She had considered bolting for the woods the moment the plane landed, then again when the SUV had stopped. Then those human females had raced from the fortress, throwing themselves at their men, clearly madly, deeply in love, and she\u2019d paused. The demon warriors had been gentle with them, caring. Utterly reverent, as though they were prized.</p><p>That, more than anything, had made her reevaluate her perception of demons.</p><p>These men were the complete opposite of what she\u2019d expected, honorable in their own right (so far) and almost kind. They seemed to want to protect her. Better, they didn\u2019t gaze at her with disappointment, blatantly wishing she were stronger, braver, more violent.</p><p>It\u2019s the angel in her, her mother would tsk every time Gwen refused to hurt an innocent. I knew better than to sleep with him. Her sisters would come to her defense, loving her as fiercely as they did, but she knew they, too, considered her feeble. The truth always shone brightly in their eyes.</p><p>Had he known her, her father would have been proud of her, she thought defensively. Surely he would have applauded such benevolence.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Sabin prompted.</p><p>\u201cI could answer you the way you\u2019ve been answering me,\u201d she said now, raising her chin. I\u2019m strong. I can stand up for myself. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I run from you? Because. That\u2019s why.\u201d There. Take a little of your own medicine.</p><p>Sabin ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m not amused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither am I!\u201d That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the way.</p><p>\u201cDarling, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>The way he said the endearment...like a caress, a fantasy and a curse all rolled into a chocolate \u00e9clair. Stolen, of course. \u201cI feel safe with you,\u201d she finally admitted. Why she had opted for the truth, she didn\u2019t know. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>He scoffed, surprising her. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. You don\u2019t even know me. But if you really are that foolish, why did you want your own room? Why question me like this?\u201d</p><p>Heat burned in her cheeks. She was foolish. \u201cWhy does it seem like you\u2019re trying to talk me out of staying when I\u2019m here at your request? Do you want me to run or something?\u201d</p><p>A single, clipped shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cThen can you at least pretend to be nice? Consistently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Again, he didn\u2019t hesitate. That was really starting to annoy her. \u201cFine. But tell me why you\u2019re nice one minute and cruel the next.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in his jaw, as if he was grinding his teeth together. \u201cI\u2019m no good for you. Trusting me will only bring you pain.\u201d</p><p>And he didn\u2019t want to bring her pain? \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>No reply.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your demon?\u201d she persisted. \u201cWhat demon do you carry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he growled.</p><p>So again, no answer. There was no answer that would make sense, anyway. Except, perhaps, that he was lying and he really did want to bring her pain because he was a demon and that\u2019s what demons did. Yet he couldn\u2019t be truly evil. He genuinely loved his friends. That much was obvious every time he looked at them.</p><p>\u201cTell me again what you think I can do for you,\u201d she said, just to remind him that he did indeed want something from her and she didn\u2019t have to help him if she didn\u2019t want to. \u201cTell me why you want to keep me around.\u201d</p><p>For once he seemed happy to respond. \u201cTo kill my enemy, the Hunters.\u201d</p><p>A laugh bubbled from her. \u201cAnd you honestly believe I can do something like that? Purposely,\u201d she added quickly, not needing another reminder of what she\u2019d unintentionally done inside that cavern.</p><p>His dark gaze leveled on her, piercing with the sharpness of a blade. \u201cUnder the right conditions, I think you can do just about anything.\u201d</p><p>Right conditions. Aka fearing for her life, aka pissed as hell. He\u2019d do it, too. Place her in danger or anger her to the point of total loss of self. Anything to win his war. \u201cWhat happened to teaching me control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d try. Not that I\u2019d succeed.\u201d</p><p>Never had there been a better reason to try and escape him. He was far more dangerous than she\u2019d thought. But she couldn\u2019t leave now, when she\u2019d only just realized that part of her did want to help him. Not to kill, she wanted no part of the actual fighting, but she didn\u2019t like that there were men like Chris out there, perhaps preying on other immortal females. If she could play some small role in stopping them, wasn\u2019t it her obligation to do so?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fear for your life?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf I give in to the Harpy, you might not live to gloat about the Hunters I\u2019ve slain. Even immortals can be killed under the right conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chance I\u2019m willing to take. Like I told you, they killed my best friend, Baden, the keeper of Distrust. He was a great man, undeserving of the death they delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of death was that?\u201d After what they\u2019d done to her fellow captives, she could only imagine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey sent a female to seduce him, and in the middle of the act they ambushed him and cut off his head. But if you want a more recent reason, the Hunters blame me and my brethren for every disease contracted, every loved one\u2019s death, every lie uttered, every violent act committed. They have tortured humans I was stupid enough to care for and they will do anything to bury me. Anything. Destroy anyone or thing, all while calling me evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all she could think to say.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Oh. Still think you won\u2019t be able to help me?\u201d</p> <p>SABIN WAS UTTERLY RIVETED by the lovely girl in front of him. All that strawberry hair tumbling down her arms, spilling into her lap. Those golden eyes flecked with shimmery silver and shining brightly. That rosy color burning in those round cheeks.</p><p>More than her appearance, he liked this newfound spirit. Despite his earlier grumblings to the contrary. Strength was damn sexy. Especially strength that didn\u2019t come naturally. Though she was timid by nature, afraid of him, this house, even her own shadow, she was sitting calmly on his bed, questioning him, head high, refusing to back down. She was truly a remarkable creature.If she\u2019s not the world\u2019s greatest actress, that is. Doubt.</p><p>Sabin growled. Gwen wasn\u2019t an actress. She\u2019d been imprisoned and tortured by Hunters; she wasn\u2019t helping them. You\u2019re irritating me with your suspicions.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m keeping you and your friends alive. Better to be on guard than dead. After all, Danika came here under the guise of rescue while she was, in fact, feeding the Hunters information.</p><p>Sabin swallowed.</p> <p>Let me at the Harpy! I\u2019ll break her and get the truth.</p><p>He pictured Reyes and Danika as they were now. Happy, in love. Proof that bad intentions could morph into good. You\u2019ll zip it. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll do. As for him...</p><p>He glanced at Gwen, knowing\u2014beyond a doubt\u2014that he wasn\u2019t destined to have a fairy-tale ending like Reyes. Watching a man cut himself, a woman could get over. Losing all sense of self-respect, she could not. Gwen was already too close to that point.</p><p>What else had shaped her into the girl she was? Or rather, woman. She was older than both Ashlyn and Danika, after all.</p><p>He was curious about her, every little detail of her life. Family, friends, lovers. And she was curious about him, too, a discovery he liked more than he should have. Way more than he should have, actually. He\u2019d wanted to answer all her questions, tell her everything, but knew the dangers of that. His self-directed irritation had made him snappier than usual. Snappier, but not any less aroused.</p><p>Just standing here, he felt desire heat him up from inside out. He wanted that hair tangled in his fingers, that lush body shivering beneath him, on top of him, her cries of bliss in his ears.</p> <p>To stop himself from reaching out, he folded his arms over his chest, his shirt straining. Her gaze fell, locking on his left bicep. Damn. If she wanted him the way he wanted her, they were going to be in trouble. Lots and lots of pleasurable, oh, so wrong trouble.</p><p>Again his demon began pulling at its reins, desperate to get to her, to invade her mind and fill it with doubts. In fact, the whispers had already started: You\u2019re not good enough, not pretty enough, not strong enough. It took every ounce of his strength to keep them inside his own head. If they reached hers...</p><p>He knew how to battle the demon and quash the doubts; she didn\u2019t. She would crumble, just as the demon wanted.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she calm his torments as Ashlyn had for Maddox? Why couldn\u2019t she charm his dark side as Anya had for Lucien? Why couldn\u2019t she curb the cravings for evil as Danika had for Reyes? Instead, Gwen roused the beast inside him to a fever pitch.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if I can help you the way you want, but I do know I\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d she said, and there was genuine sorrow in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d How...sweet. He frowned. She needed to better protect her heart and her emotions. Hurting for him could do her no good. He paused. Now he was thinking like a boyfriend. Speaking of...\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to. Before.\u201d</p><p>Before her captivity, he guessed. How had the relationship worked? Had the poor man had to watch his every word and action so he wouldn\u2019t rouse her beast? \u201cDo you miss him?\u201d There\u2019d been a trace of sadness in her tone.</p> <p>\u201cI did, yes.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that...aggravated him. \u201cDid he cheat on you? That why you asked all those silly questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly?\u201d The pink tip of her tongue swiped angrily at her lips, and his cock jerked in response, imagining it elsewhere. On him. Say, midway down his body. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t cheat on me. He was honest.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, the comparison caused his aggravation to spike. \u201cI\u2019m honest. I told you before, I didn\u2019t lie about what I will and will not do. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>One of her brows arched. \u201cWhat do you mean, you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going there,\u201d he gritted out. Gwen might need to further protect her heart, but he needed to better guard his words.</p><p>\u201cTelling the truth about your willingness to cheat doesn\u2019t make you a better person than my human. Under no circumstances would Tyson have strayed. He loved me.\u201d</p><p>Her human? Her human! \u201cHis name is Tyson? I hate to break it to you, but you dated a brand of chicken. And I wouldn\u2019t be so sure about his sense of honor. I bet he was nailing tail the moment your back was turned. And if he loved you so much, why didn\u2019t he try and find you?\u201d Sabin inwardly cursed and pressed his lips together. The terrible words had not been his, but his demon\u2019s. Since he had the bastard on a tight leash, not allowing it to seep into her head, it had decided to escape another way.</p><p>Gwen blanched. \u201cH-he probably tried.\u201d</p><p>Guilt and shame overshadowed any lingering hints of his annoyance. For all her bravado, she was still fragile. But really, this just proved his suspicions. A few measly doubts and she\u2019d looked ready to crumble. He had to stay away from her.</p><p>Could he, though? He was drawn to her. He\u2019d already arranged for her to sleep in his room. With him. Alone. Stupid! But it was the only way to guard her\u2014from the others, from herself. And foolishly, he liked the thought of being near her. He enjoyed her. More than her beauty, she was witty\u2014when she wasn\u2019t scared and silent, anyway\u2014and endearingly sweet.</p><p>He had to wonder if all Harpies were as tempting and distracting as Gwen. Guess he\u2019d find out, since he\u2019d promised to bring her sisters here. A promise he hadn\u2019t wanted to make. At first. More Harpies meant more danger. More hassle. But then he\u2019d realized that more Harpies also meant more weapons against the Hunters. Somehow, some way, he\u2019d convince her sisters to help him destroy the men who had hurt their beloved sibling.</p><p>If they love her, Doubt said. Did they even search for her when she was taken?</p><p>Damn. He hadn\u2019t thought of that. Gwen had been inside that cell for a year. They hadn\u2019t found her, hadn\u2019t saved her. Neither had that bastard Tyson.</p><p>His hands fisted at his sides. If the sisters didn\u2019t want to help him, fine. He had Gwen. He knew firsthand what she was capable of.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry for what I said,\u201d he forced out\u2014apologizing sucked\u2014and moved toward the door. \u201cYou want the room to yourself, fine. I can give you a few hours. Don\u2019t you dare leave this chamber, though. I\u2019ll have food sent up.\u201d</p><p>She moaned in obvious pleasure, in want, but said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother sending anything up. I won\u2019t eat it.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, keeping his back to her. The more he looked at her, the quicker he softened toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to start eating, Gwen. Do you understand? I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m like your captors, deliberately starving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cBut I won\u2019t eat. And you\u2019re just leaving me here, where the demons can get to me? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a demon,\u201d he said, ignoring her other question. He was getting good at that.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her voice was hesitant, barely audible.</p><p>His stomach clenched. She knew, but it didn\u2019t matter? More potent words had never been spoken. \u201cI\u2019ll be close by if you need me. Just call. Actually, I have a better idea. I\u2019ll send Anya to sit with you. She and Lucien have had hours to...reunite. She\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d And trick Gwen into eating if necessary. If anyone could convince someone to do something they didn\u2019t want to do, it was the mischievous Anya. \u201cStay put.\u201d</p><p>Only as he shut the door behind him, barricading Gwen inside lest she decide to risk bumping into one of his friends to explore, spy or even search for a phone to call the Hunters\u2014she\u2019s not working for them, damn it!\u2014did he realize he was about to knowingly pair a Harpy with the goddess of Anarchy. Great. He\u2019d be lucky if his head was still attached in the morning.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>SABIN STALKED THROUGH THE FORTRESS, pained moans rising from the dungeons below and echoing off the walls. Someone was interrogating the prisoners. He should be down there, helping, but had to speak with Anya first.</p><p>Yes, he realized he was placing a woman before his duty, but this was a tiny thing, ensuring Gwen\u2019s comfort, and it shouldn\u2019t take too long. Never again, though, he assured himself. Next time there was some torturing to be done, he\u2019d be the first one in line, Gwen be damned.Still. Strangely, leaving Gwen felt...wrong. Part of him, a big part\u2014fuck it, a very big part\u2014thought he should be with her, easing her fears, assuring her that everything would be all right.</p><p>I can\u2019t assure a female of anything but misery, he thought darkly. Especially a female he was desperate to kiss again.</p><p>That kiss on the plane had nearly slayed him. Nothing had ever been sweeter\u2014or held the potential to be so amazingly explosive. But allowing himself to participate would have meant loosening his iron hold on Doubt, and had he done so, the demon would have drawn mental blood; it was the one outcome he didn\u2019t have to doubt. Already she\u2019d been in a fragile state, frightened of who and what he was. Another kiss would be the epitome of stupid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And why the hell had he made things worse, tainting her memories of her ex? How low was he, telling her there was no way the man she\u2019d trusted had been faithful to her, no matter that his demon had driven him to say it? Worse, with every moment that passed, Doubt\u2019s determination to destroy what little confidence Gwen had strengthened. Maybe because Sabin had made her the forbidden fruit, constantly commanding the demon to stay away from her.</p><p>There was no help for that, though. If he stopped reining the demon in, Gwen\u2019s already shaky self-esteem would vanish. Her confidence would be obliterated. And he couldn\u2019t let that happen. He had to protect his weapon. Surely that was the only reason he cared about her state of mind.</p><p>He just had to figure out the best way to use her. Maybe he\u2019d convince her to pretend to join the Hunters and cut them down from the inside. That certainly had possibilities.</p> <p>Hunters had been trying such a strategy for thousands of years, Baden their greatest success. It was past time he used their own wiles against them.</p><p>Would he be able to convince Gwen to do it, though?</p><p>The question plagued him as he maneuvered through the fortress. Stained glass windows cast colorful prisms over the hallway and illuminated the dust dancing through the air.</p><p>Sabin hadn\u2019t lived here long, but even he could tell the new female residents had breathed life into the place. Their decorating had somehow chased away the gloom he\u2019d noticed when he\u2019d first arrived here. Ashlyn had selected the furniture. Sabin didn\u2019t know a lot about that sort of thing, but suspected they were expensive pieces, as they reminded him of the years he\u2019d spent in Victorian England.</p><p>No longer was every piece a shade of red to hide the blood that Reyes spilled when forced to cut himself. Now there was an off-white lounge, a chair draped in pink velvet, a carousel horse, and a walnut-and-marble desk. There was even a nursery next door to Maddox and Ashlyn\u2019s room.</p> <p>Anya had supplied the...extras. The bubblegum machine in the far corner, the stripper\u2019s pole he had to sidestep and the Ms. Pacman arcade at the side of the staircase.</p><p>Danika had painted the portraits lining the walls. Some were of angels, soaring through the heavens, some were of demons, skulking through hell, but each depicted a vision that she, as the All-Seeing Eye, had once had. Through those paintings, they were learning more about the spirits inside themselves, as well as the gods who now controlled them.</p><p>Of course, interspersed with the visions of heaven and hell were more \u201cextras\u201d from Anya. These happened to be portraits of naked men. To everyone\u2019s consternation, she\u2019d managed to save them from the Hunters\u2019 bomb blast. Only once had Sabin attempted to take one down. The next day, he\u2019d found a naked portrait of himself in its place. How the goddess had had it painted so quickly\u2014and so accurately\u2014he would never know. He would also never take down another of her pictures.</p><p>Sabin rounded a corner and stalked past the open doorway of the entertainment room, intending to take the second flight of stairs up to Lucien and Anya\u2019s bedroom. From the corner of his eye, he spotted someone tall and slender, and backtracked. He stopped in the entrance, Anya coming into focus. Dressed in an ultrashort leather dress and tall, spiked boots, she was as perfect as a female could be. Not a single flaw to her. Except her warped sense of humor.</p><p>At the moment she was playing Guitar Hero with her friend William. Her head was bobbing to the erratic beat of music, tendrils of hair dancing all around her. William was immortal and had long ago been kicked out of the heavens just as the Lords had. While they had nearly destroyed the world with their misdeeds, his crime had simply been seducing the wrong woman. Or two. Or three thousand. Not unlike Paris, he\u2019d bedded any woman who would have him, married or not. Even the god queen. King Zeus had found them together and, as William liked to say, \u201cflipped out.\u201d</p><p>Now his fate was bound to a book, a book Anya had stolen from him and liked to give back a handful of pages at a time. A book that supposedly predicted that a curse\u2014one involving a woman\u2014would befall him.</p> <p>True to form, as he pounded on the drums, the warrior was eyeing Anya\u2019s ass like it was candy and he had a sweet tooth that had been long denied. \u201cI could do this all day,\u201d he said, eyebrows waggling.</p><p>\u201cPay attention to your notes,\u201d Anya admonished. \u201cYou\u2019re missing them and dragging down the band.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, and then they both laughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t praise him, Gilly! He didn\u2019t do his best. Only a girl with a cru\u2014uh, never mind. Just\u2014tell him how awful he is!\u201d Anya twirled, fingers never slowing over the guitar.</p><p>Gilly was here? Sabin glanced around, but saw no sign of her. Then he noticed the earpieces both Anya and William sported and realized they were playing long-distance with Gilly.</p><p>Sabin leaned a shoulder against the door frame, crossed his arms over his chest, and waited impatiently until the end of the song. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lucien?\u201d</p><p>Neither Anya nor William spun or gasped or acted as though they were surprised by his presence in any way.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s escorting souls,\u201d Anya said, tossing her guitar on the couch. \u201cYes! I hit ninety-five percent. Gilly, you hit ninety-eight and poor William only hit fifty-six.\u201d Pause. \u201cWhat\u2019d I tell you? No praising the man who harshed our mellow. Yeah, you too. Until next time, chica.\u201d She removed her earpiece and threw it beside the guitar. Then she lifted a carton of cheese tots from the coffee table and started eating slowly, eyes closing in ecstasy.</p> <p>Sabin\u2019s mouth watered. Cheese tots\u2014his favorite. Somehow, she\u2019d known he\u2019d come here, seek her out; she meant to torture him, the tease. \u201cGive me a bite,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGet your own,\u201d she replied.</p><p>William tossed his sticks in the air, caught them, then placed them atop the drum set. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how many notes I miss, I still manage to make some beautiful music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I totally carried you.\u201d Anya downed the rest of the tots, her amused gaze on Sabin. She threw herself onto the couch, legs swinging over the side. \u201cSo, Sabie, I\u2019ve been looking for you. Lucien tells me we have a Harpy in the house!\u201d She clapped excitedly. \u201cI adore Harpies. They\u2019re so wonderfully naughty.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t point out that she\u2019d been playing games, not looking for him. \u201cWonderfully naughty? You didn\u2019t see her rip out the throat of a Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Her lips fell into a familiar pout. \u201cI miss all the fun babysitting Willy.\u201d</p><p>William rolled his eyes. \u201cThanks a lot, Annie. I stayed here, kept you company, helped you guard the females, and you wish you\u2019d been off fighting. Gods, the blow you\u2019ve just dealt me. I might even be tearing up.\u201d</p><p>Anya reached over and patted his head. \u201cTake a moment, collect yourself. Meanwhile, mommy is gonna chat with Doubtie poo. \u2019Kay?\u201d</p><p>William\u2019s mouth quirked at one corner. \u201cDoes that make me the daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want to die,\u201d Sabin said.</p><p>A laugh booming from him, William trekked to the seventy-three inch HDTV and plopped into the plush recliner in front of it. Three seconds later, a flesh fest was in full swing, moans abounding. Once, Paris had loved those movies. But in the weeks before their jaunt to Egypt, only William had gone near them.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything about the Harpy,\u201d Anya said, leaning toward Sabin, her face alight with interest. \u201cI\u2019m dying to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Harpy has a name.\u201d Was that...irritation in his voice? Surely not. What did he care if everyone referred to her as the Harpy? That\u2019s how he referred to her. \u201cIt\u2019s Gwendolyn. Or Gwen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwendolyn, Gwendolyn. Gwen.\u201d Anya tapped her chin with a long, sharp fingernail. \u201cSorry, not familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGold eyes, red hair. Well, strawberry-blond hair.\u201d</p><p>Her bright blue gaze suddenly glittered. \u201cHmm. That\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The hair color?\u201d Didn\u2019t he know it! He wanted to plow his fingers through it, fist it, spread it over his pillow, his thighs.</p><p>\u201cNo, that you called it strawberry-blond.\u201d A tinkling laugh bubbled from her. \u201cDoes little Sabin have a crush?\u201d</p><p>His teeth ground together in irritation as heat flooded his cheeks. A blush? A fucking blush?</p><p>\u201cAww. How precious. Look who fell in love while searching all those pyramids. What else do you know about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has three sisters, but I don\u2019t know their names.\u201d The words were raw, filled with violent warning. He was not in love.</p><p>\u201cWell, find out,\u201d she said, clearly exasperated that he hadn\u2019t done so already.</p><p>\u201cActually, I was hoping you\u2019d find out. I need you to keep her company.\u201d Guard her, a part of him wanted to beg. Keep her safe. Wait. Part of him wanted to beg? Seriously? \u201cBut William stays here. William does not go near her.\u201d</p><p>Leather rubbed against denim as William turned in the chair. He practically glowed with intrigue. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go near her? Is she pretty? I bet she\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>Sabin ignored him. It was either that or kill him, and killing him would upset Anya. Upsetting Anya was the equivalent of placing your head in a guillotine.</p><p>At times like this, Sabin found himself longing for the dull routine of battling and training that had comprised his life pre-Lords reunion. Then he had only five roomies and no annoying women\u2014beyond Cameo, but she didn\u2019t count\u2014or their horny friends to deal with. \u201cAlso, see if you can get her to eat,\u201d he added. \u201cShe\u2019s been with me for several days and has only eaten a few Twinkies, but she threw them up immediately afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I never said I\u2019d babysit your woman. And second, of course she won\u2019t eat. She\u2019s a Harpy.\u201d Anya\u2019s tone suggested he was a moron.</p><p>Maybe he was. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey only eat what they steal or earn. Duh. If you\u2019re offering her food, she has to turn it down. Otherwise she\u2019ll...drumroll please...throw up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He waved a hand in dismissal. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s their way of life.\u201d</p><p>But that...surely it wasn\u2019t...hell. Who was he to say something was impossible? For years Reyes had had to stab Maddox in the stomach at midnight and Lucien had had to escort the dead warrior\u2019s soul to hell\u2014only to return it the next morning to a healed body and do it all over again the next night.</p> <p>\u201cHelp her steal something, then. Please. Isn\u2019t petty theft your forte?\u201d Later, he\u2019d make sure food was lying around his room and easy to \u201cpilfer.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly a high-pitched cry of agony ripped through the walls, a sound that soothed Sabin\u2019s very soul. The Hunter interrogation had just reached a new level. I should be there, helping. Instead, he remained rooted in place, curious, desperate for answers. \u201cWhat else should I know about her?\u201d</p><p>Pensive, Anya stood, walked to the pool table and dug one of the balls out of a pocket. She tossed it into the air, caught it, tossed it again. \u201cLet\u2019s see, let\u2019s see. Harpies can move so quickly the human eye\u2014or immortal eye, as the case may be\u2014can\u2019t register a single motion. They love to torture and punish.\u201d</p><p>Both of those he\u2019d already witnessed firsthand. The speed with which she\u2019d killed the Hunter...the brutal way she\u2019d attacked him...that had been all about torture and punishment. Yet every time Sabin mentioned attacking the other Hunters responsible for her treatment, she paled, a trembling mass of fear.</p><p>\u201cLike any other race, Harpies can have special gifts. Some can predict when a specific person will die. Some can pull a soul from a body and carry it into the afterlife. Too bad more of \u2019em can\u2019t do that\u2014it\u2019d make my honey\u2019s job so much easier. Some can time travel.\u201d</p> <p>Did Gwen possess a special ability?</p><p>Every time he learned something about her or her origins, a thousand other questions presented themselves.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t worry about your woman,\u201d Anya added as if reading his thoughts. \u201cThose types of powers don\u2019t develop until late in life. Unless she\u2019s a few hundred years old\u2014or is it a few thousand? I can\u2019t remember\u2014she probably hasn\u2019t tapped into her ability yet.\u201d</p><p>Good to know. \u201cAre they evil? Can they be trusted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil? Depends on your definition. Trusted?\u201d Slowly she grinned, as if she relished her next words. \u201cNot even a little.\u201d</p><p>Not good for his main objective. But damn, he couldn\u2019t picture sweet, innocent Gwen playing him. \u201cFrom what Lucien told you, do you think Gwen could be working with the Hunters?\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to ask that; he truly didn\u2019t believe her capable of it. The only reason the thought was in his mind was Doubt. Doubt, for whom confidence and assurance were vile curses.</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d Anya said. \u201cI mean, you found her locked up. No Harpy alive would willingly allow herself to be caged. To be captured is to be ridiculed, found unworthy.\u201d</p><p>How would her sisters treat her when they arrived, then? He wouldn\u2019t allow them to castigate her. And shit. He\u2019d left her locked in his bedroom. A spacious bedroom, but a prison all the same. Did she now view him as she viewed the Hunters? His stomach churned.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay with her? Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate to break it to you, sweet chops, but if she doesn\u2019t want to be here, even I can\u2019t keep her here. No one can.\u201d</p><p>Another human cry ripped through the room, followed quickly by immortal laughter. \u201cPlease,\u201d he repeated. \u201cShe\u2019s frightened and needs a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrightened.\u201d Anya laughed. But his intent expression never wavered, so that laughter began to fade. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right? Harpies are never scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have I ever demonstrated a sense of humor?\u201d</p><p>As disdainful of mysteries as she was, Anya shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me there. Fine. I\u2019ll babysit her, but only because I\u2019m curious. I\u2019m telling you, a frightened Harpy is an oxymoron.\u201d</p> <p>She would soon learn the error of that. \u201cThank you. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d Anya smiled sweetly. Too sweetly. \u201cOh, and if she asks about you, I\u2019m going to tell her everything I know. Every detail. And I do mean every.\u201d</p><p>Dread instantly speared him. Already Gwen was wary of him. If she knew half the things he\u2019d done in the past, she would never help him, never trust him, never again look at him with that intoxicating blend of desire and uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Sabin said darkly. \u201cBut you are in desperate need of a spanking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one? Lucien gave me a good one this morning.\u201d</p><p>In that moment Sabin admitted to himself that he\u2019d never gain the verbal edge with Anya. He\u2019d never intimidate her, either. No reason to even try. \u201cJust...be gentle with her. And if you have any shred of mercy inside that gorgeous body, don\u2019t tell her I house Doubt. She\u2019s already afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he turned and stomped to the dungeon below.</p><p>\u201cWHERE ARE THEY?\u201d Paris demanded.</p><p>A moan of pain was his only answer.They\u2019d been at it for what seemed like days, with no real results. Aeron\u2019s demon, Wrath, was flashing all kinds of sick images in his head, wanting to punish this man for his sins. Soon Aeron wouldn\u2019t be able to stop himself. If that happened, he wouldn\u2019t get answers. He was ready to stop, regroup and try again tomorrow, allowing the remaining Hunters\u2014they\u2019d already accidentally killed two\u2014to imagine what would soon be done to them. Sometimes, the unknown proved more intimidating than reality. Sometimes.</p><p>Paris, though, didn\u2019t look ready to quit. The man was possessed. By more than his demon. He\u2019d done things to these humans that even Aeron, cold warrior that he was, couldn\u2019t have stomached. But then, Aeron was not the man he used to be.</p><p>Months ago the gods had commanded him to slay Danika Ford and her family and he\u2019d fought diligently against the bloodlust that had subsequently consumed him. Fought against the images of those sweet deaths that invaded his head, his hand slicing their throats, his eyes watching their blood pour from them, his ears registering their last, gurgling breath. Gods, he\u2019d craved those things, more than anything else in the world.</p><p>When the lust had finally left him\u2014though he still didn\u2019t know why it had\u2014he\u2019d been afraid of taking another life, any life, lest he morph back into the beast he\u2019d been. Then he and the other warriors had traveled to Egypt and a battle had raged. He\u2019d been unable to stay his hand, the lust he\u2019d feared overtaking him yet again, driving him.</p><p>Thankfully, he\u2019d calmed down without harming one of his friends. But what if he hadn\u2019t? He would not be able to live with himself. Only Legion was capable of soothing him completely, and he was currently without her company.</p><p>His hands fisted. Whoever, whatever, was watching him had to be stopped before Legion could return. Somehow. Sadly, those invisible, penetrating eyes were not on him now. He was covered in blood and had a wadded-up rag in his pocket\u2014a rag that cradled one of the dead Hunters\u2019 fingers. The sight of him might have driven the voyeur away for good.</p><p>At first he\u2019d thought it was Anya, playing a prank. She\u2019d done something similar to Lucien. Legion was not afraid of Anya, though. Which made her probably the only fortress resident aside from Lucien who could make that claim.</p><p>\u201cOne last chance to answer my question,\u201d Paris said calmly, tapping his dagger against the Hunter\u2019s pale cheek. \u201cWhere are the children?\u201d</p><p>Greg, their current victim, whimpered, a stream of saliva gushing from his lips.</p><p>They\u2019d isolated the Hunters, one to a cell. That way, the screams they elicited from one would drive the others mad, making them wonder what exactly had been done to their brethren. The scents of urine, sweat and blood already saturated the air, another added bonus.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Greg blubbered. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me. I swear to God they didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>Hinges creaked. Footsteps echoed. Then Sabin was strolling into the cell, features tight with determination. Now things would get really bloody. No one was more determined than Sabin. With a demon like Doubt, that determination was probably the only thing that kept him sane.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you learned?\u201d the warrior asked. He pulled a velvet pouch from the back of his waist and gently placed it on the table, slowly unraveling the material to reveal the sharp gleam of different metals.</p><p>Greg sobbed.</p><p>\u201cThe only new information is that our old friend Galen\u2014\u201d Aeron said the name with a sneer \u201c\u2014is aided by someone he calls...you aren\u2019t going to believe this. Distrust.\u201d</p><p>Sabin froze in place, the words obviously playing through his mind. \u201cImpossible. We found Baden\u2019s head, minus his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No immortal could have survived that. A head was not something that could be regenerated. Other body parts, yes, but not that. \u201cWe also know his demon is now wandering the earth, crazed from the loss of its host. There\u2019s no way it could have been found without Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt offends me that such words were even spoken. You punished the Hunter for lying, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Paris said with a satisfied grin. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who had to eat his own tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should put this one in the cage,\u201d Aeron suggested. The Cage of Compulsion. An ancient, powerful artifact\u2014and one that would supposedly aid them in their quest to find the box. Anyone they placed inside it had to do whatever the warriors commanded, no exception. Well, almost no exception. When Aeron had been consumed by bloodlust, he\u2019d begged someone in the heavens to place him inside and command him to stay away from the Ford women.</p><p>But Cronus had appeared before him and said, \u201cThink you I would create something as powerful as this cage and allow it to be used against me? Anything I set into motion cannot be stopped. Even with the cage. That\u2019s the only reason I agreed to leave it here. Now. Enough of this. Now is the time to act.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aeron had blinked and found himself inside Reyes\u2019s bedroom, a knife in his hand, Danika\u2019s neck so beautifully close...</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Sabin said. \u201cWe agreed.\u201d</p><p>They would not show the cage to Hunters\u2014even doomed ones\u2014for any reason, so that Hunters would never see what it could do. Just in case.</p> <p>\u201cLearn anything else?\u201d Sabin asked, changing the subject.</p><p>But Aeron saw the gleam in the warrior\u2019s eye. Because the cage had been mentioned in mixed company, this Hunter would die after their session. \u201cJust a confirmation of what the captive women told us. They were raped, impregnated, their babies meant to be used to one day fight us. Already there are half-immortal children out there being raised as Hunters, but Greg there doesn\u2019t want to save his fingers and toes and tell us where.\u201d</p><p>The sobs became silent, the Hunter so scared his throat was closing. Any moment, he\u2019d pass out.</p><p>Paris gripped him by the neck and shoved his head between his legs, the rope that bound him pulling tight on his wrists. \u201cBreathe, damn you. Or I swear to the gods I\u2019ll keep you lucid another way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least he still has his voice box,\u201d Sabin said dryly. He held a curved blade up to the light and flicked the tip. Blood instantly beaded on his finger. \u201cUnlike his friend in the cell to the left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy bad,\u201d Paris said, but he didn\u2019t sound repentant. There was an almost maniacal gleam in those blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he supposed to answer our questions if he can\u2019t speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterpretive dance,\u201d was the wry response.</p><p>Sabin snorted. \u201cYou could have used your powers.\u201d His faculty for seduction worked even on men.</p><p>\u201cI could have, but didn\u2019t.\u201d Paris scowled. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t do so now, so don\u2019t ask. I hate these bastards too much to lay on the charm, even for information. I still owe them for the time I spent as their prisoner.\u201d</p><p>Sabin glanced at Aeron, an unspoken why didn\u2019t you stop him drifting between them. Aeron shrugged. He had no idea how to deal with the fierce, violent soldier Paris had become. Was this how the others had felt about him?</p> <p>\u201cSo right now we\u2019re determined to learn the location of the kids?\u201d Sabin asked. \u201cThat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aeron replied. \u201cOne of the Hunters admitted that they range in ages, anywhere from infancy to teenager. And yeah, they\u2019ve been raping immortals that long. They were able to do so without getting caught because of their location. That cavern in Egypt was once a temple to the gods. It\u2019s protected, though no one knows by who\u2014or how we bypassed that protection.</p><p>\u201cSupposedly the kids are faster and stronger than any Hunter that has come before. Oh, and get this. Most of the incubators, as this bastard called them...they were immortals Ashlyn found.\u201d</p><p>Ashlyn had the unique ability to stand in one location and hear every conversation that had ever taken place there. Before coming to Budapest, she\u2019d worked for\u2014hell, dedicated her life to\u2014the World Institute of Parapsychology, an agency that had used her skills to hunt immortals. For \u201cresearch,\u201d they\u2019d told her.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t tell her,\u201d Aeron added. \u201cShe would be devastated.\u201d Learning she\u2019d inadvertently been working for Hunters must have been bad enough; the discovery that her abilities had been used to help breed new Hunters might be too much for the gentle pregnant woman.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell Maddox and let him decide what to leak to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, let me go,\u201d Greg begged, tone desperate. \u201cI\u2019ll take the others a message. Any message you want. A warning, even. I\u2019ll tell them to stay away from you. To leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>Sabin lifted a vial of dirty-looking liquid from that velvet pouch. \u201cNow why would I let you give them a warning that I can deliver myself?\u201d He popped the cap with his thumb and poured the stuff over his blade. There was a hiss and sizzle.</p> <p>Greg tried to scoot his chair back but it was nailed in place. \u201cWh-what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA special kind of acid I like to mix myself. It\u2019ll eat through your flesh, burn you from inside out. Vessels, muscle, bone, it doesn\u2019t matter. Only thing it can\u2019t eat through is this metal, because it\u2019s straight from the heavens. So, are you going to tell us what we want to know? Or am I going to shove this blade into the bottom of your foot and work my way up?\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down the trembling man\u2019s face, landing on his shirt and blending with the blood already caked there. \u201cThey\u2019re in a training facility. Everyone calls it Hunter High. It\u2019s a subsidiary of the World Institute of Parapsychology. A boarding school where the kids are kept as far from their mothers as possible. There they are taught how to fight, how to track. Taught to hate your kind for the millions you\u2019ve murdered with your diseases and lies. The millions who have killed themselves because of the misery you spread.\u201d</p><p>Excellent. Now he was sounding like the Hunters Aeron so loathed.</p><p>\u201cAnd where is this facility located?\u201d Sabin asked flatly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I honestly don\u2019t know. You have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t.\u201d Slowly Sabin approached him. \u201cSo let\u2019s see if I can jog your memory, shall we?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>IF ONE MORE PAIN-FILLED, gut-wrenching scream echoed off Sabin\u2019s bedroom walls, Gwen was going to hurt someone! It had been going on forever, it seemed. Didn\u2019t help that fatigue beat heavy fists all over her, weighing down her eyelids, fuzzing up her brain, making this seem like an endless nightmare. But she was determined to keep both her eyes and ears open, just in case one of the Lords decided to sneak in and hurt her.</p><p>Like they were hurting the man currently begging for mercy. Beyond any doubt, she knew the Hunters were being tortured. That\u2019s where Sabin had gone. That\u2019s why he\u2019d abandoned her so quickly. His \u201cwork\u201d was the most important thing in his life.Know him so well, do you? No. But she knew he despised the Hunters, knew he craved their destruction as much as she craved normalcy and would do anything, anything to ensure it.</p><p>She understood his desire. They\u2019d taken something from him, a loved one. More than one loved one, actually. They\u2019d taken something from her, too. Many somethings. Her pride, the normal life she\u2019d just started to carve out for herself. She hated them as much as Sabin did. Maybe more.</p><p>They\u2019d watched Chris rape those women with lust in their eyes, wanting a turn of their own. They hadn\u2019t stopped him, hadn\u2019t even protested his despicable actions. So even though the screams were driving her insane, stopping Sabin wasn\u2019t on her to-do list. Those Hunters deserved what they got. However, each and every one of those screams reminded her that Sabin wanted her to help him purposely end life.</p><p>Could she?</p><p>Just the thought caused bile to rise in her throat and fear to infuse her blood, turning the cells to acid and blistering her veins. Over the years, she had killed. Oh, had she killed.</p><p>At nine, she\u2019d killed her tutor for giving her an F. At sixteen, a man had followed her into a building, had jerked her into an empty room and locked the door. He\u2019d lasted thirty seconds against the Harpy. At twenty-five, she\u2019d moved from Alaska to Georgia, following Tyson\u2014which was what prompted her mother to cut all ties\u2014and finally started college, something she\u2019d wanted to do years earlier. She couldn\u2019t handle that rowdy a public, her sisters had said. And they were right. A married professor made a pass at her, that was all, yet she\u2019d ripped into him as if he\u2019d tried to slice her throat. Her third week of college had been her last.</p><p>Her sisters claimed the Harpy would not be so volatile if Gwen stopped combating what she was, but she didn\u2019t believe them. They were a bloodthirsty lot, constantly fighting, with a body count that staggered her. She loved them, but though she envied their confidence and strength, she didn\u2019t want to be like them. Most days.</p><p>Another agonized scream.</p><p>To distract herself, she explored the bedroom, picked the lock on the weapons chest and pocketed a few of the throwing stars Sabin had hidden there, only yawning three times\u2014an improvement. Some skills a girl never forgot, and B and E was something her family took very seriously. Should have done this sooner. She picked the door lock, as well, and sneaked into the hallway\u2014only to backtrack into the bedroom the moment she heard footsteps.</p><p>Why am I such a coward?</p><p>Another scream, this one fading into a gurgle.</p><p>Trembling, yawning again, she eased onto the mattress, forcing her fuzzy mind to consider what was around her rather than what she was hearing. The bedroom was a surprise. Hard and masculine as Sabin was, she\u2019d expected sparse furnishing, blacks and browns, nothing personal. And on the surface, that\u2019s what she saw.</p><p>But under the dark brown comforter were vibrant blue sheets and a feather-top mattress. In the closet, he had an array of funny T-shirts. Pirates of the Caribbean. Hello Kitty. One that said Welcome to the Gun Show, with arrows pointing to his biceps. Behind a veil of lush plants was a sitting area he\u2019d rigged with a pillowed floor that looked up to a ceiling mural of castles in the clouds.</p><p>She liked the conflicting sides of him. Like the harsh yet boyish aspects of his face.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello, hello,\u201d a female called. The door she\u2019d just shut flew open and a tall, gorgeous woman strolled inside, a tray of food balanced in her hands. Judging by the scent wafting from the plate, there was a ham sandwich, a handful of Baked Lays, a bowl of grapes and a glass of\u2014Gwen sniffed\u2014cranberry juice.</p><p>Her mouth watered. Maybe it was her intense hunger or perhaps her lack of sleep, but the intruder wasn\u2019t even a blip on her radar. \u201cWh-what do you have there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay no attention to the food,\u201d the stranger said, placing the tray on the dresser. \u201cThis is for Sabin. The jerk conned me into making him a meal. I was told you weren\u2019t to touch anything, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no problem.\u201d It was hard to speak, her tongue felt so swollen. \u201cWho are you?\u201d She couldn\u2019t pull her gaze from that tray. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Anya, goddess of Anarchy.\u201d</p><p>No reason to doubt the statement. Otherworldly power radiated from the woman, practically sparking in the air. But what was a goddess doing with demons? \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fiddlesticks. Will you excuse me? I hear Lucien\u2014Lucien\u2019s my man, so hands off him\u2014calling for me. Don\u2019t go anywhere, \u2019kay? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p> <p>Gwen hadn\u2019t heard anything, but she didn\u2019t protest. The moment the door closed behind the goddess, she was at the dresser, stuffing Sabin\u2019s sandwich into her mouth, washing it down with the juice, then scooping the chips in one hand and the grapes in the other. She scarfed them as though she\u2019d never tasted anything so fine.</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>It was like having a rainbow in her mouth. A m\u00e9lange of flavors, textures and temperatures. Her stomach greedily accepted every morsel and begged for more of the stolen goods.</p><p>Anya was only gone a minute, maybe two, but when she reentered the chamber, the food was gone and Gwen was seated on the bed, wiping her face with the back of her wrist and swallowing the final bite.</p><p>\u201cNow then. Where were we?\u201d Without sparing the tray a glance, Anya strolled to the bed and perched beside Gwen. \u201cOh, yeah. I was making you comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSabin told me he was sending you, but I thought he\u2019d changed his mind. I, uh, don\u2019t need a guard. Honest.\u201d Please don\u2019t notice the tray. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try and escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The beautiful goddess waved a dismissive hand. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019m the goddess of Anarchy. Like I\u2019d lower myself to such a station. Besides, nobody sends me anywhere I don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m merely bored and curious. Now one question has been answered in my mind, at least. You\u2019re unbelievably pretty. Look at this hair.\u201d She sifted a few of the strands between her fingers. \u201cNo wonder Sabin chose you as his female.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s eyelids drifted closed, her head leaning into the goddess\u2019s touch. The Harpy was quiet, lulled first by the meal, and now by the companionship. All she needed now was to leave the fortress, just for a few hours, and catch a few Zs. \u201cHe didn\u2019t choose me as his female.\u201d But something inside her liked the thought of it, she realized. Her nipples had hardened, and heat had bloomed between her legs, spreading like wildfire.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re his.\u201d Anya\u2019s arm fell away. \u201cYou\u2019re staying in his room.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids popped open, and she barely held back her whimper. Why did no one want to continue touching her? \u201cI\u2019m here by force.\u201d</p><p>Anya laughed as if she\u2019d just cracked a joke. \u201cGood one!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously. I asked for my own room but he wouldn\u2019t give it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike anyone could force a Harpy to stay somewhere she didn\u2019t want to stay.\u201d</p><p>That was true of her sisters. Her? Not so much. At least there\u2019d been no hint of disdain in Anya\u2019s tone when she\u2019d said the word Harpy. So many creatures of \u201cmyth\u201d and \u201clegend\u201d considered Harpies beneath them, mere killers and thieves.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m nothing like the rest of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. There was enough disgust in your voice to flay the skin from someone\u2019s body. Don\u2019t like our origins or ourself?\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s gaze fell to her hands, which were twisting in her lap. Was this information that could be used against her? Would keeping it secret award her some type of advantage? Would a lie serve just as well, if not better?</p><p>\u201cEither,\u201d she finally replied, deciding it was safe to tell the truth. She missed her sisters beyond belief, and here was a female, listening to her, seeming to care. At this point, whether Anya truly cared or not didn\u2019t matter. Sharing her feelings was nice. Hell, talking was nice. Twelve months had passed since anyone had listened to her.</p><p>Sighing, Anya flopped back against the mattress. \u201cBut you guys are, like, the coolest things ever. No one disses you and lives to tell about it. Even the gods pee their pants when you approach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but making friends is impossible because nobody wants to come near us. Worse, showing your true self in a romantic relationship is a no-no because you might actually eat your boyfriend.\u201d Gwen fell beside the goddess, their shoulders brushing. She couldn\u2019t help herself; she cuddled closer.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing? When I was a girl, I was utterly reviled by my peers. They called me a whore, some even refusing to stand in the same room as me, as if I\u2019d somehow taint their precious lives. I wanted to be a Harpy so badly I could taste it. Then no one would have messed with me. Guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were reviled?\u201d This beautiful, gentle, utterly kind female?</p><p>\u201cYeah. Imprisoned, too, then banished here to earth.\u201d Anya rolled to her side, tucking her hands under her cheek and peering over at Gwen. \u201cSo what clan are you part of?\u201d</p><p>Was this information that could be used against her? Would keeping it secret award\u2014Oh, shut up. \u201cThe Skyhawks.\u201d</p><p>Anya blinked, long black lashes momentarily casting shadows over her cheeks. \u201cWait. You\u2019re a Skyhawk? With Taliyah, Bianka and Kaia?\u201d</p><p>Now Gwen rolled to her side, staring over at the goddess with simultaneous twinges of hope and dread. \u201cYou know my sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. We had some good times together back in the, oh, sixteen hundreds, I believe. In all my centuries, I have only called a handful of people friend, and those girls reached the top of the list. We fell out of touch, though, a few hundred years ago. One of my human pets died, and well, I didn\u2019t handle it well. Shut myself off from almost everybody.\u201d Anya\u2019s azure gaze became intent, gauging. \u201cYou must be a new addition.\u201d</p><p>Was she comparing Gwen to her beautiful, smart, amazingly strong siblings? \u201cYes. I\u2019m just twenty-seven mortal years.\u201d</p><p>Anya sat up, clicking her tongue against the roof of her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re just a baby, then. But with that kind of age gap between your sisters and you, wouldn\u2019t your mom have long passed the age to hatch another rugrat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d Gwen followed her upright, a spark of irritation kindling in her chest. She wasn\u2019t a baby, damn it. A coward, yeah, but a grown, adult coward. These immortals would never see her any other way, that much was clear. Even Sabin had to consider her a child. A child too young even to kiss.</p><p>\u201cDo the girls know you\u2019re here?\u201d Anya asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should call them. We can party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said. And she would. Just not yet. The more she thought about it, the more she realized that her fear of admitting what had happened to her was justified. It really was going to be humiliating. They were going to lecture her, punish her as was their right as her elders and maybe even command her home, forever, where they could watch and protect her. They\u2019d never admit that the latter was just another kind of cage.</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what she\u2019d gone to Georgia to escape. She\u2019d told herself she\u2019d left to be with Tyson, who had been vacationing in Anchorage when they met. But these last few months, alone in her cell, she\u2019d had nothing to do but think and she\u2019d realized she\u2019d simply wanted out. Freedom.</p><p>For once, she\u2019d put on her big girl panties and acted on her own with no safety net. Yeah, she\u2019d failed. But at least she\u2019d tried.</p><p>The thought of putting off the call caused guilt to swim through her. Her sisters were probably worried about her lack of communication, whether they knew what had happened or not. No matter how humiliating it was going to be, she would have to contact them soon.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019ve fallen out of touch with them,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but say. \u201cBut did you keep tabs on them? Do you know how they\u2019re doing? What they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t and I don\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. But knowing them, they\u2019re panties-deep in trouble.\u201d</p><p>They shared a laugh. Gwen could easily recall the time Bianka and Kaia had painted a hopscotch square in their backyard. Rather than toss stones, they\u2019d tossed cars. Taliyah had used semis.</p><p>\u201cGood news is, they\u2019ll approve of your choice of beefcake. Sabin\u2019s just the sort of wicked they\u2019d like, no doubt about it. Pun intended, of course.\u201d</p><p>Pun? What pun? And Sabin was not her boyfriend. A good thing he wasn\u2019t; because she\u2019d left her sisters for Tyson, they\u2019d probably slay her next boyfriend on principle alone. \u201cMy guess is they\u2019d be dining on his liver five minutes after meeting him.\u201d Another reason to put off her phone call, despite her guilt. Sabin wasn\u2019t in her Fave Five at the moment, but she didn\u2019t want him dead.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. He\u2019d just grow a new one. Besides, you\u2019re not giving my boy enough credit. When it comes to battle, he fights dirtier than anyone I know. Including myself, and I stabbed my BFF in the stomach just for the giggles!\u201d</p><p>Okay. Maybe Anya wasn\u2019t as kind and gentle as she\u2019d supposed. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him fight. I know he\u2019s fierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you worry for him?\u201d Anya studied her intently.</p><p>Yes. No. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t. He\u2019s half demon, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich demon possesses him?\u201d she asked, unable to hide her impatience to know.</p><p>But Anya continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cLet me give you a little background info. See, Sabin\u2019s been clashing with Hunters\u2014the men who held you captive\u2014for thousands of years. They blame the Lords for the world\u2019s evil, sickness, death, you name it, and will stop at nothing to obliterate every single one of them. Murder humans\u2014\u201d her gaze turned shrewd \u201c\u2014rape immortals.\u201d</p><p>Gwen had to look away.</p><p>\u201cRight now there\u2019s a race to find four artifacts that once belonged to king Cronie, the shithead, because they\u2019ll lead the way to Pandora\u2019s box, the one thing guaranteed to kill the Lords. It\u2019ll suck their demons right out of them.\u201d There at the end, worry had seeped from her tone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat sounds like a good thing.\u201d What she wouldn\u2019t give to have the Harpy sucked out of her. But it wasn\u2019t another entity, much as she liked to pretend otherwise. It was her. The deepest part of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Not good. It\u2019ll kill their bodies. Those demons are like another heart. Without it, they can\u2019t function.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, though. Threesomes are fun. I should know.\u201d Anya\u2019s smile was dreamy. \u201cMy man was ordered to kill me by Cronus himself, but Lucien just couldn\u2019t do it. He fell in love with me instead. And oh, I love the way he loves me.\u201d</p><p>No one, not even Tyson, had ever made Gwen smile like that. Which meant she had never loved or been loved like that. And though she\u2019d already come to that conclusion in prison, the fresh reminder stung.</p><p>\u201cNow, enough lying around like lazy bums,\u201d Anya said. \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll give you a tour of the fortress. I\u2019ll even tell you everything I know about Sabin.\u201d</p><p>Sabin. Her heart skipped a beat, just the mention of his name able to affect her. How was that possible? He was everything Tyson was not: fierce, dominating, vengeful, passionate. He was everything she\u2019d never wanted. \u201cBut...Sabin told me to stay put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Gwen\u2014can I call you Gwen?\u2014you\u2019re a Harpy, and Harpies do not take orders from anyone, especially bossy demons.\u201d</p> <p>She bit her lip and eyed the door. You considered sneaking out once already. What\u2019s a second time? \u201cA tour does sound kind of wonderful. If you can guarantee the Lords will leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, so come on.\u201d Anya hopped to her feet, dragging Gwen up behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll give you ten minutes to shower and then we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t need a shower.\u201d Or rather, she wouldn\u2019t take one. Not in this house.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? You\u2019re all...icky.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and she wanted to keep it that way. During her captivity, she\u2019d made sure to dust herself with the sand off the ground every few days. Otherwise, everyone would have seen the true color and texture of her skin. Much as she was curious to see Sabin\u2019s reaction, she didn\u2019t want to deal with the aftereffects. And there were always aftereffects. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>If she were home, either in Georgia or Alaska, she could shower and use her makeup to blend in. Since she wasn\u2019t, she couldn\u2019t. Dirt was her only buffer.</p> <p>\u201cFine, then. Lucky for you I\u2019m not a clean freak.\u201d Anya linked their arms and kicked into a leisurely stroll.</p><p>For half an hour, they wandered the fortress, upstairs, downstairs, the wide, open kitchen\u2014Gwen tried and failed to picture any of the Lords in there cooking\u2014the library, an office, a covered garden of bright multicolored blooms, and into private bedrooms that didn\u2019t belong to either of them. Nothing was sacred to the goddess. In two of them, couples had been sleeping, arms and legs tangled. Gwen\u2019s cheeks had burned bright until the doors were shut, the nakedness blocked.</p><p>But not one secret of Sabin\u2019s did Anya reveal.</p><p>By the time they reached the media room\u2014\u201centertainment\u201d room, as the goddess called it\u2014she was ready to break down and ask. Instead, she forced herself to focus and look around, trying to learn more about Sabin and his friends through their possessions. There was a huge flat-screen TV, assorted video game systems, a pool table, a refrigerator, a karaoke machine, even a basketball hoop. Popcorn kernels littered the floor, scenting the air with their buttery goodness.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d she said, spreading her arms and twirling. The men must not be the all day/all night war hounds she\u2019d thought they were.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello, ladies. I do believe this room isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>The deep voice filled the spacious chamber as the recliner in front of the TV swiveled. Then a gorgeous man with dark hair and blue eyes was peering over at her, assessing her every curve. Gwen panicked, automatically reaching for one of the stars she\u2019d hidden in her pocket.</p><p>\u201cGwen, meet William. He\u2019s an immortal, but not demon-possessed. Unless you count his sex addiction as his own personal demon. William, meet the woman who is going to bring Sabin to his knees.\u201d</p> <p>William\u2019s sensuous lips dipped into a pout. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind being brought to my knees. So if you change your mind about being with the warrior...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she rushed out, even though she\u2019d denied Anya\u2019s claim earlier. Encouraging an admirer could lead to problems. Bloody, life and death problems.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take excellent care of you, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a day. Maybe a day and a half,\u201d Anya retorted dryly. \u201cHe\u2019s a love-\u2019em-and-leave-\u2019em kind of guy. And though he\u2019s not a Lord, he does have a curse hanging over his head. I have the book to prove it.\u201d</p><p>William growled low in his throat. \u201cAnya! Must you share my secrets with everyone?\u201d He flattened his palms on the arms of his chair. \u201cFine. If you can spill, I can, too. Anya\u2019s the reason the Titanic sank. She was playing chicken with the icebergs.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, Anya anchored her hands on her hips. \u201cWilliam had a bronze made of his penis and placed it on his mantel.\u201d</p><p>Rather than embarrass the man, her words spurred him on. \u201cAnya visited the Virgin Islands a few years ago and after that, all the natives started calling them the Islands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam has a tattoo of his own face on his back. He says it\u2019s \u2019cause he doesn\u2019t want to deprive the people behind him of his beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnya\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Gwen said with a laugh. Their easy banter had chased away her nervousness. \u201cI get the point. You\u2019re both depraved. Now enough about you two. Someone tell me something about Sabin. You said you would, Anya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she now?\u201d William immediately gave her his full attention, blue eyes sparkling. \u201cAllow me to help her out. Sabin once stabbed Aeron, the tattooed warrior with the buzz cut, in the back. Not in a playful gesture, either, but to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d she asked. William seemed outraged by that fact. Gwen thought perhaps she should be, as well, but Sabin was the kind of man who fought dirty\u2014as both she and Anya had remarked\u2014and that, well, impressed her. Her sisters were like that; sometimes, despite her instinctive fear of violence, she secretly wished she were like that, where nothing mattered but victory.</p><p>\u201cBor-ing,\u201d Anya said. She rubbed her hands together, as if she was happy to have her turn.</p><p>\u201cWait. Tell me why Sabin stabbed him,\u201d Gwen said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re digging William\u2019s story, then? Fine.\u201d Anya sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll finish it for him. The Lord/Hunter war had just erupted. In ancient Greece, in case you\u2019re wanting a timeline, before those delicious gladiators. Anyway, Hunters, being human, were losing and so they began using women as Bait to draw, trap and slaughter the Lords. They managed to kill Sabin\u2019s BFF, Baden.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s fingers fluttered over her throat. \u201cHe told me.\u201d He must have been more devastated by the loss than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d One of Anya\u2019s eyebrows winged up. \u201cWow. He\u2019s usually so tight-lipped. But why do you look close to tears? You didn\u2019t even know the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s in my eye,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>Lips twitching, Anya said, \u201cSure. Whatever you say. But back to my story. Sabin and the other warriors pounced on the Hunters responsible and destroyed them. Afterward, Sabin wanted to continue the killing spree. The others didn\u2019t. Wait, that\u2019s not true. Half agreed with Sabin, half craved peace. Aeron was going on and on about dropping things, starting a new life away from the Hunter war, blah, blah, blah, so Sabin, in his grief and fury, plunged his dagger into the man\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Aeron retaliate?\u201d Gwen pictured the warrior in her mind. Tall, muscled and heavily tattooed, as William had said. Hair cropped to his scalp, violet eyes stark and gloomy. He seemed cold but quiet. Almost unassuming. Yet she\u2019d seen the way he\u2019d viciously attacked those Hunters.</p><p>Who would win a fight between the two?</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Anya said. \u201cAnd it pissed Sabin off even more. He then went for Aeron\u2019s throat.\u201d</p><p>Was it bad that she was relieved? She didn\u2019t like the thought of Sabin being hurt. Or assaulted.</p><p>\u201cStill want to be his female?\u201d William interjected, sounding almost hopeful. \u201cMy offer is still good. I can make all your naughty dreams come true.\u201d</p><p>If she were Sabin\u2019s, which she wasn\u2019t, yeah, she\u2019d still want to be with him. William was beautiful, didn\u2019t intimidate her like the others, but he also didn\u2019t tempt her in any way. Her eyes craved the sight of rugged, sometimes boyish Sabin. Her ears craved the sound of his hard voice. Her hands itched to touch that sun-kissed skin. Silly girl. He couldn\u2019t have been any clearer about wanting to keep her at a distance.</p><p>What would she do if he changed his mind, though? He was everything she feared and there\u2019d be no controlling him.</p><p>\u201cOh, and just so you know,\u201d William added, grinning wickedly, \u201che\u2019s possessed by the demon of Doubt. So anytime you find yourself battling insecurities, he\u2019s the reason. I, however, will make you feel special and loved. Cherished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d the very voice she\u2019d been dying to hear suddenly proclaimed from behind her. \u201cYou won\u2019t be seeing another morning.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>SABIN KNEW he looked like a monster. Blood coated him like a second skin, his eyes gleamed wildly, feral\u2014they always did after something like this went down\u2014and he smelled like old pennies. He\u2019d meant to shower before approaching Gwen, not wanting to frighten her further. First, though, he\u2019d gone to check on Amun. The man had stopped writhing but had not stopped moaning, still bound to his bed and clutching his head. He must have stolen more secrets than usual. Darker secrets. Usually he\u2019d recovered by now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sabin felt guilty for having asked his friend to fill his head with more chaos, more voices. He soothed himself only with the knowledge that Amun knew what he was doing and wanted to defeat the Hunters as much as Sabin did.When he left, he\u2019d decided to sneak a peek at Gwen and see how she was doing. Had Anya fed her? Frightened her? Learned more about her? The questions had taken residence inside his head and refused to leave, somehow overshadowing his desire to force more information out of the prisoners.</p><p>Except Gwen hadn\u2019t been in his room.</p><p>Furious, he\u2019d begun to hunt. Thinking Paris, who had left the dungeon soon after Sabin appeared, had used Sabin\u2019s distraction to his advantage and seduced her, Sabin had stomped to the warrior\u2019s bedroom, violence brewing inside him. Sabin had claimed Gwen as his. His. No one else would touch her. Not because he was jealous or possessive of her, of course, but because, as he\u2019d already assured himself, he planned to use her as a weapon. Wouldn\u2019t do to have one of the warriors pissing her off. Yes, that\u2019s the only reason his vision had burned bright red and his fists had clenched, his nails elongating into his claws, his muscles gearing for confrontation.</p> <p>Paris hadn\u2019t been in bed with her, however, which had saved his life. He\u2019d been alone, drinking himself into oblivion, practically mainlining ambrosia\u2014drug of choice for the gods.</p><p>Sabin was still shocked by the sight. Paris was the upbeat one, the optimistic, caring one. What the hell had happened to him?</p><p>The misuse of the heavenly substance would have to be dealt with, for an intoxicated warrior was a sloppy warrior. Again, Sabin had meant to act, to knock some sense into the warrior, then speak with Lucien about it. Then he\u2019d heard laughing female voices and had followed the sound, helpless to do anything else, his curiosity simply too great. Yes, curiosity\u2014not desperation to finally see Gwen\u2019s lovely face lit with amusement rather than shadowed by fear and trepidation.</p><p>Now here he stood in the entrance to the entertainment room, gaze darting between her and William, seething with fury, his demon snarling in his head. Doubt might crave Gwen\u2019s destruction, but it wanted to be the one, the only, to deliver it. Wanted to be the only male around her. Everyone else was an interloper and worthy of punishment.</p><p>Let me have the warrior, the demon snarled. He\u2019ll regret his actions. He\u2019ll beg for mercy.</p> <p>Soon. Sabin had just killed a man, violently and cruelly, and should have abhorred the thought of adding another slaying to his ever-increasing list. Besides, Gwen wasn\u2019t ready to witness another violent dispute.</p><p>Gone was her amusement\u2014what had made her laugh?\u2014and in its place was more of that hated trepidation. Was it directed at Sabin? Or William, who had just blatantly propositioned what belonged to Sabin? And to think Sabin had started to like the womanizing bastard, had admired his cheeky wit. Now, not so much.</p><p>\u201cSabin, my man,\u201d the bastard in question said, popping to his feet with an irreverent smile. \u201cWe were just talking about you. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy to see you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and very soon you won\u2019t be saying much at all. Gwen, return to my room.\u201d</p><p>Anya jumped in front of the man, acting as his shield. \u201cNow, Sabin. He didn\u2019t mean any harm. He\u2019s borderline stupid. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Rather than shove her behind him as was honorable, William offered Sabin a cocky, come-get-me-now wave from behind the goddess. \u201cI kind of did mean harm. She\u2019s pretty and it\u2019s been a while for me. Like several hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGwen, go. Now.\u201d Narrowed gaze never leaving the warrior, Sabin withdrew the blade sheathed at the back of his waist and wiped any remaining blood on his pants. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter who you hide behind. You\u2019ve seen your last sunrise.\u201d</p><p>Gwen gasped, snapping out of whatever frozen state the confrontation had inflicted. When Sabin stalked forward, she even held out an arm to stop him. He allowed the action, the feel of her arm against his stomach somehow more erotic than another woman\u2019s mouth on his cock.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Indecision suddenly reigned. Gwen wasn\u2019t going to leave. Too much determination wafted from her. How strongly must this timid little creature feel to stand her ground like this? But did she hope to protect William? Sabin\u2019s desire to punish the warrior intensified exponentially.</p><p>\u201cIf you think about it,\u201d William said in that same amused tone, hands on Anya\u2019s shoulders as if to taunt him, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She\u2019s not yours. Not really.\u201d</p><p>Sabin\u2019s nostrils flared, his muscles jerking in their frenzy to finally attack. Somehow he managed to remain in place. Perhaps because Gwen trembled against him, her fingers spreading over his chest, hot and insistent. \u201cAnd why do you say that?\u201d he found himself demanding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around enough women to know when one has been claimed. Not that that ever stopped me from pursuing them, admittedly. But Gwen is fair game, my man. For me, for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Gwen waved her hands in front of his face. \u201cNothing happened,\u201d she told Sabin imploringly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re upset. You and I aren\u2019t even...we\u2019re not...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d he said, his gaze still on William. \u201cMine to protect.\u201d He would mark her, he decided, put a brand on her so that William and the others understood beyond any doubt that she was now and forever off-limits. \u201cMine to claim.\u201d</p><p>It would mean nothing. He wouldn\u2019t let it. But it had to be done.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d He twined their fingers and turned, pulling her behind him. William laughed. Thankfully, Gwen didn\u2019t protest. Had she, he would have thrown her over his shoulder and carried her fireman style\u2014after stalking back to William and knocking a few teeth loose.</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d he heard Anya growl. A smack sounded, as though she\u2019d slammed her open palm into the back of William\u2019s fat head. \u201cDo you want to be kicked out? Who do you think Lucien will side with if it comes down to you or Sabin, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you,\u201d the warrior said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll side with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, bad example. Don\u2019t forget I\u2019ve got your precious book. Every time you act like this, I\u2019m going to rip out another page!\u201d</p><p>A low growl. \u201cOne day I\u2019m going to...\u201d</p><p>Their voices faded, leaving the echo of Gwen\u2019s shallow breathing and heavy footfalls.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cMy room. Where you should have stayed to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a prisoner, I\u2019m a guest!\u201d she said.</p><p>Up the stairs he climbed, slowing his gait so that she could keep up. Along the way they ran into Reyes and Danika, Maddox and Ashlyn, who were headed toward the kitchen. Both couples tried to stop and talk to him, the smiling females wanting an introduction to Gwen, but he kept moving without a word.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so upset?\u201d Gwen\u2019s fingers tightened around his. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I talk to them? I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>He was proud of her. She recognized the danger he posed right now, but didn\u2019t try to escape and didn\u2019t seem in jeopardy of losing control of her Harpy. \u201cI\u2019m not upset.\u201d I\u2019m enraged!</p><p>\u201cDo you normally threaten to kill men who don\u2019t upset you?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question, one of his own springing to mind and refusing to leave. \u201cDid he touch you?\u201d The words were ruthless, his tone biting. Walking away from the impending fight had been acceptable because he\u2019d thought William had merely used words to try and gain Gwen\u2019s affections. Anything more, and he would turn around as he\u2019d wanted before, grind the bastard into hamburger and feed him to the wild animals roaming the hills.</p><p>\u201cNo. He didn\u2019t. Your nails, they\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Sabin relaxed his grip, willing his nails to sink back into their beds. They snaked a corner, and his pace increased. Urgency rushed through him, as potent and strong as a flooded river.</p><p>\u201cDid he scare you?\u201d This time, the question was merely gruff.</p><p>\u201cAgain, no. And if he had, I\u2014I could have handled him.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched in his first stirring of humor that evening. As if. When she was Gwen, the Harpy dormant, she was the most docile creature he\u2019d ever encountered. It was, at times, endearing. His life was death and dishonor, cruelty and might, yet she was all that was serene and good.</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you have done that?\u201d He didn\u2019t ask to taunt her but to force her to admit she needed a guardian. Him. Here, in this house, even out in the world, she needed him. The day she learned to control her Harpy, of course, that would change. And he was glad. Yep. Glad.</p><p>A little gasp of irritation escaped her and she tried to rip her hand from his. He held tight, strangely unwilling to end the physical connection. \u201cI\u2019m not a total washout, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if you were as strong as Pandora once was. You are desirable, and some of the men here like to believe they are irresistible. I don\u2019t want you dealing with them. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find me...desirable?\u201d</p><p>Had she not heard the warning in his voice? To stay away from the warriors, or else?</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she muttered, his hesitation clearly embarrassing her. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else. Like your home. Yes. Perfect. Your home is lovely.\u201d She was panting now, the long walk likely more exercise than she\u2019d gotten in her year of confinement.</p><p>He gave his surroundings a cursory glance. The stone floor was polished and veined with gold\u2014like her eyes. The end tables were cherrywood\u2014as glossy a red as her hair. The walls were smooth, inlaid with multihued marble and utter perfection\u2014like her skin, even dirty as it was.</p><p>When had he begun to compare everything to her?</p><p>When they hit the landing of the second staircase, his bedroom door entered his line of vision and he breathed a sigh of relief. Almost there...How would she react to what he was about to do? Go Harpy? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d have to tread carefully. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014back down.</p><p>What if he hurts you? the demon was suddenly whispering into her mind. What if he\u2014</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d he snarled, and Doubt laughed gleefully at the damage it had already caused.</p> <p>Gwen tensed. \u201cMust you curse like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He tugged her now reluctant form through the door, shutting and locking it behind her. They faced off. She was pale, trembling again. \u201cBesides, I wasn\u2019t talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We\u2019ve had this conversation before. You were talking to your demon. To Doubt.\u201d</p><p>A statement, not a question. He massaged the back of his neck, wishing his fingers were curled around the goddess of Anarchy\u2019s neck instead. \u201cAnya told you.\u201d He didn\u2019t like that Gwen knew, would have liked for her to have time to get used to him first.</p><p>A shake of her beautiful head. \u201cWilliam did. So the demon wants me to...doubt you?\u201d She twirled the ends of her hair. Another nervous gesture?</p> <p>\u201cIt wants you to doubt everything. Every choice you make, every breath you take. Everyone around you. It can\u2019t help itself. The indecision and confusion of others is where it derives its strength. A moment ago, I could hear it shooting its poisoned barb into your mind, trying to make you believe I\u2019ll hurt you. That\u2019s why I felt the need to curse.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, those silver striations expanding and overshadowing the amber. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing, then. I wondered where the thoughts were coming from.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed as he processed her words. \u201cYou\u2019re able to distinguish its voice from your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Those who knew him often recognized the demon simply by its word choices. But for a virtual stranger to separate him from his demon...How could she tell the difference between them? \u201cNot many can do so,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWow. I actually have a skill most don\u2019t. And an impressive one, at that. Your demon is sneaky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInsidious,\u201d he agreed, surprised that she hadn\u2019t fainted, screamed or demanded to be released from his despicable clutches. She even seemed proud of herself. \u201cIt senses weakness and pounces.\u201d</p><p>Her expression became pensive. Then depressed. Then angry. She\u2019d discovered the hidden meaning to his words: she was weak and the demon knew it. He preferred her pride.</p><p>His gaze snagged on the tray resting on his dresser. An empty tray. He nearly grinned. Anya had gotten her to eat, thank the gods. No wonder her color was higher, her cheeks sweetly fuller. What else was different about her? he mused, studying her. At her waist, there were several slight bulges\u2014but those, he was sure, weren\u2019t the result of her recent meal.</p><p>A quick scan of the room revealed his weapons case was three inches to the right of its normal mark. She must have disabled the lock and pilfered the contents. The little thief, he thought, eyeing her again.</p><p>She squirmed under the scrutiny, cheeks pinkening. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking.\u201d Let her keep them, he decided. Hopefully, they made her feel safer. And the safer she felt, the less likely it was that he\u2019d have a confrontation with the Harpy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous,\u201d she admitted. She rubbed her palms on the front of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s speed things along and assuage your fears.\u201d Gods, she was lovely. \u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth fell open on a strangled gasp. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Strip.\u201d</p><p>One step, two, she backed away from him, holding her hands up and out. \u201cNot just no but hell, no.\u201d Her knees hit the back of the bed and she fell onto the mattress, gaping up at him in horror. \u201cI fell! That was an accident, not an invitation,\u201d she rushed out, popping to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI know. The hell, no gave you away. But it doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re going to shower.\u201d She needed to clean up and he needed to mark her. They could knock out both objectives at the same time.</p><p>\u201cFeel free.\u201d Her voice trembled. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether. And that\u2019s not an invitation, either. It\u2019s a fact.\u201d He reached behind him and dragged his shirt over his head. His favorite necklace, a gift from Baden, bounced against his chest as the material pooled at his feet.</p><p>\u201cPut that back on!\u201d she said, her gaze locking on his butterfly tattoo. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you.\u201d Her pupils dilated, belying her words.</p><p>Good. She was intrigued, if panicked. He toed off one boot, then the other. They landed with echoing thumps. He unsnapped his pants and shoved them to his ankles. \u201cThis is going to happen whether you agree or not, Gwendolyn.\u201d</p><p>She gave a violent shake of her head, those strawberry curls flying. Still her gaze remained on him. Between his legs now. Her breath emerged faster, raspier. \u201cYou said you meant me no harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing menacing about a shower. It\u2019s...cleansing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>He stepped out of the fatigues, now totally and completely naked. And yeah, he had an erection. He willed it away, if only to relax her, but the stupid thing refused to obey, remaining long and hard and thick.</p><p>She swiped her tongue over her lips, a telling reaction, like a neon sign that read I Want Some of That. Her borrowed T-shirt was baggy but he could see that her nipples were hard. Another tell.</p><p>After the way she\u2019d kissed him on the plane, he\u2019d suspected she desired him. Now, he knew for certain. She did. And he was glad. It was foolish, wrong, and could only hurt them both in the end, but he couldn\u2019t make himself care just then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fuck you,\u201d he said, purposely being crude. Anything to snap her out of the staring contest she had going with Little Sab.</p><p>It worked. Amber met brown in a heated clash. \u201cWh-why not sex? And what are you going to do to me?\u201d</p><p>Kiss you. Touch you. Give you a hickey\u2014and an orgasm that will make you scream the roof down. No way William could question his claim on the girl after that. The lack of sex, well...Sabin\u2019s control would snap and his demon would have free rein if he allowed himself to experience too much pleasure. So he\u2019d do what he could: a little petting for him, a lot of petting for her.</p><p>Sure you have what it takes to please one such as her? Pretty as she is, she\u2019s probably had scores of men. They\u2019ve probably done things to her you\u2019ve only dreamed about.</p><p>His jaw clenched. Old as he was, he didn\u2019t have a tremendous amount of experience with women. While living in the heavens, he\u2019d been too busy defending the gods to pursue his own pleasures. When first cast to earth, he\u2019d been too evil, too crazed to want anything besides destruction. And once he\u2019d gained a measure of control over the wickedness inside him, he\u2019d quickly learned how bad he was for the opposite sex.</p><p>A few times, though, he\u2019d considered himself in love and had chased the women shamelessly. Single, married, it hadn\u2019t mattered. He supposed he and William had that in common. If he\u2019d wanted them, he\u2019d gone after them because the want had been such a rare thing.</p><p>Darla was the most recent\u2014and devastating\u2014example of his destructive impact. She had been married to a Hunter, Galen\u2019s right-hand man. She\u2019d come to Sabin with information, knowledge of where her husband and men kept their weapons, what they were planning. She\u2019d seen the hypocrisy of the Hunter code, she\u2019d said, and had wanted the war to end. At first, Sabin had thought she meant to act as Bait. To lure him and his men into a trap. But she hadn\u2019t. Everything she\u2019d told him had been accurate.</p><p>They\u2019d soon become lovers. He\u2019d wanted her to leave her husband, but she had refused because she would have been unable to help Sabin. He hated to admit this, but part of him had been glad about her decision. He hadn\u2019t lost his mole. But every time she\u2019d visited him, every time he\u2019d taken her to bed, she\u2019d left with a little less sparkle. All too soon, she\u2019d become clingy, needy, desperate for a kind word. He\u2019d tried, gods had he tried, to boost her confidence back up, telling her how beautiful and brave and intelligent she was. She had, of course, doubted him, so in the end it hadn\u2019t mattered.</p><p>She\u2019d called him after slashing her wrists.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t gotten to her in time. No, Stefano beat him there and kept Sabin from seeing her one last time. He hadn\u2019t even been able to attend her funeral, not wanting Hunters to catch sight of him.</p><p>Eleven years had passed since her death, but his guilt was as fresh and clear as if it had happened yesterday. He should have left her alone. If he had, Stefano might have grown tired of the chase and the battles and bowed out. Instead, fueled now by vengeance as much as fanaticism, the Hunter was as savagely determined to win as Sabin.</p><p>Sabin hadn\u2019t been with anyone since, avoiding female companionship entirely. Until Gwen. Could she handle him, though? Even a little?</p><p>\u201cW-well?\u201d she stammered. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He forced the demon\u2019s worries from his mind. \u201cI\u2019m going to clean you.\u201d</p><p>Again she shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be clean. I swear I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said, and advanced.</p><p>Panting, she fell back onto the bed once more and scrambled backward, not stopping until her shoulders hit the headboard. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this, Sabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. You\u2019re just afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. What if I kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve handled Hunters for thousands of years. What\u2019s a lone Harpy?\u201d Brave words, but he couldn\u2019t admit the whole truth. That he didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do, how he\u2019d react or what would happen if they were forced to fight each other. But he was willing to risk her wrath to see this done.</p><p>White-hot desire pushed itself into her eyes, lighting them up. \u201cYou truly think you can defeat a Harpy in attack mode?\u201d</p><p>Up he climbed on the bed, closing more and more of the hated distance between them. \u201cHopefully, it won\u2019t come to that. If it does, well, we\u2019ll find out together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s not good enough.\u201d Her foot slammed into his chest, but rather than shove him away, the action sealed her fate. His fingers twined around her ankle and jerked her closer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never know unless we try.\u201d</p><p>Then a tear escaped the corner of her eye and slid the length of her cheek, and his chest constricted. \u201cPlease,\u201d she rasped brokenly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t back down. \u201cLike I said, there\u2019s only one way to prove to you that I can handle anything you throw at me.\u201d He hardened his heart against her tears; he had to. For her, for him, for peace inside this fortress, this had to be done. She had to be marked. Wanted to be marked, whether or not she admitted it. And like the warrior he was, he would see it through to the end. No matter what.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>GWEN COULDN\u2019T BELIEVE IT. Sabin, the man she\u2019d kissed, fantasized about, craved, relied on, viewed as a protector, a villain, the man she didn\u2019t want to desire but desired anyway, had stripped her despite her shouted protests and wild kicking and hauled her ass into the shower stall before climbing in behind her. Pissed as she\u2019d been\u2014was, damn it\u2014she hadn\u2019t turned Harpy.</p><p>At first, she\u2019d been shocked. Then nervous. Then excited. Each emotion had lasted only a few minutes, but each had been world-shaking. Why hadn\u2019t she hurt him? Because Sabin had yet to make a threatening move? Because the Harpy loved physical contact as much as Gwen did and would take it wherever and however she could get it?Right now steam enveloped her and Sabin, thick as clouds. Hot water cascaded down the planes and curves of her body. Nothing had ever felt so amazing\u2014except for the naked man behind her, pinning her in, keeping her inside. She would not hook up with a demon, no matter how sexy he was. Would she? Her life didn\u2019t need more weird. Did it?</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she make a decision? His demon wasn\u2019t even pestering her, so she had no excuse.</p> <p>Gwen wrapped her arms around her middle, not bothering to cover her breasts or the tiny triangle of hair between her legs. Why bother? Sabin was stronger and could pry her hands away in an instant if he so desired\u2014and part of her wanted him to see her, to crave her. Still...</p><p>\u201cDo you not realize you could have morning after regrets in the form of shredded skin and organs?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Soapy hands settled on her shoulders, hot and wet, massaging. \u201cYou feel like silk. I doubt I\u2019ll be regretting anything.\u201d His voice was husky, rich...drugging.</p><p>Mmm, more. Her muscles loosened, her head lolling back and propping against the hollow of his neck. Stop. Tense up! Fight his allure. She tried, she really did, but her body refused to obey her mind. His ministrations simply felt too damn good.</p><p>I wonder if he finds you attractive. Or ugly.</p><p>Okay. Finally, she tensed. There was that beguiling, destructive voice. The demon, Doubt. So different in tenor from her own inner voice. Her jaw clenched painfully, and the Harpy squawked at the unwelcome intrusion. \u201cAny way you can cap your friend? He\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuch spirit. I like it. And the demon is hardly my friend.\u201d Sabin\u2019s thumbs traced her collarbone. He leaned down, his mouth at her ear, his breath a beautiful caress. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to change the subject, but have I told you yet that I find you utterly lovely?\u201d</p><p>Gwen gulped, unsure of how to reply. Part of her still wanted to encourage him and part of her still wanted to shove him away before she forgot exactly why she had to resist him. He represented everything she hated about her life. Darkness, violence, chaos. More than that, he planned to use her to hurt his enemy. Nothing came before his hatred of the Hunters, not even the love of a woman.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to it, shall we?\u201d Sabin released her, and she had to press her lips together to cut off a whimper. Then those sensual fingers tangled in her hair, working in shampoo, the scent of lemon dancing from them. Her eyes closed in ecstasy. No wonder he always smelled so edible.</p><p>\u201cYou go Harpy when you\u2019re scared. What about when you\u2019re aroused? Or climaxing?\u201d</p><p>Such a blunt and personal question. But he\u2019d picked the perfect time to ask. As they were currently naked, she didn\u2019t mind answering. \u201cS-sometimes she tries to make herself known. I try to be careful, though, and stop her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to stop her with me.\u201d Before she could respond, he changed the subject again. \u201cWilliam told you about my demon.\u201d He shifted his hips, his erection brushing the curve of her spine. An accident? \u201cDid Anya tell you about my past?\u201d</p><p>A shiver stole through Gwen. \u201cDo you mean, did she tell me that you stabbed your friend in the back? No. She left that part out.\u201d</p><p>His nails dug deeply in her scalp, and she gasped. Immediately he released her with a muttered, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>Damn it. Her sarcastic tongue kept creeping out at the worst times. Soon someone (cough Sabin cough) was going to take exception and try and cut it out. And really, suppressing that side of her nature shouldn\u2019t be hard. She\u2019d been doing it her entire life. For the first time, however, there was a spark of resentment in her chest. If she weren\u2019t such a coward crybaby, she wouldn\u2019t fear people\u2019s reactions, wouldn\u2019t fear her own response and could just be herself.</p><p>Herself. Did she even know who that was anymore?</p><p>\u201cDuck your head under the water,\u201d Sabin said suddenly, gruffly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to obey, but cupped the back of her neck and shoved her under the hot stream. Sudsy droplets sprayed into her mouth, and she sputtered.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes or they\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw, ow, ow!\u201d She squeezed her eyelids tightly closed.</p><p>\u201cBurn,\u201d he finished with a laugh.</p><p>Gwen rubbed her eyes, perturbed despite herself by his casual attitude about all this. He\u2019d been so jealous about William\u2014at least, that was the only emotion that had made any sense. And his gaze had scorched her as he\u2019d stripped her, promising incomparable pleasure.</p><p>So why wasn\u2019t he copping a feel?</p><p>Motions clipped, businesslike, he soaped her from neck to toes. His palms glided over her breasts and hardened nipples without pause, then delved between her legs. Though his touch was somehow detached, he still managed to leave her trembling and achy, breathless and needy.</p><p>\u201cI can clean myself,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou had the chance yesterday and the day before that. Hell, you had the chance this morning. You didn\u2019t take it.\u201d He shifted, his erection brushing her once again. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>Her blood heated as she pressed her lips together. No reason to tell him what he wanted to know. He would deduce the answer on his own any moment now. And, to be honest, she was almost excited to witness his reaction. Already he\u2019d admitted he found her lovely. What would he think of her without the mask of grime? Would he finally make a freaking move?</p><p>When he finished cleaning and rinsing her, he stilled. His breath seemed to catch in his throat, and she felt a swirling heat seep into her, spreading, intensifying. Here it was, his reaction. He\u2019d noticed. \u201cYour skin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should have tried harder.\u201d He spun her around, gaze perusing her swiftly, then more leisurely.</p><p>Seeing him, she realized just how wrong she\u2019d been. There was nothing casual about him. His eyes were bright, hot as fire, his lips pulled back over his teeth, thin lines of strain bracketing his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYour skin...\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need a mirror to know that without the grime, she glowed. There was a translucent sheen to her that made her look like a freshly polished opal.</p><p>Tentatively, as though in a trance, Sabin reached out. His fingertip traced her jawline, dipped to her neck, between her breasts. She didn\u2019t back away. No, she stepped forward. Closer. Craving more. Unable to stop. Goose bumps broke out, and all thoughts of resisting him vanished.</p><p>\u201cSmooth and warm and luminous,\u201d he whispered reverently. \u201cWhy do you hide\u2014\u201d His teeth pressed together and the reverence mutated into anger before her eyes. \u201cMen can\u2019t keep their hands off you, can they?\u201d</p><p>A lump formed in her throat, preventing her from replying. She shook her head. What would Sabin do and say next? He changed moods faster than anyone she\u2019d ever met. Touch me.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t done with his line of questioning. \u201cDo your sisters have skin like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll Harpies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hopefully he was finished now.</p><p>\u201cHave you called them?\u201d</p><p>Nope. Not done. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do it the moment we leave this shower. I want them here, in this fortress, within the week.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him, shocked to her core. She was naked, her skin at its most alluring, and he wanted to speak of her sisters? To meet them? Why did he\u2014the answer slid into place and her shock faded. Of course he wanted them here. He probably thought they\u2019d help him with his war. Or maybe he wanted a harem of Harpies.</p><p>Something dark and powerful bloomed in Gwen\u2019s chest. Something poisonous. It caused her nails to elongate, the Harpy to screech and her teeth to sharpen. Red spotted her vision.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d He blinked in confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d I will kill you if you try and bed them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gripping me so tightly, my palm is bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Part of her registered that he didn\u2019t sound upset or frightened. The rest of her was still too furious to admire his courage under fire.</p><p>\u201cYou want to sleep with my sisters,\u201d she snarled. Snarled? Her, Gwendolyn the Timid?</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cNo, I want my friends to sleep with them.\u201d</p><p>She blinked just as he had done, not under...standing. Oh. Oh. All of her fury drained as swiftly as her shock had, leaving the sweetest sense of pleasure. If his friends were occupied with her sisters, they would leave Gwen alone. Was Sabin that possessive of her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWere you jealous?\u201d he asked, as though the prospect intrigued him.</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d That was not information he needed, could be used against her, and in this instance a lie would absolutely serve her better than the truth. \u201cI was...thinking of Tyson, wishing I was with him.\u201d</p><p>Sabin\u2019s eyes narrowed, but through the thick shield of his lashes she could see the brown irises edging with crimson. \u201cYou will not think of him. Do you understand? I forbid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014okay.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what else to say. Never had Sabin looked more capable of murder. But why wasn\u2019t she scared?</p> <p>However feeble her response, it seemed to pacify him. \u201cI\u2019d already decided to mark you.\u201d There was determination in his tone. Determination so cold and hard she doubted a blade could cut through it. \u201cBut this...\u201d His gaze swept over her body. \u201cBy gods, I\u2019ll mark you every day if I have to. You will only ever think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what do you mean, mark me?\u201d Mark, as in slash? Punish? Now she had no problem backing away. And what did he mean, every day? How much did he expect her to endure?</p><p>His hand whipped out, fingers curling around her wrist and dragging her back. \u201cI\u2019m going to sink my teeth into that pretty skin, gently, but enough to leave an imprint.\u201d</p><p>Once again her fear drained, leaving only white-hot thrums of wicked bliss. It had been so long. So long since a man had held her, made her feel cherished and special and hot enough to writhe against him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want that?\u201d he asked softly.</p> <p>Did she? Hell, yes. She might not know who she was anymore, but she did know her body hungered for this male. Could she allow it, though?</p><p>Time to find the logic. Sabin was strong, immortal and claimed he could handle anything she dished. She was strong enough to enjoy him and stay distanced. She hoped. The \u201cmarking\u201d would keep the other warriors away from her. And it was nice to feed the Harpy what it wanted once in a while so that it, in turn, would behave.</p><p>Logic achieved.</p><p>Before she could form an answer, however, Sabin\u2019s nostrils flared as if he could already smell her desire. \u201cIf anyone else touches you, they\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>He was willing to hurt his friends for her? Lord, just the thought melted her.</p><p>Slowly, he tugged her forward, not stopping until her nipples brushed the strength of his chest. He moaned.</p> <p>\u201cYour demon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be kept on a tight leash, so no worries. Now. Choose.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to think about it anymore. \u201cYes,\u201d she said breathlessly. Gulping, she reached up, twined her arms around his neck, pressing her wet body against his. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, either. I\u2019ll be careful with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d He swooped in, his mouth taking possession of hers. It was not the soft, one-sided kiss from the plane. This was consuming, raw, his tongue plunging inside, participating, deep and hard and demanding a response. She gave it to him, helpless to do otherwise. One hand tangled in the dark silk of his hair, the other kneaded his back, probably leaving marks of her own.</p><p>Don\u2019t lose yourself completely. The warning blasted through her mind. Enjoy, but stay focused. The Harpy was purring, happy with what was happening, wanting more, more, more. But when Gwen commanded her breathing to slow, her body to still, to accept Sabin\u2019s touch, to enjoy but nothing more, those purrs turned to growls. More, more, more.</p><p>Sabin gripped her chin and angled her head, prying her mouth open even wider, refusing to allow her to withdraw, even slightly. Their teeth banged together with the force of his next thrust. Though she groaned, he didn\u2019t pull back. Didn\u2019t soften. On and on the kiss continued, until she was breathless, shaking, arching into him, moaning, groaning again, ready to beg for more just like the Harpy.</p><p>For the second\u2014third?\u2014time she tried to distance herself, to calm her body so that she didn\u2019t fall too deeply under his spell.</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t. Stay with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill only feel. No thinking. That\u2019s for later.\u201d Slowly he backed her into the tiled wall, and the coldness made her gasp. He swallowed the sound, his mouth already on her again, taking everything she had to give and demanding more. Behind them, the shower continued to rain, battering against the porcelain.</p><p>With one hand he corralled both her wrists and pinned them above her head. With the other he cupped her breast, rolling the nipple between his knuckles. Her stomach quivered, her knees weakened. She would have fallen, but he jammed his thigh between her legs, holding her up. Except, the core of her rubbed against the rough skin of his knee and that weakened her further.</p><p>\u201cYou like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No reason to lie now. She couldn\u2019t hide her body\u2019s reaction.</p><p>Down, down his fingers traced, swirling around her navel. Back and forth she rocked against his leg, little breathless moans escaping her lips. More. More. More! The Harpy\u2019s cries blended with her own, until they were a single voice inside her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bite you now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to accept or deny, sinking his teeth into the tender cord at the base of her neck. At the same time, he removed his thigh from between her legs and replaced it with his hand. Two fingers plunged inside her, deep, so wonderfully deep.</p><p>\u201cSabin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, darling. You\u2019re hot. Tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to...I can\u2019t...I shouldn\u2019t...\u201d So close already. From just two fingers, pumping and grinding inside her.</p><p>\u201cLet yourself go. I won\u2019t let anything bad happen. Swear.\u201d</p><p>What if she\u2014what if the Harpy\u2014damn it! Her thoughts were fragmenting, her mind focusing only on the pleasure of having those thick fingers working her.</p><p>\u201cCome for me.\u201d His thumb brushed her clitoris, and there was no more fighting it. She climaxed, screaming, pumping against him, then biting him back until she tasted blood.</p><p>As she spasmed, he released her hands and grabbed onto her hips, forcing them forward, ramming her into his erection. No penetration, just friction, but damn, it was good. She sank her nails into his back, digging deep, cutting.</p><p>He hissed through his teeth, repeated the action of jamming her against him, and hissed again. She loved the sound. Needed to hear it again. And again. Soon she was moving on her own, meeting him halfway, pounding against him with all of her strength, sharp teeth back in his flesh, beads of blood coating her tongue.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way,\u201d he praised. \u201cJust like that. You feel so good, so damned good.\u201d He was babbling. To remind her of where she was, who she was with? \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let things go this far. Not for me. But I\u2019m going to explode. I know it. Shouldn\u2019t be this good. Shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then he was kissing her again, his tongue plunging, hot seed spurting onto her stomach, his body quaking and hers erupting again just from the thought of his pleasure. They clung to each other, panting, moaning.</p><p>Finally she collapsed against him, amazed that she\u2019d lost control. Amazed that they hadn\u2019t had sex, yet this little shower had been world-shaking. Amazed that the Harpy hadn\u2019t turned vicious. Amazed that the Harpy only wanted more. Most of all, she was amazed that, even though she\u2019d just experienced two intense orgasms, she, too, still wanted more.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>SABIN CARRIED GWEN to the large bed in his room and snuggled her against him. Neither of them said a word as they watched the night sky give way to dawn through the room\u2019s only window. They lay there, naked, intertwined, each stiff and strained and lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to sleeping on the floor?\u201d Gwen finally asked him, breaking the silence.\u201cI never actually fell asleep. Technically I didn\u2019t break my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>After that, silence enveloped them again. But again, neither slumbered.</p><p>He\u2019d expected her to drift easily; there were bruises under her eyes, more prominent than ever, and he\u2019d seen her yawn earlier. But once again, she surprised him. She pretended to sink into oblivion once or twice, but she never actually fell.</p><p>He knew why he couldn\u2019t relax: his demon was crazed inside his mind, more desperate than ever to reach her, to hurt her. To make her question everything that had happened between them. Just as it had done to all the others before her. Women who had either left him or killed themselves.</p><p>I should leave before something like that happens. The moment he thought it, denial roared through him, sharp and cutting, as if it had teeth, and all the reasons he should stay popped into his head. One, Paris could come looking for him and stumble upon her, then seduce her. Promiscuity just couldn\u2019t help himself. Two, a Hunter could escape from the dungeon, grab her and bolt. Three, she could begin to regret what they\u2019d done in the shower and bolt on her own.</p><p>All excellent reasons. But they weren\u2019t the reason he ended up settling more deeply into the feathered mattress. Gwen felt too soft and warm against him, smelled too delicious, like lemons, his favorite, and kept uttering wanton little sighs he yearned to swallow.</p><p>Already he wanted her again. Wanted all of her this time. Wanted to sink in and out of her, pounding softly, then hard and harsh, a never-ending rhythm that would bind them together. No woman had ever aroused him so thoroughly, tasted so sublime, fit his body so perfectly. And none had ever clutched him with such abandon, bit him, drawn blood and had him panting for more.</p><p>Even though he hadn\u2019t sealed the deal, they\u2019d both found release. He\u2019d suspected once would never be enough, and he\u2019d been right.</p><p>Hearing her cries in his ears had been sweeter than pumping inside another woman. And that skin...it was like a drug for the eyes. One glance, and you had to have another, and another. Looking away was painful, the desire to look again a constant urge.</p><p>She probably hates you now, probably wants nothing to do with you. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she thought about her human boyfriend while you kissed her and that\u2019s why she was so passionate. Didn\u2019t she tell you he was in her thoughts? Clearly the human is everything she wants for her life. You are not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sabin\u2019s arm tightened around Gwen, squeezing, and she expelled a pained puff of air. Instantly he forced his grip to loosen, and placed a block on his mind to silence his demon. There\u2019d been no thoughts of the ex-boyfriend, emphasis on ex; he was sure of it, and neither Doubt nor Gwen\u2019s own earlier words would convince him otherwise. It had been Sabin\u2019s name Gwen had called. Doubt was surly, that was all, and lashing out at him, desperate for a target. At least, like him, Gwen could distinguish the demon from her own insecurities.</p><p>\u201cCan we stop pretending to relax like happy lovers now?\u201d Gwen asked suddenly, once again cutting through the quiet.</p><p>He sighed, dislodging several strands of her hair and causing them to dance over his chest, tickling the skin. If only they were happy lovers. No demon, no Harpy, no war, just two people enjoying their time together.</p> <p>Sabin blinked, the thought completely foreign to him. Never, in all his thousands of years, had he wished to be anything other than what he was. An immortal warrior. Powerful, extraordinary, eternal. Yes, he\u2019d made a mistake, helping the other Lords steal and open Pandora\u2019s box. And yes, he\u2019d been kicked from the heavens and suffered constantly because of the demon inside him. But it was a suffering he accepted and deserved. A suffering he willingly endured because it made him stronger than he\u2019d ever been while serving Zeus. So why wish otherwise now?</p><p>\u201cYes, we can stop pretending. We can even talk. And by talk, of course I mean I\u2019ll ask the questions and you\u2019ll answer them. Let\u2019s begin now, shall we? You never sleep. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy baggage,\u201d she muttered. \u201cFor your information, I don\u2019t need to sleep.\u201d In a fluid move she must have been waiting hours to perform, she rolled to her back so that only their shoulders touched. He\u2019d noticed that usually she wanted all the contact she could get. What had changed?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, he supposed. After Darla, he\u2019d promised himself he\u2019d always keep his distance from the females he found himself attracted to. For eleven years, he had. Now Gwen was helping him with that. There was a definite spark of irritation in his chest at the thought that she had been the one to get them back on track.</p><p>\u201cYou refused to eat though you were hungry. You refused to shower though you were dirty. Not for one moment do I believe your body\u2014\u201d your luscious body \u201c\u2014needs no rest.\u201d</p> <p>Is he saying that because you resemble the walking dead? Because you appear tired, worn out, haggard?</p><p>Sabin heard the degrading thought leave him and drift to Gwen, unable to stop it.</p><p>A moment later, she stiffened. \u201cYour demon is a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And you had better shut up, you rotten piece of shit. You\u2019ve already been warned. Remember the box?</p><p>There was a heavy pause, then an aggravated growl of acceptance.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she gasped out. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p> <p>Resemble the walking dead? Hardly. \u201cYou are the loveliest woman I\u2019ve ever beheld.\u201d Truth. And it didn\u2019t even bother him that he sounded like Lucien when the warrior spouted pretty nonsense to Anya. Nonsense Sabin had always rolled his eyes at.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Gwen shifted to her side, peering over at him and tucking her hand under her cheek. \u201cYou have to say I\u2019m pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because I\u2019m a gentleman,\u201d he said dryly. He, too, shifted to his side so that he could meet her gaze. Those exotic curls framed her face and delicate shoulders, her dazzling skin catching the red hue and making her look deliciously flushed. \u201cYou think it can be said that I\u2019m always polite, never want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings and spout sweet lies because I like the people around me to be docile? Oh, and if I do accidentally insult someone, because I\u2019d never do it on purpose, I absolutely refuse to take what I want from them by force?\u201d</p><p>Lush lips twitched into a half smile\u2014lips he\u2019d kissed, sucked and nibbled\u2014and her eyes swirled hypnotically. Eyes he\u2019d nearly drowned in. Seeing that smile Sabin experienced an instant, unwanted hard-on, immensely grateful for the sheet that covered his lower half. And he was supposed to be the dangerous one in this relationship, he mused darkly.</p><p>Not a relationship, self-preservation piped up. He wouldn\u2019t let it be anything more than a business transaction. He would convince her to fight for him, protect her from his friends while she did so, and when the war was at last over he would stop thinking about her, stop lusting for her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s feelings, but you do want my help. You\u2019re trying to butter me up like toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll agree to fight the Hunters whether I butter you up or not,\u201d he said, striving for a confident tone. It was a confidence he didn\u2019t feel, but had to believe in. He could accept no less. \u201cNeed I remind you that you\u2019ve already promised to help?\u201d</p><p>Tired of lying dormant, Doubt pounced. She nearly faints at the sight of blood. Help you fight? I think not!</p> <p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he reiterated for the demon, for himself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind helping you with the clerical aspects of your campaign. Like researching on the Internet and filing paperwork. If you keep records of your, uh, kills, I could be in charge of that. I could even research those artifacts you\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s what I did before I was abducted. I worked in an office, taking notes, fact-checking, that sort of thing. And I was damn good at it.\u201d</p><p>Never had he heard more pride in someone\u2019s tone. But was she proud of her work or her ability to fit into the normal world?</p><p>\u201cAnd you liked this work?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t bored?\u201d The real question was, how had her Harpy handled the monotony? Sabin considered Gwen\u2019s dark side very much like his own, a driving force, a curse, a sickness, but a part of her that craved excitement and danger. A part of her that grew twitchy if ignored for too long.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe a little,\u201d she admitted, twirling a strand of hair around her finger.</p><p>He almost laughed. He\u2019d place money on the fact that she\u2019d been bored out of her freaking mind. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you for your aid,\u201d he said, recalling Anya\u2019s words about the Harpies\u2019 need to steal or earn their food. He wanted her in the field, fighting, but wouldn\u2019t mind using her for research, as well. At least at first. \u201cName what you want and it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Several minutes passed in silence before she said, \u201cI\u2019m drawing a blank. I\u2019ll have to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Knowing how badly he craved victory, she could have asked him for anything, the moon and the stars even. Yet she couldn\u2019t think of a single thing. Odd. Most people would toss out an astronomical sum and bargain from there. He wondered what sort of thing was prized among her people. Money? Jewels? \u201cWhat do your sisters do for a living?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together in a thin line.</p><p>What was this? She didn\u2019t want to tell him or she didn\u2019t like what they did? \u201cHookers?\u201d he guessed, not just to get a rise out of her but also to test how far he could push her before the Harpy began demanding his head on a platter.</p><p>She gasped, slapped him, then jerked her hand back quickly, as if she couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d done such a thing. Afraid he\u2019d retaliate for such a puny action? Silly girl.</p><p>\u201cYou deserved to be hit, so I won\u2019t apologize. They aren\u2019t hookers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKillers?\u201d</p><p>No gasp. No slap. A simple narrowing of her eyes, lashes fusing together. Bingo.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re mercenaries.\u201d Not a question. What amazing luck.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said through gritted teeth. \u201cThey are.\u201d</p><p>Sabin wanted to laugh. If one Harpy could destroy an entire army, what could four do? He could pay for their services. He had the money, no matter their price.</p><p>\u201cI see the wheels turning in your head.\u201d Her free hand drummed the pillow cushioning her own head. \u201cBut you should know that they love me and won\u2019t take a job if I ask them to turn it down.\u201d</p><p>Now his eyes narrowed, probing. She wore an innocent expression, if edged with tendrils of anger. \u201cIs that a threat, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it however you wish. I don\u2019t want them fighting those despicable Hunters for any reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Like you said, they\u2019re despicable. Evil. They would have found a way to drug you into a stupor, rape you and steal your baby if I hadn\u2019t saved you. You should be begging your sisters to fight them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already tortured them for what they did to me and the others.\u201d The words rasped from her.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s enough for you? When someone hurts me, I want to be the one to hurt them back. I want to make sure it\u2019s done right. Didn\u2019t you feel some satisfaction when you tore the throat out of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay. Yes. But allowing someone else to do it has to be enough. Otherwise I\u2019ll spend my life hunting them, killing them, never really living.\u201d Her nostrils were flared, her chest heaving. With every inhalation, the sheet slipped and revealed the top of a pink nipple. He had to force himself to look away before he ended their conversation.</p><p>Was she saying his life was empty? Well, it wasn\u2019t. It was full, damn it. \u201cBetter to live a life of hunting and killing than to bury yourself in fear.\u201d</p><p>She raised her palm as if she meant to strike him once more. She was shaking, the muted anger she\u2019d radiated before now a red-hot fury. He\u2019d finally pushed her hard enough. The Harpy was there, in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he told her. It would be good for her. Show her that she could lash out and he wouldn\u2019t break. He hoped.</p><p>Slowly her hand lowered; the shaking ceased. With a deep breath, her eyes returned to normal. \u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you? Like me to be like you? Well, it\u2019s not going to happen. No one would survive if it did. No one. Not even my sisters.\u201d</p><p>He caught the hidden meaning and arched a brow. \u201cFought them and hurt them, have you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A reluctant nod. \u201cI was just a child and they were merely playing with me, taunting me as sisters do. I erupted and tore them up pretty badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said they were stronger than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. They can control who they kill, even while fully Harpy. That is true strength.\u201d</p> <p>He thought about it a moment, tangling a hand back and forth through his hair. \u201cI bet I could take your Harpy. I mean, like your sisters, I\u2019m immortal and heal quickly.\u201d Yeah, he remembered what she\u2019d done to the Hunter and yeah, he remembered how swiftly she\u2019d moved. But why had he counted himself out before, even for a moment? He had brute force, thousands of years of experience and a determination matched by few. As long as she didn\u2019t take his head, he\u2019d recover.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d She must not have realized what she\u2019d said until a few seconds later because she froze as the words echoed off the walls.</p><p>\u201cNothing you say will provoke me enough to hurt you,\u201d he told her, torn between tenderness and exasperation.</p><p>Gradually she relaxed, but the tension between them remained.</p><p>\u201cDo you regret what happened in the shower?\u201d he asked, in part to turn the conversation in another direction and in part, well, because his curiosity demanded to be assuaged. She\u2019d just made it very clear that she didn\u2019t like what he was or what he did.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, cheeks heating.</p><p>No hesitation from her, and that seriously irritated him. \u201cWhy? You liked every moment of it.\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>His hands curled into fists, the bones suddenly brittle. That damn Doubt. But he feared that for once the insecurity was his own, not the demon spreading its poison.</p><p>Her gaze skittered away from him. \u201cIt was okay, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw. It was okay. She guessed. She fucking guessed. By gods, he\u2019d give her another demonstration. He\u2019d kiss her, every inch of her this time, just the way he wanted. He\u2019d dance his tongue between her legs, bite her, finger her, make her beg for his cock and then, only then, would he give it to her. He\u2019d flip her to her stomach, grip her hips and\u2014</p> <p>Make love to her if he continued down this path. Mistake, mistake, mistake. Worth it, though, he thought next. There\u2019d be no stopping him, and she\u2019d love every minute of it. He\u2019d pump inside her, spill his seed, deep and hot, and\u2014</p><p>Again hear her tell you it was okay. She guessed. Doubt laughed, and in that moment the demon actually respected her.</p><p>\u201cIt was more than okay, but we\u2019ll table that discussion until later.\u201d Sabin hopped from the bed, unabashed as the sheet fell away, leaving him bared to her gaze. Suddenly shy, she slapped a hand over her eyes. But if he wasn\u2019t mistaken, she was peeking through her fingers. He could feel the heat of those eyes, the smoldering desire.</p><p>He stalked to the closet. After weaponing up as was his custom\u2014if fifteen blades strapped to his ankles, wrists, waist and back was being too careful, then give him the Too Careful award\u2014he tugged on a pair of jeans and an I\u2019ll See You in the Afterlife T-shirt.</p><p>He grabbed a pair of sweatpants and a plain white tee and tossed them at Gwen. \u201cGet up, get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She sat up, hair tumbling around her, and gathered the clothing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to call your sisters.\u201d Time to get that little chore over with. \u201cAnya told me a bit about your culture, and if you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll try and harm you for allowing yourself to be captured, don\u2019t be. I won\u2019t let them.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her time to respond. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done with the call, we\u2019re going downstairs to eat. And you will eat, Gwen. That\u2019s an order.\u201d There\u2019d be none of that only eating what she stole nonsense. He might have considered leaving things lying around so she\u2019d feel like she\u2019d stolen them, but he wasn\u2019t in the mood to placate her now.</p><p>\u201cAfter that,\u201d he continued, \u201cI need to call all the men together for a meeting, tell them what I\u2019ve learned about the Hunters. You\u2019ll sit in on that, too. Because you\u2019re part of this now.\u201d</p> <p>Her chin rose stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m not one of your men to order around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were one of my men, I\u2019d be ashamed of my thoughts right now.\u201d His gaze lowered, lingering on her breasts, her stomach...between her legs. He spun on his heel before he could do what he really wanted and stalk to her, cover her and penetrate her. \u201cNow hurry up.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, then a swoosh of material, a bounce of the bed, a sigh. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready.\u201d She sounded resigned.</p><p>Once more Sabin faced her\u2014and stopped breathing. Just like before, the clothing bagged on her. Now that she was clean, however, the white cotton caused her skin to gleam like a pearl. His mouth watered for a taste; a single lick would suffice. Would have to suffice, he thought, entranced, already walking to her, reaching out.</p><p>What the hell are you doing? Snap out of it, asshole! He stopped abruptly, teeth grinding. It took a moment for him to gather his wits and recall what he\u2019d wanted her to do. When he did, he crossed the room to his dresser and swiped up his cell. There was a missed call and a text message. He scrolled the menu. The call had come from Kane. The text...Kane, as well. The warrior was spending the day in town but said to call if he was needed and he would rush home. It was a miracle that Kane had been able to use his phone twice in a row without frying it to hell.</p><p>After Sabin cleared the screen, he threw the phone at Gwen. She missed.</p><p>\u201cStart dialing,\u201d he told her.</p><p>GWEN LIFTED THE PHONE with a trembling hand, tears burning her eyes. The entire year of her imprisonment, she\u2019d wanted to do this, had needed to hear her sisters\u2019 voices. But she was still ashamed about what had happened to her and still didn\u2019t want them to know.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s morning here, so it\u2019s nighttime in Alaska,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps I should wait.\u201dSabin showed no mercy. \u201cDial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand your reluctance. You love them. You want them here, even made it a condition of your staying with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She traced her finger over the glowing numbers on the little black device. Her guilt was returning. Guilt for making her beloved sisters wait for news of her\u2014or, if they didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been taken, simple contact from her.</p><p>\u201cWill they blame you for what happened? Want to punish you? I told you I wouldn\u2019t let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maybe. What she did know was that they\u2019d demand Sabin allow them to join his war, just as he wanted. They\u2019d want Hunter ass on a platter, served raw and fresh. But if they were injured because of Gwen...she\u2019d hate herself forever and still another eternity.</p><p>\u201cCall,\u201d Sabin said.</p><p>Get over yourself, she thought. With a sigh, she dialed Bianka\u2019s number. Of the three, Bianka was the most kindhearted. And by kindhearted, Gwen meant that Bianka would toss a glass of water at the person she\u2019d just lit on fire.</p><p>Three rings later, her sister answered. \u201cI have no idea who is calling me from this number but you had better haul ass or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Bianka.\u201d Her stomach clenched painfully, the voice so hauntingly familiar and so well loved the tears that had been burning her eyes finally spilled over, rushing down her cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, an inhalation of breath. \u201cGwennie? Gwennie, is that you?\u201d</p><p>She swiped at her cheeks with the back of her wrist, very aware of Sabin\u2019s hot gaze on her, practically eating her up. What was he thinking? Warrior that he was, her show of weakness\u2014more weakness, that is\u2014probably disgusted him. And that was a good thing. Really. They\u2019d kissed and touched in the shower and she\u2019d been ready to go further, take more, take all, give all, despite the kind of man he was and the things he\u2019d said to her, the things he would ultimately do to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, you still there? Gwennie? Are you okay? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, it\u2019s me. The one and only,\u201d she finally replied.</p><p>\u201cMy gods, girl. Do you know how long it\u2019s been?\u201d</p><p>Twelve months, eight days, seventeen minutes and thirty-nine seconds. \u201cI have an inkling. So how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter, now that I\u2019ve heard from you, but pissed as hell. You are gonna pay big-time when Taliyah finds you. A while back we called your phone, you know, to say hi and threaten to bitch slap you if you didn\u2019t come home. No answer. So we called Tyson. He said you had moved out and he didn\u2019t know how to reach you. We searched and searched, all over the damn world, but no luck. Finally we paid Tyson a personal visit and he told us you\u2019d been taken against your will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you torture him?\u201d She wasn\u2019t mad at him, didn\u2019t want him hurt. He\u2019d merely been protecting himself, something she understood.</p><p>\u201cWell...maybe a little. Not our fault, though. He wasted precious time.\u201d</p><p>She moaned; then she pictured Bianka, black hair twisted around her head, amber eyes glowing, red lips lifted in a wicked smile, and she couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cHe\u2019s alive, though. Yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, girl. As if we\u2019d lower ourselves to kill that puny little shit. I never knew what you saw in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He didn\u2019t know where I was. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho took you, anyway? What\u2019d you do to them to punish them, huh, huh? They are dead, right? Tell me they\u2019re dead, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll, uh, get to that.\u201d Truth. \u201cSome other time.\u201d Again, truth. \u201cListen,\u201d she added before Bianka could probe too deeply, \u201cI\u2019m currently in Budapest, but I want to see you guys. I miss you.\u201d There at the end, her voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cThen come home.\u201d Bianka had never pleaded for anything\u2014that Gwen knew of\u2014but she sounded ready to beg just then. \u201cWe want you home. Not knowing where you were nearly destroyed us. Mom moved out months ago \u2019cause we wouldn\u2019t stop pestering her about you, so you don\u2019t have to worry about the cold-shoulder treatment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That she\u2019d kept them waiting longer than necessary...guilt rose again, hotter than before, and Gwen tumbled straight into a shame spiral.

They\u2019d never been close. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to have to come to me. I\u2019m with the, uh, Lords of the Underworld, and they\u2019d like to meet you.

Unless your personality has undergone a huge overhaul this past year and a half?\u201d</p><p>Not really. \u201cJust...will you come?\u201d</p><p>No hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>THE KITCHEN LOOKED as if it had been bombed. Hungry warriors were savages, Sabin thought. Before coming down, he\u2019d texted each of them\u2014gods, he loved technology; he\u2019d even brought technophobe Maddox into the twenty-first century\u2014calling a meeting at noon to discuss what the Hunters had told him about both Distrust and the boarding school for the half-human, half-immortal children, as well as the impending arrival of Gwen\u2019s sisters.</p> <p>The sisters. Tears had filled Gwen\u2019s eyes the moment one of the Harpies had answered the phone, turning the bright gold to melted bullion. Relief, hope and sadness had played across her face, and Sabin had had to fight the urge to go to her, to wrap her in his arms, offering whatever comfort he could. Every warrior instinct he possessed had been needed to hold himself in place.He hoped the rest of the day was easier. With a flick of his wrist, he closed the refrigerator door. Warm air instantly blanketed him. He faced Gwen, who was staring down at the marble countertops. Or maybe the stainless steel sink, perhaps wondering why so ancient a home had been modernized in some places and left to age in others.</p><p>He\u2019d had the same thought himself upon arriving in Budapest a few months ago. He\u2019d made some improvements since moving in, and planned to have the entire monstrosity pimped out by the end of the year. It was funny. He\u2019d traveled all over the world, had a base of operations in many places, but this fortress had quickly become his home.</p><p>\u201cEmpty,\u201d he announced.</p><p>Her gaze snapped to his and a moment passed before she focused. When she did, she ran a hand through her still-damp hair as though embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine without food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d No way he\u2019d allow her to go without. For a year, she\u2019d endured the horrors of starvation. Not one more day would she do so while in his care. Her every need was his to meet. Because he desired her help and cooperation.</p><p>He was in a better mood than before, so he supposed he could placate her with \u201cstolen\u201d goods, after all. \u201cWe\u2019ll go into town,\u201d he added. Paris, whose job it was to shop, was probably still jacked out of his mind. \u201cAfter we cover you from head to toe.\u201d No way he wanted people seeing that precious-gem skin.</p> <p>\u201cMakeup will take care of my face,\u201d she said, guessing his intentions. \u201cAnd anyway, Anya brought you a tray...uh, what I mean to say is that I had food earlier.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s how Anya had gotten her to eat. Claiming the food was for him, ensuring that eating it was stealing it. For once Sabin applauded the goddess\u2019s trickery. \u201cOne meal won\u2019t satisfy you forever. Besides, we can grab you some clothes that fit while we\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>Pleasure consumed her expression and that amazing skin seemed to glint with all the colors of the rainbow. His cock hardened painfully, his blood heated dangerously and images of her naked body, wet and glistening, flashed in his mind. Suddenly he could taste her decadence in his mouth, hear her cries in his ears.</p><p>\u201cClothes?\u201d she said. \u201cOf my very own?\u201d</p><p>Her happiness was too much for Doubt, who decided to pounce, using Sabin\u2019s distraction to its advantage and ripping free of its leash. New clothes won\u2019t make your situation better. They might even make it worse. How are you supposed to pay for them? With your body? Or maybe your sisters will be the ones to pay. What if Sabin desires them? He didn\u2019t penetrate you, even though he was primed. What if he takes your sisters to bed instead?</p><p>Usually the demon was more circumspect, a gentle whisper, a quiet supposition, each designed to destroy the listener\u2019s confidence. Now it was using what had happened between them in the shower to ignite jealousy and feminine pique. Gwen didn\u2019t have to like him or even desire more of him for it to work, either. No one enjoyed the thought of their would-be lover in bed with someone else. Sabin was already prepared to cut out the eyes of anyone who even admired Gwen.</p><p>You knew this would happen. Knew Doubt would continue to go after her. \u201cGwen,\u201d he said, jaw clenched. \u201cThose thoughts...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I\u2019m going to hurt you for this, you sick fuck. \u201cYou won\u2019t owe me anything for the clothes. No one will.\u201d</p><p>Her pupils were thickening, black consuming gold...white...Soon she would be Harpy. Not knowing what else to do, he cupped the back of her neck and jerked her into his body. It had worked on the plane. Maybe...</p> <p>His other hand snaked around her waist, fitting her against his still-hard cock. \u201cFeel that? It\u2019s for you. No one else. I can\u2019t stop my reaction to you, crave only you.\u201d He nuzzled the side of her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, we can\u2019t be together, but I can\u2019t make that matter. I only want you.\u201d He\u2019d say it a thousand times if necessary. He only wished the words were a lie.</p><p>Nothing. No response.</p><p>He pressed a soft kiss to her lips, lingering, savoring. Even chaste as the kiss was, it rocked him. The feel of her...knowing the skin that lurked underneath her baggy clothes, the pink little nipples that liked to be licked.</p><p>She sucked in a breath\u2014his breath. Ever so slightly, she arched into his touch, and her arms wound around him, holding tight, tugging him closer. Just like that, her pupils began to thin. Her breathing became less choppy, her muscles less stiff.</p><p>His words hadn\u2019t reached her; his touch had. The Harpy must calm when given physical contact. He\u2019d have to remember that.</p><p>But with the realization came a fury so hot his organs were blistered. A year, a full year, without contact must have been hell for this girl who so hated her darker side. The Harpy must have been a screaming voice inside her head, a constant hated companion.</p><p>It was one more link between them. Although Sabin didn\u2019t hate his demon. Not all the time. He certainly enjoyed the torment it could bring to Hunters. Right now, if he were honest (and he had to be), hate could not be denied. The bastard refused to leave Gwen alone, provoking her when she deserved only peace.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d he asked.</p><p>A shuddering breath escaped her. Abruptly she released him, cheeks heating. \u201cThat depends. Have you put a muzzle on your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking on it. And as I\u2019ve told you, the demon isn\u2019t my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m fine now, yes.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been resentment in her tone. \u201cSure?\u201d He traced his thumb along her hairline.</p><p>\u201cSure. You can let go of me now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to; he wanted to hold on forever. And that\u2019s exactly why he released her, stepping away. He\u2019d already marked her. Anything else was overkill. Unnecessary and dangerous to his ultimate goal.</p><p>Doubt whimpered in disappointment, receding to the back of his mind to decide on its next point of attack.</p><p>AFTER SHE APPLIED a layer of makeup to cover her skin, makeup Sabin borrowed from one of the female residents, Gwen and Sabin left the fortress. He touched her constantly. A brush of his arm here. A caress of his fingers there. She never wanted him to stop. She knew the magic he could work, after all.</p><p>She shivered. The stimulation and memories were almost\u2014almost\u2014enough to distract her from the beauty of Budapest. There were castlelike homes, modern buildings, green trees, bricked streets and birds eating crumbs from them. There was a murky river, an iron-enclosed bridge and a chapel that dusted the sky with its points. There were columns and statues and multihued lights.Sabin almost managed to distract her from the townspeople, as well. They regarded him with awe, stepping out of his way but still trying to connect with him, any part of him. Some even gasped, \u201cAngel\u201d when he passed.</p><p>They shopped for several hours, and not once did he seem irritated with her need to try everything on, to draw every piece of material across her cheek and twirl in front of the full-length mirrors. Often she caught him smiling.</p><p>After deciding on several pairs of jeans, a handful of colorful T-shirts and glittery pink flip-flops, as well as her own set of makeup, they moved on to the food. But who cared about ever eating again? She was wearing her new clothes! A snug pair of denims and a lovely pink T-shirt.</p><p>She\u2019d never been so happy with how she looked. After a year in that skimpy white tank and skirt, she felt beautiful and comfortable and, well, normal. Human. As they left the grocery store with their bounty, Sabin eyed her as though she was his favorite ice cream cone.</p><p>Of course, then the whispers began.</p><p>Are you sure you look okay? I wonder if your breath smells bad. How many women has Sabin been with? How many were prettier and smarter and braver than you?</p><p>Gwen\u2019s happy mood faded, edginess taking its place. The whispers continued, and soon even the Harpy\u2019s feathers became ruffled. If a total meltdown happened, havoc would invade this lovely town and Sabin would be hurt. Much as Sabin irritated her, Gwen still didn\u2019t want a single drop of his blood spilled.</p><p>Right now he was loading their groceries into the back of the car, his muscles bunching with every movement. Breads, meats, fruits and vegetables abounded. The scents were divine. Several times in the store the temptation had proven to be too great, her mouth watering, and she\u2019d pilfered. But her skills were seriously rusty, for Sabin had caught her every time. He hadn\u2019t protested, though. No, he\u2019d encouraged her with a smile or a wink, as if he were proud of her. That had shocked her\u2014shocked her still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gwen leaned a hip against the taillight. \u201cYour demon is very close to ruining my entire day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. For the record, you look amazing, your breath is fresh, I haven\u2019t been with that many and there are none prettier or smarter than you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t mention braver, she noticed. \u201cDistract me. Tell me more about the artifacts you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p> <p>He paused, a bag suspended midair. Sunlight cascaded all around him, dark hair shimmering, lifting in the breeze. His eyes narrowed on her\u2014something they did a lot, she mused. \u201cThat isn\u2019t something I can discuss out in the open like this.\u201d</p><p>Was that just an excuse to keep her in the dark?</p><p>Or was his demon rubbing off on her, and she doubted him just because?</p><p>Argh! \u201cYou can tell me. I\u2019m working for you now.\u201d Wasn\u2019t she? Hadn\u2019t they decided she would do the clerical stuff? She hadn\u2019t named her price, but that was because the first thing that had come to mind was room and board in his fortress. For, like, ever. How dumb was that? \u201cI\u2019m helping you find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you about them. Later.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, so maybe the demon was rubbing off on her.</p><p>Sabin returned to the bags, finesse gone as he tossed them inside with a flick of his wrist. She winced when she heard the eggs crack.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, we never reached an agreement about your duties,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gwen propped her elbow above her head, resting her head in her hand, nails digging into her scalp. \u201cDo you not think I\u2019m capable of clerical work or do you just not respect me enough to let me prove myself in that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Did you just throw out the R word in a discussion about clerical work?\u201d His jaw worked left and right, popping. \u201cWhat is it with women? Make out a little, and suddenly everything you do means you lack respect for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d He\u2019d had to go there, hadn\u2019t he? Just talking about it, she felt the hot drops of water on her skin, felt his hands caressing her, his teeth biting at her. He\u2019s not the kind of man you want for yourself. It was sad that she needed the reminder. And would probably need it again. And again. \u201cOne, I\u2019ve been offering to help and you claim you want me to, but you\u2019ve never actually told me how I can get started. Two, the shower has nothing to do with anything. In fact, let\u2019s make a pact never to discuss what happened in there again.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to her, bags completely forgotten now. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to physically fight your enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not why do you think I don\u2019t respect you or why do I want you to do clerical work, but why don\u2019t you want to discuss the shower?\u201d</p><p>Cheeks heating, she straightened, looked away. \u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Because I\u2019ll want more. \u201cMixing business with pleasure is more dangerous than we are,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>A muscle ticked below his eye and he stared over at her, taking her measure, she was sure, and waiting for her to back down. She didn\u2019t, and that surprised her. She wasn\u2019t afraid of him, she realized. Not even a little.</p><p>\u201cGet in the car,\u201d he commanded.</p> <p>\u201cSabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar.\u201d</p><p>A curse on domineering men!</p><p>When they were buckled inside, he started the engine but didn\u2019t pull out onto the road. He shielded his eyes with sunglasses, placed a hand on her thigh and faced her. \u201cNow that we\u2019re alone, I don\u2019t mind telling you about the artifacts. But the moment you know, it means you\u2019re stuck with me. You\u2019re not leaving with your sisters, you\u2019re not venturing away from the fortress by yourself. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Wait. What? \u201cJust how long are we talking about here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil they\u2019re found.\u201d</p><p>Which could be a few days. Or eternity. Which she\u2019d secretly wanted, but not because she had no choice. \u201cI\u2019m not agreeing to any such thing. I was imprisoned for a year already and have no desire to live that way again. I do have a life to return to, you know.\u201d Well, kind of. Not that she\u2019d even tried. Or wanted to. \u201cThere are things to do, people to see.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThen you\u2019ll get nothing out of me.\u201d With that, he maneuvered the vehicle onto the road. He drove slowly, easing into traffic. His caution seemed...odd. Against his live-on-the-edge personality. Was this for her benefit? To keep her safe? The thought was kind of sweet.</p><p>Don\u2019t you dare soften toward him!</p><p>\u201cYou like staying at the fortress. Admit it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Was this information that could be used against her? Yes. Would keeping it secret award her some type of advantage? Yes. Would a lie serve just as well, if not better? Yes. But when she opened her mouth, the truth spilled out. \u201cFine. I admit it. I\u2019ve been alone and afraid for a year. You and your friends came and suddenly I wasn\u2019t alone. I was still afraid, but no one hurt me or threatened me, and that feeling of safety is just so wonderful I can\u2019t bring myself to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have gotten the same feelings from your sisters.\u201d His tone had softened; his fingers massaged her leg. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Kind of. \u201cI could have lied about what happened, I suppose, so there\u2019d be no tension, but they\u2019ve always been able to see right through me. I can lie to anyone but them.\u201d And Sabin, it seemed. \u201cYou guys are like a vacation away from life. Only, you want me to work on my vacation. And that\u2019s okay,\u201d she rushed out, \u201cas long as it\u2019s desk work.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, loud and long, the sound of it echoing through the vehicle. \u201cListen up, because I\u2019ll only offer this information once. There are four artifacts. The Cage of Compulsion, the Paring Rod, the Cloak of Invisibility and the All-Seeing Eye. Somehow, when all four are together, they\u2019ll point the way to Pandora\u2019s box. We own two. The cage and the eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they, exactly? I\u2019ve never heard of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever\u2019s locked inside the cage is forced to do whatever is commanded of them. Anything and everything, nothing is too sacred, as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt Cronus. Since he had the thing constructed, he somehow made sure it couldn\u2019t be used against him.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Gwen had to admire anyone with that level of power. She couldn\u2019t even control her own dark side.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure what the rod does. The cloak is pretty self-explanatory and the eye shows us what\u2019s happening in heaven. And hell.\u201d He rested his head on the back of the seat, eyes still on the road. \u201cDanika is the eye.\u201d</p><p>Okay, double wow. The petite blonde who looked so normal could see the wonders of heaven and the horrors of hell? Poor thing. Gwen knew what it was like to be different, to be...more. Maybe they could be friends, throw back a few cold ones and whine about their troubles. How cool would that be? She\u2019d never had that before. \u201cSo how\u2019d you find the cage and the eye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe followed clues Zeus left behind so that he himself could one day reclaim them.\u201d</p><p>Like a treasure hunt. Tr\u00e9s badass. \u201cCan I see the cage?\u201d She couldn\u2019t disguise the excitement that laced her voice. Her sisters, paid mercenaries that they were, had often left her home, alone, while they traipsed the world on hunts of their own. She\u2019d always wanted to go. Or, at the very least, enjoy the spoils of their victories with them. But they\u2019d always passed the item to its new owner before returning home, so she\u2019d never gotten her wish.</p><p>Sabin\u2019s attention flicked briefly to her, and she could feel the heat of his gaze. \u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Once again, she was to be left out. She tried to hide her disappointment. \u201cWhat are you going to do with Pandora\u2019s box when you find it?\u201d</p><p>His fingers whitened around the wheel. \u201cSmash it to pieces.\u201d</p><p>The answer of a warrior. She was glad. \u201cAnya mentioned it could draw the demon out of you, killing you and locking away the demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if you\u2019re killed without the box? Does the demon die, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many questions,\u201d he tsked.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She traced a circle over her knee. \u201cI\u2019ve always been too curious for my own good.\u201d That curiosity had nearly gotten her killed a few times. Once, as a young child, she\u2019d been exploring her family\u2019s mountain and she\u2019d stumbled upon a calm, serene river. If she were submerged, would she be able to see the fish swimming through it? she\u2019d wondered. And if so, how many would there be, what color would they be and would she be able to catch one?</p><p>The moment she dove in, the icy water had completely depleted her strength. It hadn\u2019t mattered that there was no current. She hadn\u2019t had the energy to keep herself afloat. The Harpy had taken over, but the water had frozen her wings to her back, preventing her from flying out.</p><p>Kaia had heard her panicked cries and saved her, and she\u2019d received the thrashing of a lifetime. But that hadn\u2019t stopped her from wondering about those silly fish.</p><p>\u201c\u2014listening to me?\u201d Sabin said, his voice cutting into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. She loved when they did that. Made the larger-than-life male seem, well, human. \u201cWhat I\u2019m telling you is privileged information, Gwen. You do understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. She understood. It could be used against him, given to Hunters to hurt him. \u201cYou saved me. I\u2019m not going to betray you, Sabin. But if you think I\u2019m capable of that, why do you even want me on your team?\u201d The fact that he didn\u2019t believe in her bruised her more than she would have thought possible. Maybe he can\u2019t help himself. Maybe his demon keeps him from trusting in anyone. She blinked at that. Made sense, and didn\u2019t sting quite so much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do trust you.

Of course he wouldn\u2019t let it happen. She wouldn\u2019t, either. She was a coward, but she was also vicious when she needed to be, and she\u2019d learned her lesson on evasion well. \u201cI still want the info.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood, because I was testing you and you passed. This can\u2019t be used against me since Hunters already know. If I\u2019m killed and the box is not around, the demon will be free. Crazed, insane and more dangerous and destructive than ever, but free.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s why they want to capture you rather than kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent troops were always coming and going in the catacombs, but every time one regiment would leave to fight\u2014I didn\u2019t know who at the time\u2014they would remind each other not to kill, only to injure and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he suddenly spat, cutting her off. \u201cWe\u2019re being followed. Damn it!\u201d He banged a fist into the steering wheel. \u201cI allowed myself to be distracted or I would have caught them before now.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring the accusation in his voice and the new stream of hurt that came with it, Gwen spun in her seat, peering out the darkened glass. Sure enough, there were three cars following them around a corner. Each had tinted windows, so she couldn\u2019t see inside to count the number of men bearing down on them. \u201cHunters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Shit!\u201d Sabin growled again, and it was the only warning she had before a fourth car pulled out in front of them. Boom. Crunch. Metal crashed against metal.</p><p>She was thrown forward, saved from injuries by her seat belt and the airbag.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d Sabin demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed. Her heart was drumming uncontrollably, her blood like ice in her veins.</p><p>Sabin was already reaching for the blades strapped to his body, the silver tips gleaming in the sunlight. \u201cLock yourself inside,\u201d he said. He dropped two blades on the dash between them. \u201cUnless you want to fight?\u201d He didn\u2019t give her time to reply, just jumped from the car, slamming his door shut behind him.</p> <p>Bile rose in Gwen\u2019s throat as she locked the door. Bile mixed with shame and fear. How could she sit here, allowing him to fight\u2014she scanned the groups emerging from the now stopped vehicles, running for him, guns raised\u2014fourteen men on his own? Dear Lord. Fourteen!</p><p>She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Pop. Whiz.</p><p>I\u2019m a Harpy. I can fight. I can win. I can help him.</p><p>Her sisters wouldn\u2019t have hesitated. They would have been on top of the cars, ripping the roofs to shreds before the wheels had even stopped turning. I can do this. I can. With a shaky hand, she lifted the weapons. They were heavier than they appeared, their handles like lava against her too-cold skin.</p><p>This one time. She\u2019d fight this one time. But that was it. After that, she was going on full-time clerical duty. Another pop. Another whiz. Then a loud thunck! She yelped. Yes, I can do this. Maybe.</p><p>Where the hell was the Harpy? Her vision was normal, not infrared, and there wasn\u2019t a need for blood inside her mouth.</p><p>The lazy bitch was probably sated by food and touch, sleeping even. If Gwen hadn\u2019t spent so much time suppressing the dark side of her nature, she might have known how to summon it. Now, it seemed, she was on her own.</p> <p>Pop. Scream.</p><p>Can\u2019t stay in here forever. Gulping, trembling, she emerged from the car. A horrific sight instantly greeted her. Sabin, locked in a lethal dance, arms slashing, knives cutting, blood spraying. Hunters, shooting him full of holes. To his credit, he never slowed.</p><p>\u201cStupid, going out alone, demon,\u201d one of the strangers said. \u201cGive us back our women, and we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>Gwen should have known Hunters would retaliate for what had happened in those catacombs.</p><p>Sabin snorted. \u201cYour women are gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the redhead. We saw her with you. That whore certainly cozied up quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall her that again. I dare you.\u201d There was so much fury in his voice, Gwen was surprised the Hunters didn\u2019t bail then and there.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a whore and you\u2019re a bastard. I\u2019m gonna jam you up with copper, revive you and spend the rest of my life making you pay for what you did in Egypt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou murdered our friends, you son of a bitch,\u201d someone else piped in.</p><p>Sabin didn\u2019t say another word. Just continued to pound forward, eyes glowing bright red, a flash of sharp, gnarled bones suddenly visible beneath his skin. Bodies toppled around him, but how much longer could he last? There were\u2014eight more. Eight still shooting at him. Not to kill, but to incapacitate, going for his calves, his upper arms.</p><p>Gwen could almost hear his demon tossing dangerous little insecurities in their ears: You can\u2019t really beat him, you know that, right? There\u2019s a very good chance your wife is going to have to identify your body tonight.</p><p>Blocking the sound, drawing on every ounce of courage she possessed, she inched forward. She\u2019d distract the Hunters, allowing Sabin to pounce. Yes, yes. Good plan. Okay. How best to distract them so Sabin could swoop in and work his magic, though? Without getting killed or maimed in the process, she qualified.</p><p>The answer came to her, and she almost vomited. No, no, no. There\u2019s no other way, one part of her said.</p><p>This is stupid and suicidal, the other part replied. Didn\u2019t matter. She was doing something, acting brave for the first time in her life, and it felt...good. Really good, actually. She was still scared, still trembling, but that wasn\u2019t going to stop her. Not this time. Sabin had saved her from the Hunters, so she owed him one. More than that, as she peered over at the men partly responsible for her year-long confinement, she felt a sense of entitlement mixed with an urge to hurt.</p><p>Sabin had been right. It would feel good to destroy her enemy, up close and personal. The only problem: she wasn\u2019t a trained soldier like her sisters. She knew what to do, but could she actually succeed?</p><p>Gotta try. What was the worst that could happen, anyway? Well, she could die. Gwen sucked in a breath, straightened and waved her arms in the air, blades glistening in the sunlight. \u201cYou want me? Come and get me.\u201d</p><p>The dance of death ceased. Every gaze swung in her direction, and she tossed a knife. It soared through the air as if it meant to do major damage, then landed on the ground uselessly. Damn it!</p><p>She ducked, but one of the Hunters fired off a shot before she was fully covered, his friend yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t kill her,\u201d and shoving at his arms to change the direction of his aim. But it was too late. The bullet lodged in her shoulder, and a sharp pain tore through her, throwing her backward.</p><p>She lay there for a moment, utterly dazed, panting, arm stinging. Being shot wasn\u2019t as bad as she\u2019d imagined, she realized. Yeah, it hurt like a bitch, but the pain was manageable. Especially when her vision began to wink in and out, the blue sky and white clouds there for a few seconds, gone the next few. She heard footsteps pounding from a distance, cars swerving. Hopefully, she\u2019d distracted the Hunters enough to give Sabin his victory.</p><p>\u201cHold him back,\u201d someone shouted. \u201cI\u2019ll get the girl.\u201d</p><p>Sabin roared, an unholy sound that nearly made her ears explode. Then a bullet ricocheted off the tire rim and ate its way into her chest. Another sharp ache blasted through her. Okay, that pain wasn\u2019t so manageable. Her entire body was trembling, the muscles seizing into hard knots. But what bothered her most was the fact that warm blood was soaking her pretty new T-shirt. A T-shirt she herself had picked. A T-shirt she\u2019d been so proud and happy to wear. A T-shirt that Sabin had peered at with lust in his eyes.</p><p>It\u2019s ruined. My beautiful new shirt is ruined. At that, even the Harpy stirred in anger, finally rousing.</p><p>It was too late, though. Gwen\u2019s strength was draining from her, along with her lifeblood. Her vision went completely black, no more peeks of color. Sleep pulled at her, beckoning, lulling, but she fought it. Can\u2019t sleep. Not here, not now. There were too many people around her. She\u2019d be more vulnerable than ever. A disgrace to her family. A target once again.</p><p>\u201cGwen!\u201d Sabin called. In the distance, there was a sickening rip, as if limbs were being torn from a body, followed by an ominous thud. \u201cGwen, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...fine.\u201d The darkness finally swallowed her whole, and this time there was no fighting it.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>THE MEETING WITH SABIN was due to kick into gear any moment, yet Aeron hadn\u2019t seen any sign of Paris. No one had, and the different sets of lovebirds had been stumbling from their rooms at different times, coming from all different directions.</p><p>He\u2019d worried about the warrior all night. Never had he seen the usually optimistic man so bleak. Wasn\u2019t right. Wouldn\u2019t be tolerated. Which was why Aeron now stood in front of Paris\u2019s bedroom door, knocking insistently.There was no answer. Not even the sound of footsteps echoing.</p><p>He raised his fist to knock again, this time louder, harder.</p><p>\u201cMy Aeron, my sssweet Aeron.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that familiar, childlike voice, hope flooded him and Aeron spun. And there she was. His baby. Legion. He\u2019d only known her a short time, but she\u2019d already become his favorite part of himself, weaseling her way into his heart with her unquestioned loyalty to him. She was the daughter he\u2019d always secretly wanted.</p><p>When his gaze collided with the waist-high, green-scaled, bald, red-eyed, clawed, fork-tongued little she-demon all his worries melted away, Paris momentarily forgotten.</p><p>\u201cGet over here, you,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>That was all the encouragement she needed. Grinning widely\u2014and baring those sharp little teeth\u2014she leapt at him, landing on his shoulders and winding herself around his neck. She squeezed him tightly, cutting off his air, but he didn\u2019t mind. The boa-like embrace was her version of a hug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMissssed you,\u201d she cooed. \u201cSsso much.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and scratched behind her ears the way she liked. Soon she was purring. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d He liked having her nearby, liked knowing she was safe.</p><p>\u201cHell. You know that. Me told you.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, he\u2019d known that, but he\u2019d been hoping she had changed her mind and gone somewhere else. Hell was a place she despised, but a place Sabin kept convincing her to return to\u2014to \u201chelp\u201d Aeron through recon work, the warrior always said. Bastard. Her brethren there sensed the good in her and thrilled in hurting her, taunting her as if she were a damned soul rather than one of their own.</p><p>\u201cAnyone hurt you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cTry. Me run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He would have found a way inside that fiery cavern if they\u2019d harmed a single scale on her body.</p><p>She slithered up, propping her elbows on his shoulder and her cheek against his. The touch was hot, like a brand, but he didn\u2019t push her away. Nor did he flinch when she ran the tip of a poisoned fang against his jaw stubble. For whatever reason, Legion adored him. She would rather die than hurt him, and he would rather die than injure her feelings.</p> <p>The only time Legion had gotten upset with him was when he\u2019d traveled to the edge of town to watch the citizens. A habit of his. Their weaknesses and frailty both disgusted and entranced him. They seemed oblivious to the fact that they were destined to die, some that very day, and he wanted so badly to understand their thought processes.</p><p>Legion had assumed he\u2019d been on the lookout for a potential bedmate and had flipped out. You belong to me. Me! she\u2019d cried. Only after he\u2019d assured her that he\u2019d never offer himself to creatures so feeble had she calmed.</p><p>\u201cYou eyesss gone.\u201d Relief dripped from her tone.</p><p>His eyes\u2014his stalker. And yes, his \u201ceyes\u201d were gone. But for how long? That gaze bore into him randomly, never at the same time of day or night. Last time he\u2019d felt them, he\u2019d been stripping for a shower. Before he\u2019d removed his briefs, he\u2019d found himself alone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going to find out who or what it is.\u201d Somehow, some way. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to stop them.\u201d By whatever means necessary.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh. I learn for you!\u201d Legion clapped happily, but then began to pout. \u201cSsshe a girl. An angel.\u201d Gag, shudder.</p> <p>He blinked, sure he\u2019d misheard. \u201cWhat do you mean, an angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom...\u201d Another gag. \u201cHeaven.\u201d Another shudder.</p><p>Why would an angel from the heavens be watching him? A female, at that? In appearance, he had to be everything such a being would deplore. Tattooed, pierced...rough. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone talking in hell. That\u2019sss why I come back, sssso\u2019ssss I can warn you. They sssaying angel in trouble for following Lord of Underworld. Sssaying ssshe about to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d And what happened to angels when they fell?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. But ssshe be in big trouble. Big big trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have to be mistaken.\u201d He could understand a god or a goddess watching his every move. They wanted the artifacts; they wanted the box. Cronus, king of the Titans, liked nothing more than to use the warriors for his own gain, demanding they kill his enemies or suffer.</p><p>As Aeron well knew.</p> <p>\u201cHate her,\u201d Legion spat.</p><p>If his shadow were indeed an angel, that certainly explained why Legion couldn\u2019t remain in his presence. Angels, he\u2019d learned from Danika, were demon assassins. They weren\u2019t controlled by the gods, but by a single being no one had ever seen. Only...felt.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she\u2019s here to kill me,\u201d he mused. Ah, now that made sense, considering what he was. But why him, rather than another demon-possessed Lord? Why now? He and the other warriors had been walking the earth for thousands of years. The angels had always left them alone.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, no, no. Me kill her!\u201d was the fervent reply.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to challenge her, sweet.\u201d Aeron patted the top of Legion\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something. You have my word. And I\u2019m grateful to you for the information.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t accept a death sentence easily; he had Legion to protect. He wouldn\u2019t allow the artifacts to be snatched from his friends, either, if that\u2019s what the angel wanted. Too many lives were at stake.</p><p>What he would do was talk to Danika, learn all he could about his new shadow. And how to destroy it.</p><p>Gradually Legion relaxed against him. He was gratified to learn that he calmed her as thoroughly as she calmed him. \u201cWhat you doing here, anyway? Me want to play catch and claw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Not yet. I have to help Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, oh.\u201d She clapped excitedly again, long nails clacking together. \u201cLet\u2019sss play with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hated to deny her, but he liked his friends alive. And when it came to Legion and games, death was usually involved. \u201cI need him.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence. Then she sighed. \u201cFine. Me be bored just for you.\u201d</p><p>Aeron was chuckling as he turned back to the door. When Paris failed to answer his next summons, he twisted the knob. The lock held steady. \u201cStand over there, sweet. I\u2019m going to bust it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Me fix.\u201d Legion slithered down his chest, the lower half of her body still anchored around his neck while she reached out and used her claws to disable the cylinder. Click. Hinges squeaked, the wood gliding open. A giggle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>As she preened, he strolled inside the bedroom. Once, it had been a sensual haven. Blow-up dolls, sex toys and silk sheets had abounded. Now, the dolls had holes in them\u2014and not the good kind. They\u2019d been slashed. The toys were piled in the trash bin and the bed had been stripped of every amenity.</p><p>A quick search, and he found Paris in the bathroom, hunched over the toilet and moaning. His hair, a beautiful mix of black and golden brown, was tied in a knot at the base of his neck. Normally pale, his skin was now pallid, the veins bright and thick. There were dark half moons under his eyes, his irises a dull blue.</p><p>Aeron crouched beside him and spotted the bottles and Baggies littering the onyx floor. Ambrosia and human alcohol, and lots of each. \u201cParis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d Moans growing in velocity, Paris rose on his haunches and emptied the remaining contents of his stomach into the toilet.</p><p>When he finished, Aeron said, \u201cCan I do anything for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Barely audible. \u201cLeave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch you tone, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aeron motioned for Legion to hush, and surprisingly enough, she did. She even slid off him and perched in the corner of the bathroom, arms crossed over her chest and lower lip trembling. The intensity of his sudden guilt almost had him reaching for her. Take care of Paris first.</p><p>\u201cHow long since you had sex?\u201d Aeron asked his friend.</p><p>Another moan. \u201cTwo\u2014three days.\u201d Paris wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist.</p><p>Which meant Paris hadn\u2019t had a female since before their return. But Aeron knew Lucien had flashed the warrior into town every night they\u2019d spent in the desert for just that reason. Had the warrior had trouble finding a willing partner?</p><p>\u201cLet me take you into town. You can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Only want Sienna. My female. Mine.\u201d</p><p>Uh, what now? Far as Aeron knew, Paris was as single as ever, plowing his way through the female population one at a time\u2014sometimes two or three at a time. Probably just the ambrosia talking, Aeron decided. Still, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to humor the man. \u201cTell me where she is, and I\u2019ll go get her.\u201d</p><p>Bitter laugh. \u201cCan\u2019t. She\u2019s dead. Hunters killed her.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was a little too specific to be fueled by ambrosia. But Aeron had never met this Sienna, never even heard of her.</p><p>\u201cCronus was going to give her back to me, but I picked you instead. Knew you hated the bloodlust. Knew Reyes would die without the blonde. So I gave her up. Never going to see her again.\u201d</p><p>All of the pieces suddenly fell into place. The reason for Paris\u2019s recent behavior, the reason Aeron\u2019s bloodlust had left him so suddenly. Paris must have met the girl in Greece, while searching the Temple of the All Gods for the box. Dear gods. He\u2019d given up his lover for Aeron.</p><p>Aeron didn\u2019t have a female of his own, had never wanted one, but he\u2019d seen the way Maddox was with Ashlyn, Lucien with Anya, Reyes with Danika. They would die for each other. In Ashlyn\u2019s case, she had. Each constantly thought of the other, craved the other and went crazy when alone.</p><p>Staggered, Aeron\u2019s knees gave out and he plopped onto the cold tile. The enormity of Paris\u2019s actions settled like a heavy weight across his shoulders. \u201cWhy would you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>That simple.</p><p>\u201cParis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The warrior pushed to shaky legs and swayed.</p><p>Aeron was on his own feet in an instant, wrapping an arm about his friend\u2019s waist and holding him upright. When he tried to step forward, leading Paris to the bed, the warrior groaned and clutched his stomach. So Aeron swung him up, holding him steady against his chest.</p><p>Rather than carry him to bed, Aeron set him in the tub. Soon hot, steaming water was beating down, washing away the evidence of sickness. After Paris struggled out of his clothes, Aeron handed him a rag and soap and waited until the warrior cleaned himself from head to toe. Through it all, Paris stared past the stall, past the bathroom, as if, mentally, he were in a different place altogether.</p><p>\u201cIt pains me that you\u2019ve done this to yourself,\u201d Aeron said softly. \u201cAnd for me. I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll recover,\u201d Paris said, but Aeron didn\u2019t think either one of them believed it.</p><p>After he switched off the water, he handed his friend a towel. He would have dried Paris himself, but didn\u2019t think the big guy\u2019s pride would appreciate it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust go,\u201d Paris said, crawling out of the stall.</p><p>\u201cEither walk to the bed or I\u2019ll carry you,\u201d Aeron said.</p><p>Paris growled low in his throat, but stood without comment. He stumbled to the bed and flopped onto the mattress, bouncing once. Aeron followed close at his heels, then stared down at him, unsure what to do next. Never had Paris looked more fragile or lost, and the sight brought tears to his eyes. After all, he owed this man his life. Not just for what Paris had given up for him, but for his friendship, for fighting beside him, taking bullets and knife wounds for him, listening to him bitch about life\u2014this and their other, when they\u2019d been warriors for the gods and he\u2019d wanted, well, more.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t leave him like this. Which meant he had to go into town on his own and find Paris a woman.</p><p>Leaning down, he smoothed a strand of hair from the warrior\u2019s brow. \u201cI\u2019ll make this better. I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScore me another bag of ambrosia,\u201d was the weak reply. \u201cThat\u2019s all I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, oh,\u201d Legion said happily, suddenly done with her sulking. She raced into the room and hopped onto the bed. \u201cMe know where to get sssome!\u201d</p><p>Paris groaned yet again as the mattress shook. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p> <p>Aeron frowned at Legion and her smile faded. Head hanging, she climbed back on his shoulders. \u201cWhat wrong now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t encourage him. We don\u2019t want him sicker, we want him better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssorry.\u201d</p><p>He scratched her behind the ears. \u201cI\u2019ll return,\u201d he told Paris, and left the room, shutting the door behind him. Thankfully everyone was in the entertainment room, waiting for the meeting to start. If it hadn\u2019t already. He made it to his chamber without bumping into anyone and hugged Legion tight before settling her on the ruffled lounge he\u2019d had Maddox build for her.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he said, stalking to his closet. In seconds, he was weighed down with knives. He wanted to take a gun, just in case, but didn\u2019t want the human, whoever he chose, having access to it while he was preoccupied with flying.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but\u2014Me just got here. Me misssed you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, and I missed you, too. But the townspeople are already afraid of me. I think they\u2019d riot at the sight of both of us.\u201d It was true. They\u2019d never regarded Aeron\u2019s heavily tattooed face with the same reverence they bestowed upon the other warriors. \u201cI need to find a female for Paris and fly her back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can carry two. Me and her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She stomped her foot, red eyes bright. \u201cNo fe-malesss alone with you.\u201d</p><p>He knew she wasn\u2019t jealous romantically, but jealous like a child was when its parent remarried. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this, Legion. I don\u2019t like human females.\u201d When he gave himself to a woman, it would be a strong immortal, one who was hard, resilient and not easily destroyed.</p><p>How Paris and the others could bed the humans, knowing they were doomed by disease, stupidity, carelessness or cruelty at the hands of another of their kind, he didn\u2019t know. They would die. They always did. Even Ashlyn and Danika, to whom the gods had promised immortality, had weaknesses.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan to grab the first female I find. Someone completely unattractive to me.\u201d</p><p>She traced a claw over the emerald velvet. \u201cProm-issse?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>That mollified her somewhat, and she sighed. \u201cOkay. Me ssstay. Me...\u201d Her thin lips curved into a frown.</p><p>An instant later, Aeron felt a pair of invisible eyes boring into him. Hot, curious, insistent.</p><p>Legion trembled, scales paling, fear curtaining her features. \u201cNo. Nooooo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he commanded, and she did without hesitation, disappearing with only a thought.</p><p>Slowly he spun, searching for any hint of the...angel? There was nothing, no shimmery outline, no heavenly scent. Everything was as it had always been. His jaw clenched. So badly he wanted to curse at the creature, demand it emerge and state its business with him. But he didn\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t time. Later, though...</p><p>He pulled off his shirt and tossed it to the floor, looking down at his tattooed chest. Battle scenes, faces. He never wanted to forget the things he\u2019d done. The people he\u2019d seen led to slaughter. Otherwise he feared he would become the very evil he\u2019d always fought against. He would become his demon, Wrath.</p><p>No time for these grim thoughts. With only a mental command, his wings exploded from the hidden slits in his back, black, gossamer, deceptively fragile in appearance but incredibly strong. In that moment, he thought he heard a feminine gasp. Then warm hands were stroking those wings, learning every curve and hollow. Just like that, his cock hardened, a traitor to his resolve.</p><p>Hell. No. Desire a demon assassin? Not in this lifetime. \u201cDon\u2019t touch,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>The phantom hands jerked away.</p><p>If only the creature would obey him in all things. \u201cIf you hurt my friends or think to steal from me, I will carve you up, piece by piece. It would be better for you to leave and never return.\u201d</p><p>There was no response. That white-hot gaze remained.</p><p>Teeth grinding together, he strode to the double doors overlooking his balcony.</p><p>Outside, warm air enveloped him, fragrant with the scents of nature. Trees towered around the fortress, stretching to the sky. In the distance, he could see the red rooftops of the town shops and cathedrals. Those soft, hot hands never returned to him, and he was grateful. He was not disappointed, he assured himself.</p><p>Determined, he leapt from the balcony. Down, down he fell. He flapped his wings once, and rose. Again, and soared higher. He angled toward the left, turning to the north. That\u2019s when the front of the fortress came into view and he saw Sabin, jumping out of the SUV with a bleeding, unconscious Gwendolyn in his arms.</p><p>Aeron wanted to stop, to help, but instead flapped his wings faster, harder. Paris came first. Now and always, Paris would come first.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>SABIN HAD MEANT to keep at least one Hunter alive for questioning, perhaps a little torturing. Then they\u2019d shot at Gwen, and that desire had vanished. The second bullet had been an accident, but rage had consumed him, more rage than he\u2019d ever experienced before. He\u2019d slaughtered them like cattle, one by one, their throats opening under the slick pressure of his blade. Hadn\u2019t seemed like enough, then or now.</p><p>On the way to the fortress he\u2019d phoned Lucien, who had flashed Maddox and Strider to the scene for cleanup, then had gone back to the fortress to gather Gideon and Cameo to search for any other Hunters that might be lurking about. Sadly, there\u2019d been no sign of more. That didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t there, only that they were well-hidden.He wanted to slaughter another dozen or so.</p><p>Only a handful of times in the past two days had Gwen regained consciousness. Fuzzy as she\u2019d been, he\u2019d vacillated over and over again: take her to the hospital in town or keep her here? In the end, he always chose to keep her in his bedroom. She wasn\u2019t human. Doctors could do her more harm than good.</p><p>But why wasn\u2019t she recovering faster? She was immortal, a Harpy. Anya knew the race and swore they healed as swiftly as the Lords. But even though he\u2019d removed the bullets, the holes in Gwen were still gaping, still raw.</p><p>After fussing over her this morning, Danika and Ashlyn had suggested he place Gwen in the Cage of Compulsion and command her to heal. Finally hopeful, he\u2019d done it. But she\u2019d only gotten worse. That was not how the cage was supposed to work, and he\u2019d realized that though they thought they\u2019d known the artifact\u2019s abilities, they actually had much to learn.</p><p>Sabin had tried summoning Cronus, but evidently the god king was ignoring him. Damn gods. Only showing up when they wanted something. He now found himself praying for the arrival of her sisters. They would know what to do\u2014if they didn\u2019t butcher everyone inside the fortress first. The number Gwen had dialed the other day was stored in his phone, so he\u2019d called it, too, intending to solicit advice, tell the girls to hurry. But the woman who answered had nearly gone up in flames when she discovered it was not Gwen on the line. And when he was unable to produce Gwen, the threats to his manhood had started.</p><p>Not a good omen of things to come.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>The question came from the door and Sabin jerked in surprise. Normally, a spider couldn\u2019t sneak up on him. Lately, anyone and anything could. Damn Hunters. They\u2019d been lurking in town, watching him, waiting for him to mess up so they could snatch Gwen. And he hadn\u2019t fucking known.</p><p>\u201cSabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He lay on the bed, Gwen tucked into his side. She\u2019d stopped moaning in pain, at least. My charge, and I failed her. Worse, he\u2019d promised her that the Hunters would never hurt her again. Hadn\u2019t he? If he hadn\u2019t, he should have. Guilt ate at him.</p><p>Did you expect anything less?</p><p>Doubt had long since turned its evil on Sabin, not giving him a moment\u2019s rest.</p><p>\u201cSabin.\u201d</p><p>Hands fisting, he regarded Kane, who stood in the entryway. Dark hair, hazel eyes. There was a smear of white on his left cheek. Probably from plaster. Ceilings loved to cave in on the keeper of Disaster.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He should be planning his next move against his enemy. He should be with his men, gearing up for battle. He should be on the streets, hunting. Instead, he could barely force himself to leave his bedroom. If his eyes weren\u2019t on Gwen, if he wasn\u2019t watching her chest rise and fall, his mind simply fried, unable to fend off Doubt with logic.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with him? She was just a girl. A girl he wanted to use. A girl who would probably die fighting his enemy\u2014a girl he\u2019d asked to fight his enemy. A girl he couldn\u2019t have. A girl he\u2019d only known a short while.</p><p>Being with her now, guarding her, wasn\u2019t putting her above his mission, he assured himself. After he trained her, she\u2019d be a killing machine. There\u2019d be no stopping her. That\u2019s why he was here, unable to leave, desperate for her recovery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d a female voice suddenly asked.</p><p>Again, he was blinking as he refocused. Damn, but his mind wandered a lot lately. Ashlyn and Danika had returned\u2014he\u2019d lost count of the number of times they\u2019d visited\u2014and now stood beside Kane.</p><p>\u201cHolding steady.\u201d Why wasn\u2019t she healing, damn it? \u201cHow\u2019d the meeting go?\u201d Because of the attack, it had been put off until this morning.</p> <p>Kane shrugged, and the action seemed to piss off the lamp in the far corner because the lightbulb sparked. Then exploded. The women yelped and jumped out of the way. Used to such things, Kane continued as if nothing had happened. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in agreement. There\u2019s no way Baden can be alive. Each of us held his head in our hands before we burned it. Either someone\u2019s impersonating him or they\u2019re starting the rumor to distract us from our purpose.\u201d</p><p>The latter made sense. How like the Hunters. Because they weren\u2019t as strong as the warriors, their best weapon was trickery.</p><p>Danika strolled to Gwen and smoothed the hair from the sleeping beauty\u2019s face. Ashlyn joined her and clutched Gwen\u2019s hand, probably willing her strength into that frail little body. Their concern touched him. They didn\u2019t know her, not really, yet they still cared. Because he cared.</p><p>\u201cGalen knows that we know he\u2019s leading the Hunters,\u201d he told Kane. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he attacked again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s planning, probably. Gathering his forces. Spreading lies about Baden to confuse us, definitely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe sooner than you think. I saw him last night in my dreams,\u201d Danika said without looking up. \u201cHe was with a woman. The scene was so vivid I painted it when I woke up this morning. Do you want to see?\u201d</p><p>Poor Danika. She was faced with grisly visions nearly every night. Demons torturing souls, gods battling other gods, loved ones dying. Delicate human that she was, the horrors she witnessed had to scare her, yet she endured them with a smile because they helped her man\u2019s cause.</p><p>What would Gwen do if she had such visions? he found himself wondering. Would she tremble as she had that day in the pyramid? Or would she attack, teeth bared, like the Harpy she\u2019d been born to be?</p><p>\u201cSabin?\u201d Kane asked. \u201cYour distraction is screwing with our egos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Yes, please. I want to see it.\u201d</p> <p>Danika made to stand, but Kane stopped her. \u201cStay there. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d He disappeared down the hall, only to return a few minutes later, holding a canvas that stretched the length of his arm. He held it up, light gleaming off the dark colors.</p><p>Looked to be some sort of cave, the jagged rocks splattered with scarlet and soot. A few bones were scattered across the twig- and dirt-laden ground. Human, most likely. And there, in the far corner, was Galen, feathered wings outstretched. His pale head faced the viewer, and he was holding a...Sabin had to squint to see. A piece of paper?</p><p>There was indeed a female beside him, though only a sliver of her profile could be seen. She was tall, thin, with black hair. Blood dripped from the corner of her mouth. She, too, was studying the sheet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us have,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThere\u2019s something oddly familiar about her, though, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He studied her more closely. None of her features were familiar, no. But the way she frowned...the crease at the corner of her eye...maybe.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had gotten a better view of her,\u201d Danika said.</p><p>\u201cThat you saw anything at all is a miracle,\u201d Ashlyn assured her.</p> <p>Kane nodded. \u201cTorin\u2019s gonna scan her face into his computer, work some of his magic to form a complete composite and try to figure out who she is. If she\u2019s immortal, she probably won\u2019t be in any human databases, but it\u2019s worth a try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they in the portrait?\u201d Sabin asked, pushing the female from his mind and concentrating on their surroundings.</p><p>\u201cNot sure, but we\u2019re looking into that, too.\u201d Kane rested the painting on the tops of his boots. \u201cFinding Galen has become Priority One. If we can kill him, we think we can put an end to the Hunters once and for all. Without his guidance about all things immortal, they should crumble.\u201d</p><p>Gwen shifted against him, knee rubbing his thigh.</p><p>He froze, not even daring to breathe. He wanted her to awaken, but he didn\u2019t want her in pain. But several minutes passed and she remained just as she was.</p><p>My guess is she\u2019ll die.</p><p>Fuck you.</p><p>You\u2019re the one to blame, not me.</p><p>That, he couldn\u2019t refute. \u201cWhat about our search for the box?\u201d he asked Kane. \u201cWhat about the training facility or boarding school or whatever it is for the halfling children? And I wanted to go back to the Temple of the Unspoken Ones, search it again.\u201d The temple was in Rome and had only recently risen from the sea\u2014a process that had begun when the Titans overthrew the Greeks to seize control of the heavens. Because of Anya, he knew those temples were intended to be used as a place of worship, a means of returning the world to what it once was: a playground for the gods.</p><p>\u201cThose are priorities two, three and four,\u201d Kane said, \u201cthough knowing Torin, he\u2019s running several different searches on several different computers. A few more days, and we\u2019ll probably be back in action.\u201d</p><p>Would Gwen be recovered by then? \u201cAny news on the third artifact?\u201d Sometimes there weren\u2019t enough hours in the day to do everything that needed doing. Fight Hunters, find ancient relics of the gods, stay alive. Heal one tiny female.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Maddox and Gideon are taking Ashlyn out and she\u2019s going to listen.\u201d</p><p>Hopefully the Hunters that had come for Gwen had been vocal about their plans. Like where they\u2019d planned to take her. He\u2019d blow the place up on principle alone.</p><p>\u201cKeep me updated on any progress.\u201d</p><p>Kane nodded again. \u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSabin.\u201d</p><p>It was a rough, scratchy entreaty\u2014and it had come from Gwen. His head swung in her direction. Her eyelids were flickering open as she tried to focus.</p><p>His heart sped up, his skin tightening, his blood heating.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s waking up,\u201d Danika said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should\u2014\u201d Kane pressed his lips together as the bottom half of the painting careened to the floor. Scowling, he gathered the second piece. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Danika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d She jumped up, closed the distance between them and gently took the pieces from him. \u201cIt can be taped.\u201d</p><p>Ashlyn moved beside them, rubbing her growing belly along the way. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s give these two some time alone.\u201d</p><p>And then they were gone, the door closing behind him.</p><p>\u201cSabin?\u201d A little stronger this time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d He slid his fingers up and down Gwen\u2019s arm, offering what comfort he could. His relief was palpable. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore. Weak.\u201d She rubbed the sleep from her eyes and gave herself a once-over. A black T-shirt covered her, and she sighed in relief. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days.\u201d</p><p>She scrubbed a hand over her tired face, still too pale for his liking. \u201cWhat? Really?\u201d</p><p>Her surprise was genuine. \u201cHow long does it normally take for you to heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Weak as she was, she was unable to hold up her arm for any length of time. It flopped to her side. \u201cI\u2019ve never been injured. Damn it, I can\u2019t believe I fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>Her claim baffled him. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. The never-being-injured thing.\u201d Everyone, even immortals, scraped their knees, banged their heads, broke their bones at some point in their lives.</p><p>\u201cWith sisters like mine, protecting me at every turn, it is.\u201d</p><p>So her sisters had done a better job of ensuring her safety than he had. That rankled.</p><p>Did you expect something different?</p><p>I hate you today, you know that, right? They had let her be captured, he reminded himself. He had saved her.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you to stay in the car,\u201d he found himself growling.</p><p>Amber eyes landed on him, a little glazed with pain but mostly edged with anger. \u201cYou told me to stay in the car or help you. I chose to help you.\u201d With every word, her voice became weaker. Her lashes were fluttering again, ready to close for another too-long slumber.</p><p>His anger drained. \u201cStay awake for me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened at half-mast and her lips curled into a tired smile. \u201cI like when you beg.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t bode well that he was suddenly eager to beg for a few kisses. \u201cAnything you need to help you stay awake?\u201d Thanks to Anya, Danika and Ashlyn, he had everything a patient could desire on the bedside table. \u201cWater? Pain meds? Food?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and her stomach rumbled. \u201cYes, I\u2014no.\u201d There was longing in every word. \u201cNothing. I need nothing.\u201d</p><p>Her fucking rules, he realized. Though he wasn\u2019t hungry, he grabbed the turkey sandwich and bit into the edge. He lifted the glass of water to his lips and sipped. \u201cThis is mine, but the rest is for you,\u201d he told her, motioning to the bowl of grapes that remained.</p><p>\u201cTold you. Not hungry.\u201d</p><p>Not once had her attention wavered from the food in his hand. \u201cFine then. We\u2019ll eat later.\u201d He set the sandwich and the glass back on the tray and grabbed his cell, as if he couldn\u2019t wait to send an important text. \u201cI\u2019ll be just a moment.\u201d</p><p>He rolled from the warmth of her body and sat up, typing, T, call when have new intel.</p><p>The reply was nearly instantaneous. Duh.</p><p>He lay back down. The sandwich was gone and the water drained. He\u2019d never even seen her move. He pretended not to notice the missing food as he stuffed the phone in his pocket. \u201cSure you don\u2019t need anything?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed audibly, and he almost laughed. \u201cI need a bathroom. And a shower.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo shower. Not without me. You\u2019re so weak you\u2019ll fall.\u201d Sabin gathered her up. He expected her to protest but she burrowed her head in the hollow of his neck. So trusting. Damn, but he liked that.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t shower, then. Things happen when we shower together.\u201d</p><p>As if he needed a reminder. \u201cI\u2019ll control myself,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cBut will your demon? I don\u2019t have the strength to fight him. Just...give me ten minutes,\u201d she said when he set her down. Her curls were knotted around her head. \u201cCome to my rescue only if you hear bone slam into porcelain,\u201d she added as she gripped the sink for balance.</p><p>He felt his lips twitch, beyond relieved that she was strong enough to tease him. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Nine minutes later, she emerged, face damp, the scent of lemons wafting from her. His mouth watered for a taste, a deeper, fuller taste than he\u2019d gotten last time. She\u2019d brushed her hair, and it cascaded down her back. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze remained fixed on the floor, her cheeks bright with color. \u201cMuch. Thank you.\u201d She tried to walk, but both of her knees collapsed.</p><p>Sabin had her snuggled against his chest before she hit the ground. Once more, she welcomed his attention. So did he.</p> <p>\u201cI got my ass handed to me, huh,\u201d she said, wincing when her wounded shoulder brushed the sheets.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stood at the side of the bed, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cBut we can fix that. I\u2019ll train you.\u201d Whether or not she ever fought again, she needed the necessary skills to protect herself.</p><p>Whether or not she ever fights again\u2014like it\u2019s a question now? I thought you wanted her to fight, no matter what. He couldn\u2019t blame the hesitation on Doubt. It was all his.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, surprising him. Her eyelashes were drifting shut once more. \u201cI\u2019ll let you train me, because you were right. I like the thought of hurting Hunters.\u201d</p><p>Not what he\u2019d expected her to say. \u201cYou may change your mind before I get through with you. I\u2019ll hurt you, even though it won\u2019t be intentional, make you bleed and break you down.\u201d But she would be stronger because of it, so he wouldn\u2019t go easy on her.</p><p>Are you trying to talk her out of it?</p> <p>No, he just wanted her prepared. He wasn\u2019t hardwired like the other warriors to view female soldiers as weak, fragile and in need of protection. He didn\u2019t coddle them, either, and never had. Maybe that\u2019s why Cameo had chosen to go with him when he and Lucien had split the group. He even treated female Hunters the same way he treated male ones. Had he tortured a few? Yeah. And he wasn\u2019t sorry. He\u2019d do it again, do more if necessary.</p><p>With Gwen, however, he was a bit uneasy. She wasn\u2019t just any other female soldier and she wasn\u2019t his enemy.</p><p>No reply.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d</p><p>A breathy sigh. She\u2019d fallen asleep again. He covered her more securely and settled in beside her, resigned to the now familiar task of waiting for her to wake up.</p><p>\u201cMOVE EVEN AN INCH, and I\u2019ll take your goddamn head off.\u201d</p><p>Sabin came awake instantly. Cold steel pressed into his jugular, a bead of blood trekking down his neck. His bedroom was dark, the curtains over the window drawn. He drew in a breath and caught a scent\u2014female. The intruder smelled of ice and wintry skies. Her long hair tickled his bare chest.\u201cWhy\u2019s my sister in your bed? And why is she sleeping\u2014and injured? Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s fine or I\u2019ll make you eat your own tongue. I can smell the wounds on her.\u201d</p><p>The other Harpies had arrived.</p> <p>Apparently they\u2019d blown through Torin\u2019s state-of-the-art security without a single problem, because none of the alarms were screeching. Still more proof that he needed these women on his team\u2014assuming he still had a team. \u201cAre my men still breathing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d The blade pressed deeper. \u201cWell? I\u2019m waiting, and I\u2019m not the most patient of creatures.\u201d</p><p>Sabin remained utterly still, not even trying to go for the weapon under his pillow. Some help here, he said to Doubt.</p><p>I thought you hated me.</p><p>Will you just do your job?</p><p>He swore to the gods the demon sighed inside his head. Are you sure you want to hurt this man? Doubt asked the Harpy. What if he\u2019s Gwen\u2019s lover? Gwen might hate you forever.</p><p>Her hand trembled against him, loosening slightly.</p><p>Good boy. It was moments like this that made him appreciate the beauty of his curse. \u201cShe\u2019s here because she wants to be here. And she\u2019s injured because my enemy came after us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t protect her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk.\u201d His teeth ground together. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t. But I learn from my mistakes and it will never happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. Did you give her blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>There was an irritated growl. \u201cNo wonder she\u2019s sleeping with you in the room! How long ago was she injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d</p><p>A gasp of outrage. \u201cShe needs blood, you ass. Otherwise she\u2019ll never recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? She told me she\u2019s never been injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s been injured, she just doesn\u2019t remember. We made sure of it. And just so you know, you\u2019re going to pay for every mark on her. Oh, and if I find out you\u2019re lying, that you\u2019re the one who hurt her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t personally injured her.\u201d Yet. The thought sobered him as nothing else could have.</p><p>She eyed him from top to bottom. \u201cLook, I might be impressed by the stories I\u2019ve heard about you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m stupid enough to trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to Gwen, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. In a minute. So tell me. Which demon are you?\u201d</p><p>He debated the wisdom of replying. If she knew the truth, she would know to guard herself against Doubt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d The tip of the blade pressed into his carotid.</p><p>What the hell, he decided. If he had to unleash the demon, she wouldn\u2019t stand a chance even if she knew what it was. No one did, not even him. \u201cI\u2019m possessed by Doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Was that disappointment in her tone? \u201cI was hoping for Sex, or whatever you call him. The stories of his conquests are my favorite.\u201d</p><p>Yep, disappointment. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d Maybe a good bedding from Paris would lighten the woman\u2019s attitude. For that matter, maybe a good bedding from the woman would lighten Paris\u2019s attitude.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. I won\u2019t be here long enough to make any memories. Gwen.\u201d In the next instant, Gwen\u2019s body was quaking against him.</p><p>The sister was fucking shaking her, he realized with a snarl. Sabin latched on to the Harpy\u2019s wrist. \u201cStop. You\u2019ll hurt her worse.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly the knife left him, her arm ripping free of his grip, and the light was switched on. His eyes watered and he blinked. The Harpy was once again at his neck, but he hadn\u2019t had time to move.</p><p>When his vision cleared, he studied her. She was lovely, her skin as luminous as Gwen\u2019s was. But for some reason, Sabin wasn\u2019t transfixed, wasn\u2019t overcome with the urge to bed her. She had bright red hair, not streaked with blond like Gwen\u2019s. They possessed the same amber-gray eyes, though, and the same sensual red lips. Yet where innocence always drifted from Gwen, this woman pulsed with centuries of knowledge and power.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he began, only to be silenced as the knife cut past his skin.</p><p>\u201cNo. You listen. I\u2019m Kaia. Be glad it\u2019s me who\u2019s wielding the blade rather than Bianka or Taliyah. You phoned Bianka, refused to let her speak with Gwennie, and now she wants to beat you\u2014with your own limbs. Taliyah wants to feed you to our snakes, piece by piece. Me, I\u2019m willing to give you a chance to explain. What were your plans for her?\u201d</p><p>He could talk, tell her what she wanted to know, but he wouldn\u2019t. Not like this. If Gwen\u2019s sisters were going to hang around\u2014for despite Kaia\u2019s anger, he thought that they would\u2014and if they were going to fight for him, he had to assert himself as commander.</p><p>Without even a twitch of muscle to alert her to his plans, Sabin jerked Kaia on top of him. The blade sank deep, hit a tendon, but he didn\u2019t slow. He rolled her over, away from Gwen, and pinned her with his muscled weight.</p><p>Rather than fight him, she laughed, the tinkling sound like candy for his ears. \u201cSmooth move. No wonder she\u2019s in your bed. Must say I\u2019m a little disappointed you didn\u2019t go for my head, though. I expected better of a Lord of the Underworld.\u201d</p><p>The bouncing mattress must have finally woken Gwen, because she gasped weakly. Croaked out, \u201cKaia?\u201d</p><p>Kaia shifted her attention, a beauteous smile playing at her lips. \u201cHiya, baby. Long time no see. And I know you\u2019re thinking I\u2019m mad at you right now for falling asleep, but you\u2019re wrong. I know where to place the blame. In fact, your man and I were just working out a few details about your stay here. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re underneath him. You\u2019re underneath Sabin.\u201d Gwen\u2019s pupils were bleeding into gold...white...Her nails were elongating, sharpening. Her teeth gleamed menacingly in the light.</p><p>Kaia gaped. \u201cShe\u2019s...is she really...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Going Harpy.\u201d Shit. Sabin shoved Kaia from the bed with all of his might. She landed on the floor with a thwack, but he didn\u2019t care. The moment his arms were free, he pulled Gwen into the heat of his body, one hand winding loosely around her neck and caressing her face, the other stroking the soft contours of her belly, where her shirt had ridden up.</p><p>Those claws latched on to his shoulders and sank all the way to bone, but he gave no reaction to the pain. She could have done far, far worse.</p><p>\u201cWe were only talking. I wasn\u2019t going to hurt her. I pinned her to get her blade out of my neck, nothing more. She\u2019s here to help you, wants the best for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want her?\u201d Gwen rasped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bastard that he was, he was pleased by her jealousy. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t. And she doesn\u2019t want me, either. I swear it. You know I only want you.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw that Kaia had stood and was now watching him raptly.</p><p>Gradually, Gwen\u2019s nails receded, leaving wide, bleeding gashes. Her gaze cleared. And through it all, Doubt was strangely silent. Like, dead silent, as if it had hidden in the deepest part of Sabin\u2019s mind.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kaia finally said, and there was an edge to her tone. \u201cImpressive. You talked a Harpy from her rage. You know what that means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t spare her a glance. He kept his attention on Gwen and slid his hand down her leg, then he angled her so that her knee was propped on his hip, cradling their lower bodies together. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my sister\u2019s consort. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>GWEN HAD NEVER BEEN more nervous in her life. Not in her prison cell. Not even when she\u2019d faced the Hunters with Sabin.</p> <p>After watching Sabin calm the Harpy, Kaia had summoned Bianka and Taliyah with a sharp whistle. Apparently, they\u2019d been in the hallway, making sure no one approached while Kaia rescued Gwen. Then the three sisters had barricaded themselves inside Sabin\u2019s bedroom for a little \u201cchat.\u201d\u201cNo one else knows we\u2019re here,\u201d Bianka had said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just gonna be the five of us.\u201d</p><p>Gwen would have protested the coming chat, the isolation\u2014this kind of scenario always ended in bloodshed for the Skyhawks\u2014but several things stopped her. One, Sabin had a death grip on her, keeping her pinned against his side. Why? Did he think she would race to her sisters and demand they slaughter him? Two, she was as weak as a newborn kitten, barely able to hold up her eyelids. Plus, her shoulder and chest burned painfully. If Sabin had let her go, she would have collapsed against the headboard. And three, she planned to be brave one more time and act as Sabin\u2019s shield. If her sisters, who were angry at her treatment and seemed to have conveniently forgotten they\u2019d once admired the Lords, came after him...</p><p>Why she cared, she didn\u2019t know. Only minutes ago, he\u2019d been embracing Kaia. Hadn\u2019t he? The memory was fuzzy, as if she\u2019d watched the couple on a screen rather than in real life. Real or not, though, it had pissed the hell out of her. Sabin belonged to Gwen. For now, at least. And not because they\u2019d showered together and he\u2019d given her the best orgasm of her life. But because, well, she didn\u2019t know. He just did.</p><p>\u201cBefore we start talking, let\u2019s take care of baby girl.\u201d Kaia strode to her now, cutting her wrist along the way, and held it to Gwen\u2019s mouth. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d drunk from her sisters throughout her childhood, \u201cto be safe from any injury you might obtain,\u201d they\u2019d always told her. They themselves drank from any boyfriend they had at the time before heading to a battle or any kind of job. So it wasn\u2019t an odd command. After all, vampires weren\u2019t the only race that required blood, though Harpies only needed it for healing or to prevent injuries. But just as she fit her lips over the dripping wound, Sabin grasped her by the neck and spun her around so that she was facing him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kaia growled.</p> <p>His neck had a long, thick gash, a gash he\u2019d now reopened with a slash of his razored nail. \u201cIf she needs to drink, she\u2019ll drink from me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give anyone time to protest, but jerked Gwen forward, holding her head completely immobile to prevent her from turning away. Like she would. Already she could smell the sweetness of his scent. Lemons and blood. It filled her nostrils, drifted into her lungs and spread through the rest of her, leaving a trail of tingling warmth.</p><p>Unable to stop herself, mouth watering, she traced her tongue over the wound. Ecstasy. A fruity dessert. Her eyes closed and she fit herself against his body, arms wrapping around him to hold him captive, knees caging his legs. The angel side of her knew this was wrong, that she shouldn\u2019t do it and certainly shouldn\u2019t like it, but the Harpy side of her sang happily, desperate for more, for nothing had ever tasted like this. Like heaven and hell, perfect and wicked and sure to be her downfall.</p><p>On and on she sucked, drawing the liquid decadence into her mouth, down her throat. With every swallow a little more of her strength returned. The ache in her wounds began to ebb, the tissue weaving back together. How had she ever lived without this? Thankfully, blood didn\u2019t have to be stolen to be enjoyed. It was a source of medicine, not food. She should have thought to drink from Sabin before.</p><p>Through it all, Sabin remained still. Between her legs, however, she could feel the hard length of his erection. His fingers had fallen to her hips and were digging deep, holding her immobile.</p><p>She could hear his breath raging in her ears, could even hear a few of his thoughts: yes, yes, more, don\u2019t stop, so good, must...bed...mine. Or maybe they were her own.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drain him, baby girl,\u201d Bianka said, breaking through the mire of Gwen\u2019s new addiction. \u201cWe have a few questions for him first.\u201d</p><p>Nails dug into her scalp, and her head was torn away from Sabin\u2019s neck. She yelped, blood trickling from her parted lips.</p> <p>He snarled low in his throat, glaring over at Bianka while tightening his grip on Gwen. \u201cTouch her like that again and you\u2019ll be saying goodbye to your hands.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Bianka twirled a strand of black hair around her finger. \u201cNow there\u2019s the Lord of the Underworld I\u2019ve heard so much about. I almost believe you\u2019ll do it, demon. Well, try to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never make a threat I don\u2019t intend to see through,\u201d he said, turning Gwen and smashing her against his side once more.</p><p>She almost moaned. Her sisters never\u2014never\u2014backed down from a challenge. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she said, hoping to distract them.</p><p>\u201cThe big guy not taking care of you?\u201d Kaia strolled around the room, lifting knickknacks, opening dresser drawers. \u201cOh, sweet. Black briefs are my favorite.\u201d She even crouched in front of Sabin\u2019s weapons case, broke the lock with a twist of her wrist and flipped open the lid. \u201cHmm, lookie what I found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking care of me,\u201d Gwen said, oddly defensive of him. He\u2019d released her from captivity, guarded her, planned to teach her how to defend herself. The Hunter thing was her own fault. She should have stayed in the car. She couldn\u2019t regret that she\u2019d emerged to help, though. He was alive. Safe.</p><p>Are you being truthful with your sisters, because I can think of several instances that Sabin\u2014</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Sabin muttered.</p><p>Good thing he\u2019d shut that stupid demon up, because the Harpy had started squawking the moment its voice had filled her head.</p><p>Bianka joined Kaia at the chest, and they oohed and ahhed over the guns and knives. Weapons were their kryptonite. Taliyah stepped to the edge of the bed, staring down at her, expression blank, emotionless. No one was more beautiful than Taliyah. She possessed white hair, white skin, eyes of the palest blue. She was like a snow queen\u2014and many a person had actually accused her of having ice in her veins. Not that they\u2019d lived long afterward.</p><p>\u201cI know your situation with the Hunters,\u201d she said to Sabin. \u201cI\u2019ve heard tales of your viciousness and have admired you for it. I\u2019ve even hoped to meet you. But now I want to kill you for bringing my sister into this mess. She isn\u2019t a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be.\u201d Several seconds passed, but Sabin didn\u2019t add anything else. Didn\u2019t try to defend himself.</p><p>He was going to leave it at that? Let them think she\u2019d shacked up with him and he\u2019d placed her in danger for no reason, rather than tell them the truth, that she\u2019d been stupid, caught and caged? That he\u2019d saved her. If he told them the truth, he would guarantee their participation in his war. A war he placed above everything else in his life, even love. Why would he do that? For her?</p><p>Tears suddenly burned her eyes, threatening to spill over. Well, she could do something for him. \u201cActually, the Hunters brought me in,\u201d Gwen admitted, twisting the sheets.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Sabin said. A warning.</p><p>\u201cThey need to know everything.\u201d For his sake, and her own. Gathering her strength, she told her sisters about her confinement, leaving no detail out. As she spoke, the tears fell freely. Only a few minutes passed, but they were the most mortifying minutes of her life. Sabin, like her sisters, admired strength. Ferocity. Yet here she was, broadcasting her weakness to the only people who mattered to her.</p><p>He surprised her by tenderly wiping away the salty beads that cascaded down her cheeks with the pad of his thumb. That made her cry even harder.</p><p>When she finished, silence encompassed the room. Tension thickened the air, creating a crackling suspension of time.</p><p>Taliyah was the first to speak. \u201cHow did they get you?\u201d</p><p>The cold tone of her voice sent a shiver through Gwen. \u201cTyson forgot his cell phone one morning when he left for work, and I knew he\u2019d want it. But he was too far down the road for me to catch at human speed so I...\u201d She gulped. Such a stupid mistake, one she\u2019d regretted every day since. \u201cI used my wings and beat him to his office. Hunters saw me when I stopped, thought I had magically appeared, though I didn\u2019t know it at the time. I guess they followed me home, waited until later that night when Tyson and I\u2014\u201d she gulped \u201c\u2014fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept in bed with Tyson?\u201d three female voices said at once.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you Harpies and sleep?\u201d Sabin stiffened against her. \u201cNot that I think you\u2019re wrong to be disgusted by anyone in bed with chicken man. It\u2019s that bastard Tyson who needs to die. He didn\u2019t protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did you,\u201d Taliyah said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alive because of Sabin.\u201d Gwen offered him a shaky smile. \u201cAnd Tyson\u2019s not a bad guy. He tried to save me before they knocked him out.\u201d Even though he\u2019d been upset with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he\u2019d come home from work that evening, he hadn\u2019t wanted to talk about what had happened. She\u2019d utterly freaked him out by beating him to his office\u2014because he\u2019d already begun to notice other, weirder things about her.</p><p>She\u2019d hidden her dark side as best she could but sometimes it had emerged despite her, and he would come home to holes in the wall, ripped sheets, smashed dishes. Once, during a silly argument about whose turn it was to pick what DVD they\u2019d watch, she\u2019d even shoved him into a wall and the plaster had collapsed on him. They\u2019d kissed and made up, but that had been the beginning of the end.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she continued, \u201cI found myself wrapped up, unable to move, barely able to breathe as the Hunters flew me to Egypt. They locked me up and twelve months later Sabin and the other Lords set me free and brought me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed the men responsible for her torment, of course?\u201d Taliyah asked Sabin.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cGwen killed one. I killed some of the others.\u201d</p><p>Her powder blue eyes flared in anger. \u201cWhy not all? And good job, Gwen,\u201d she added with a nod of approval.</p><p>Before she could admit it had been an accident, Sabin said, \u201cThe survivors are being held in my dungeon and tortured for information.\u201d</p><p>Taliyah\u2019s shoulders relaxed somewhat. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, then.\u201d She turned back to Gwen. \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p><p>Gwen cast a sideways glance at Sabin. Very clearly she recalled stealing his sandwich and stuffing it into her mouth. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, he gave no reaction. With Tyson, she\u2019d stolen their food from nearby restaurants and passed it off as her own cooking. He\u2019d never known. He would have rebuked her. Would Sabin? She didn\u2019t think so. He\u2019d smiled at her when she\u2019d taken things from the store.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go home, then?\u201d Kaia jumped onto the side of the bed, causing the mattress to bounce. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m more than ready to blow this joint. I know you like your demon, so you can bring him if you want. Whether he wants to come or not. We\u2019ll get you tucked safely away and come back for the Hunters. They will pay for what they did to you. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014well...\u201d Did she want to go home? Hidden, safe, everyone else taking care of things? Hadn\u2019t she gone to Georgia in part to escape just that? And while she liked being with Sabin, she knew he would be miserable trapped in Alaska with no one to fight. He would grow to resent her.</p><p>So if she went home, she\u2019d have to go alone. The thought left a hollow ache in her chest. What she and Sabin had done in the shower...she wanted it again. I thought there could be no more of that. I thought it was too dangerous. But faced with the possibility of going without it, without him, of never knowing what it would be like to be possessed by him, totally and completely, none of the reasons for staying away from him seemed to matter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d Sabin said.</p><p>Lord love domineering men. Sometimes. \u201cRight. I\u2019m staying.\u201d Gwen peered over at her sisters, silently beseeching them to understand, to accept. They watched her for a long while, as quiet as she was.</p> <p>Bianka was the first to speak. \u201cFine. But where should we store our gear?\u201d she asked on a sigh.</p><p>Gwen had known they\u2019d want to stay, as well, and that both delighted and worried her. Sabin, at least, didn\u2019t bat an eye. \u201cThere\u2019s an empty room beside this one. Mind sharing?\u201d</p><p>He was giving them a room of their own after denying Gwen the same privilege?</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t mind,\u201d Taliyah said. \u201cBut tell me, what are your plans for the Hunters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill them. All of them. We\u2019ll never know peace as long as they\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWell, lucky you, you\u2019ve got yourself three new soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d Gwen rushed out before she could stop herself. She\u2019d meant what she said, she realized. She really did want to stop the Hunters. She wanted to protect her sisters and Sabin from them. And for once, she wanted to prove herself worthy.</p><p>Once more, everyone focused on her. Sabin, with anger\u2014though she didn\u2019t know why. He wanted her to do this, didn\u2019t he? Bianka and Kaia, with indulgence. And Taliyah, with determination.</p> <p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t just lie there,\u201d Kaia said, arms lifting and dropping at her sides in exasperation. \u201cGet up. We\u2019ve got a war to win.\u201d</p><p>Sabin ran a hand down his suddenly drawn face. \u201cWelcome to my army, girls.\u201d</p><p>HE WAS GWEN\u2019S CONSORT, her sisters had said. Sabin took that to mean they thought she belonged to him. He wasn\u2019t sure he believed it himself, but damn if he didn\u2019t like the thought. He still couldn\u2019t keep her, though, not without destroying her. At least, not as things stood.</p><p>She spent the rest of the day and night in bed, though she never fell asleep again. Determined to find out why, he left her alone the next morning and went in search of Anya. He found her in the entertainment room, finishing another video game with Gilly. He told her about the arrival of their guests and she clapped happily.\u201cLucien told me you texted him about guests, but I had no idea they were more Harpies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you know. They\u2019re in the gym. So what\u2019s the deal with Harpies sleeping?\u201d</p><p>She laughed in his face. \u201cFigure it out on your own,\u201d she said, sauntering to the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got a Skyhawk reunion to see to.\u201d</p><p>He followed her into the gym, curious as to how such a reunion would go down.</p><p>The trio\u2014who had already made themselves at home, with everything\u2014spotted the goddess, stopped tossing and catching barbells as if they were tiny stones, and ran to her, throwing their arms around her.</p><p>\u201cAnya! You took off without a word, you bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>They threw the questions at her simultaneously, but Anya seemed unfazed. \u201cSorry about that, girlies. I\u2019ve been all over the world. You know, seeing the sights, causing trouble and falling in love with Death himself. I\u2019m here because this is home. Like what I\u2019ve done with the place?\u201d</p><p>They continued to hug and talk and laugh. Sabin tried to butt in a few times, but was steadfastly ignored. Finally he gave up and left them to it, meaning to find Anya later and once again ask her about Harpy sleeping arrangements. Asking the sisters was out of the question. Harpies, he\u2019d already learned, lived by their own set of rules, and he didn\u2019t want to inadvertently demean Gwen with his ignorance.</p><p>Gwen.</p><p>Every minute with her was dangerous. Last night had been the worst. He\u2019d remained by her side, smelling her femininity, hearing the cotton glide over her skin, but they\u2019d kept their distance from each other, remaining on separate sides of the mattress. He would have taken her\u2014he was weak where she, that luscious body and that lickable skin were concerned; there, he\u2019d finally admitted to a weakness\u2014but every time he\u2019d reached for her, Doubt had begun spreading its poison.</p><p>Will she die if you keep her? Will she want more than you can give, then leave you when you can\u2019t give it?</p><p>Once again, he hated the demon.</p><p>Only around her sisters did the little shit quiet, and Sabin didn\u2019t know why. He would figure it out, though. He was determined. Because, if he could somehow work it so that Doubt shut the hell up around Gwen, he could have her. Maybe forever.</p><p>After he checked on the prisoners\u2014who were still too weak to endure any more torture and survive\u2014he went to the kitchen to fix Gwen something to eat. All the food was gone. Talk about d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Nothing was left, not even a bag of chips. The Harpies had been here, he supposed.</p><p>With a sigh, he strode to his bedroom. Gwen was no longer in bed. Frowning, he began hunting her. He found her on the roof with Anya and her sisters\u2014the latter of whom were playing Who Can Fall From The Roof And Break The Least Amount Of Bones.</p><p>\u201cI leave you for less than an hour,\u201d he said to Gwen. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare jump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just watching,\u201d she assured him with a grin. A grin that made his chest ache.</p><p>A smattering of warriors stood on the ground below, watching as well. They wore resigned expressions, but mixed with the resignation was awe. They were drinking in that Harpy skin like it was wine.</p><p>\u201cEnough of this,\u201d Sabin said before one of the Harpies could jump again. \u201cWe have training to do.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t agree graciously, but they did agree and soon nearly every occupant of the fortress was on the ground, grunts and groans saturating the air, the scent of blood and sweat chasing nearby animals away.</p><p>Sabin stood on the sidelines, once again simply watching the happenings. Torin had just texted him and was on his way down.</p><p>Finally the warrior arrived. Keeping a good distance between them, Torin stopped at his side. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been so busy, I knew calling another meeting would do no good, so I\u2019ve been trying to catch everyone individually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He waggled his black eyebrows, which were a startling contrast to his white hair. \u201cFound an obscure tabloid article about a school for gifted children in Chicago. Children who can lift cars, get people to do whatever they want simply by speaking and move faster than the eye can see. And get this. The entire thing was denied by the World Institute of Parapsychology.\u201d</p><p>Sabin\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHunter High. Just like our prisoner told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Can\u2019t be a coincidence, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to search that facility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. That\u2019s why I\u2019m making arrangements for departure in two days. Some of you need to go, but some should stay and search for the people listed on the scrolls. I just need to know who\u2019s doing what.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been geared up to say he\u2019d go\u2014kill Hunters, rescue those kids and maybe finally draw Galen out of hiding\u2014when the rest of Torin\u2019s speech penetrated his mind. \u201cWait. Scrolls?\u201d</p><p>A soft breeze moved between them, ruffling Torin\u2019s hair. He smoothed the strands from his face with a glove-covered hand. \u201cCronus just paid me a visit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sabin\u2019s stomach clenched. \u201cI tried to summon him, but he ignored me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know the drill. \u2018Do as I command or I\u2019ll torture everyone you love,\u2019\u201d Torin said in a superior, arrogant tone.</p><p>The impersonation was dead-on. \u201cYeah, but what\u2019d he order you to do? Find people, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to that. You know he wants Galen dead as much as we do, right, since Danika predicted Galen will be the one to kill him? Well, the scrolls he gave me provide a list of names. Names of the other demon-possessed immortals. You won\u2019t believe how many there are. There are blank lines, though, as if several names were erased. Weird, huh? Think that means they somehow died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Only recently\u2014through Danika\u2014had he and the others learned that they weren\u2019t the only demon-possessed immortals running around. Seemed there had been more demons in Pandora\u2019s box than warriors in need of punishment, and so the remaining spirits had been placed inside the prisoners of Tartarus. Prisoners who were now missing.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Cronus thinks we can find our brethren and use them to contain Galen once and for all. They can help us lock him up, stop him from causing trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Sabin shook his head. \u201cThey were prisoners, which means even the gods couldn\u2019t control them. We can\u2019t trust them enough to use them. Besides, much as we want Galen dead, we all know how dangerous it would be to unleash his demon on the world. But what\u2019s to stop these strangers from doing just that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken. And yeah, we\u2019re merciful enough to allow him to keep his head for now, but Galen might not reciprocate in kind. These men are exactly the kind of creatures he would want for his army, which means we still need to find them before he does.\u201d</p><p>Sabin knew they also needed to make Cronus happy. Bad things happened when the god king didn\u2019t get his way. \u201cWe also have to find the remaining artifacts, and they seem a little more important at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t find them if we\u2019re overrun by immortal kids determined to destroy us,\u201d Torin said. \u201cSo, first and foremost, we have to find that school and neutralize the threat. You staying or going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d Sabin\u2019s gaze locked on Gwen, who fell to her ass to dodge her sister\u2019s poorly\u2014and purposely, he was sure\u2014aimed sword thrust. His hands curled into fists. Hurt her and die, he projected at the Harpy, though he knew the woman was caging the brunt of her strength. More than that, he knew he was a hypocrite for even thinking such a thing when he\u2019d vowed not to go easy on Gwen himself.</p><p>If he went to Chicago, he would have to leave Gwen behind. She just wasn\u2019t ready for battle yet. He could take her sisters with him, using them to safely gather the kids. Kids who would most assuredly fight him and the other Lords, since they had probably been raised to hate them. Or he could leave the Harpies behind to guard her. Neither option satisfied him. He didn\u2019t like the thought of Gwen alone. Well, not alone, but without him. And he didn\u2019t like the thought of unnecessarily scaring those kids.</p> <p>Clang. Click.</p><p>The clash of metal against metal pulled him from his musings. Gideon and Taliyah were sparring, their expressions dark, serious. So far, it was a draw. Strider and Bianka were throwing punches at each other, and Bianka was laughing. At first, Strider resisted a full-out clash with her; he held back, pulled his punches even though losing to her would mean a few days in bed, writhing in pain and crying for a mommy he\u2019d never had. Then Bianka broke his nose and kicked his balls into his throat. The fight was suddenly on.</p><p>Amun was finally up; he sat off to the side, polishing an ax and watching...someone. Sabin wasn\u2019t sure who. Yet. He suspected it was one of the Harpies.</p><p>\u201cWho do you have lined up so far?\u201d Sabin asked Torin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve asked.\u201d</p><p>Before he could talk himself out of it, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d War came first. \u201cGet me five other warriors. I\u2019ll try to get us a Harpy.\u201d That would leave two sisters here to protect Gwen, while giving him a small advantage.</p><p>Torin nodded and was off.</p><p>Decision made, Sabin strode forward. \u201cYou\u2019re babying her,\u201d he snapped at Kaia. Not exactly the correct way to get on the woman\u2019s good side, but he didn\u2019t care. Gwen\u2019s future well-being was too important for niceties. Sabin was only glad he wasn\u2019t thanking the Harpy for her gentleness.</p> <p>The redheaded Harpy swung around, tossing a dagger at his heart. \u201cThe hell I am! I\u2019ve thrown her six times.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and all six of those times he\u2019d wanted to throw Kaia. Scowling, he caught the hilt of the blade just before contact. \u201cYou relax your elbow just before striking. You\u2019re not teaching her the proper technique or even allowing her to learn your strengths and counteract. Hell, you\u2019re showing her that fighting unfairly and winning at any cost is wrong. Just...go find someone else to play with,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m taking over Gwen\u2019s lesson. You\u2019ve done enough damage. And if you dare interfere, you\u2019ll regret it. I don\u2019t care what you see, what you disagree with or don\u2019t like, you stay back. This is for her own good.\u201d</p><p>Kaia\u2019s mouth hung open, as if she couldn\u2019t believe someone had spoken to her like that. Then she was stalking to him, murder in her gaze, nails bared, sharp teeth gleaming in the sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m going to snap your neck like a twig, demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it,\u201d he said, waving his fingers at her in a mocking salute.</p><p>An earsplitting squawk suddenly erupted from sweet little Gwen.</p><p>Both he and Kaia froze. Even Taliyah and Bianka stopped their sparring to face Gwen as she crouched, sights locked on her redheaded sister. The whites of her eyes had already turned black.</p><p>\u201cAre you freaking kidding me?\u201d Kaia gasped out. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to attack me. What\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThreatened her man,\u201d Taliyah said coldly. \u201cYou knew better. I hope she claws her way to your spine.\u201d</p><p>Her man. Just the words had him rock hard, and it was freaking embarrassing. He couldn\u2019t allow her to hurt her sister. She\u2019d never forgive herself. Sabin walked to Gwen, each step slow, measured. \u201cGwen, you will calm down. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She snapped her teeth at him and almost nailed his chin. Only his quick reflexes saved him a severe biting. \u201cGwendolyn. That wasn\u2019t very nice. Shall I bite you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Okay, now he was harder than a rock. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t have anything left to bite if you don\u2019t calm down.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, that reached her. She licked her lips, eyes fading to normal, body straightening. A tremor moved through her, and she swayed on her feet. He didn\u2019t touch her, not yet. He wouldn\u2019t want to stop and they had witnesses.</p><p>A deep breath shuddered through her nose. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said brokenly, reminding him of the incident in the pyramid. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean...I shouldn\u2019t have...did I hurt anyone?\u201d Watery eyes lifted to him, the gold like the sun yet the gray like storm clouds.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll go back to our room. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to stay here and fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Expression shocked, she stumbled backward. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I thought you wanted me calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. For now.\u201d He gripped his shirt and tugged it over his head, then dropped the material at his feet. Automatically her gaze lowered to his ribs, where the points of his tattoo stretched. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight. You\u2019re not allowed to hurt anyone but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather study your tattoo,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to trace it in the shower, and I\u2019ve been dreaming of tracing it.\u201d</p><p>Dear Lord. Talk about the ultimate come-on. Rather than pounce on her as he wanted, he forced himself to kick out a leg, slamming her ankles together and sending her hurtling to the ground. \u201cFirst lesson. Distraction will get you killed.\u201d</p><p>Air shot from her parted lips, and she gazed up at him with disbelief. Even...betrayal?</p><p>Gods. Had he really done that? Harden your heart, asshole. Treat her like Cameo. Like her sisters. Like any other female.</p><p>She\u2019ll hate you. She\u2019ll\u2014</p><p>Not another word.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>Silence!</p><p>\u201cYou tripped me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And he\u2019d do much, much more before they were finished. Had to be this way. He couldn\u2019t show her any mercy. Otherwise, she\u2019d never learn. Would never be safe.</p><p>Thankfully her sisters maintained their distance and didn\u2019t try to stop him.</p><p>\u201cUp.\u201d He held out a hand, and she grasped it. But he didn\u2019t help her to her feet. He jerked her into his body, rattling her brain and pinning her arms at her sides. \u201cSecond lesson. An opponent will never aid you. He might act like he wants to, but never, ever believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Now let go.\u201d She struggled, and he released her, letting her fall back to the ground. Immediately she popped to her feet, eyes shooting fire at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo dramatic. Toughen up. You aren\u2019t human. Everything I dish, you can take. You know that deep down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll see,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>For the next hour, he worked her over. Hand to hand combat, daggers. To her credit, she didn\u2019t complain, didn\u2019t beg to stop. She did wince several times, yelp once and twice he thought she verged on tears. His chest had constricted painfully at that, and he\u2019d found himself pulling back, not using all of his strength.</p><p>Just as Kaia had done.</p><p>Pussy. That\u2019s what he was. A disgrace to himself and his men. He was ready to quit, something he\u2019d never done before. Something he\u2019d be teased about for the rest of his endless life.</p><p>All of the Lords, all of the Harpies, William, Ashlyn, Anya and Danika were now watching avidly. Some were throwing popcorn at them. Some were placing bets on who would win. William was hitting on Gwen\u2019s sisters\u2014not literally. Gwen was shaking, her every strike tentative. She wouldn\u2019t last five minutes in a real battle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t even close to hurting me,\u201d he barked. \u201cCome on. Make me work for it. I\u2019m all over you and you\u2019re taking it. Letting me. Almost welcoming me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Sweat dripped from her face, and her shirt was plastered to her chest. \u201cI\u2019m not welcoming you. I hate you.\u201d</p><p>Everyone he\u2019d ever trained had said that at one point or another, but this was the first time he\u2019d ever felt the words in his soul, burning, aching. \u201cThen why haven\u2019t you given up? Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to learn to fight?\u201d he demanded, easily tripping her again. He wanted her to voice her reasons for pushing herself so hard. Maybe it would motivate her. \u201cYou could be hurt. By me. By Hunters.\u201d</p> <p>She went down, but quickly jumped back up, spitting dirt. Cuts and bruises marred her from head to toe. Her jeans had been ripped to shreds from her many tumbles.</p><p>\u201cHunters deserve to die.\u201d She remained in place, panting. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve already been hurt. I survived. I healed.\u201d</p><p>Because of his blood. It was the hottest thing he\u2019d ever done, giving his essence to a woman. He wanted to give her more, every drop. The craving had grown with every hour that passed.</p><p>Sabin scoured a hand down his face, wiping away grime. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working.\u201d She couldn\u2019t take much more, and he wasn\u2019t sure how much more he could dish. \u201cWe need to try something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing we haven\u2019t tried is unleashing my Harpy. Then you\u2019d be sorry. She\u2019s desperate to get her hands on you.\u201d There was relish in her tone.</p> <p>His eyes widened. Of course. \u201cYou\u2019re right. If you plan to fight Hunters,\u201d which he wasn\u2019t sure he would allow anymore\u2014wait, where had that thought come from?\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll have to learn to summon your Harpy quickly. Which means you need to summon her now and train with her.\u201d</p><p>Every speck of color in Gwen\u2019s lovely face drained. She shook her head. \u201cI was taunting you, trying to scare you. I wasn\u2019t serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to rethink this, demon,\u201d Bianka called from the sidelines, tossing her black hair over her shoulder. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t learned to control her Harpy yet. Piss her off, and she might eat even you.\u201d</p><p>He turned, giving Gwen his profile. Part of him hoped she would attack him, prove she\u2019d been listening and go for blood the moment her opponent\u2019s attention veered. But she didn\u2019t. Too softhearted, he supposed. \u201cAnd you have? Learned to control it?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled into a smile. \u201cYes. Only took me twenty years, but then, I like that part of myself and Gwen never has.\u201d</p><p>Great. He realized in that moment that he couldn\u2019t leave Gwen when he traveled to Chicago, not even with two of her sisters guarding her. If she accidentally lost control of her Harpy, she could hurt the warriors who\u2019d remained behind. He was the only one who seemed capable of calming her. Could he take her with him, though, and leave her somewhere while he traipsed off to war? Alone? Unprotected?</p> <p>Shit. He was going to have to stay here with her.</p><p>Surprisingly, the decision brought relief rather than irritation.</p><p>\u201cHow did you finally learn?\u201d he asked Bianka.</p><p>\u201cPractice. Regrets.\u201d The last was said with a hint of sadness. She\u2019d probably killed people she cared about, even as Gwen feared doing.</p><p>He focused fully on Gwen. \u201cWell, we\u2019re gonna have to put you on an accelerated program. So let the Harpy out. She and I are going to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Violently she shook her head again, even backed away from him, palms outstretched to keep him at bay. \u201cNo way in hell.\u201d</p><p>Very well. He popped his jaw. This is for her own good. Do it. You have to. A deep breath, then, Doubt. Have at her.</p><p>Happy to finally get to work without restriction, the demon swooped on her in a single heartbeat. He had your sister pinned to a bed yesterday. She\u2019s so pretty, so strong. I wonder if he wishes you\u2019d never woken up. If he wishes he\u2019d never fed you his blood to make you strong. I wonder if he\u2019s imagining Kaia in bed with him even now, all that hair spread over his thighs as she sucks him dry. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s pushing you so hard\u2014so you\u2019ll walk away from him, leaving the field wide open for your sister. Or maybe he hopes you\u2019ll be so sore, you won\u2019t protest if he decides to make another go at her. Tonight. All night.</p> <p>One second Gwen was in front of him, the next she was gripping him, flying him through the air, forest buzzing past, a blur. After an eternity, his back slammed into a tree trunk, and breathing became an impossible dream.</p><p>Her teeth were bared, her claws ripping away his pants. He grabbed Gwen by the shoulders, not knowing whether to push her away or draw her closer. She was Harpy, totally and completely, her eyes a perfect night sky, hair feathered back from her wild expression.</p><p>\u201cGwen. We need to go back to the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d she said, her voice high-pitched, and then her teeth were deep in his neck and he couldn\u2019t have moved to save his life. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. Mine!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>GWEN\u2019S MIND WAS a whirl of activity. Most of it turbulent, dark. Last night, she\u2019d tried to ignore Sabin\u2019s appeal because he hadn\u2019t seemed to want her. He\u2019d slept next to her\u2014his lemon and mint scent in her nose, his heat wafting to her, his raspy breaths ringing in her ears, her body attuned to his every movement, skin itching for a touch, a single touch, heart racing\u2014but he hadn\u2019t made a move. Ignoring him was no longer an option.</p><p>She was becoming obsessed with him. She wanted to learn more about him. She wanted to spend every minute of every day with him. She wanted to possess him. Will possess him, a voice screeched in her mind. The Harpy. The one now pulling her strings, urging her to do all the naughty things she\u2019d been fantasizing about. So what that Sabin wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d always wanted for herself. So what that he would betray her in an instant if it meant winning his war. There was nothing wrong with enjoying the here and now. With him. If he thought to take her sisters...She\u2019d known the demon of Doubt had whispered those terrible things to her. She\u2019d recognized its poisonous murmur, but had been unable to stop the flood of violence that raged through her. Sabin and Kaia\u2014hell, no. No one touched him, including her loved ones. Might be irrational of her, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Several times he\u2019d claimed to desire only Gwen. Well, he was damn well going to prove it.</p><p>She had him pinned to a tree, and there was nothing he could do to escape. He was hers. Hers, hers, hers to do with as she pleased. And right now, she wanted him naked. He\u2019d already removed his shirt on the field, so all that remained were his pants. She worked at buttons, then the zipper. In seconds, the denim was nothing more than ribbons in the warm breeze.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t wearing underwear.</p><p>\u201cI think my briefs were stolen,\u201d he said sheepishly, following her gaze.</p><p>His erection sprang free, long, thick, proud, and she gasped in pleasure. His testicles were heavy and drawn up tight. Sunlight poured over him, turning the bronze of his skin to a delicious gold. Today he\u2019d pushed her around, and she\u2019d taken it without (much) complaint. Deep down, she\u2019d known she needed his brand of training. Never again did she want to be shot up like a turkey at Christmas. Plus, part of her really did want to defeat the men who\u2019d abused her. Plus, she\u2019d wanted to impress Sabin. He valued strength.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d she said, wrapping her fingers around his cock. She didn\u2019t recognize her voice. It was higher, raspier. A bead of moisture coated her hand.</p><p>He arched his hips forward, forcing her hand to slide to the base of his shaft. \u201cYes,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>Her grip tightened. Her vision was a bit distorted, fuzzed to infrared, so she could see the heat pulsing from him. \u201cTell your demon to keep his mouth shut or I\u2019ll gut him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been quiet since you rammed me.\u201d</p><p>Good. She must have scared the forest animals and insects, as well, because there wasn\u2019t a chirp or footfall to be heard. She and Sabin were completely alone, about a mile from where they\u2019d been training. \u201cRip off my clothes. Now.\u201d</p><p>Unused to taking commands, he reacted slowly to hers. She released him to do it herself, and he growled. \u201cPut your hand back.\u201d</p><p>The moment she did, he was tugging at her clothes, doing whatever was necessary to remove them without disrupting the connection between them. Finally, she was naked, their heated skin was touching and he was moaning.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d He ran his hands down her back, paused. \u201cWings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Warm air caressed her, hardening her nipples, stoking the wet ache between her legs. A constant ache. One that hadn\u2019t left since that time in the shower.</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d He spun her around. For a moment, there was nothing, no reaction, no comment; he didn\u2019t even breathe. Then he placed a soft kiss on one of the tiny, fluttering protrusions. \u201cThey\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>No man had ever seen her wings. She\u2019d even kept them hidden from Tyson, never letting them peek from the slits in her back. They set her apart, proved how different she was. But under Sabin\u2019s gaze, she felt...proud. Shivering, she pivoted on her heel, returning to her former position. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you want to do this, Gwendolyn?\u201d His voice was husky and thick, almost drugged.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t stop me.\u201d Nothing would stop her, actually, not even a protest from him. She was going to have him, know his taste, feel him inside her, today, now, this moment. Part of her knew she was not herself just then, but the other part of her didn\u2019t care. Once Sabin had thought to mark her to keep his friends away from her. Now she was going to mark him.</p><p>\u201cSure you want it and not just your Harpy?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t make her feel guilty about this. \u201cStop talking. I\u2019m going to have you. I don\u2019t care what you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Her world spun, and then jagged bark was cutting into her back. Sabin kicked her ankles, shooting her legs apart. He quickly inserted a thigh, placing her clitoris right above his knee. \u201cThere\u2019ll be consequences. I hope you know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you talking?\u201d Because his erection was so thick, she hadn\u2019t been able to close her fingers around it and easily lost her grip. That pissed her off, and she snarled. \u201cGive back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he vowed, biting her earlobe. To distract her, the diabolical man? Didn\u2019t matter, it worked.</p><p>As she cried out at the exquisite sensation, he descended, claiming her mouth with his own. His tongue plunged deep, taking, giving, demanding, seeking, begging, rolling, branding every inch of her. The taste of mint hit her first, then lemons, then the flavors became a part of her, his breath hers.</p><p>Her fingers tangled in his hair and drew him closer. Their teeth scraped, and he angled, sinking deeper. Her breasts rubbed against his chest, the friction so decadent her legs were trembling. And then her legs weren\u2019t holding her up anymore\u2014his were. She had propped herself completely on his knee, was gliding up and down, back and forth, zings of sensation rocketing through her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tight grip,\u201d he rasped out.</p><p>Took every ounce of humanity inside her, but she loosened it. Disappointment filled her, and the Harpy squawked, demanding she make him like it.</p><p>Sabin frowned down at her. \u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s a tight grip, but I want tighter. You\u2019re not going to break me, Gwen.\u201d As he palmed and squeezed her ass, urging her on, he ducked his head and sucked hard on one of her nipples.</p><p>She cried out, her belly quivering, her hands back in his hair and tugging forcefully. His words...damn, they were as beautiful as a caress, freeing in a way she\u2019d never imagined. \u201cI love how strong you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here. I want everything you have to give.\u201d He kicked at her ankles and she tumbled to the ground. Sabin followed her down, never slowing his quest to her core. When he reached it, he spread her legs as far as they would go and just looked at her.</p><p>\u201cTouch,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty. So pink and wet.\u201d His eyelids had dropped to half-mast, and he licked his lips as though he could already imagine her taste. Those dark eyes were luminous. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a man?\u201d</p><p>No reason to lie. \u201cYou know I have.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in his jaw. \u201cThat fucker Tyson treated you properly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d How could he have done anything but, as tame as they\u2019d been with each other? But right here, right now, she didn\u2019t want tame. As Sabin had said, she couldn\u2019t break him. Anything she gave, he could take...he wanted. Though he hadn\u2019t even entered her, her pleasure soared to a new level.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d he muttered, rolling her nipples between his fingers. \u201cDo you still think of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And she didn\u2019t want to talk about him, either. \u201cHave you had a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many, considering how old I am. But perhaps more than a human will ever have.\u201d</p><p>At least he was honest about it. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to kill them.\u201d Sadly, that was not an empty boast. Gwen had always abhorred violence, had always fled from a fight, but right now she happily could have sunk a dagger into the heart of every woman who had tasted this man. He belonged to her.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Sabin said, ghosts in his eyes. Then he dove for her, licked the core of her and groaned, his expression flooding with pleasure.</p><p>Her back arched, her gaze shooting straight to the heavens. Sweet fire, that felt good. She reached behind her and latched on to the base of a tree, instinctively knowing she needed to hold on for the ride of her life.</p> <p>\u201cMore?\u201d he asked huskily.</p><p>\u201cMore!\u201d</p><p>Over and over he tongued her, and then his fingers joined the play, spreading her, sinking deep. She didn\u2019t have to ask him if he liked it; he was lapping her up as if she was candy and she was arching in to every sensual glide.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he praised. \u201cThat\u2019s the way. I\u2019ve got my cock in my hand, can\u2019t help myself, imagining it\u2019s your hand, while I\u2019ve got heaven in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her cries echoed through the forest, each more hoarse than the other. Almost there...so close...\u201cSabin. Please.\u201d His teeth grazed her clitoris, and that was all it took. She climaxed, skin tightening, muscles jumping in joy, bones locking together.</p><p>He lapped until he\u2019d sucked down every drop.</p><p>As she panted, Sabin flipped her over and propped her on her hands and knees. He teased her with the tip of his shaft, running it along her folds but not yet entering.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt your wings.\u201d</p><p>Sweet man. \u201cLet me taste you,\u201d she said, and he groaned. She wanted to lick his tattoo, as well. It drew her, was an aphrodisiac all on its own, yet she\u2019d never gotten a chance to study it the way she craved.</p><p>\u201cYou taste me, and I won\u2019t be able to make love to you. I really want to make love to you. But the choice is yours.\u201d He pressed his chest into her back, his face only an inch away from hers.</p><p>His shaft in her mouth or between her legs. Hard choice, literally. In the end, though, she opted for what she\u2019d spent last night fantasizing about. She had to know what it was like to be his woman. Completely. Otherwise, she\u2019d regret the lack for the rest of her life. However long or short that was. Being shot and realizing she did indeed want to help bring those Hunters down had taught her one thing: time wasn\u2019t a guarantee, even for immortals.</p><p>\u201cNext time, then.\u201d She reached around, clamping down on a handful of his hair and jerking his mouth to hers. His tongue plunged deep again, and this time he was flavored with her.</p><p>He positioned himself at her entrance, but just before sliding home, he stiffened. Cursed. \u201cI don\u2019t have a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarpies are only fertile once a year, and this isn\u2019t it.\u201d Another reason Chris had been willing to hold her for so long. \u201cInside. Now.\u201d</p><p>In the next instant, Sabin\u2019s shaft was buried all the way to the hilt. The kiss halted as she gave another cry of pleasure. He stretched her, filled her up, touched every part of her, and it was even better than she\u2019d dreamed.</p><p>He bit her earlobe. Still reaching around, she dug her nails into his shoulder, felt warm blood trickle as he hissed in a breath. Hmm, the sweet smell of it drifted to her and her mouth watered. \u201cI want\u2014I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want is yours.\u201d On and on he pounded inside her, forward and back, fast, hard, his testicles slapping at her.</p><p>\u201cWant...all. Everything.\u201d With the feel of him, she became mindless, lost, no longer Gwen or the Harpy but an extension of Sabin. \u201cWant your blood,\u201d she added. Only his. The thought of anyone else\u2019s left her hollow, unsatisfied.</p><p>Sabin withdrew from her completely.</p><p>A whimper escaped her. \u201cSabin\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was lying on the ground, fitting her over him, deep inside her, pumping, sliding, gliding a second later. One of her knees dug into a twig and got cut, but even that seemed to lull her into a state of utter sensation. Pleasure, pain, didn\u2019t matter. Each fed off the other and dragged her further and further into a black sea of bliss.</p><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d he commanded, gripping her head and forcing her mouth to his neck.</p><p>Her teeth had already sharpened. Without hesitation, she bit him. He roared, loud and long, and she sucked the warm liquid deep into her throat, her tongue dancing over his skin. Like a drug, it spread through her, the warmth becoming a sizzle, blistering, scorching her veins. Soon she was trembling, writhing against him.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she said. She wanted everything he had, every drop. Had to have it. Would\u2014kill him, she realized, forcing herself to jerk upright. His cock slid even deeper, and she shivered. \u201cI almost drank too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Now give me more. Everything, like you said.\u201d</p><p>Up and down she rode him, his fingertips clutching her so tightly they nearly broke skin. The fear of hurting him faded, leaving only a consuming sense of neediness.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way. So good...so very good...\u201d He was panting, grinding against her, his thumb stroking her clit. \u201cDon\u2019t want it...to end.\u201d</p><p>Neither did she. Nothing had ever consumed her like this. Nothing had ever taken over her mind and body so fervently, to the point that nothing else mattered. Her sisters could find them, could be searching even now. Swift as they moved, they could be here already. Can\u2019t stop. Need more.</p><p>Her head fell back, the ends of her hair brushing his chest. Reaching up, he cupped and kneaded her breasts, applying a little pressure to arch her backward. She complied, anchoring her hands on his thighs.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he commanded roughly. \u201cI want your blood.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she hesitated too long\u2014what exactly did he want? Had she heard correctly? He palmed her knees, lifting, and spun her. His cock remained inside her. When she was facing the other direction, away from him, his fingers curled around her neck and drew her down. Her back to his chest. His teeth were in her neck a second later, and she was spasming, screaming at the bliss.</p><p>He didn\u2019t suck her long, just enough to experience his own orgasm, hips hammering up and into her, one hand flat on her stomach to grind her against him. Nothing compared. Nothing was as wild, as necessary, as liberating. She and the Harpy soared through the heavens, lost in the pleasure of another climax.</p><p>An eternity passed before she collapsed, fully and completely spent, unable to breathe. Her chest was too constricted. Sabin\u2019s inhalations were choppy, as well, his grip on her now weak.</p><p>The Harpy was quiet, had quite possibly passed out. Gwen didn\u2019t roll off him, even though she wanted to pass out, as well. She\u2019d been fighting sleep for so long, restful sleep untainted by pain and injury, but now it was creeping up on her, determined to consume her.</p><p>She lay exactly as she was, head cushioned by Sabin\u2019s neck, his arms wrapped around her, his shaft still inside her. Stars winked in front of her eyes\u2014or maybe it was the sun dancing between the clouds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What they\u2019d just done...the things they\u2019d done...</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t rape you, did I?\u201d she asked softly. Her cheeks burned. Without the cloud of lust, she admitted that she\u2019d been jealous, attacked him, and had decided to have sex with him whether he wanted it or not.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I was kind of forceful.\u201d Her eyelids were so heavy she blinked\u2014closed, open, closed\u2014and then they refused to open again, as though they were glued together. If her sisters found her asleep, they\u2019d freak out. They\u2019d be disappointed in her, and they\u2019d have every right. Had she learned nothing from her capture?</p><p>\u201cActually, you were kind of perfect.\u201d</p><p>Words to make her melt. Instead, she stiffened, still fighting with all her might to remain awake for just a little longer. Anytime she and Sabin relaxed together, no anger between them, Doubt usually pounced.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, suddenly concerned.</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for Doubt to try and tear me down.\u201d Were her words truly as slurred as they sounded to her? \u201cYou say something nice, and he\u2019s knocking on my door to point out why you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Sabin pressed a soft kiss into the side of her neck. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of your Harpy, I think. She comes out, and he goes into hiding.\u201d Joy and awe had entered in his tone there at the end, as if he\u2019d reached some sort of decision with those words. But what?</p><p>\u201cSomeone afraid of me.\u201d She grinned slowly. \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He stroked between her breasts, his index finger grazing a nipple. \u201cDo Harpies have any weaknesses I should know about?\u201d</p><p>Yes, but to admit it was to court punishment. Her sisters would cut her off as her mother had; they would have to. It was a rule that couldn\u2019t be broken. Lethargy fragmented her thoughts before she could reason things out. She yawned and settled more snugly against him, fading...still struggling...</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d</p><p>A soft entreaty, but it pounded through her mind, and she grabbed on to it like a life preserver. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI lost you there for a moment. You were telling me about a Harpy\u2019s greatest weakness.\u201d</p><p>Was she? \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make sure you\u2019re protected so no one can use it against you.\u201d</p><p>Good idea. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually considering this. But this was Sabin, the man who\u2019d just kissed and touched her everywhere. The man who wanted her strong, invincible. And she didn\u2019t like that she had such a weakness, either. It was how the Hunters had subdued her, though they had never realized exactly what they\u2019d done. It was what flooded her with worry every time her sisters decided to hire out their services.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t use it to hurt you. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Once he\u2019d admitted to forsaking his honor if it meant winning a battle. Would he forsake this vow? She sighed, sinking further under the blackness. Stay awake. You have to stay awake. This came down to one decision: to trust him or not. He desperately wanted her to help destroy his enemy. No way would he jeopardize that by betraying her.</p><p>\u201cOur wings. Break them, cut them off, bind them, and we\u2019re powerless. That\u2019s how the Hunters got me. They didn\u2019t know it, but when they wrapped me in that blanket to abduct me, they paralyzed my wings, thereby weakening me.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her tight. In comfort? \u201cMaybe we can design something to protect them, something that still allows them to move freely. But you\u2019re also going to need to train with them bound. It\u2019s the only way to...\u201d</p> <p>His voice faded completely, the darkness thicker than ever. Lord, she\u2019d done so many bad, bad things this last hour. She\u2019d given him her body and snuggled in as though he were a comfortable couch. Harpy rule: always leave afterward.</p><p>If she fell asleep, Sabin would have to carry her out of the forest, past her sisters, who would see her zonked out and vulnerable, just as she\u2019d feared.</p><p>I\u2019m a failure in every way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...let...them see,\u201d she managed before sinking into oblivion.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>DON\u2019T LET THEM SEE...what? Sabin wondered as he gathered the sleeping Gwen in his arms. A mewling sound parted her lips, soft and oddly erotic. He tightened his grip, feeling oddly protective.</p><p>Don\u2019t let the Lords see her naked body? Done. He would rather die than allow another man a peek at her beauty.Don\u2019t let her sisters see her like this? Again, done. They would ask questions he wasn\u2019t ready to answer. More than that, they tended to react negatively to the thought of Gwen snoozing. Why? It still made no sense to him.</p><p>Another mewl, this one quieter, breathy. His stomach clenched in desire, because it was a sound she\u2019d made while grinding on his erection. The sun stroked her, highlighting the glimmer of her skin, her rosy nipples. Her hands were folded over her belly, her body loose, her head resting trustingly at the base of his neck. Strawberry curls tumbled over his arm, his stomach, and it felt as if he were draped in silk.</p><p>Should he dress her? No, he thought a moment later. He didn\u2019t want to jostle her and accidentally wake her. Finally, she was resting. Truly resting. And all he\u2019d had to do was pleasure her senseless, he thought dryly. Then he grinned. If he had to, he would pleasure her senseless every night. Girl needed her rest, after all. And (cough, cough) he was used to making sacrifices.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even consider dressing himself. He would have had to put her down and coverage wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to risk a twig poking her or a bug crawling on her.</p><p>Sabin kissed her temple, unable to help himself, and stalked forward. Remaining in shadows, he edged toward the back of the fortress, always careful of the cameras, pits and trip wires he and the other warriors had designed to keep Hunters out.</p><p>What had just happened between him and Gwen...He\u2019d never experienced anything like it before. Not even with Darla, whom he had loved.</p><p>And unlike Darla, Gwen just might be strong enough to cope with his demon over the long term. It had been a startling, and welcome, revelation.</p><p>Do you really think you can keep her? How long will she love you, if she\u2019s ever stupid enough to love you? You might betray her. And you\u2019re always rushing off to fight. Worse, you plan to fight beside her sisters. What if they\u2019re killed? Gwen will blame you, and rightly so.</p><p>The doubts didn\u2019t float through him. They screamed, pounding into his temples, beating at his skull. He cringed from the sharp ache of it. Now that Gwen was asleep, her Harpy tethered, Sabin\u2019s demon had come out of hiding, pissed and desperate to feed.</p><p>What better to feed on than the secret fears Sabin only then realized he\u2019d harbored? And now that they\u2019d been forced to the forefront of his mind, there was no blocking them; they nearly swallowed him whole.</p><p>Did he want Gwen to love him?</p><p>To have those amber eyes regard him softly, today, tomorrow, forever...to have that luscious body in his bed every night...to hear that sparkling laughter...to protect her...to awaken her to the strength of her true nature...</p><p>Yes, he wanted her to love him. She could handle his demon in mental combat, as he\u2019d just discovered. Hell, she\u2019d frightened the beast into submission.</p><p>Part of him had loved her since the moment he\u2019d seen her, he realized. When she\u2019d been captive, helpless, his every instinct had clamored to save her. Then, as she\u2019d struggled to keep her Harpy under tight control, to follow the rules of her people, he\u2019d found himself fascinated by her. But he\u2019d never really understood her, had mistakenly thought her weak. Now, he saw her for what she really was: stronger than her sisters, stronger than him.</p><p>For most of her life, she\u2019d suppressed a seemingly insuppressible brute. Sabin had trouble caging his demon for more than a day. She\u2019d left her family to pursue her own dream. She hadn\u2019t run from him, even when she\u2019d discovered his origins and even though she\u2019d been afraid.</p><p>Oh, yes. There was more courage in this tiny female than anyone had realized. Even Gwen. Now, because of him, she wanted to attack the Hunters. She wanted to place herself in danger, each and every day.</p><p>If she were injured, she would heal. That, he knew. Rationally, at least. The thought of her injured, bloodied, broken, however, nearly had him roaring as he snuck in one of the back entrances to the fortress. I\u2019m a fucking idiot!</p><p>No argument here.</p><p>Frowning, he made his way to a secret passage, a passage Torin monitored.</p><p>Sabin stared up at one of the hidden cameras and shook his head, a command for his friend\u2019s silence. Never once did he slow his gait, though. When he reached his bedroom, he barricaded the door. Did Gwen love him? She was attracted to him, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have given herself to him. And so passionately, at that, gifting him with the best orgasm of his long, long life. She trusted him, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have admitted her greatest weakness. But love?</p><p>If she did love him, could that love withstand the trials they were sure to face? Yes or no, he realized he wouldn\u2019t let her go. She belonged to him now, and he belonged to her. He\u2019d warned her there would be consequences to giving herself to him.</p><p>He wanted to know everything about her. He wanted to see to her every need. Pamper her. Kill anyone who hurt her\u2014even her sisters.</p><p>He\u2019d once told her that he could\u2014and would\u2014sleep with a woman other than the one he loved if it meant aiding his cause. How silly he\u2019d been. How naive. The thought of bedding another woman left him cold. Even sick. No one would feel, sound and taste like his Gwen. More than that, it would hurt her, and he couldn\u2019t hurt her. And the thought of Gwen bedding another man\u2014touching him, kissing him, enjoying him\u2014just to win a battle sent Sabin into a killing rage.</p><p>What if she wants another man? Desires him? Craves\u2014</p><p>Another word, and I swear to the gods I\u2019ll find Pandora\u2019s box and suck you out by the balls.</p><p>You\u2019d die. There was a tremor to the words.</p><p>You\u2019d suffer. And we both know I\u2019ll spite myself to destroy my enemy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Who would guard your precious Gwen?</p><p>Her sisters. Shall I go get them? Let you talk to them?</p><p>Silence. Sweet silence.</p> <p>Sabin gently placed Gwen on the bed and tucked the covers around her. A loud knock echoed from his door, and he scowled. Gwen didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t moan or act as if she was aware of the interruption in any way. That saved the intruder\u2019s life.</p><p>Three long strides and he was at the door, removing the barricade then ripping it open.</p><p>Kaia tried to push her way inside. \u201cWhere is she? You better not have hurt her, Mr. Pound On Gwen For Giggles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for giggles. It was to strengthen her, and you know it. You should be thanking me, since you failed to do your job. Now go.\u201d</p><p>She glared up at him, hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until I see her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>Golden eyes, so eerily similar to Gwen\u2019s, darted down his naked body. \u201cI see that. I still want to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t let them see, Gwen had beseeched. \u201cShe\u2019s naked.\u201d Truth. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to get back to her.\u201d Again, truth. \u201cYour conversation can wait.\u201d</p><p>A wide grin spread over the Harpy\u2019s beautiful face, and his shoulders sagged in relief. Thank the gods sex wasn\u2019t against those damned Harpy rules.</p><p>He and Gwen were going to have a long talk when she awoke, and she was going to outline exactly what was permitted and what wasn\u2019t. And then the rules he didn\u2019t agree with would be demolished.</p><p>\u201cMom would be so proud! Little Gwennie, bagging an evil demon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet lost.\u201d He slammed the door in her face. Then he grimaced and spun. Thankfully Gwen still hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>Throughout the day, warriors, females and Harpies alike came knocking on his door. He couldn\u2019t relax because he couldn\u2019t get Gwen\u2019s words out of his head. Don\u2019t let who see what, damn it? The sisters had already seen her sleeping with him, the night of their arrival, so now he wasn\u2019t sure that was such a big deal. They hadn\u2019t tried to punish her or anything. Was Gwen ashamed of the wounds in her neck? Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have bitten her.</p><p>The first visitors were Maddox and a smiling Ashlyn, holding a plate of sandwiches. \u201cAfter such an intense training session, I thought you and Gwen might be hungry.\u201d</p><p>Maddox hadn\u2019t been smiling, but he hadn\u2019t insisted Gwen be made to leave, either. \u201cThanks.\u201d Sabin took the plate and shut the door. He\u2019d pulled on a robe, wanting to give the appearance of a sexual marathon\u2014Kaia had seemed happy about that, so surely it wasn\u2019t shameful to the Harpies\u2014while still maintaining his dignity.</p><p>Next came Anya and Lucien. \u201cYou and Gwen wanna watch a slasher movie with us while we pretend to read those dusty scrolls but really make everyone else do all the work?\u201d Anya asked, waggling her eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Again, he shut the door.</p><p>A short while later, Bianka arrived. \u201cI need to talk to my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still busy.\u201d Sleeping. He shut the door in her scowling face.</p> <p>Finally the visits tapered off. Sabin texted Torin to let him know he was staying behind while the others went to Chicago.</p><p>Figured, was the reply. Which is why I already found you a replacement. Gideon\u2019s taking over the mission.</p><p>His relief was almost palpable. Leaving Gwen like this wasn\u2019t even an option.</p><p>If any of the men are injured, you\u2019ll blame yourself, Doubt said.</p><p>Sabin didn\u2019t try to deny it. With reason.</p><p>What if you begin to resent Gwen?</p><p>Now he rolled his eyes. I won\u2019t.</p><p>How do you know? Sulky, whiny.</p><p>She\u2019s not to blame. I am. If I resent anyone, it will be myself.</p><p>Seriously, how could he resent this tenderhearted woman? If she\u2019d known about the trip, he suspected she would have wanted to go herself.</p><p>Sabin watched the sun set, the moon rise and the sun reappear, unable to rest or relax. Why wasn\u2019t Gwen waking up? No one needed this much rest. Did she need blood again? He\u2019d thought he\u2019d given her plenty in the heat of their loving.</p><p>Sabin leaned back in the chair he\u2019d dragged to the bedside. The wooden slats dug into his back, but he didn\u2019t mind. They kept him alert, his mind active.</p><p>Look at you. You\u2019re becoming everything you\u2019ve ever despised, he thought. Weak, because of a woman. Worried, over a woman. Vulnerable to attack, because of a woman.</p><p>\u201cSabin,\u201d a breathless sigh rang out.</p><p>Sabin jerked upright in the chair, feet hitting the floor with a thump. His heart skipped a beat, his lungs nearly seized. Finally!</p><p>Gwen\u2019s eyes blinked open, but her eyelashes were matted together and she had to scrub them. Then their gazes collided, and he forgot to breathe. He\u2019d wondered how she would react to awakening in his bed; he should have wondered how he\u2019d react. He could have prepared himself. He was shaking, his blood heating at the sensual sight of her, rumpled and ready.</p><p>She frowned, attention sweeping the bedroom. \u201cHow\u2019d I get here? Wait. Tell me when I return.\u201d She threw her legs over the side of the bed and lumbered to a stand.</p><p>Sabin was already on his feet, already swooping her up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He deposited her in the bathroom, stepped back into the room and shut the door behind him, allowing her a measure of privacy.</p><p>What if she falls and hurts herself?</p><p>Shut up. You\u2019re not going to affect me right now.</p><p>A horrified gasp pummeled through the wood, and he grinned. She must have only then realized she was naked. Holding her like that had affected him madly. He was hard as a steel pipe, her female scent in his nose.</p><p>When he heard the water switch on, he grabbed a change of clothes and stalked to the bedroom next to his. The door was open, so he walked inside without preamble. The three Harpies sat in a circle on the floor, stacks of groceries in the center. They were laughing about something\u2014until they spotted him.</p><p>Kaia\u2019s eyes began to bleed black, and Sabin\u2019s demon quickly retreated. \u201cOur food,\u201d she squawked and he grimaced. Funny. Didn\u2019t bother him when Gwen sounded like that. Rather, he just wanted to please her. \u201cWe stole it. It\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down.\u201d Bianka slapped her arm, though her gaze never left Sabin. \u201cAbout time you showed up. Where\u2019s Gwennie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowering. I need to use yours.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for permission, but headed into the bathroom and gathered a towel.</p><p>\u201cAfter hours and hours of nonstop sex, you guys can\u2019t share a stall?\u201d one of them called. Sometimes, when he couldn\u2019t see the twins, it was hard to tell which was speaking.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019ll be another marathon if they try and share,\u201d another teased.</p><p>They cackled.</p><p>\u201cDid she put you in a coma? Has she been hiding you all this time to keep you from being shamed?\u201d Taliyah had spoken this time; he recognized that cold timbre, which never failed to make him shudder.</p><p>She knew the truth, he realized. He wondered yet again if sleeping like that was against Harpy protocol. \u201cWhat if she did?\u201d he found himself saying.</p><p>Bianka and Kaia twittered. \u201cGo little sis,\u201d one of them said.</p><p>Sabin kicked the door shut and jumped into the shower, moving quickly, afraid the females would burst in on Gwen and question her before he could. But they were exactly as he\u2019d left them when he emerged, eating and laughing.</p><p>Taliyah, the only one not smiling, nodded at him. In gratitude?</p><p>He took a quick detour through the kitchen\u2014someone had shopped, thank the gods\u2014and rounded up a bag of chips, a brownie, a granola bar, an apple and a bottle of water. Loaded down, he entered his bedroom, shut the door with a backward kick, and found Gwen seated on the edge of the bed. She wore a pair of sweat shorts and a bright blue T-shirt, both of which she\u2019d picked for herself in town the other day, her hair wet and dripping from a knot atop her head.</p><p>Doubt peeked from the shadowed corner in Sabin\u2019s mind, but decided not to risk incurring the Harpy\u2019s wrath and hid again.</p><p>Forcing his expression to remain neutral, he settled into the chair he\u2019d occupied for far too long already. He balanced the tray on his stomach.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she said, gazing at the food with longing. \u201cAbout what happened in the forest...\u201d</p><p>Before she could venture down that path, he told her how long she\u2019d been out, how he\u2019d guarded her, how no one had seen her neck, no one knew what she\u2019d really been doing and how everyone assumed they\u2019d been going at it like animals.</p><p>\u201cThere is a God,\u201d she said on a relieved breath.</p><p>Or gods. But whatever. Any other woman would have been horrified, he thought, fighting a grin. Still more proof that she was the only woman for him. \u201cNow you\u2019re going to answer some questions for me.\u201d</p><p>She gulped, eyes luminous in the sunlight that streamed through a gap in the dark, heavy curtains. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can you only eat stolen food?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re beyond that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we are,\u201d she said grudgingly. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can understand.\u201d He popped open the brownie and bit into the end. \u201cYou\u2019ve trusted me with your body. You\u2019ve trusted me to guard you while you sleep. You\u2019ve even trusted me with your weakness. Now trust me with your secrets.\u201d</p><p>Up and down her chest moved, her breath emerging shallow and raspy. Her stomach rumbled, and she rubbed it without looking away from him. Or rather, the food. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014okay. Yes.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cWill you pay me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay you? How much and for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say yes!\u201d It was snarled.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips again, words tumbling from her. \u201cThe gods despise Harpies and consider us an abomination since we were the spawn of a prince of darkness. Long ago, they hoped to bring about our ruin in a manner that would not reflect poorly on them. A way that would seem as if we\u2019d destroyed ourselves. So they cursed us in secret, stating that never again could we enjoy a meal freely given to us or one we had prepared ourselves. We sicken terribly if we disregard the curse; some even die. It only takes once to learn that lesson. As you saw for yourself at the camp in Egypt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnyway, the first of my kind learned through trial and error that they could still eat, but only what they\u2019d stolen or what was given to them in payment. The gods didn\u2019t succeed in destroying us, just making our lives difficult. So pay me. I gave you the answer you wanted, now you owe me.\u201d</p><p>Her demand for payment suddenly made sense. And hadn\u2019t Anya mentioned something about eating what they earned? Gods, he had to smarten up and listen better. \u201cFor the secret.\u201d He tossed the brownie at her and she caught it with a too-quick flick of her wrist. The dessert was consumed a second later. This was yet another similarity they shared, he reflected. Both their lives had been affected by a curse.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me I could pay you with food,\u201d he chided. \u201cI could have been feeding you all along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you well enough to share the fundamentals of my race. And as my sisters say, knowledge is power. You didn\u2019t need more power over me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d often said the same thing, though he thought he did need more power over her. \u201cBut now you do?\u201d he asked softly, foolishly pleased with her. \u201cKnow me, that is?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks burned bright red. \u201cWell, now I know you better.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. Sabin dangled the bag of chips from pinched fingers. \u201cTell me who you didn\u2019t want to see you, what you didn\u2019t want them to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sisters. I didn\u2019t want them to see me sleeping.\u201d</p> <p>So that had been the reason. \u201cWait. Tell me how you rested with your chicken, and then you\u2019ll get these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSabin. Chips!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered to my satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never rested with a chick\u2014Oh, you mean Tyson. For a long time, I didn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t rest, I mean. Does that count? Did I earn the chips?\u201d She reached out, fingers waving eagerly.</p><p>He held firm. \u201cHow long were you with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months.\u201d</p> <p>Six. Months. He gritted his teeth, not liking the thought of her with anyone that long. \u201cYou remained awake for all that time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. At first, I let him think I had insomnia. I\u2019d stay up all night. But when the fatigue would get to be too much, I would call in sick at work and sleep in the trees. That\u2019s the only location we\u2019re supposed to sleep, since it\u2019s nearly impossible to be seen or reached. But as the months passed, I thought, why not rest with this man I trusted? So I started sleeping in bed with him. And before you ask, not sleeping around other people wasn\u2019t a command or curse of the gods, but a safety measure every Harpy is taught from birth.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t recall her sisters leaving at night to head for the forest, but as silently as they moved, they certainly could have. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She pushed out a frustrated breath. \u201cOur wings can be bound while we sleep, as proven by my time in captivity. Now give. Me. The. Chips.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the bag.</p><p>Plastic ripped and orange-stained chips sprayed. Gwen popped one in her mouth, closed her eyes and moaned. Sabin had to swallow a moan of his own.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to earn the apple?\u201d</p><p>The tip of her tongue emerged, swiping over her lips. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me your thoughts about me. About what we did in the forest. And don\u2019t lie. I\u2019m only paying for the truth.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t she want him to know? What didn\u2019t she want him to know? A minute ticked by in silence, and he feared she would simply content herself with the food she already had. Then she surprised him.</p><p>\u201cI like you. More than I should. I\u2019m attracted to you and want to be with you. When I\u2019m not with you, I\u2019m thinking about you. It\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m stupid. But I love the way I feel when I\u2019m with you. When your demon\u2019s quiet, I don\u2019t feel ashamed or forgettable or scared. I feel worthy, desired and protected.\u201d</p><p>Sabin tossed the apple at her and she caught it, her gaze avoiding him. \u201cI feel the same about you,\u201d he admitted gruffly.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Her eyes snapped to him, bright with hope.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she grinned, but that grin soon fell away and her shoulders slumped. She bit into the apple, chewed, swallowed.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if we can make anything work. You once said you could betray the woman you loved if it meant winning a battle. Not that I think you love me. I just, well, if you were to be with someone else, I would kill her. Then you.\u201d There at the end, there had been steel in her tone. Steel sharpened to a razor point.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d He scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cYou\u2019re the only thing I can think about anymore. I doubt I could even fake it with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut for how long will that last?\u201d she asked softly, rolling the apple in her palms.</p><p>Forever, he suspected, guilt filling him. He\u2019d already devoted more time to her than he should have. He hadn\u2019t studied the names on Cronus\u2019s scrolls or done anything to find the two remaining artifacts. He hadn\u2019t been searching for Galen.</p><p>For so many years, he\u2019d placed the war with the Hunters above everything else\u2014and demanded the same from his men. Distractions hadn\u2019t been tolerated. They\u2019d given him everything he\u2019d asked for, and more. How could he, as their leader, now give himself fully to Gwen?</p><p>So, rather than answer her, he pushed to his feet, said, \u201cI\u2019ve neglected my duties to watch over you and now have a lot to do,\u201d and left her. If he hoped to keep her, he had a lot of shit to figure out first.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>AND I WANTED TO BE A SOLDIER? Gwen wondered for the thousandth time after another grueling session. She was panting, sweaty and bruised as she flopped atop Sabin\u2019s bed.</p><p>The last few days, Sabin had divided his time between his duties\u2014whatever those were\u2014and her training. She\u2019d just spent the past few hours getting the crap beaten out of her. Again. He gave no quarter, showed no mercy. It sucked!\u201cYou\u2019re stronger, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said, as if he could read her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And she was.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t apologize. You know you can take a punch now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd dish out my own,\u201d she said smugly, recalling how she\u2019d sent the muscled warrior flying into the trees, gasping for breath, only an hour ago. She also knew when to duck and when to attack.</p><p>\u201cYou just have to learn how to summon your Harpy faster. Good things happen when you do.\u201d He sat at the edge of the bed, cupped a hand around the base of her neck and drew her toward him. \u201cNow drink.\u201d</p><p>As she sank her teeth into his artery, her cheeks heated at the reminder of the way she\u2019d taken him in the forest. Then her eyelids drifted shut and she simply enjoyed the taste of this man.</p><p>He lifted her to his lap without breaking contact, and she immediately spread her legs, welcoming him against her body. He rubbed his erection between her thighs. She moaned at the bliss, the decadence. But when she tangled her fingers in his hair, withdrawing her teeth to lick and nip at him, he flung her back on the mattress, stood to shaky legs and strode toward the door.</p><p>\u201cTime for round two,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you outside.\u201d He disappeared around the corner.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really starting to piss me off,\u201d she called.</p><p>No reply.</p><p>She almost screeched in frustration. Twice before, he\u2019d done this to her. Trained with her, brought her to his room to heal her injuries with that delicious blood, got her hot and ready, and then abandoned her for his \u201cduties\u201d or more training. Why? Since their little chat, he hadn\u2019t made love to her again. Again, why?</p><p>They\u2019d declared their feelings for each other. Hadn\u2019t they? She knew she wanted him, however she could get him, for however long she could have him. No use denying that anymore. If they didn\u2019t last, at least she\u2019d tried. And of course, it would be his fault so she\u2019d have no regrets.</p><p>The thought of blaming him for any future discord caused her frustration to fade; she grinned. And the thought of a future with him had her sighing dreamily as she curled into a pillow. He was the kind of man every Harpy craved. Powerful, a little wild, a lot wicked. He could kill an enemy without guilt. He wasn\u2019t afraid of hard work. He could be ruthless, without mercy, yet he was tender with her.</p><p>The only question was, would he put Gwen before his war?</p><p>Wait. Two questions: Did she want him to?</p><p>With another sigh, she rose and headed back outside. The sun was high and warm as she searched for Sabin. The moment she saw him, she experienced a wave of pride. Mine. He was hunched over two daggers, sharpening them to razor points.</p><p>No reason to practice with fakes, he\u2019d told her. Tomorrow, they planned to work with guns. Golden light caressed his bare chest, deepening his tan. Sweat beaded over his muscles, making them gleam\u2014and her mouth water. The puncture wounds were already healing on his neck; she wished they\u2019d remain forever, her brand on him.</p><p>I\u2019ve had all that strength over me, inside me.</p><p>She wanted it again. Soon. The nights were the most difficult of all. He wouldn\u2019t enter the bedroom until close to morning\u2014it didn\u2019t take his demon to make her wonder where he\u2019d been, what he\u2019d been doing\u2014and then he would crawl in beside her, though he refused to touch her. She would feel his heat, hear his soft inhalations, and she would ache all over. Then she would fall asleep before she could do anything about it.</p><p>Tonight, if he continued to resist her, she would take matters into her own hands. Literally. He\u2019d tangled with her Harpy once and survived; he could damn well do it again.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Ashlyn, wife to the keeper of Violence, said. It was surprising, hearing the gentle woman curse. \u201cNot again!\u201d</p><p>As usual, Ashlyn and Danika sat on the sidelines to cheer for her. They also liked to boo when Sabin knocked her down. Though she hadn\u2019t spent a lot of time with them, she already adored them. They were open and honest, kind and witty, and had somehow, despite everything, managed to make a relationship work with a Lord of the Underworld. Gwen planned to get the lowdown from them as to how they\u2019d achieved such a feat, but hadn\u2019t yet had the time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Currently, they were a bit distracted, playing some kind of game with Anya, Bianka and Kaia\u2014who also liked to witness her sessions. Ashlyn and Danika had welcomed her sisters with open arms, claiming the fortress needed a little more estrogen to balance out the testosterone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to roll,\u201d Bianka said in a mock growl. \u201cSo you can back off my dice or have your fingers removed. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Maddox was inside, or he would have challenged her sister, Gwen knew. Game or not, he didn\u2019t like anyone threatening his woman.</p> <p>The warrior called Kane stood off to the side, watching the women with a half smile on his face, his hazel eyes bright. He was out in the open, not leaning against a tree, not shaded by branches. And yet, even as Gwen watched, a twig snapped from the far black oak and hurtled straight into him, slapping him across the face.</p><p>He and a few of the others had apparently stayed behind to read scrolls Cronus, the god king, had given them\u2014was that one of Sabin\u2019s duties?\u2014while the rest of the men had traipsed off to Chicago on a mission to \u201ckick Hunter ass.\u201d Odd that she missed them.</p><p>\u201c\u2014concentrating?\u201d A hard weight slammed into her stomach, shoving her to her ass.</p><p>Sabin was on top of her a second later, glaring, the daggers just above her shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about allowing your mind to wander.\u201d</p><p>As her lungs were in the process of seizing, it took her a moment to form a reply. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t...started yet.\u201d</p> <p>Do you really think you\u2019re...strong enough for this?</p><p>Doubt\u2019s voice drifted through her head, but the demon had sounded reluctant, afraid even to make itself known. It really was terrified of her, as Sabin had said. A sense of power accompanied the knowledge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for using the demon against you, but I want to train you against it, as well. And do you think a Hunter is going to ask your permission to begin and then wait until you nod?\u201d</p><p>Good point. Perhaps it was time for her to make a point of her own. \u201cFirst, your demon is like a tame little house cat now. Second...\u201d Since her arms were free, she fisted her hands and slammed both into his temples. He grunted in surprise, cradling his head as he fell backward. She didn\u2019t waste any time. She kicked him in the chest so hard his ribs cracked.</p><p>The Harpy laughed. More!</p><p>For once, hearing that voice didn\u2019t terrify her, and she blinked in surprise. Was she...could she be...embracing her darker side?</p> <p>\u201cGo, Gwennie!\u201d Kaia called.</p><p>\u201cKick him while he\u2019s down!\u201d Bianka shouted.</p><p>He was still clutching the daggers as he blinked, trying to clear his vision. Gwen jumped to her feet, wings springing free in her back. Thankfully they were so small, they didn\u2019t rip her shirt away. Moving faster than anyone could possibly see, she raced behind him and wrapped her fingers around his wrists.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time for him to resist.</p><p>Before he realized where she was and what she was doing, she had the sharp tips of the knives resting on his shoulders. A bead of blood formed around each one.</p><p>A moment passed in stunned silence.</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019ve officially kicked my ass.\u201d Some men would have been humiliated by that, but there was pride in Sabin\u2019s tone.</p><p>Joy burst through her. Just like that, faster than a blink, she\u2019d done it. She\u2019d really done it. Winning a fight, no matter her opponent, was something she\u2019d never thought to do, something she\u2019d considered an impossibility. Yet she\u2019d just defeated a freaking Lord of the Underworld, one of the most capable warriors in this world and any other. Gods trembled at the mere mention of their names.</p> <p>Well, if they didn\u2019t, they should.</p><p>\u201cNext time we fight, though, I want you to let your Harpy completely free,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded reluctantly. Letting the Harpy come out for lovemaking was one thing; battling was quite another.</p><p>\u201cJust think about what you will soon be doing to the Hunters,\u201d Kaia said with awe. \u201cBaby girl, I\u2019ve never seen moves like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother would be proud.\u201d Taliyah strode beside her and slapped her on the back. \u201cIf we knew where she was, she might even welcome you back into her fold.\u201d</p><p>Gwen could have danced. She\u2019d always been the anomaly, the weak link, the mistake. With one sweet victory, she finally felt like she was one of them. Like she was worthy.</p><p>Silent, Sabin reached up and plucked the daggers from her now shaky hands. What thoughts were tumbling through his mind?</p><p>\u201cGood job.\u201d Ashlyn rubbed her rounded belly. \u201cI\u2019m truly impressed.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Danika clapped. \u201cSabin, you should be embarrassed. You were brought down in less than a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by a girl.\u201d But Kaia\u2019s amusement quickly faded. \u201cOkay, now that the training is winding down, I have a question. When are we going to see some action?\u201d She anchored her hands on her hips. \u201cWe\u2019re bored. We\u2019ve been bored. And we\u2019ve been on damn good behavior, waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hunters hurt baby sis, so now they need to pay,\u201d Bianka said.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Sabin told them. \u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>That scared Gwen a little. Not enough to change the course she\u2019d set for herself, though.</p><p>\u201cBut at the moment, I\u2019m going to spend some time with the woman of the hour. Alone.\u201d No one protested as Sabin ushered Gwen to a private alcove, where he\u2019d already stashed a cooler. He motioned for her to sit inside a cool circle of shade. \u201cDo you need more blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Seriously, what was he thinking? He was polite, but more distant than ever. Clearly \u201calone time\u201d didn\u2019t require nudity and a bed. How disappointing. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Operating at full strength, even.\u201d To prove it, she too remained standing.</p><p>\u201cGood. Much as I want to give it to you, I want to see how you recover from minor wounds without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wounded, minor or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d His pointed gaze dropped to her arm.</p><p>She looked down and saw the bloody grooves in her forearm. \u201cOh.\u201d Wow. Getting shot must have inured her to the pain of other injuries.</p><p>\u201cLet me know the moment it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Always the trainer. She liked that about him. Everything was a lesson meant to strengthen her, prepare her for what could happen. It really showed how much he cared, because he didn\u2019t do it for everyone. Only her, actually.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, he only reacted with violence when someone threatened her. Kaia and Bianka had verbally insulted and physically assaulted his friends on several occasions, and he\u2019d grinned, even joined in the teasing. But the moment her sisters turned their teasing her way, Sabin\u2019s mood darkened. He never hesitated to shove them away, either. Really shove. To him, men and women were equal in every way and deserved the same treatment, something else she admired about him.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he urged again. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d obeyed, he held up an ice-cold, dripping bottle of water. \u201cIf you want to earn it, you\u2019ll tell me what happens to a Harpy when she takes a consort. Tell me how long she has the consort, and what\u2019s expected of him.\u201d</p><p>Was he...could he be...thinking about signing on for the job? Her eyes were wide as he plopped a few feet in front of her and stretched out.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsorts are forever,\u201d she croaked, \u201cand very rare. A Harpy is a free spirit, but every so often one will encounter a male who...delights her. That\u2019s the best word I can think of to describe the obsession. His smell and touch become drugs to her. His voice soothes her fury as nothing else is able, almost as if it strokes her feathers. As to what\u2019s expected of him, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never met a Harpy with a consort.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had one? A consort, I mean. And if you dare say chicken man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no consort.\u201d Tyson had not delighted her Harpy, that was for sure. She waved her fingers at the water. \u201cI earned it.\u201d The bottle was soaring through the air a second later. Cold liquid splashed her arms when she caught it. In seconds, she had the contents drained.</p><p>\u201cDo Harpies have to obey their consorts?\u201d</p><p>A laugh bubbled from her. \u201cNo. Do you honestly think a Harpy has to obey anyone?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, and she caught a glimpse of both resolve and disappointment in his dark gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYour sisters seemed to think...\u201d A muscle ticked in his jaw. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His gaze became piercing. \u201cSure you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think I am your consort.\u201d</p><p>Her chin hit her sternum, her mouth forming a wide O. \u201cWhat?\u201d she repeated, sounding foolish even to her own ears. \u201cWhy would they think that?\u201d And why hadn\u2019t they talked to her about it, rather than Sabin?</p><p>\u201cI calm you. You want me.\u201d He was almost defensive.</p><p>But if he...if she...holy hell. He did calm her. From the first, he\u2019d calmed her. And she craved him, his blood, his presence, his body. She\u2019d been such a failure at everything else in the Harpy world that she\u2019d always figured a true consort wasn\u2019t in the cards for her. Was it?</p><p>When Sabin wasn\u2019t with her, she was looking for him. When he was with her, she wanted to be snuggled up to him, enjoying him. She had shared her secrets with him and wasn\u2019t sorry.</p><p>Anya had told her Sabin belonged to her, but Gwen hadn\u2019t believed the goddess back then. Now...holy hell, she thought again, dazed.</p><p>Was that why Sabin had been so distant with her? He didn\u2019t want to be her consort? Her stomach twisted painfully. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know if I love you, though,\u201d she said, trying to give him an out.</p><p>Something dark filled his eyes. Something hard and hot. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to love me.\u201d The word \u201cyet\u201d hung between them, unsaid but there all the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did he love her? It was almost too much to hope for. Because, if he loved her, he would have touched her again. Right? \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the war,\u201d she found herself saying, rather than asking what she really wanted to know: Why haven\u2019t you made love to me? \u201cWon\u2019t be as uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cHave it your way, then. I didn\u2019t go to Chicago with the others, so I\u2019ve been taking names from scrolls that list other demon-possessed immortals out there, looking for them in the books Lucien collected over the years and trying to learn about them.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stayed for her. She knew that, and couldn\u2019t stop the delight that spread through her. Perhaps he didn\u2019t hate the thought of being her consort, after all. \u201cFound anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI recognized a lot of the names from my days in the heavens. Most of the prisoners in Tartarus were placed there by me and the other Lords, so we won\u2019t be their favorite people. Might be best if we just hunt them down and kill them, so they don\u2019t help Galen. Then again, he helped lock them away, too, back when he was one of us, so maybe it\u2019s moot.\u201d He paused, sighed again. \u201cLook, I brought up the consort thing because I wanted to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment and eagerness dueled for supremacy. Eagerness won. She straightened, ears perking. This was clearly an important subject to him. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Motions stiff, he dug into the cooler and withdrew another water.</p><p>\u201cPayment?\u201d she asked with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve already agreed to help you. No need to pay me.\u201d</p><p>Silent, he popped the lid and drained the contents.</p> <p>Her grin faded, the silence edged with tension. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He fell back against the tree, looking everywhere but at her. \u201cWhen the time comes for battle, and it will, sooner rather than later, I want you to stay here, away from the action.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Right. She laughed again, her humor restored. \u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I have your sisters. I don\u2019t need you.\u201d</p><p>But...he couldn\u2019t mean this. Could he? This driven warrior would use anyone against the Hunters, would not be happy with three Harpies when he could have four. Right?</p><p>\u201cI would never joke about something like this,\u201d he added.</p> <p>No, he wouldn\u2019t. Just then it felt as if a thousand of Sabin\u2019s daggers were stabbing at her chest, each of them aimed for her heart. Several of them succeeded in puncturing the organ, for it throbbed and burned. \u201cBut you said you needed me. You did everything in your power to enlist my aid. I\u2019ve been training. I\u2019ve improved.\u201d</p><p>He scoured a hand down his face, looking exhausted all of a sudden. \u201cI did say that. You have improved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d he suddenly growled, fist slamming into the ground. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for you to spring into active duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What\u2019s going on? What changed your mind like this?\u201d It would have taken something major, she knew.</p><p>\u201cI just...damn it,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhatever goes down in Chicago will surely infuriate the Hunters. Look what happened after Egypt. They\u2019ll come here. They\u2019ll try to retaliate. I won\u2019t be able to concentrate with you by my side. All right? I\u2019ll worry. I\u2019ll be distracted. And my distraction will place my men at risk.\u201d</p><p>Gwen didn\u2019t know where she found the strength, but she pushed to her feet. Her eyes narrowed. He would worry. The female in her liked the thought of that. A lot. The blossoming warrior, the Harpy she now wanted to be, hated it, burning away the joy. She would never again be a coward.</p><p>\u201cYou can train yourself not to worry, then, because I\u2019m joining you. It\u2019s my right.\u201d</p> <p>He jumped to his feet, too, nostrils flared, hands fisted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my right as your lover\u2014consort, to dispatch your enemy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you were my consort. So you listen up. I\u2019ve waited my entire life to be something. To prove myself. You will not take this away from me. I won\u2019t let you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d Taliyah suddenly interjected. She stood off to the side, Kaia and Bianka beside her. Each radiated fury. \u201cNo one stops a Harpy. No one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig mistake, Doubt,\u201d Kaia told him. \u201cToo bad\u2014we were actually starting to like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew eavesdropping was the smart thing to do,\u201d Bianka said through clenched teeth. \u201cYou might be wonderfully vicious, but you\u2019re still a man and we know better than to trust anything male. Look what happened the last time Gwen went down that road.\u201d</p><p>Taliyah ran her tongue over her straight, white teeth. \u201cGwen finally gave you what you wanted, and you decided you didn\u2019t want it anymore. Typical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cCome. We\u2019re leaving the fortress. We\u2019ll take care of the Hunters on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sabin said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be none of that.\u201d</p><p>For what seemed an eternity, Gwen simply stared over at him, silently begging him to tell her sisters they were wrong. Doubts consumed her, doubts that were all her own. Was he doing this to protect her, because he cared? Or did he simply have no faith in her abilities, even after all her hard work? Or was he planning to do something that would upset her\u2014something with a female Hunter\u2014and he didn\u2019t want her to witness it?</p><p>Or was his demon ruling his mind? If so, there had to be a way to combat it.</p><p>\u201cSabin,\u201d she said, hoping. \u201cLet\u2019s talk this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay within these walls,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cAt all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll leave me here, but you\u2019ll utilize my sisters, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of them. One will stay with you.\u201d</p><p>The women in question laughed. \u201cAs if,\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>Gwen raised her chin, glaring over at him. \u201cThey won\u2019t help you without me. Still think to leave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No hesitation.</p><p>How could he do this? How, when he\u2019d worked so hard to win her and her sisters to his cause? Bile rose in her throat, burning like acid. \u201cDo you want to win your war? Finally? Because you could. With us, with all of us, you very well could.\u201d</p><p>Silence. A silence that made her feel like she was being force-fed disappointment, regret and sadness, one rancid spoonful at a time.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Taliyah said, sharply this time. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>Betrayed to her very soul, Gwen turned away from Sabin and followed her sisters.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>CHICAGO WAS COOL and just a little windy. Still, the sun was like a glaring eye, following Gideon\u2019s every move. But he liked the towering buildings and the closeness of the water; one gave him the feel of being in a big city and the other a beach. The best of two worlds.</p><p>He and the other warriors had been here several days, yet had only now found the facility they\u2019d come for. Somehow they\u2019d passed it over and over again. Maybe because the numbers were off, or maybe because the twenty or so red brick buildings around it were exact copies of one another. Thin but tall, at least fourteen stories, two square windows on each floor.Despite the fact that it was so well hidden, they should not have walked past it over and over again like they had. Made him wonder if something else was going on, something more than his \u201cmaybes.\u201d Something like magic.</p><p>A protective spell, perhaps? He\u2019d met a few witches over the years and knew they were a powerful race. Though why any would choose to work with the Hunters was beyond him.</p><p>Finally, they\u2019d come up with the brilliant idea of leaving Lucien out here alone, in spirit form, waiting for a Hunter to pass him. Hence another delay\u2014Hunters weren\u2019t always easy to spot, their clothes normal, their weapons hidden\u2014so Lucien had followed many a human. His efforts eventually paid off and Lucien spotted a likely candidate venturing inside a building none of them had noticed\u2014or if they had, they didn\u2019t remember. Lucien had tagged the building with a small smear of his own blood, something Anya could track with her eyes closed.</p><p>Now everyone was settled across the street from it, hidden inside a construction site and peering through thick wooden beams as workers bustled behind them. A few people had possessed the courage to ask them to leave. A rose-scented, mismatched-eyes-swirling hypno-suggestion from Lucien, and everyone had forgotten they were even here. Gideon could scream, and they wouldn\u2019t even blink.</p><p>Gideon wanted a power like that. Or maybe a super rage like Maddox, who could rip the world to shreds just because he was pissed. Maybe the ability to read people\u2019s minds like Amun. Or to enjoy every cut, slash and injury inflicted upon him like Reyes. Or even to screw like a monkey like Paris. Or fly like Aeron. Or win everything like Strider. Or\u2014he could name something he envied about every Lord of the Underworld. Even Cameo, the epitome of Misery. She could clear a room just by speaking. She could send grown men to their knees, sobbing like babies.</p><p>What could Gideon do? He could lie, that\u2019s what. And it sucked ass. (That was not a lie.) He couldn\u2019t tell a woman she was pretty unless she was ugly. He couldn\u2019t tell his friends he loved them. He had to tell them he hated them. He couldn\u2019t tell Hunters they were shitbags. He had to tell them they were sweetie pies. Talk about a nightmare\u2014which of course he\u2019d have to call a dream come true.</p><p>And yet, through it all, he couldn\u2019t regret the fact that he was a demon-possessed warrior. He wore it like a badge of pride. He would have liked to act as if it disgusted him, which would have given him something in common with the others\u2014all but Sabin and Strider, that is\u2014but he never lied to himself.</p><p>Sometimes he thought he was the only warrior who welcomed his curse. There was nothing wrong with having a demon inside you. Nothing wrong with enjoying it, being glad you weren\u2019t alone\u2014not that his demon ever spoke to him like the others\u2019 spoke to them. No, his was more a...presence in the back of his mind. Nothing wrong with being happy you were more powerful. But damn it, would it have killed the gods to stick him with Rage or Nightmare? Okay, now Nightmare would have been freaking awesome. Having the ability to turn Hunters\u2019 nightmares into reality would be the sweetest kind of heaven. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly a pang of longing swept through him and he blinked in surprise. Longing? For what? The ability? Or the demon itself?</p><p>Gideon waved the odd sensation aside. He didn\u2019t know if Nightmare had even been inside the box\u2014there was another pang.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching the place for over an hour, our guy has already left empty-handed and there\u2019s been no other movement. I think it\u2019s abandoned,\u201d Anya said, and there was a rare trace of confusion in her tone. \u201cBut I\u2019m sensing chaos. A freaking lot of chaos.\u201d Chaos was the strongest source of her power, so if anyone would recognize it, it was this beautiful goddess.</p> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t possibly be witches and their spells,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>Anya gasped. \u201cWitches. Of course. Why didn\u2019t I think of that? I\u2019ve had a run-in or two thousand with them over the years. Talk about abusers of power,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cWonder how they\u2019ll feel when I abuse mine and use their black hearts as our table\u2019s new centerpiece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should ghost inside,\u201d Lucien said. He would be invisible to those around him and could check things out without fear of being spotted.</p><p>\u201cNo. We talked about this,\u201d Anya said determinedly. She shook her head. Gideon stood on her right side, and felt the silky swish of her hair. \u201cSomething\u2019s wonky with that building, and I don\u2019t even want your spirit in it. And now that witches might be involved...hell, no.\u201d</p><p>Gideon adored women, and felt his skin heat at the brush of her hair. Last time he\u2019d been with a woman had been mere hours after he\u2019d returned from Egypt. The women of Buda knew, on some level, that he and the other Lords were different. They were considered \u201cangels.\u201d He hadn\u2019t had to speak, just crook his finger, and this one had come running. But she wasn\u2019t enough to soothe the ache inside him. They were never enough.</p> <p>\u201cSo let\u2019s keep standing here, doing nothing,\u201d he said. Which meant, let\u2019s raid the place, guns blazing, and well his friends knew it. They were well-versed in Gideon Speak. They had to be.</p><p>If he even attempted to utter a truth, any kind of truth, sharp pain burned through him. Pain far worse than one person should ever have to endure. Like knives dipped in acid, covered in salt and topped off with venom, then stabbed into his gut and raked all the way from his brain to his feet over and over again.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t survive a bomb a while back,\u201d he added, because yeah, they had. Only a few months had passed since the blast in question and he still remembered the shock and pain of it. But he would willingly endure it again. Too long had passed since he\u2019d sunk his blade or fired off a round into his enemy. The dry spell made him twitchy. \u201cSo we damn sure can\u2019t survive anything else they throw at us. Even spells.\u201d</p><p>Gideon was proof the Lords could not only survive a bunch of shit but also come out grinning. Once, Hunters managed to capture and imprison him. The next three months of his life had been torture. Literally. He would rather have roasted in hell than endure the poking, prodding, testing and beatings that took him to the brink of death, only to be revived so that he could be beaten again.</p><p>Sabin had found and saved him, actually carting Gideon over his shoulder because Gideon had been unable to walk. They\u2019d just cut off his feet to watch them regenerate. Perhaps that was why Gideon loved the warrior so much. Would do anything for him. I\u2019ll kill a few Hunters just for him. That Sabin wasn\u2019t here, when the boss man lived for this kind of shit...</p><p>It was the Harpy\u2019s fault, he was sure. Never had Sabin been so obsessed with a woman, locking himself away with her, ignoring his duties. Gideon was glad his friend had found someone, but unsure what it meant for their war.</p> <p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Strider said. Strider always had ideas. Since victory was necessary for his continued good health, he often planned and strategized for hours, days, weeks before marching into battle. \u201cAshlyn found the immortals for the Hunters. Hell, she probably found the witches for them. So we\u2019ll just have her find one for us. Our witch can undo whatever spell their witch cast, if it\u2019s actually a spell we\u2019re dealing with, and boom, victory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime is not our friend right now. We need these kids out of our enemy\u2019s hands. We need to return to searching for the box,\u201d Lucien said.</p><p>\u201cBut, baby,\u201d Anya said, worry in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, love. I won your heart, I can do anything.\u201d Lucien kissed her, lingering despite the urgency in his tone, before disappearing completely. The human workers continued to bustle around them, oblivious. If they could see and hear the warriors, they gave no indication.</p><p>Anya sighed, dreaming. \u201cGods, that man revs my engine.\u201d</p><p>Reyes chuckled.</p><p>Strider rolled his eyes.</p><p>Amun remained as stoic as ever.</p> <p>No, not stoic, Gideon thought. But edged with something dark. Lines of tension branched from the man\u2019s dark eyes and set mouth. His shoulders were stiff, as though the muscles were knotted. The last trip inside the mind of that Hunter in the pyramid must have really messed him up.</p><p>If there were anything Gideon could do to help him, he would do it. Gideon loved the silent giant. No one was kinder, no one was more caring. As Gideon had recovered from his footbotomy, Amun had been the one to bring him food, make sure his bandages were clean and even carry him outside for fresh air.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, he switched places with Strider so that he was standing next to Amun, and slapped the big guy on the back. Amun didn\u2019t face him, but his lips did twitch into a small smile.</p><p>\u201cQuick, someone distract me,\u201d Anya said. \u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>Everyone groaned. A bored Anya was a troublesome Anya. But Gideon knew the truth. He still heard the worry in the goddess\u2019s voice. She didn\u2019t like to be parted from Lucien.</p><p>\u201cWe totally could not play How Am I Going To Kill The Hunters,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stab them,\u201d Reyes said instantly, the gleam in his dark eyes ferocious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll shoot them,\u201d Strider replied. \u201cIn the groin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll snap their necks,\u201d Anya said, rubbing her palms together, \u201cthen make them watch me cut out their intestines.\u201d She\u2019d do it, too. Anyone who threatened Lucien ended up on her Must Torture list. \u201cNo need to tell us you\u2019d kiss them, Gideon. We already know.\u201d</p><p>A symphony of chuckles abounded.</p><p>So much for trying to be kind to Anya. He flipped each one of them off.</p><p>\u201cI know what we can do,\u201d Reyes said. Normally he had a dagger in each hand and was cutting himself as he spoke. Not today. Not while parted from Danika. That was a pain all its own, he often said. \u201cLet\u2019s take bets on how Sabin\u2019s doing with the Harpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan has balls, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Strider said. \u201cGwen\u2019s pretty, but anyone who can rip out your throat...\u201d He shuddered.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Anya leveled them with a scowl. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t Gwen\u2019s fault. Not that I think there\u2019s anything wrong with performing a throat extraction on a Hunter. Anyway, the way I hear it, she was scared. You don\u2019t scare a Harpy and live to brag. That\u2019s, like, one of the first things they teach you in deity school. The entire race is just violent by nature. I mean, you\u2019ve met Gwen\u2019s sisters, right?\u201d</p><p>This time, everyone shuddered.</p><p>\u201cSabin is a lucky bastard,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>Anya\u2019s gaze locked on him, but her expression was suddenly dazed, as if she saw past him. A hum of power drifted from her, wrapping around him, squeezing. When she focused, a smile bloomed. \u201cBetter watch it,\u201d she said. \u201cOr you\u2019re going to be fated to love a female far worse than a Harpy. The gods are fun that way.\u201d</p><p>The heat drained from his cheeks, and he clenched his hands into fists. \u201cDo you know something?\u201d She was a goddess and potentially privy to information they weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said with a dainty shrug.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me!\u201d He loved women, he did. But take one permanently, when a single one had never truly satisfied him? Hell, no. Violent as his life was, he needed something extreme to push him over the edge. When his partners asked how to please him, he had to tell them the opposite. How much worse would it be if he were strapped with a single female? He would never get sex the way he truly craved, not even accidentally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d absolutely tell you if I knew.\u201d</p><p>She was lying. He knew she was. Lying was a passion of hers. How did Lucien stand her? Hey, wait a sec, he thought, disgusted.</p><p>Suddenly Lucien materialized, his scarred face confused as everyone crowded around him. \u201cThe place is furnished but abandoned. No paperwork, but I did see clothing strewn about. Sizes only children can wear. Must have left in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Strider rubbed his temple. \u201cThat means we\u2019re too late, that we made the trip for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are strange markings on the wall, though,\u201d the scarred warrior added. \u201cI could not decipher them. I want to flash you in one at a time so if the outside area is still being monitored, we won\u2019t be spotted. Surely someone among us will have seen the markings before and know what they mean.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t take long. Within five minutes they were inside the building. Gideon was swaying from dizziness\u2014flashing sucked\u2014Strider was laughing, Reyes pale and clutching his stomach, Anya dancing around the empty room, and Amun staring into the distance.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Lucien said.</p><p>They stalked down narrow corridors, their booted footsteps echoing. Gideon traced a finger over the wall; it was painted a sickening gray. That had been the color of his cell while in captivity. The only furniture he\u2019d been given was a bed with wrist and ankle straps.</p><p>Bad memories. He didn\u2019t like to venture down that brain path unless he was in the middle of a fight. Helped channel his rage. He looked around. There were multiple bedrooms. Well, they were more like barracks, with fifteen beds to a space. There were also what appeared to be classrooms.</p><p>Left, right, right, left and they entered a gymnasium, everyone remaining on guard. One wall was mirrored with a bar in front of it. For...ballet? he wondered. Of course, he thought next. Killers could be more effective when they were flexible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Three of the walls were gray, just like the hall. But the last was painted in a multitude of colors. Gideon couldn\u2019t make out a single picture, only sharp, jagged lines and sweeping arches. They were a mess.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also a spell, as we suspected,\u201d Anya replied.</p> <p>Bodies closed around him. Fingers were soon tracing, eyes following, searching for patterns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Reyes said darkly. \u201cIn the books I used to learn more about Anya.\u201d</p><p>When Anya had first come to them, no one had known if she meant them harm. Not their fault, either. The woman was renowned throughout the ages for the trouble she caused.</p><p>\u201cOh, Panie. Your interest still flatters me, but really, get over your crush. I\u2019m taken. Now about the spell. They definitely used the old language,\u201d she said. \u201cThough they added their own flare, and I\u2019m having trouble deciphering certain words. That one means dark, that one means power, and that one...helpless, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave now,\u201d Gideon said, spine suddenly tingling in warning. Danger was nearby.</p> <p>Reyes sighed. \u201cThe lying is already getting on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care. I do,\u201d Gideon told him dryly. \u201cMy heart is actually hurting for you. And just so you know, I can go without lying just like you can go without cutting yourself.\u201d</p><p>Another sigh. Then, \u201cSorry,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have gone there. Lie all you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Strider belted out a laugh and slapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>Gideon knew he was annoying. He did. But he couldn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>Suddenly Anya, who had been muttering under her breath, reading, gasped. \u201cOh my gods.\u201d One step, two, she backed away from the wall. She was trembling, and in all the weeks Gideon had known her, all the battles they\u2019d fought together, he\u2019d never seen the courageous female tremble. \u201cFlash us, Lucien. Now. All of us, if possible.\u201d</p><p>Lucien didn\u2019t hesitate, didn\u2019t waste time asking why. He stalked to her and wrapped his arms around her, clearly intending to flash her first\u2014because whether she knew it or not, he couldn\u2019t transport more than he could touch. But it was too late. Dark, metal shades fell over the room\u2019s two windows, drowning out all hint of light.</p><p>Down the hall, he could hear the same shades closing over the other windows.</p><p>Gideon spun around, palming his daggers. He wanted to lash out, but it was now so dark he couldn\u2019t even see his hand in front of his face, much less his friends. He didn\u2019t want to cut the wrong person.</p><p>\u201cLucien,\u201d Anya cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby, but I can\u2019t flash. I can\u2019t seem to force my body to dematerialize anymore.\u201d Lucien had never sounded so grim. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s some sort of a magnetic shield locking my spirit to my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d Anya said. \u201cMagic. I activated it the rest of the way when I read the spell aloud.\u201d</p><p>There was an ominous pause as everyone digested that, realization bubbling in Gideon\u2019s throat, practically choking him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do the designs mean?\u201d Strider finally asked.</p><p>\u201cMost of it is the spell, locking us in the dark, our powers gone, our bodies helpless. The last line, though, is a message to all of you. It says, Welcome to hell, Lords of the Underworld. You\u2019ll be here until you die.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>THE FIRST WOMAN Aeron had found for Paris, the warrior had previously slept with. Not that Paris had known it by looking at her. His body\u2019s lack of response had given him away. So back to town she\u2019d gone. Since receiving his demon, Paris had only once gotten hard for the same woman twice. And that was the female who had died and couldn\u2019t be reborn. Because of me.</p><p>The second woman Aeron had found for his friend had been a no go, as well. Same reason. The third had been a tourist, new to town, and had thankfully never crossed paths with the warrior. Aeron had abducted her right out of her hotel room while she slept so that his tattooed face and inhuman wings wouldn\u2019t frighten her. She\u2019d woken up next to Paris and when she\u2019d glimpsed his pretty face, she\u2019d climbed on board for the ride of her life.Today, Aeron was flying his friend into town. No more taking females back and forth. It was a waste of time. This way, Paris could choose whom he wanted and Aeron could quickly and efficiently procure her for him. The two could have their fun in Gilly\u2019s apartment, the safest place Aeron knew of, since Torin had the entire building wired like a maximum security prison to keep Danika\u2019s young friend safe. Aeron hadn\u2019t liked it when she had moved out of the fortress\u2014she was too fragile, too skittish\u2014but the warriors freaked her out and time hadn\u2019t calmed her. Aeron would take her to the coffee shop across the street, if she\u2019d let him, and keep her company while they waited.</p><p>A perfect plan. Well, as perfect as he could work it.</p><p>If only Paris and the Harpies had gotten along. But Promiscuity had taken one look at the beautiful women and deemed them \u201ctoo much effort.\u201d Aeron supposed he knew the feeling. He himself hadn\u2019t enjoyed a female in over a hundred years, and he wouldn\u2019t enjoy one for a hundred more. If ever. As he\u2019d told his sweet Legion, they were simply too weak, too easily destroyed, while he would most likely live forever.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he could survive having to watch another loved one die.</p><p>Speaking of loved ones, had Legion returned to hell? Was she in danger? She wasn\u2019t happy unless she was with Aeron and he wasn\u2019t complete unless she was perched on his shoulders.</p><p>The so-called angel hadn\u2019t visited him in days. Hopefully, she was gone for good and Legion would return.</p><p>He leaned to the left, turning smoothly. Pinks and purples streaked the sky, the sun setting perfectly. Wind whipped across his scalp, his hair too short to ruffle. Paris\u2019s, though, continually slapped his cheeks. The warrior was cradled against his chest, arms wrapped around his back, under his wings.</p><p>He remained low and in the shadows, out of view.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d Paris said flatly.</p><p>\u201cToo bad. You need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you? My pimp now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to be. Look, you found a woman you could bed more than once. Surely you can find another. We just have to look for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you! That\u2019s like telling a man whose arm has been chopped off that you\u2019ll sew someone else\u2019s on him. It\u2019s not going to be the same. It won\u2019t be the right color, the right length. Nothing will be as perfect as the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll petition Cronus for Sienna\u2019s return. You said her soul is in the heavens, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d was the grudging response. \u201cHe\u2019ll say no. He said I had a choice, and if I didn\u2019t pick her he would ensure she never returned to earth. He\u2019s probably already killed her. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sneak into the heavens. I can search for her.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, as though Paris was considering his words. \u201cYou could be caught, imprisoned. Then my sacrifice would be in vain. Just...forget about Sienna.\u201d</p><p>Problem was, Aeron couldn\u2019t forget about her until Paris did. He was going to have to ponder this, decide how to proceed. All he knew was that he wanted his friend back. The laughing, carefree warrior who had a smile for everyone.</p><p>\u201cCity\u2019s crowded tonight,\u201d he observed, hoping to bring them to a safer topic.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder what\u2019s going on.\u201d The moment he\u2019d spoken, he experienced a twinge of dread. Last time it had been this crowded, the Hunters had invaded. He studied the people below more closely, looking for the telltale sign of the Hunters. A tattoo of infinity. But these people were wearing watches, long sleeves, and he couldn\u2019t see their wrists. Besides, while he knew Hunters were proud of their brands, he also knew they could have started hiding them, marking themselves in discreet locations. Would have been the smart thing to do. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we need to go back to the fortress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Aeron was already heavily armed, and he never minded fighting on his own, but he had Paris with him. Paris, who was still fuzzed from those massive amounts of ambrosia and would be more a hindrance than a help.</p><p>\u201cWait. Stop!\u201d Paris had tensed against him, and his tone had been disbelieving, hopeful and dripping with wonder.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I saw...I think...Sienna.\u201d He said her name as if it was a prayer.</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Aeron scanned the ground. There were so many faces and he was moving so quickly, he couldn\u2019t really distinguish one from another. But if Paris had seen Sienna, if she was somehow once again alive, then Hunters were definitely here. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack. Go back. She was heading south.\u201d There was so much excitement in Paris\u2019s voice, Aeron couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>Despite the danger, he turned. He wanted to toss out a warning, don\u2019t get your hopes up, but couldn\u2019t. Stranger things had happened.</p><p>Suddenly Paris jerked, grunted. \u201cFind shelter! Now!\u201d</p><p>Aeron felt something warm and wet slide over his arms where he gripped Paris\u2019s waist. Then a barrage of arrows pierced Aeron\u2019s wings, tearing the membrane. His arms and legs were next, the muscles ripped open, the bones nicked. As he jerked in pain, understanding dawned. Hunters were indeed here, and they\u2019d spotted him. Had probably been watching and waiting for just such an opportunity.</p><p>My fault, he thought. Again. He began to fall...fall...twisting and turning. Crashing.</p><p>TORIN LEANED BACK in his chair, hands locked behind his head, feet propped on his desk. He\u2019d been glued here for days, barely leaving to eat, shower or, hell, live. Cameo hadn\u2019t come to see him since the night of her return, and maybe that was for the best. He couldn\u2019t concentrate when she was near and he had more work on his plate than ever before.</p><p>He kept the warriors well-moneyed, playing with stocks and bonds. He monitored the surrounding area for intruders. He made all travel arrangements. He researched any leads on Pandora\u2019s box, the artifacts or the Hunters. He was even scouring news sites for any sign of a man-with-wings sighting. Aka Galen. To the best of Torin\u2019s knowledge, Galen and Aeron were the only warriors who possessed the means of flight.Torin didn\u2019t mind his many jobs because he had the time to do it all; he never left the fortress. To do so could quite possibly kill everyone in the world. So dramatic, he thought dryly. But true. One touch of his skin against another\u2019s was all that was needed to jumpstart a plague. Last one he\u2019d started, thanks to the Hunters, had been here in Buda. At least it had been contained by doctors before it could do too much damage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But, oh, how he wanted to touch Cameo. Would have given anything for the chance. He pictured her in his mind. Small, slender, that long dark hair, those sad gray eyes.</p><p>Would he still want her if he could have his pick of women? he found himself wondering for the thousandth time that day. Would he still want her if he could touch anyone he wished? Go into town anytime? As a man, yeah, he\u2019d want her. She was pretty, smart, amusing if you got past her suicidal voice. But anything permanent? He just didn\u2019t know. Because...his gaze strayed to the monitor to his left.</p><p>Every so often he would catch a glimpse of a beautiful woman walking through town. Long black hair, exotic eyes that were bright one moment and glazed the next. She\u2019d pause in her stride, smile, frown, then kick back into gear. When the wind caressed her, ruffling her hair, Torin would catch the barest hint of...pointed ears? Whether he was seeing things or not, the sight of those ears made him hard as a rock. He had the strangest urge to lick them.</p> <p>She wore a T-shirt that said Nixie\u2019s IAD House O\u2019 Fun, and she had earbuds in her ears. What was a Nixie? A quick Google search and he figured it\u2014she?\u2014was some sort of Immortal After Dark. Interesting. Because he\u2019d like nothing more than to explore her after dark.</p><p>What type of music was she listening to? Judging by the brisk nod of her head, it was something fast and hard. Where had she come from? What was she? Delicious, I bet...</p><p>Lusting after the strange woman had shaken him, sent those questions about Cameo spiraling through him. If he could desire another, he wasn\u2019t in love with Cameo. And if he wasn\u2019t in love with her, was it cruel of him to mess around with her? Would he eventually hurt her? Hurt himself?</p><p>He\u2019d never be able to touch her, and as passionate as she was, she would eventually need a man who could. He\u2019d never had to worry about these things before because he\u2019d never been with a woman. Not even before his possession. He\u2019d been too busy then, too involved in his job. Maybe he needed to join Workaholics Anonymous, he thought dryly. He had to be the only millennia-old virgin in history.</p><p>One of his monitors flashed, and he gave it a detailed scan. Nothing out of the ordinary. No sign of his pointy-eared brunette, either. Another question popped into his head: if Cameo weren\u2019t worried about her demon inflicting untold misery upon a human, would she have chosen another man to dally with?</p> <p>At the thought of her with another man, there was no intense surge of jealousy, as a taken male should feel. Okay, so there was more confirmation. Much as he adored her, much as he craved her sexually, much as he couldn\u2019t resist her when she stepped inside this room, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen her had circumstances been different.</p><p>Damn. What kind of moron was he?</p><p>To his right, there was a flash of azure light. Torin twisted to face it, dread already pooling in his stomach. Cronus.</p><p>Sure enough, when the light faded, the god king was standing in the middle of Torin\u2019s bedroom. \u201cHello again, Disease,\u201d said that imperial voice. A white robe draped one of Cronus\u2019s deceptively fragile-looking shoulders and flowed to his ankles. On his feet were leather sandals. What always struck Torin was the clawlike curve of the immortal\u2019s toenails. They just didn\u2019t fit with the man\u2019s old world nobility.</p><p>\u201cYour Lordship.\u201d Torin didn\u2019t stand, as he knew Cronus expected. Already this god had too much power over him and his friends. He would keep what he could. Even this, so small a thing.</p><p>\u201cHave you been searching for the possessed prisoners as I commanded?\u201d</p> <p>Torin studied him more intently. Something was different about the god. He looked...younger, maybe. His silver beard wasn\u2019t as thick as usual, and there were streaks of blond mixed with his white hair. If the heavenly sovereign had been going for Botox and highlights, he should have had time for a pedicure.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Wait. What did Cronus want to know? Oh, yeah. \u201cSome of the warriors have been searching for them, yes.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in the king\u2019s jaw. \u201cNot good enough. I want the other possessed men and women found as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Well, Torin wanted to touch a female skin to skin without killing her, or in the case of an immortal, ruining the rest of her endless existence. Not everyone got what they wanted, did they? \u201cOur hands are a little full at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Silver eyes narrowed on him. \u201cUn-fill them.\u201d</p><p>As if it were that easy. \u201cWouldn\u2019t matter if I had all the time in the world. Some of the names have been removed from the list, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to find them all.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. Then, \u201cI removed them. You did not need those names.\u201d</p> <p>O-kay. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many questions, demon. So little action. Find the possessed or suffer my wrath. That is all you need know. I am not asking for the impossible. I have given you the names you require. Now all you must do is find them. You can identify them by the butterflies tattooed on their bodies.\u201d There at the end, the god\u2019s tone had been dry. Almost...amused.</p><p>Again, as if it were that easy. \u201cWhy butterflies, anyway?\u201d he grumbled, knowing it would do no good to argue. No one was more stubborn than Cronus. But he also knew that Cronus needed him to find and contain Galen. What he didn\u2019t know\u2014what nobody knew\u2014was why the god king couldn\u2019t do so on his own. Cronus wasn\u2019t exactly forthcoming.</p><p>\u201cMany reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m un-filling my time, as commanded, so I\u2019ve got enough to spare to listen to every one of those reasons.\u201d</p><p>Cronus\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cSomeone considers himself more useful than he actually is, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cI am lower than low, a nothing, unneeded, useless.\u201d</p><p>Cronus inclined his head in acknowledgment. \u201cAs my pet so quickly learned his place, I will give him a reward. You wish to know about the butterflies. Butterflies my children, the Greeks, bestowed upon you.\u201d</p><p>Torin nodded stiffly, not daring to speak lest he talk the god out of this boon.</p><p>\u201cBefore your possession, you were limited in what you could do, where you could go. Trapped in a cocoon, you could say. Now look at you.\u201d He waved his hand along Torin\u2019s body. \u201cYou emerged as something dark but beautiful. That\u2019s why I would have chosen the mark, at least. My children, well...\u201d He opened his mouth to say more, paused, and then his head tilted to the side. \u201cYou have another visitor. Next time I visit you, Disease, I expect results. Or you will not find me so lenient.\u201d And then the god was gone and there was a knock at the door.</p><p>Torin flicked a glance to the monitor at his left. Cameo waved up at him, as if his earlier thoughts had summoned her. He shoved Cronus and the god\u2019s warnings to the back of his mind. He planned to help the king, but he would not jump when the bastard said jump. Pet, indeed.</p><p>Body still prepped and ready because of the glimpses he\u2019d gotten of Lickable Ears, he pressed the button that unlocked his door. Cameo sailed inside, closing the wood behind her with a determined click. He swiveled in his chair, studying her with new understanding. Her color was high, pretty, and tension hummed from her. But that was all. Tension. The need for release.</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t have chosen him, either.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you a question,\u201d he said, twining his fingers over his middle.</p><p>Her hips swayed as she approached him, and her lips curled into a slow smile. \u201cAll right.\u201d She\u2019d probably meant to sound husky, sexy, but that tragic voice only reached I-might-not-kill-myself-after-all.</p><p>\u201cWhy me? You could have any man here.\u201d</p><p>That had her grinding to a stop. Then her smile inched into a frown as she hopped onto the edge of his desk, out of reach, legs swinging. \u201cYou really want to talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is, these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. You understand me, my demon. My curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do the others here.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers twisted in her lap. \u201cAgain, I have to ask if you really want to go there. Especially since we could be doing something else...\u201d</p><p>Did he? It might alter the good thing they had going. Pleasure for both of them. Pleasure he wouldn\u2019t\u2014and couldn\u2019t\u2014get anywhere else. \u201cYeah. I want to go there.\u201d Idiot. But every day he saw Maddox and Ashlyn, Lucien and Anya, Reyes and Danika, and now Sabin and the Harpy, and he wanted something like that for himself.</p><p>Not that he could ever have it. He\u2019d tried once, about four hundred years ago. All he\u2019d had to do to ruin it was take off his gloves, caress his would-be-lover\u2019s face\u2014and then watch her die the next day, her body ravaged by the disease he\u2019d given her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go through that again.</p><p>Since then, he\u2019d purposely stayed away from all things female. Until Cameo. She was the first woman he\u2019d looked at, truly looked at, in too many years to count.</p><p>Her gaze darted away from him. \u201cYou\u2019re here. You never leave. You won\u2019t be killed in a battle. The man I loved was taken from me, tortured by my enemy and sent back in pieces. I don\u2019t have to worry about that with you. And I like you. I really do.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t love him, and the potential for love, the forever, die-without-you kind of love, anyway, wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t that just about on par with the rest of his life?</p><p>\u201cSo...do you want to stop?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He glanced at the monitor again. No sign of his pointy-eared babe. \u201cDo I look stupid?\u201d</p><p>A laugh escaped her, chasing away her sadness. \u201cGood. We\u2019ll continue on as we have been. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But what happens when you meet a man you could love?\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip and shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop.\u201d She didn\u2019t ask him the same question. Except, of course, switching \u201cman\u201d for \u201cwoman.\u201d Both of them knew he\u2019d never meet a woman who could live with him in any sense of the word.</p><p>One of his computers beeped, catching his attention. He straightened, scanning until he found the proper screen. A breath whistled from between his teeth. \u201cHoly hell, I did it!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameo asked.</p><p>\u201cI found Galen.

Then, to her sisters, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not taking her away from me.\u201d They\u2019d spent the last hour packing their stuff\u2014and some of his\u2014and were now standing in the foyer of the fortress.</p> <p>They were ready to leave, but Gwen kept stalling, \u201cremembering\u201d something she\u2019d left in his room.He knew the Harpies meant to take her away, for now and always. Right in front of him, they\u2019d talked about how they didn\u2019t want him around Gwen anymore. They thought she was breaking too many rules, softening too much for a man who could never place her first on his list of priorities. More than that, they didn\u2019t like that he\u2019d made love to her out in the open, where anyone, even an enemy, could have snuck up on him.</p><p>They liked him, appreciated what he\u2019d done to toughen Gwen up\u2014that had been admitted grudgingly\u2014but still considered him bad for her. And not the good kind of bad.</p><p>Hearing them talk, thinking about being without her, was screwing with his head. He couldn\u2019t be without her. Wouldn\u2019t be without her. He wouldn\u2019t lose her to her sisters and he damn sure wouldn\u2019t lose her to his war. He needed her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do anything we damn well please,\u201d Bianka said, her tone daring him to contradict her again. \u201cSoon as Gwen finds her...whatever she mentioned this time...we\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d His phone beeped, signaling a message. Frowning, he withdrew the device from his pocket. A text from Torin.</p> <p>Galen in Buda. With an army. Prepare.</p><p>Then Cameo was racing down the stairs. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the Harpies asked. Even though they were planning to leave, they still felt entitled to know his business. Figured.</p><p>\u201cHe probably never left,\u201d Cameo continued as if they hadn\u2019t spoken. She stopped in front of him. \u201cHe\u2019s probably been here the whole time, waiting, watching, growing his numbers. And now that we\u2019re down half our number...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Sabin scoured his face with a hard hand. \u201cWhat better time to punish us for what happened in Egypt. And let\u2019s not forget he wants those women back.\u201d Gwen included.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Torin\u2019s alerting the others,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not headed here, at least, but they are assembling in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Bianka demanded.</p><p>\u201cHunters are here and ready for battle,\u201d Sabin told her. \u201cYou said you\u2019d fight for me, help me defeat them. Well, now\u2019s your chance.\u201d First, though, he had to figure out what to do about Gwen while he\u2014they?\u2014were gone. If they dared try to abscond with her while his back was turned...</p><p>A snarl rose in his throat, tickling his voice box.</p><p>And yeah, the thought of leaving a strong, capable warrior behind was foreign to him. Even straight-up ridiculous. Especially since he\u2019d thought to send Gwen into battle from the very beginning. But he wasn\u2019t going to change his mind. Somehow, some way, Gwen had become the most important thing in his life.</p><p>He\u2019d left her alone these past few days, trying to diminish her importance to him, as well as straighten out his priorities. Hadn\u2019t worked. She\u2019d become more important\u2014and his number one priority.</p><p>Just then Kane rushed past them. He was carrying the still-broken portrait of Galen that Danika had painted, one half in each hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with that?\u201d Sabin called.</p> <p>\u201cTorin wants me to lock it up,\u201d was the reply. \u201cJust in case.\u201d</p><p>Gaping, Kaia grabbed Kane by the arm, stopping him. \u201cHow did you get that? I hope you know you\u2019re going to pay for breaking it, you bast\u2014\u201d She released him with a yelp and rubbed her palm. \u201cHow the hell did you shock me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Gwen pounded down the steps, her gaze riveted on the portrait. Her skin was pale, her mouth hanging open. \u201cHow did you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sabin crossed the threshold to stand beside her. He wrapped an arm around her waist. She was trembling.</p><p>Taliyah\u2019s cool gaze shot from Gwen to the portrait, the portrait to Gwen. She, too, was paling, her already pallid skin revealing deep blue veins. \u201cWe need to go,\u201d she said, and for the first time since Sabin had met her, there was emotion in her tone. Dread. Worry.</p><p>Bianka pounded forward and grabbed for Gwen\u2019s wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t say a word. Let\u2019s get out of here, go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Sabin said, holding tight. What the hell was going on?</p><p>A tug-of-war began, but Gwen barely seemed to notice.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d she finally said, the words so quiet he had to strain to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father?\u201d he prompted. She\u2019d never spoken of the man before, so he\u2019d just assumed whoever it was was not a part of her life.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t like me to talk about him. He\u2019s not like us. But how did you get this? It was hanging in my room in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He glanced at the portrait. \u201cAre you saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man is my father, yes.\u201d</p><p>No. No. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Look more closely and you\u2019ll see that you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d Be mistaken. Please be mistaken. He gripped her shoulders and forced her to face the painting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mistaken. That\u2019s him. I never knew him, but I\u2019ve studied this painting my entire life.\u201d Her tone was wistful. \u201cIt\u2019s the only link I have to my good side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen!\u201d the Harpies shouted as one. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>She ignored them. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s my father. Why? What\u2019s wrong with you? And how did you get the painting? Why is it broken?\u201d</p><p>Another wave of denial burst through him, followed quickly by shock and more slowly by acceptance. With the acceptance came fury. So much fury, blended with the very dread and worry Taliyah had expressed. Galen was Gwen\u2019s father. Galen, his greatest enemy, the immortal responsible for the worst days of his long, long life, was Gwen\u2019s fucking father.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Kane said. \u201cShit, shit, shit. This is bad. Very bad.\u201d</p><p>Sabin popped his jaw and did his best to gather his composure. \u201cThe portrait is hanging in your room? This exact portrait?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy mother gave it to me. She painted it years ago, when she realized she carried me. She wanted me to see the angel, to want to be different from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Kaia snapped, pulling on her sister all the harder. \u201cWe told you to stop.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t. It was as though the words were leaving her of their own free will, bottled up too long and spilling over. And maybe, having learned to fight, she was no longer afraid to stand up for what she desired. \u201cShe had a broken wing and crawled into a cave to heal. He was chasing a demon disguised as a human, a demon who ran inside that cave and tried to use her as a shield. He saved her, got rid of the demon.</p><p>\u201cHe doctored her, and she slept with him, even though she hated what he was. She said she couldn\u2019t help herself, that she felt hopeful of a future with him. A future she had somehow convinced herself she wanted. Afterward, the dark-haired woman you see there arrived with a message, something about catching sight of a spirit, and he had to leave. He told her to wait, that he\u2019d come back for her. But when he was gone, my mother regained her senses, realized she wanted nothing to do with a real live angel, and left. She\u2019s an artist, and when I was born she painted his portrait with the woman. The last vision she had of him was to be my first, she said.\u201d</p><p>Dear. Gods. \u201cDo you know who your father is, Gwen?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Finally her eyes tore from the portrait and landed on him, confusion swimming in their depths. \u201cYes. An angel, like I said. An angel my mother seduced. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the way I am. Weaker, less aggressive.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t that way any longer, but now was hardly the time to point that out. \u201cGalen is no angel,\u201d Sabin said, his disgust loud and clear. \u201cThe man you\u2019re looking at, naming your father, is a demon, the keeper of Hope. I guarantee he\u2019s the reason your mother experienced that false sense of hope for a future with him and why she wised up so soon after he left.\u201d</p><p>A heavy gasp escaped her, and she shook her head violently. \u201cNo. No, that can\u2019t be right. If I possessed demon blood, I would have been strong like my sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were, you just refused to see it,\u201d Bianka said. \u201cMom beat down your confidence, is my guess.\u201d</p><p>Sabin closed his eyes, opened them. Why did this have to happen now?</p><p>\u201cThat man is just like me, except for one important distinction. He\u2019s the leader of the Hunters. He\u2019s responsible for the rape of those women. He\u2019s commander of the men who captured you. He\u2019s here, in Buda, and he\u2019s itching for battle.\u201d As he spoke, he realized his mistake. Delight sparked in her eyes at the knowledge that her father was nearby.</p><p>Not so long ago, Sabin had entertained the thought that the Hunters had planted her in that cell, thinking to use her as Bait to learn his secrets and lure him to his death. He\u2019d discarded that thought immediately. He still discarded it, even though Doubt was shouting in his head, tossing out other possibilities.</p><p>She was more dangerous than Bait. Galen could play the father card to get her to betray Sabin.</p><p>Damn this!</p><p>\u201cThat just can\u2019t be right,\u201d Gwen repeated, delight replaced by disbelief as she faced her sisters. \u201cI\u2019ve never been like you, despite what Bianka said. I\u2019ve always been too soft. Like an angel. How could my father be a demon? I would have been worse than you! Right? I mean...I can\u2019t...did you know anything about this?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, Kaia stepped forward, getting in Sabin\u2019s face, placing them nose to nose. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. Much as we have always wished otherwise, her father is not a demon. And he\u2019s certainly not leading those Hunters. If Gwen were half demon, we would have known it. She wouldn\u2019t have\u2014there\u2019s just been some sort of mistake. Gwen\u2019s father is not the leader of your enemy, so don\u2019t even think about hurting her!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gwen\u2019s goddamn father. The words echoed through his mind, though he almost couldn\u2019t process them. Any future he\u2019d imagined with Gwen was most likely ruined. Even if she was completely innocent and hadn\u2019t aided her bastard of a father, which he knew she was, Sabin planned to lock him away for eternity. How could she live with the warrior who\u2019d imprisoned her father?</p><p>Besides, most people wouldn\u2019t turn on family, no matter the circumstances. He wouldn\u2019t. His friends\u2014his makeshift family\u2014were everything to him. Always had been. And it had to stay that way.</p><p>No matter how much his mind might be screaming not to do what he was now planning.</p> <p>Gwen might not have aided her father, but that could change at any moment, now that she knew who he was. Fucking Fate!</p><p>\u201cMaybe Kaia\u2019s right and you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d she said hopefully, clutching his shirt. \u201cMaybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent a thousand years with that man, guarding the king of gods in the heavens. I spent a few thousand more hating him with every fiber of my being. I damn well know who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would a demon lead the Hunters? Why does he want to find the box that will destroy all of you if it will destroy him, too? Huh? Tell me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019ll save himself. But I do know he\u2019s the reason we opened that damn box in the first place! He would do anything, even send his own daughter into our midst, to ruin us. And since our possession, he\u2019s fooled those humans into thinking he\u2019s an angel. That\u2019s how he\u2019s able to lead them.\u201d</p> <p>She scrubbed a hand down her face, a mimic of him. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right about him, maybe you\u2019re wrong. Either way, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Her eyes were luminous, even half-circled as they were by fading bruises. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t conspire against you.\u201d</p><p>He drew in a shuddering breath, released it. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, then? Do you think I\u2019ll aid him one day, now that I know who he is? I won\u2019t. I would never do that to you. Yeah, I\u2019m leaving as planned,\u201d her voice broke at that, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t trust me to fight with you. But you can trust me to keep your secrets safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d And then he went for her wings.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>A DUNGEON. Sabin had locked her in a freaking dungeon. Worse, he\u2019d locked her in a dungeon next to the Hunters, who were moaning and crying and begging to be set free. And he\u2019d done this after he\u2019d bound her wings. After she\u2019d trusted him with her secrets.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he\u2019d said, and there\u2019d been true remorse in his tone. \u201cBut this is for the best.\u201dLike that mattered now.</p><p>She\u2019d known he would do anything to win his war. She\u2019d known it, hated it, yet she\u2019d foolishly begun to believe his feelings had changed since he\u2019d met her. He\u2019d stayed with her, rather than go with his friends to Chicago. He\u2019d taught her how to kick major ass. He\u2019d asked her about a Harpy\u2019s consort, for gods\u2019 sake. And then he\u2019d decided to leave her behind, and she hadn\u2019t known if it was because he cared or because he had no faith in her ability.</p><p>Now she knew. He hadn\u2019t cared. He thought her father was his enemy, thought she was his enemy.</p><p>Was she?</p><p>If he was right and the man in the portrait was Galen, leader of the Hunters, then Galen was indeed her father. She\u2019d spent days, months, years staring at that same likeness: same pale hair and sky-colored eyes, same strong shoulders and white wings. Same broad back and carved chin. She\u2019d traced her fingertips over it, imagining she felt actual skin. How many times had she dreamed of him coming for her, gathering her in his arms, begging forgiveness for taking so long to find her, then flying her to the heavens? Countless. Now he was nearby...they could be reunited....</p><p>No. There would be no happy reunion. To learn that he was actually a demon...that he hurt people...that he wanted to kill Sabin...Sabin, whom she hungered for constantly, but who had locked her up in squalor as if she meant nothing to him.</p><p>Gwen spun in a circle, laughing bitterly. The floor was comprised of dirt. Three of the walls were made of stone. No crackable mortar, just smooth rock. One was made of thick metal bars. There wasn\u2019t even a cot to sleep on or a chair to sit on.</p><p>Last thing he\u2019d said before leaving her in this shithole? \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this when I return.\u201d</p> <p>Like hell they would.</p><p>One, she wouldn\u2019t be here. Two, she was going to break his jaw with her fist so he wouldn\u2019t be able to talk ever again. And three, she was going to kill him. And her anger was nothing compared to the Harpy\u2019s. It squawked inside her head, demanding retribution. How could Sabin have done this? How could he have taken her newly awakened need for vengeance away from her? How could he have left her here, after the way they\u2019d made love?</p><p>Sabin\u2019s betrayal was an even bigger blow than the newfound knowledge of her father\u2019s evil.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Bianka growled, stomping from one corner to another. Dark grains of sand flew around her booted feet. \u201cHe had all of our wings clipped before I even knew what was going on. He shouldn\u2019t have been able to do that. No one should have been able to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hang him with his own intestines.\u201d Kaia slammed a fist into a bar. It held steady, her strength basically that of a human\u2019s now. \u201cI\u2019m going to remove his limbs, one by one. I\u2019m going to feed him to my snake and let him rot in her belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine. I\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d The sad thing was, Gwen didn\u2019t want her sisters to punish him. She wanted to do it herself. Yes, that was part of it. Also, despite everything\u2014even her own desire to maim and kill him\u2014she didn\u2019t want to see him hurt. How stupid was that? As he\u2019d locked her up, relief had blazed in his eyes, even alongside the regret, so he deserved whatever she did to him. Deserved all but softening from her.</p><p>It had taken her a while to piece the reasons for his relief together. But finally, she had. He\u2019d gotten his wish: she couldn\u2019t leave the fortress, and she wouldn\u2019t be fighting Hunters. He\u2019d considered that more important than allowing her her freedom even though his enemies had once done the same thing to her.</p><p>Gwen, too, slammed a fist into the bar. The metal whined as it bent backward. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to\u2014hey. Did you see that?\u201d Shocked, she glanced down at her fist. There was a red line from the impact, but the bones were intact. Tentatively she punched the bar again. Again, it bent. \u201cOh, I am so getting out of here.\u201d</p><p>Kaia gaped at her. \u201cHow is that possible? I hit it, too, but it didn\u2019t budge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe damaged our wings, draining our strength,\u201d Taliyah said. Which had to have hurt like hell. \u201cHe only smashed Gwen\u2019s until he released her into this cage. She\u2019s as strong as she ever was. I wonder, though, how he knew to go for our wings and why he was so gentle with Gwen\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The first part of her sister\u2019s speech drained a little of her elation. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my fault. I didn\u2019t mean...I thought...I\u2019m so, so sorry. I told him. I thought he could help me train against it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your first love,\u201d Bianka said, surprising her. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>Grateful as she was for her sister\u2019s forgiveness, Gwen bristled at her words. First implied there would be many more. She didn\u2019t like the thought of being with another man. Didn\u2019t like the thought of kissing and touching someone else. Especially since she hadn\u2019t had nearly enough of Sabin. Did she love him, though?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. Not after this.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t blame me?\u201d</p><p>They gathered around her and hugged her, and her love for them swelled. Hands down, it was the best family moment ever. They supported her, no matter that she\u2019d broken the rules and screwed up royally.</p><p>When they released each other, Taliyah gave her lower back a shove and motioned to the bars with a tilt of her chin. \u201cDo it again. Harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to blow this joint,\u201d Kaia said, clapping.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s heart pounded as she obeyed, throwing her fist into the metal again and again. The bar bent and whined and bent some more.</p><p>\u201cKeep at it,\u201d Kaia and Bianka cheered in unison. \u201cYou\u2019re so close!\u201d</p><p>Pouring every ounce of her fury and frustration into the punches, she increased her velocity, watching as her fist hammered away, moving so swiftly she saw only a blur. Sabin must have assumed her utterly lacking in strength and wits because he hadn\u2019t left a guard. Or maybe all the warriors were now off fighting, only the females and Torin remaining. Gwen hadn\u2019t seen much of the reclusive Lord during her stay here, but Sabin had mentioned he never left the fortress, his link to the outside world the monitors in his chamber.</p><p>Was there a camera here? Probably.</p><p>Gwen didn\u2019t allow the thought to slow her. Boom. Boom. Boom!</p><p>Finally, the bar snapped completely, leaving a gaping space to shimmy through. Success\u2014and it felt damn good. They exited one at a time. When the Hunters spotted them outside the cell, they gripped their own bars in a frenzy.</p><p>\u201cLet us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Show us more mercy than we showed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not evil. They are. Help us!\u201d</p><p>The voices were familiar. She\u2019d heard them for a year of her life\u2014the worst year of her life. Hunters. Close. Hurt. Gwen felt her Harpy overtaking her, all but the colors of red and black fading from her vision. Hurt. Destroy. Under her shirt, her wings were flutteringly wildly.</p><p>These men had stolen twelve months from her. They had raped other women in front of her. They were evil. They were her enemy. Sabin\u2019s enemy. Led by her father. A man who was not the benevolent angel she\u2019d always thought him. She should kill him, too. He\u2019d destroyed all her dreams. But the moment she imagined going for his throat, even her Harpy shied away. Murder her own father? No...no. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No wonder Sabin had locked her up.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d</p><p>The cry drew her back to the present, back to her rage. Why hadn\u2019t Sabin killed these bastards yet? They needed to be killed. She had to kill them. Yes, kill...kill...</p> <p>In the back of her mind, she was aware of her sisters grasping at her arms but they were too weak to stop her. Usually, she tried to stop herself. Not this time. No longer. She was learning to embrace her Harpy, right?</p><p>She pounded at the second set of bars, fists again hammering, mouth now watering. Teeth sharpening. Nails elongating. The sight of her must have frightened them, because the men backed away from the bars.</p><p>Enemy...enemy...</p><p>Finally, the bars crumbled under her ministrations and she burst inside the cell with a screech. One minute men were standing, backing away from her, the next they were on the ground, motionless. More...she wanted more...</p><p>Her Harpy cooed happily while Gwen panted, trying to catch her breath as a deep male voice entered her awareness.</p> <p>\u201c\u2014Aeron and Paris are missing. Sabin, Cameo and Kane are in town, William and Maddox have the women in hiding, guarding them with their lives, so I\u2019m the only one here and I can\u2019t touch her because I\u2019m Disease. So do me a favor and calm her down or I\u2019ll have to do it and you won\u2019t like my methods.\u201d</p><p>The deep voice was unfamiliar to her. Good. Someone else for her to destroy. Where was...her gaze circled the room. Or rather, hallway. Oh, look there. Three bodies were vertical. They appeared feminine rather than masculine. All that meant was that they\u2019d taste sweeter.</p><p>More. She stalked from the cage, determined to make them fall as the Hunters had.</p><p>\u201cGwen.\u201d</p><p>She recognized that voice. It wasn\u2019t from her nightmares, but it didn\u2019t slow her. She rammed the woman in the temple with her fist, heard a gasp, watched the form fly back and slam into a rocky wall. Dust must have plumed around the woman because it filled Gwen\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cGwen, honey, you have to stop,\u201d another voice said. \u201cYou did this once before. Remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you did it twice, but the time we\u2019re referring to, you actually almost killed us, and we had to rip the wings from your back.\u201d A third familiar voice. \u201cWe hypnotized you to bury the memory, but it\u2019s there. Think back, Gwennie. Bianka, what\u2019s the damn code phrase to make her remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cButterscotch rum? Hopscotch butter buns? Something stupid like that.\u201d</p><p>The memory rose...higher...higher...pushing forward, and soon the shadows around it scattered and light pierced it, shining brightly. She\u2019d been eight years old. Something had set her off...a cousin had eaten her birthday cake. Yes. That\u2019s right. She\u2019d laughed while she\u2019d done it, taunting Gwen, after she\u2019d nearly gotten captured for stealing it.</p><p>The tether she\u2019d kept the Harpy on had snapped inside her, and the next thing she\u2019d known, the cousin and her sisters were hovering near death. The only reason they\u2019d survived was that Taliyah had somehow ripped off her wings in the fray.</p><p>It had taken her weeks to regrow them. Weeks they\u2019d taken from her memory, as well. My memory, the Harpy squawked. Mine.</p><p>Possessive bitch. Memory loss was better than the alternative, a rational part of her brain supplied. The guilt would have destroyed me.</p><p>They are weak. They can\u2019t hurt you this time. You can\u2014</p><p>\u201cGods, who would have thought I\u2019d want that stupid demon back in her life?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTorin, dude, can you get Sabin here? He\u2019s the only one who can calm her without hurting her.\u201d</p><p>Sabin. Sabin. Tendrils of her bloodlust faded, leaving room for Gwen\u2019s conscience to make itself known. You don\u2019t want to kill your sisters. You love them. In and out she breathed, slow and measured. Slowly colors sparked inside her mind, the black and red dispersing. Gray walls, brown floor. Taliyah\u2019s white hair, Kaia\u2019s red and Bianka\u2019s black. They were scratched up but alive, thank the heavens.</p><p>Then realization struck. You did it. You calmed yourself down without killing everyone in the room. Her eyes widened, and despite the chaos around her, joy burst through her. That had never happened before. Each time she\u2019d lost control here at the fortress, Sabin had been here to talk her down. Maybe she didn\u2019t need to fear her Harpy anymore. Maybe, for once, they could live in harmony. Even without Sabin.</p><p>The thought nearly dropped her to her knees. She didn\u2019t want to live without him. She\u2019d planned to leave, yes, but if she were honest she\u2019d admit that she\u2019d expected him to come for her\u2014or to return herself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d Bianka asked, as surprised as she was.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She spun, purposely avoiding the Hunter\u2019s cage, and found no trace of the man who had been speaking. \u201cWhere\u2019s Torin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not actually here,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cHe was talking to us from a speaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he knows we escaped,\u201d she said, clutching her stomach and backing away. What if he came for them? What if she killed him to keep him from locking her up again? Sabin would never forgive her. Would believe beyond any doubt\u2014and that was saying something for him\u2014that she meant to aid the Hunters. Wait, you don\u2019t fear your Harpy anymore, remember? Old habits died hard, she supposed.</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Taliyah said as Torin echoed, \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>Kaia grabbed her shoulders and forced Gwen to still. \u201cHe can\u2019t do anything because he can\u2019t touch us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can shoot you,\u201d that disembodied voice reminded them.</p><p>Gwen shuddered. Bullets were not fun.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s gather Ashlyn and Danika,\u201d Kaia said, unconcerned with either their audience or Torin\u2019s threat.</p><p>\u201cTorin said they\u2019re guarded by Maddox and William,\u201d Bianka reminded her. \u201cLet\u2019s take them, too.\u201d</p><p>Nervous energy still pounded through Gwen, but those words had her blood freezing. \u201cWhy do we want them?\u201d The girls were sweet and kind and didn\u2019t deserve to be hurt.</p><p>\u201cPayback. Now come on.\u201d Bianka turned on her heel and pounded up the steps, headed into the main house.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Gwen called, her voice shaking. \u201cPayback how?\u201d</p><p>Kaia released her and turned, as well. \u201cSabin damaged our wings, so now we\u2019re going to damage his precious army. When the rest of the warriors return and find the women missing, as well as their friends, they\u2019ll freak.\u201d</p><p>No, she thought. No. \u201cI told you. Sabin\u2019s mine. I\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d</p><p>Both Kaia and Taliyah ignored her, following after Bianka.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We may be weakened but that\u2019s what guns are for,\u201d Kaia said, grinning over her shoulder in the likely direction of Torin\u2019s camera. \u201cRight, Tor-Tor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you do this,\u201d he replied, his voice hard as steel.</p><p>\u201cWatch us.\u201d Taliyah\u2019s voice was cold as ice. Quite a pair they made just then, both unwilling to bend.</p><p>Gwen watched her sisters disappear up the stairs. To capture the innocent females, to hurt her man. Well, not her man. Not anymore. But she realized she had a choice to make. Allow things to play out as they were, or stop her sisters, maybe hurting them in the process, and take matters into her own hands.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Torin said, jolting her. \u201cYou can\u2019t let them do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I love them.\u201d They\u2019d always been there for her. They\u2019d forgiven her so easily for spilling their secrets. They\u2019d even tried to protect her from her own memories. To do this...</p><p>\u201cThe men will fight to the death to protect those females. And if your sisters do manage to defeat them\u2014which is a big if since they aren\u2019t operating at full strength\u2014it\u2019ll mean war between the Lords and the Harpies.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it would.</p><p>\u201cIt will divide the warriors here, because I suspect Sabin will choose you. And that will make us vulnerable to the Hunters. They\u2019ll have the advantage. If they don\u2019t already. I haven\u2019t been able to reach Lucien all day. Not Strider, Anya, or any of the others who went to Chicago, either. That\u2019s not like them, and I\u2019m afraid something\u2019s happened to them. I need Sabin to go look for them, but he\u2019s stuck here, fighting.\u201d</p><p>Her first thought? She hoped the Lords in Chicago were okay. Her second? Sabin, choose her? Not likely. \u201cHe could have had my help, but he doesn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe trusts you. He just used that as an excuse to protect you. Even I know that, and I\u2019m not that close to him.\u201d Heavy pause, breath crackling. \u201cWell, you\u2019d better make a decision fast because your sisters are indeed carrying guns and are closing in on their targets.\u201d</p><p>SABIN CROUCHED in the shadows. Kane was at his left, Cameo at his right; they were loaded down with enough weapons to take out a small country. Sadly, that might not be enough for the coming battle.</p><p>Hunters were everywhere. Coming out of shops, striding down the sidewalks, eating at outdoor caf\u00e9s. Like flies, they swarmed and buzzed and annoyed the hell out of him.There were average-looking women, the bulge of knives and guns giving them away. Tall, muscled men who looked like they\u2019d just come from war and were eager for another were positioned on the rooftops of buildings, gazing down at the town\u2019s happenings. Beside them, to Sabin\u2019s dismay, were children, ranging in age from roughly eight to eighteen. Sabin had already watched one of those teens walk through a wall. Walk through it, as if it weren\u2019t even there.</p><p>What could the others do?</p><p>He was outmanned, and he knew it. And even as depraved as he was, he also knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt the kids. Hunters had probably banked on that. Could have used a Harpy right about now.</p><p>His fingers curled tightly around his guns, his bones brittle. Don\u2019t go there. He\u2019d been surveying the scene for a while, trying to decide, to work up a plan. Rather than feeling empowered, though, he felt more helpless than ever. He just didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>The worst part was that he\u2019d left Gwen locked up\u2014looked like he was going there, after all\u2014and so another battle awaited him at home. Stupid. He\u2019d allowed his concern for her to overrule his common sense. That was the danger of softening toward a woman. Emotions screwed with your thought processes, made you do stupid things. But he couldn\u2019t go back for her, apologize and ask for her aid. He\u2019d hurt her sisters. Loyal and loving as they were with each other, she would never be able to forgive him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Over and over he tried to tell himself that it was better this way. That he\u2019d fought Hunters and won before her, and he could fight Hunters and win after her. And anyway, she was related to Galen. Sabin couldn\u2019t trust Gwen\u2019s motivation now. He couldn\u2019t trust her to help him and not also help her family.</p><p>Gwen could be your family. He scowled at the wayward thought, scowled further when Doubt chimed in.</p><p>You don\u2019t deserve her. Not now. Maybe not even before. She wouldn\u2019t want you anyway, so this is moot.</p> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Kane flicked him a glance. \u201cYour demon giving you trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do about the current situation? It\u2019s just the three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve fought with worse odds,\u201d Cameo said, and Sabin cringed. Her voice always had that effect on him. Strangely, though, it didn\u2019t affect him as badly as usual this time. Maybe because he was already miserable. How could he have done that to Gwen?</p> <p>I just wanted to protect her.</p><p>Well, you failed.</p><p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause this time we have to make sure no kids get hurt in the fray.\u201d</p><p>Her finger flexed on her gun. \u201cWell, we have to do something. We can\u2019t leave them out there unfettered.\u201d</p><p>Sabin studied the melee again. Just as crowded, just as dangerous. Those kids...shit. They complicated everything. Decision time. \u201cOkay. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. Split up, head in different directions, stay in the shadows, damn it, and take out the adults one by one. Kill on sight. Just...don\u2019t get yourselves killed. Do me a favor and\u2014\u201d His words stopped abruptly, his gaze slamming into the camo-clad Hunters stuffing two unconscious men into their van at the end of the street. Several of the kids surrounded them, forming a wall.</p><p>Cameo followed the line of his gaze and gasped. \u201cIs that...\u201d</p> <p>The chunk of earth underneath Kane split, and he fell into the widening hole. \u201cAeron and Paris? Shit. Yes. That\u2019s them.\u201d</p><p>Sabin cursed under his breath. \u201cNew plan. Kill as many of the men around them as possible, and I\u2019ll take care of the kids. If you can, drag Aeron and Paris back to the fortress and I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>GWEN HAD LOCKED her sisters up. I\u2019m as bad as Sabin.</p><p>She was inside Torin\u2019s room, standing behind him, arms crossed over her chest. He kept his back to her, as if he didn\u2019t have to worry about her approaching. He didn\u2019t. But at the very least, he should have feared a bullet in the brain. She was a Harpy, after all.\u201cI think I just made the biggest mistake of my life and it\u2019s too late to fix it.\u201d If her sisters forgave her, and if she forgave Sabin, they\u2019d still want to punish her for her actions. Oh, who was she kidding? Everyone she loved\u2014well, kind of liked, sometimes, in Sabin\u2019s case\u2014was stubborn to their very cores. There\u2019d be no forgiveness.</p><p>Her gaze landed on one of the monitors, the one that showed her sisters. They were pacing, cursing and beating at the bars, to no avail. They were fast healers, so she had perhaps a few days before they were able to bust out. And punish her for betraying them, of course. Gwen\u2019s chest constricted.</p><p>Taliyah had put up the greatest fight, and Gwen still bore the wounds. There were multiple gashes riding her ribs and neck. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d actually beaten them, even weakened as they\u2019d been. All her life, they\u2019d been the pinnacle she\u2019d longed to reach. Stronger, prettier, smarter. Better. She\u2019d constantly compared herself to them and always came up lacking.</p><p>Now, here she was, a warrior to the core. If she succeeded with the Hunters, would they be proud of her?</p> <p>On one of the other monitors, Maddox and William paced, both weighed down with too many weapons to count. Ashlyn and Danika were behind them, wringing their hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d Danika could be heard saying. \u201cThe dream I had last night...I saw Reyes trapped in a dark box, his demon screaming and screaming and screaming for release.\u201d</p><p>Ashlyn rubbed her rounded belly, her features pale. \u201cMaybe we should travel to Chicago. I can listen, learn whether Hunters have hidden them and where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Maddox said.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Danika said, speaking over him. \u201cBut what about what Torin told us? Hunters are out there in Buda even now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter head into town,\u201d Torin suddenly said, drawing her attention from the monitors, his voice no longer dryly amused. \u201cJust got a text from Sabin. Aeron and Paris are injured and being stuffed inside a van, Hunters are swarming and Sabin\u2019s about to initiate battle.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s stomach twisted painfully. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a tracker in Sabin\u2019s cell and it\u2019s showing his location as two miles north of here. Head out the back door and down the hill. Don\u2019t take any turns and you\u2019ll run right into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She needed weapons. Lots and lots of weapons. An image of the chest in Sabin\u2019s closet filled her mind. Perfect! She spun on her heel, meaning to stalk out of Torin\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Gwen.\u201d</p><p>She turned, faced him.</p><p>He opened a map of the surrounding forest on the far computer screen, a red line highlighting the way. \u201cThere are traps here, here and here, so be careful as you descend or you\u2019ll be blindsided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d With another sigh, she raced to Sabin\u2019s bedroom. The chest was no longer locked, thanks to her sisters, and nearly picked clean. There was only a gun and a knife. She took both. There\u2019d been no time to train with a semiautomatic yet, but pointing and shooting didn\u2019t sound too difficult.</p><p>\u201cHere goes,\u201d she muttered, wings fluttering frantically. Out of the fortress and down the hill she raced, not even glancing at the SUV parked in back. In Harpy form, she could get there faster.</p><p>The two-mile trek took her less than a minute to make. And it only took that long because she had to dodge the Lords\u2019 booby traps. The town was bursting with pedestrians. Thankfully, blur that she was, no one had spotted her yet. Some felt her, though, looking confused as she breezed by and wind caressed them.</p><p>Once she reached her destination she continued moving swiftly, eyes drinking in the scene. A group of military types surrounded an open van. As Torin had said, there were two unconscious men lying inside. Three guards crouched beside them, guns at the ready, smoke wafting from their barrels.</p><p>There was not a driver in front. Odd, she thought, until she realized Kane was behind a building and killing anyone who approached the wheel. The front glass was already shattered, blood dripping from the wheel. Four bodies were sprawled outside the open door.</p><p>When a Hunter approached him, Kane simply switched locations and hid, keeping his gun trained on the van.</p><p>Where was Sabin?</p><p>Why weren\u2019t humans screaming?</p><p>Even as she questioned herself, her gaze fell on a young girl who had her arms outstretched. A soft voice whispered through Gwen\u2019s mind: Stay calm. Go home. Forget that you came into town. Forget what you saw.</p><p>That beguiling voice made Gwen want to do as it suggested, the memories already fading, her body already spinning toward the fortress. Perhaps she would have obeyed completely if not for her Harpy. The dark side of her nature squawked and clawed inside her mind, drowning out the voice, reminding her of her purpose.</p><p>What should I do? And what was up with all the kids she was suddenly seeing? One of them, a little boy, was moving through the town almost as fast as Gwen was. Only reason she saw him was that he left a slight trail of light in his wake. He was obviously searching for the Lords, and when he spotted one\u2014Cameo, this time\u2014he stopped and began to yell.</p><p>Frowning, clearly reluctant to hurt him, Cameo grabbed the boy and pinched his carotid. He went down like a brick. Sweat ran down her face, along her chest, soaking her T-shirt to her body. Gwen had never seen the female warrior so upset and tired.</p><p>But at least one question had been answered. The kids were obviously helping the Hunters.</p><p>There was an infuriated growl behind her. \u201cCome out, come out wherever you are. You can\u2019t beat us, and you can\u2019t call for reinforcements. We\u2019ve got your friends. You\u2019ve never been more ripe for the plucking.\u201d</p><p>Gwen spun, but another voice called out, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give yourselves up, save yourselves the humiliation of failing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou claim you\u2019re not evil\u2014well, now\u2019s the time to prove it! Turn yourselves over to us and give us the girl. Let us find a way to remove the demons from your bodies. Help us return the world to what it once was\u2014good and right and pure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe beg us for forgiveness, too,\u201d a male sneered. \u201cHad you been locked up as intended, sickness would never have been introduced into the world and my son would still be alive.\u201d</p><p>Wow, Gwen mused. Hunters really were fanatics. As if the Lords were responsible for all of the world\u2019s evil. Humans had free will. Hunters, too. They\u2019d chosen to lock Gwen up. They\u2019d chosen to rape females of the otherworld. That made the Hunters evil\u2014and unworthy of mercy.</p><p>Someone screamed, drawing Gwen\u2019s attention. Her eyes widened when she saw Sabin dance through a mass of men, two daggers clutched in his hands. His arms moved gracefully, slicing through humans with lethal procession. One by one they fell around him.</p><p>Nearly every inch of his clothes was bright crimson, as though his entire body was cut up. Hopefully, that was not the case. Hopefully, he wore his enemy\u2019s blood.</p><p>Gwen felt the now familiar surge of her Harpy taking over, mind and body, nothing holding it back. At first, she experienced her instinctive fear. Then the fear faded. I can do this. I will do this. Her vision tunneled to red and black, and her mouth watered for a taste of that sweet red nectar. Her hands itched to hurt...maim.</p><p>Just before she gave over completely, she thought: Please don\u2019t hurt Sabin or his friends. Please don\u2019t hurt the children. Please take as many as you can to the fortress and lock them up. That\u2019s what Sabin would want. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wings swishing more frantically than ever, Gwen scooped up the sleeping child Cameo had taken down\u2014don\u2019t hurt, don\u2019t hurt, don\u2019t hurt\u2014and carted his motionless body with her as she swooped through the masses and chop-blocked Hunters, fractured their kneecaps so they couldn\u2019t stand and slammed the hilt of her blade into their temples.</p><p>Should have brought the SUV, after all, she thought as she gathered one of the unconscious Hunters in her other arm and headed toward the fortress. She deposited her cargo in one of the dungeon cells and rejoined the fray. The total journey took five minutes. She repeated the action sixteen times before realizing she was shaking, slowing a little. The crowd, at least, was thinning.</p><p>Sabin was still on his feet and Cameo was at his back, each dispatching threats from a different direction. Kane still had his weapon trained on the van.</p> <p>Aeron and Paris, she thought, working her way toward them. She had to remove them from the area. They were clearly injured and in dire need of help. But a Hunter stepped into her path and she slammed into him, losing her breath as she soared backward. When she landed, broken pieces of concrete jabbed into her back, cutting.</p><p>Sabin dispatched him and was at her side a moment later, as if he\u2019d known exactly where she was the entire time despite her speed, and jerking her to her feet. \u201cTorin texted me, told me you were here. You okay?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>The feel of his hand on her...divine. Momentarily made her forget where she was and what she was doing. The sweat and blood glistening off him reminded her. \u201cYes,\u201d she rasped. She was panting, tired, overheated, aching and trembling. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He swayed, scrubbing a hand down his face as if to clear his line of vision. Never had she seen the fierce, vibrant warrior so near the end of his tolerance. \u201cCan you get Aeron and Paris to safety?\u201d</p><p>At least he wasn\u2019t trying to send her away. \u201cYes.\u201d She hoped. But just then she wanted to take Sabin to safety, rather than his friends.</p> <p>Sabin grabbed the semiautomatic from the back of her waist and removed the safety. \u201cYou mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you to the van,\u201d he said before she could grab him, and off he went. A rapid boom, boom, boom followed.</p><p>Even with the blocks her ears were sensitive and the sound of that gunfire had her cringing. In fact, she felt warm liquid trickle from her eardrums. Thankfully, the blood somehow muted the volume.</p><p>Once again bodies began falling around him. Gwen moved forward, noticing that only one child remained among the masses. The little girl keeping the townspeople at bay. Gwen had several kids locked up, but thought the Hunters must have taken some of the others and run. What kind of monsters brought children into war?</p><p>When she reached the van, Sabin continued to fire, even though there were no longer any Hunters around the vehicle, the last few having taken off to hide. Or maybe they\u2019d been nailed by Kane. She hefted a warrior on each shoulder, nearly toppling under their weight. No way she\u2019d be able to cart them both at the same time.</p> <p>She placed Aeron on the seat as gently as she could and tightened her grip on Paris. He wore the most blood. \u201cHave to come back,\u201d she said, hoping Sabin heard her, and sprinted for the trees. This journey took a little longer, her sprint slowing. Finally, though, she reached her destination.</p><p>Huffing, she deposited the hulking warrior in the foyer of the fortress. Torin must have seen her coming and alerted Maddox and William, because the men had let the women out of hiding. When Ashlyn and Danika spotted Paris, they rushed forward.</p><p>Fear gleamed in Danika\u2019s dark green eyes. \u201cIs he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going\u2014\u201d Ashlyn began.</p><p>\u201cNo time. Have to go back for the others.\u201d Gwen didn\u2019t wait for a reply but rushed back to the city.</p><p>Sabin was still at the van, a group of Hunters now holding shields and pushing their way toward him. Clearly they\u2019d come prepared for anything. Still trembling, and fatigued beyond imagining, Gwen lifted Aeron and took off at a run.</p><p>Before she reached the forest\u2019s edge, a bullet pierced her left thigh.</p> <p>She cried out, dropped to the ground. Aeron grunted, but didn\u2019t wake, and blood gushed from her. Damn it! An artery had been hit. The trembling became almost violent, but she pushed to her feet. Black winked in and out of her vision. Keep going. You can do it. She surged ahead. Took her ten minutes this time, but reaching the finish line had never been sweeter.</p><p>Again, both Danika and Ashlyn were waiting for her, doctoring Paris there in the foyer while Maddox and William rushed to get them whatever they needed.</p><p>Gwen dropped Aeron beside his friend, too weak to be gentle this time. When she stumbled to the door, Danika grabbed her arm.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go back. You can barely stand.\u201d</p><p>She jerked loose. \u201cHave to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t make it. You\u2019ll faint on the hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll drive.\u201d \u2019Cause there was no way she was staying here. Sabin was out there, needed her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d There was steel in Danika\u2019s tone. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you. Just let me get the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam,\u201d Maddox called.</p><p>The warrior sighed. \u201cI know what that means. I\u2019m supposed to do the driving.\u201d</p><p>Still Danika rushed off. Ashlyn stepped up and placed two fingertips at the base of Gwen\u2019s neck. \u201cYour pulse is too fast,\u201d she said on a sigh. \u201cBreathe slower. That\u2019s the way. In. Out. Good girl.\u201d</p><p>She must have closed her eyes because the next thing she knew, her leg was bandaged and William was at her side, grabbing her hand and ushering her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cDanni gave me the keys. If we\u2019re gonna do this, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Ashlyn called.</p><p>Once they were settled in the SUV, William peeled out, burning rubber through the forest. Gwen was thrown against the door, and her temple slapped into the window. That\u2019s gonna leave a mark, she thought dizzily.</p><p>\u201cYou holding on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, the word weak, even to her own ears.</p><p>\u201cHey, listen. Thank you for bringing Aeron and Paris home. Anya loves them and would have been devastated if they\u2019d been killed. Much as she irritates me, I want her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d And pain.</p><p>When they reached their destination, the battle had already wound down. Sabin, Kane and Cameo were bleeding profusely, cut up and nearly broken, but they continued fighting the stragglers.</p><p>Seeing the SUV, they jumped back, out of the way. Gwen braced herself as William hit the gas and ran over the humans. \u201cGods, this is fun,\u201d he said on a laugh. The vehicle bounced once, twice. Before it stopped, Gwen threw open her door. Sabin sprinted to her side and dove in. The others claimed the backseat just as swiftly.</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go,\u201d Sabin commanded, and William once again burned rubber. Sabin\u2019s arm wound around Gwen\u2019s waist, squeezing tight.</p><p>Now that he was with her, alive, what little energy she possessed drained away completely. Weakness consumed her, overshadowing all else. Even the Harpy was eerily silent.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Sabin said, concern drenching his tone. \u201cGwen, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She tried to respond, but no words would form. No sound would push past the sudden lump in her throat. She didn\u2019t know what to say, anyway. She was still furious with him, still wanted to hurt him for what he\u2019d done to her, still wanted to cry for the way he\u2019d doubted her.</p><p>\u201cGwen! Stay with me, darling. Okay? Just stay with me.\u201d</p><p>William must have hit another body because Gwen bounced back and forth again. Or maybe Sabin was shaking her. There were two white-hot bands wrapped around her forearms.</p><p>\u201cStay with me! That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d just saved his life, and he thought to order her around? \u201cGo to...hell...\u201d she managed, then darkness claimed her and she knew nothing more.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>SABIN PRESSED HIS WRIST into Gwen\u2019s mouth, her teeth sinking deep into his vein. The feel of those soft lips...that hot suction...He was so hard his cock could be considered a dangerous weapon. This was Gwen\u2019s second feeding, and she was healing nicely. She had flat-out refused to take his neck, even though she would have received a better flow of blood and thereby healed much faster. Worse, she refused to talk to him.</p><p>So he talked for both of them. He told her the kids she\u2019d captured were still contained, but comfortable and safe. He told her that her sisters had escaped the dungeon about an hour ago and had once again taken up residence in the chamber beside his. Despite the anger they had to feel, they\u2019d been strangely quiet.So had Doubt, for that matter.</p><p>He\u2019d known the demon feared the Harpies. He\u2019d known the little shit retreated deep inside his mind every time Gwen became riled. But now the fiend remained silent even if she wasn\u2019t. Striking distance was all that was required now. Almost seemed as if Doubt, well, doubted itself and its ability to take her in a battle of wills. Poetic justice, if you asked Sabin.</p><p>The demon turned on Sabin every time he ventured away from Gwen, of course, and still sought other victims constantly. But not Gwen, not any longer, and it never dared say anything about Gwen. After the way she\u2019d ripped through those Hunters...The demon had also stopped trying to convince Sabin that he couldn\u2019t have her, too afraid to piss Gwen off.</p><p>A little anger from her wouldn\u2019t have been a bad thing, though. Anything was preferable to the silent treatment.</p><p>Sabin sighed. So badly he wanted to hop a plane and search for the missing warriors. But first, he had to recover from yesterday\u2019s battle. He and the others were no good to anyone right now. What\u2019s more, he knew he couldn\u2019t divide their forces more than they already were. Hunters were still in Buda, and those Hunters had to be dealt with before the fortress fell or the women were injured.</p><p>This morning Torin had pegged one of the new captured with a tracking dye and \u201caccidentally\u201d let him escape, following his every move from his computer and waiting for the bastard to lead the warriors to their hiding place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Waiting was difficult, though. He\u2019d tried to talk the Harpies into going to Chicago, had promised them a fortune, but they\u2019d shut their door in his face. He knew they didn\u2019t want money. They wanted him to send Gwen packing. That, however, he couldn\u2019t do.</p><p>He loved her. More than before, even.</p><p>More than his war, more than his hatred for the Hunters, he loved her. She was Galen\u2019s daughter\u2014so what. Sabin carried the demon of Doubt inside him, so like he really had room to judge. Gwen wouldn\u2019t aid her father. She wouldn\u2019t. Sabin knew that soul-deep. And yeah, he also knew that Gwen would be giving up a chance at a relationship with her dad to be with him, which was why he needed to prove to Gwen that he was now her family.</p> <p>She was number one in his life. He shouldn\u2019t have locked her away. He should have trusted her, should have allowed her to fight. Hell, he would have lost without her\u2014and he would rather lose than be without her ever again.</p><p>The pressure of her mouth eased, and then she was pulling away from him. He was seated on a recliner he\u2019d dragged to his bedroom\u2014more than taking from his neck, Gwen had refused to drink from him on the bed. She was seated across from him in the other recliner he\u2019d confiscated because she\u2019d also refused to sit on his lap.</p><p>Her lips were bright red and puffy, as though she\u2019d been kissed. \u201cThanks,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Thanks\u2014her first word since waking from her injuries this morning. He closed his eyes, smiling as her beautiful voice drifted through his head. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d she said dryly.</p> <p>Slowly his eyelids cracked open. She hadn\u2019t flounced to the bed as she had earlier but remained in the chair, her back ramrod straight, peering just over his shoulder, determination pulsing off her. Dread coursed through him. What, exactly, was she determined to do? Leave him still?</p><p>\u201cHow are Aeron and Paris?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Needed to work up to it, did she? \u201cHealing like the rest of us. Thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to William. I\u2019d pushed myself too far and wouldn\u2019t have been able\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you,\u201d he interjected. \u201cYou did more, fought harder, than anyone I\u2019ve ever seen. And you had no reason to do it and every reason not to. Yet still you saved us all. I\u2019ll never be able to thank you enough for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your thanks,\u201d she said, cheeks heating. Not in embarrassment, nor in desire. But...anger? Why would she be angry at his gratitude? She released a shuddering breath, which seemed to calm her. \u201cI\u2019m healed, my strength almost completely returned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means...I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Her voice cracked there at the end.</p><p>And there it was. He\u2019d suspected that was coming, but was still devastated by the words. You can\u2019t leave, he wanted to shout. You\u2019re mine. Now and always. But he, more than anyone, knew the consequences of trying to control such a fierce soldier. \u201cWhy?\u201d was all he managed to get out.</p><p>Jerkily she hooked a lock of hair behind her ear. \u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpell it out for me.\u201d</p><p>Finally her eyes slid to him. Fire sizzled in their depths. \u201cYou want to hear it? Fine. You used my weakness against me, my secrets. You hurt my sisters, forced me to hurt them and lock them away to save you. You didn\u2019t trust me and you almost died for it.\u201d She jumped to her feet, hands fisted. \u201cYou almost died!\u201d</p><p>Okay, the thought of his death upset her most. She\u2019d mentioned it twice. Hope flared inside him, and Sabin was out of his chair and tossing her on the bed before she had time to blink. As she bounced from the impact, he pinned her with his weight.</p><p>Rather than struggle against him, she glared up at him. \u201cI could snap your neck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Actually, this position left her vulnerable. Left her wings immobile, which drained her strength. Her weakness, the one he\u2019d used against her before. There\u2019d be no more of that. He flipped to his back, placing her atop him. \u201cI thought I was doing it for your own good. I didn\u2019t want you fighting. Didn\u2019t want you hurt. Didn\u2019t want you pitted against your own father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he repeated. \u201cTo be honest, I did it for me. I needed to know you were safe. That was stupid of me. Stupid and wrong. I won\u2019t be leaving you behind again. You\u2019re a better soldier than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>Her legs straddled his waist, placing the heat of her directly above his throbbing erection. He groaned, gripped her hips to keep her still.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t trust you anymore,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou can. You can trust me. You, more than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d She slapped him, hard enough to crack bone. His cheek exploded in pain, but he didn\u2019t make a sound, didn\u2019t retaliate or release her. Just slowly faced her, ready for anything else she wanted to dish. He deserved it. He\u2019d let her flay the skin from his body if it meant working this out between them. \u201cI question everything you say now, something I didn\u2019t do even when your demon was drifting through my head at every possible opportunity. More than that, I will never truly believe you trust me. After everything you\u2019ve done\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have weaknesses, too.\u201d The words left him in a desperate rush, quieting her. \u201cYou gave me your secrets. Now let me give you mine. To prove that I trust you, that I\u2019ll never leave you behind again.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her a chance to respond. \u201cWhile guarding the king of gods, I lost an eye. Zeus had to give me another. I can\u2019t see great distances like the other warriors.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, her shoulders relaxed a little. Her fingers curled in his shirt, bunching the material and lifting it from his stomach. His hope intensified. \u201cYou could be lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I can\u2019t lie. I pass out if I try. That\u2019s part of my curse\u2014and another weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t use my secrets against me. That was a lie, but you didn\u2019t pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it at the time.\u201d</p><p>She remained silent.</p><p>\u201cI hold two daggers while fighting because I have a tendency to grab my opponent if a hand is free. I\u2019ve lost fingers that way more times than I can count. If you can disarm me of a single blade, you can more easily defeat me.\u201d He\u2019d never told anyone these things. Even his men, though they\u2019d probably noticed over the years. Still, he was surprised by how easily\u2014and willingly\u2014he shared with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I think I noticed that.\u201d Her tone was softer, gentler. \u201cDuring practice.\u201d</p><p>Encouraged, he continued. \u201cEveryone is sensitive in some place, some way. It\u2019s a weakness, an Achilles heel. Mine is my left knee. The slightest pressure can send me to the ground. That\u2019s why I fight with my body half-turned.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, as if she were reliving their practice sessions in her mind, trying to judge the truth of his claim for herself. A few minutes ticked by in silence. Sabin concentrated on breathing deep and even, drawing her scent into his nose.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, though, there is one weakness that slays me more than any other. Right now, always, that\u2019s you.\u201d His voice dropped, husky, intent. \u201cIf you still want to leave, leave. But know that I\u2019ll be leaving with you. Try to lose me, and I\u2019ll just hunt you down. Where you go, I go. If you decide to stay and wish me to stop fighting, I\u2019ll never again fight the Hunters. You are more important. I\u2019d rather die than live without you, Gwendolyn.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head, disbelief warring with hope in her expression. \u201cMy father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Gwen.\u201d More than he\u2019d ever loved another. More than he loved even himself. And he loved himself a great deal\u2014most of the time. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d find myself grateful to Galen for anything, but I am. I could almost forgive him for every wrong he\u2019s committed because he brought you into the world.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, still hesitant to accept his claim. \u201cBut other women\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even tempt me. I am your consort. Not for any reason, even to win a battle, would I turn to someone else. Ever. I\u2019d rather lose the battle than lose you. You are it for me. The only one. Hurting you destroys me. I know that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to believe you. I do.\u201d Her gaze fell to his chest, to where her fingers rested. Those fingers relaxed their grip, even traced squiggly lines. \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me time. Let me prove it. Please. I don\u2019t deserve a second chance, but I\u2019m willing to beg for one. Anything you desire, anything you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I desire is you.\u201d Her eyes met his, pupils consuming the irises. \u201cYou\u2019re here, and you\u2019re alive, and that\u2019s all I can seem to make matter at the moment. Let me have you.\u201d She ripped his shirt in half and dove down, mouth suddenly sucking one of his nipples. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the future, but I know that I need you. Show me what you want me to believe. Show me you love me.\u201d</p><p>Sabin\u2019s hands tangled in her hair, and he rolled them over. Joy burst through him. Joy and shock, love and white-hot desire. She hadn\u2019t offered the everlasting declaration he\u2019d hoped for, but this would do. For now.</p><p>He tugged at her clothing, his own. Soon they were both naked, hot skin pressed against hot skin. He sucked in a breath at the bliss. She moaned, her nails spearing deep in his shoulders.</p><p>Sabin kissed his way to her chest, laved his tongue over each of her nipples, kneaded her breasts, and then continued his trail of kisses. His tongue swooped into her navel, and she quivered, writhing against him.</p><p>\u201cGrab the headboard,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeadboard. Hold it. Don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>She was blinking up at him in confusion, the scent of desire wafting from her. She was lost in the pleasure, drowning in it, but finally she obeyed. Her back arched, her breasts now high in the air, nipples hard as little pearls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDrape your legs over my shoulders,\u201d he rasped out, reaching up to roll one of those beautiful nipples between his fingers.</p><p>This time she obeyed without hesitation, gasping, trying to grind up against him. When he felt her heels digging into his lower back, he parted the damp folds guarding the new center of his world and bent his head for a taste.</p><p>Her flavor was intoxicating. Addicting. Rich and sweet, the perfection he remembered. He circled her clitoris, teasing it, while he sank two fingers inside her. Her cry echoed throughout the bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I resisted you, even for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I told you yet how beautiful you are? How much I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. On and on he tongued her, his fingers never ceasing their ministrations. Her head thrashed back and forth, strawberry curls flying in every direction, body writhing.</p> <p>\u201cMore,\u201d she chanted. \u201cMore, more, more.\u201d</p><p>When he brought a third finger into play, she immediately began spasming, holding him inside, muscles locking tight. He sucked her clit harder...longer...drawing out her climax.</p><p>Only when she screamed his name, only when she collapsed against the mattress limply, did he release her. He crawled up her body, cock begging to penetrate her tight little sheath. But he didn\u2019t. Not yet.</p><p>Her eyelids blinked open. Luminous amber irises peered up at him, white teeth nibbling at her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, ever again,\u201d he vowed, and then flipped her to her stomach. \u201cLet me prove it.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, instantly reared back to knock his weight off her, but he reached down and flattened his chest to her back, stopping the frantic flutter of her wings. She stilled. Don\u2019t panic on me, darling. Next he flattened his hands over hers, meshing his cock between her lower cheeks, his legs outside hers. He was panting, warm breath trekking wildly over her shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cI owe these precious wings a proper apology,\u201d he said, lifting his weight. \u201cWill you allow me to touch them?\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, she didn\u2019t try to buck him off again. She did stop breathing, though. He heard the hitch of it in her throat. Unable to speak, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cMake them stop,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Gradually, the wings calmed.</p><p>Inch by inch, he covered each delicate wing with a kiss. They were soft, like silk, and cool to the touch, the perfect contrast to his heat. There wasn\u2019t a single hint of feathers, which surprised him. They were nearly translucent, blue veins intertwining from top to bottom, flowing like crystal rivers.</p><p>Just then he hated himself for what he\u2019d done to her. How could he have bound these beautiful wings, even for a moment?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cSo sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. No excuse is good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I forgive you.\u201d The words were husky, wine-rich. \u201cI do understand why you did it. I don\u2019t like that you did it, but I do understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, I swear it. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed you inside me. Now.\u201d Frantically she moved her backside against him, seeking the head of his shaft. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me desperate. I need more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes.\u201d Wait. Slow down. \u201cFertile yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Speed back up. Sabin gripped her hips and slammed all the way to the hilt. They cried out in unison. So good. Felt so good. Better than before, hotter, wetter. More fulfilling. They were connected, one being, fused together. She belonged to him, and he to her.</p><p>Bending down, he pressed his stomach to her back, reached around and thrummed her clit with one hand and kneaded her breasts with the other, attacking every possible pleasure-point. She lifted her body, grabbing the headboard again and sinking deeper onto his cock.</p><p>Shit, he wasn\u2019t going to last much longer. He was at the edge, had been at the edge for days already. But over and over he hammered inside her, slipping, sliding, no longer Sabin, only Gwen\u2019s man.</p><p>A scream suddenly reverberated through the room, and she was once again locking down on him, milking him. Just like that, Sabin hurtled over, pleasure consuming him, washing him in great waves of sensation.</p><p>They stayed like that forever, still joined, before collapsing against the mattress. Sabin quickly rolled to her side, not wanting to smash her with his weight. Well, not wanting to smash her again.</p><p>Unable to release her, even for a second, he pulled her into his side and she eagerly snuggled against him. This, he decided, must be what heaven was like.</p><p>\u201cTwice now you\u2019ve asked me if I was fertile, which leads me to believe you can have children,\u201d she said between breaths, the husky announcement breaking the silence. \u201cEven Ashlyn is pregnant, though I assumed she had gotten that way before she arrived here. Oh, wait. Galen helped make me, so you guys can reproduce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and yes, Ashlyn\u2019s child is Maddox\u2019s. The conditions for conceiving have to be just right, but we can indeed father kids. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read the stories of the gods impregnating humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you guys weren\u2019t born in the traditional way,\u201d she countered. \u201cYou were created by Zeus himself. I would think you\u2019d be...lacking in...you know...baby serum.\u201d</p><p>Baby serum? He had to cut back a laugh. \u201cWe have a lot more hormones, white blood cells and other necessary components than humans. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re able to heal so quickly. Most females\u2019 bodies cannot handle that potent a...serum, so they begin fighting and killing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I could handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you could handle anything.\u201d</p><p>Gradually she relaxed against him. Might even have smiled. \u201cDo you ever want to have kids?\u201d</p><p>He never had before. His life had been too turbulent. But he liked the thought of creating a baby with Gwen. A baby just like her, increasing this new blessing in his life. \u201cYeah. Someday, just not yet. Not until it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Her expression was pensive. \u201cSafe.\u201d She sighed and changed the subject. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop fighting Hunters, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Though he\u2019d use his dying breath to convince her to stay. And he hadn\u2019t lied. He\u2019d follow her. Wherever she went, he\u2019d follow. Getting rid of him was going to be a bitch of a problem. \u201cBut don\u2019t expect me to watch you walk away and do nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to worry about that just yet. First, I\u2019m going to help you find your friends. Can you trust me to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I could discover you hugging Galen and I wouldn\u2019t doubt you.\u201d He said it with confidence. Meant it. Gwen was the one thing in his life that he would never have to doubt.</p><p>A laugh bubbled from her. \u201cThat I would have to see to believe.\u201d She traced her fingertips along his chest. \u201cI need to talk to my sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d He captured them and brought them to his lips.</p><p>Another sigh. \u201cI half expected them to leave. But deep down I knew they\u2019d stay just to punish me for what I did to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>She twined their hands and gave a gentle squeeze. \u201cHow are Danika and Ashlyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrateful to you, worried about the missing men.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Gwen sat up, hair tumbling gloriously down her back. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower, clear my head. Will you call a meeting with everyone here in, say...an hour?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask why she wished to have the meeting, he simply trusted her, as he\u2019d said he would. \u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>GIDEON WAS SLOWLY GOING INSANE. He\u2019d lost track of time and didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d been trapped. A day? Two? A year? There wasn\u2019t a sliver of light to cling to, nothing to remind himself that there was a world out there\u2014a world he would soon return to by fair means or foul.</p><p>First, he needed a little peace and quiet to think up an escape plan.His demon, usually just a presence in the back of his mind, had yet to stop screaming inside his head. \u201cIn, in, in,\u201d it cried, meaning, \u201cOut, out, out.\u201d \u201cNeed dark, need dark,\u201d it sobbed, meaning, \u201cNeed light, need light.\u201d Lies thought it was locked inside Pandora\u2019s box once more, unable to escape, forgotten, abandoned.</p><p>Apparently, the other demons thought the same. Lucien moaned frequently, though Anya was always there to soothe him. Reyes was surprisingly calm. He\u2019d mutter Danika\u2019s name, then wouldn\u2019t speak again for hours. Amun growled and snarled low in his throat, as though he were fighting a horde of demons Gideon couldn\u2019t even imagine. The secrets that must be playing through his head...</p><p>Strider, who had been outsmarted and therefore had lost a mind game, constantly banged his head against the wall, his demon probably screeching, his body definitely agonized. Gideon had seen the warrior lose only once, hundreds of years ago, but the consequences of that loss were imprinted in his memory. Never had he seen a grown man writhe with such force, tears streaming down his ashen face, eyes flashing anguish rather than the usual pride, teeth grinding so vigorously blood poured from them.</p><p>Concentrate, dummy. Many times the entire group had tried prying the window shutters open or hacking through the brick walls. Anya, the only one who still had use of her abilities, muted though they were, had blasted tornados through the chamber, but she\u2019d only hurt the men, not the building. Everything had been fortified and then refortified\u2014with spells?\u2014until their prison was seemingly unbreachable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to look for a way out again,\u201d Anya said. She was the calmest of the group\u2014an ironic twist, since she thrived on chaos. There was a rustle of clothing, a moan from Lucien, a coo from Anya, and then the shuffle of footsteps.</p><p>Gideon had always been reluctant to commit to a woman, preferring variety. Right now that seemed stupid. He had no one to think about, wish for, or dream of. No one to keep him focused, as Reyes had. No one to comfort him, as Lucien had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What female would have you long-term?</p><p>What, he was possessed by Doubt now?</p><p>Thump.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Anya muttered. \u201cWho\u2019d I hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need\u2014\u201d Strider\u2019s breath sawed in and out, shallow and raspy, pained. \u201cHelp. Help me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Anya promised, then cooed at him for a few minutes. More footsteps.</p><p>Bang. Scrape.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well. What do we have here?\u201d a voice boomed from what Gideon assumed were hidden speakers. And it didn\u2019t belong to anyone he knew. \u201cIs it my birthday?\u201d</p> <p>The room grew eerily quiet, until Anya beat a hasty path back to Lucien, her heels clacking against the tiled floor.</p><p>Lights flickered on, chasing away the shadows. In that moment, sweet peace claimed Gideon. He blinked against the spots clouding his vision, seeing his friends for the first time in forever. Lucien was splayed across the floor, his head resting in Anya\u2019s lap as the goddess clutched him protectively. Reyes was slumped against the wall, grinning eerily. Strider was on his side, clutching his stomach, knees drawn to his chest, and Amun was beside him, petting his head, his own features glazed.</p><p>No sign of Hunters, though. The windows were still blocked, the door still closed.</p><p>\u201cI wondered who had tripped my silent alarm. Had to take care of your friends in Buda before I could return here, though.\u201d Cruel laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hoping you\u2019d come here, ever since that article was published. I see our denial of this facility\u2019s existence had the desired effect and convinced you there was no way this could be a trap.\u201d</p><p>With the sudden quiet in his mind, Gideon was able to sift that voice through his mental files, and hello. It belonged to someone he knew, after all. Dean Stefano. Second in command of the Hunters, answerable only to that sick fuck, Galen. Stefano hated Sabin for stealing Darla, his wife; said Darla would still be alive if the Lords and the evil they housed were in hell where they belonged.</p><p>Stefano\u2019s evil knew no bounds. He\u2019d sent Danika, an innocent, to spy on them, planning to use her to capture\u2014and torture\u2014the Lords one by one. Not that his plan had worked. But he\u2019d sent her in, and then tried to bomb the fortress with her in it.</p> <p>Dread tightened Gideon\u2019s stomach, followed quickly by rage and sorrow as Stefano\u2019s words took root and spread. Had to take care of your friends. Understanding dawned. Hunters had been to Budapest. They\u2019d fought\u2014and they\u2019d won, or they wouldn\u2019t be here now. Sabin would never have let them escape.</p><p>Where was Sabin now? Until the box was found, Hunters wouldn\u2019t kill the Lords, believing their demons would escape and cause more trouble. Had they imprisoned him? Tortured him? Pushing to his feet proved difficult, but Gideon did it. Swayed, but managed to stay upright. All but Strider did the same, extending their weapons, ready to do what was necessary despite their infirmities.</p><p>\u201cCome in here.\u201d Reyes waved his fingers in challenge. \u201cI dare you.\u201d</p><p>Stefano gave another laugh, this one genuinely amused. \u201cWhy should I? I can starve you, watch you waste away. I can poison your air, watch you suffer. And I can do all of those things without ever touching your filthy bodies.\u201d There at the end, his voice had hardened, eagerness dripping from the sharp edges.</p><p>\u201cLet the woman go,\u201d Lucien called. \u201cShe\u2019s done nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Anya shook her head, pale hair flying in every direction. \u201cI stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d Stefano said mockingly. \u201cShe wants to stay with her demon. Well, I think I\u2019ll remove her. Just for you, Death. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll like what I do to her, though.\u201d</p><p>Snarling, Lucien crouched, preparing to engage. His semiautomatic was raised, aimed. Ready. He looked brutal and savage, every inch Death. \u201cTry.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s when a boy, around eleven years old, walked through the far wall as though he were a ghost. Gideon\u2019s eyes widened, his mind replaying the scene in hopes of processing the extraordinary event.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d the boy said to Anya. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeat trick.\u201d She slowly spun, arms spread. \u201cYou sent a child into the lion\u2019s den. Cowardly, don\u2019t you think? And do you really think your little pet can force me to do something I don\u2019t want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d the boy responded in all seriousness. \u201cBut there\u2019s no need to engage in violence.\u201d</p><p>Lucien shoved Anya behind him, his eyes glowing red, his teeth sharp and bared. Seeing the usually stoic warrior worked into such a frenzy was almost painful. The man loved his woman and would die for her. Would rather die, actually, than to see her hurt.</p><p>Stealthily Gideon moved beside Death, unsure of what to do but knowing he couldn\u2019t passively watch. But really, who reeked of evil here? The men in the cage or the men who had sent a child into the midst of war?</p><p>Reyes, Strider and Amun flanked Gideon\u2019s other side, forming a protective wall around Anya.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d the boy said again, frowning now. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he wonderful?\u201d Stefano asked with a laugh. \u201cI do hope you like him, my newest weapon against you. I didn\u2019t plan to use him for a while yet. Then you had to venture into Egypt and steal my incubators. Incubators I will find and use again. Especially the one our friend Sabin so favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo glad to hear from you, Stefano,\u201d Gideon said, ignoring the taunts. \u201cThis is wondrous\u2014\u201d sick \u201c\u2014even for you.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then, \u201cAhh, Lies. A delight, as always. How tedious your demon must be. But I have good news for you. We\u2019ve found a way to draw the demons from your bodies and place them inside someone else. Someone weaker, someone who will accept their imprisonment for the good of mankind. Which is what we\u2019ve already done to Sabin. After we defeated him, of course. He put up quite a fight, Sabin did, but in the end he fell. Just. Like. You.\u201d</p><p>Hell, no. Sabin wasn\u2019t dead. Sabin couldn\u2019t be dead. He was too virile, too determined. More than that, sucking out their demons and placing them in another body wasn\u2019t possible. It couldn\u2019t be possible.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d Stefano laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. You will when it happens to you. Besides, why do you think your friend isn\u2019t here, saving you?\u201d</p><p>A fear Gideon had entertained himself. Don\u2019t let Stefano get to you. He\u2019s lying. Later you can\u2014</p><p>Gideon slammed a fist into the wall at his right. Dust plumed around him. He hit it again and again, tears burning his eyes. He hit it so many times his bones cracked and his muscles tore. He\u2019d spent thousands of years with Sabin, had thought to spend a thousand more.</p><p>\u201cPoor Lies.\u201d Stefano tsked under his tongue. \u201cWithout a leader. Whatever will you do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Gideon screamed. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you. Fucking kill you.\u201d And he meant it with everything inside of him, it was the truth, something he planned to do, wanted to do, would do. \u201cYou will die by my hand, motherfucker!\u201d</p><p>As the heated words echoed around him, his demon gave a shocked cry\u2014then a pained one. The pain shoved its way into Gideon, tearing him apart cell by cell. Felt like every one of his organs were splintering, his bones popping from their joints. Lies was clawing at his skull, falling to his feet, grasping for an anchor, biting at his toes as the pain drove it to madness. Still that wasn\u2019t enough. The demon swept through the rest of him, screaming, tearing his veins, leaving only acid behind.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s knees gave out, and he collapsed to the floor. The dagger he\u2019d held in his good hand skidded out of reach. He\u2019d known better. Allowing his emotions to overtake him was always his downfall. That\u2019s why he\u2019d learned to hide everything he felt behind sarcasm. Idiot! Stefano\u2019s defeated you now. Your enemy has the advantage. He can walk in here, grab you up, beat you, cut off your limbs, and there\u2019s not a fucking thing you can do about it.</p><p>\u201cHate...you...\u201d he gritted out. Hell, he\u2019d already told the truth once. Why not do it again? Say what he\u2019d longed to say for so long. \u201cHate you to the depths of my soul.\u201d</p><p>Again, the demon screamed. Screamed and screamed and screamed. Again the pain ripped through him, tore him apart.</p><p>He opened his mouth to reveal another truth.</p><p>\u201cLy-ing,\u201d Amun said haltingly. \u201cHe\u2019s...lying...Sabin...alive.\u201d</p><p>They were the first words the keeper of Secrets had spoken in centuries. His voice was raw, as though his voice box had been wiped with sandpaper and run through a shredder, each word like rubbing salt in a wound.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Stefano blustered. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there. He\u2019s dead, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Gideon stilled. Despite the agony, the torment of his current condition, he stilled. Stefano had lied to him. Fucking lied to him, and he\u2019d believed it. Gideon, who could sniff out a lie from a thousand feet away. He\u2019d uttered so many over his lifetime, identifying them was as natural as breathing.</p><p>Amun roared and fell to his knees beside Gideon. The floodgates had been opened, it seemed, for one word, then one sentence, then one story after another rushed from the warrior, all told in the different voices of their creators. He spoke of murder, rape and abuse of every kind. He spoke of jealousy, greed and infidelity. Incest, suicide and depression.</p><p>None of the crimes were his own, but they might as well have been. They belonged to the people he\u2019d encountered over the years, the Hunters he had drained of memory, and they were as clear to him as if he had lived them himself.</p><p>Eyes squeezed shut tightly, Amun rubbed his temples, writhing, grimacing, the spew of poison never slowing. \u201cHe didn\u2019t love me anymore, even though I did everything for him.\u201d His voice was high, like a woman\u2019s. Gideon thought he heard a gasp over the speakers, but couldn\u2019t be sure. \u201cCooked and cleaned and slept with him even when I was too tired. All he cared about was his precious war. Though he still found time to screw our whore of a neighbor, over and over again. He treated me like I was garbage!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow are you projecting that voice? That\u2019s Darla\u2019s voice. How, damn you?\u201d Stefano barked. There was no answer, only more of Darla\u2019s secrets. Gideon had no idea how the warrior had learned them. \u201cShut him up. Shut him up right now!\u201d</p><p>The little boy jumped, startled, before rushing forward. When Lucien and Reyes grabbed at him, their arms misted through him, and both warriors screamed in agony, the sounds of their pain blending with Gideon\u2019s, with Amun\u2019s. Then both men dropped like weights in an ocean, their bodies twitching as if they\u2019d just received the shock of a lifetime. Anya crouched behind them, ready to spring forward if the boy tried to touch them again.</p><p>Can\u2019t let the kid hurt Amun like that, Gideon thought, forcing himself to stand. He was unsteady, dizzy, hurting so badly there were tears in his eyes. He had to hunch over and grip his stomach to keep from vomiting. With his free hand, he grabbed his dagger and held it out in warning. But really, how was he going to stop someone he couldn\u2019t grab?</p> <p>Anya stretched one arm toward the boy, who now crouched beside Amun, about to reach inside his throat. And do what? She stopped herself just before contact.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch him,\u201d she shouted. Tiny golden flames branched from her fingers, but they were muted, mere outlines. \u201cI have power in this realm and the other. Touch him, and you\u2019ll burn. Trust me. I won\u2019t hesitate. I\u2019ve done worse.\u201d</p><p>Puppy dog brown eyes implored her to understand, to allow him to act as he\u2019d been commanded. Poor kid. His arm was shaking and remorse pulsed from him in powerful waves.</p><p>\u201cThere are two liars in the room, I see,\u201d Stefano said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what powers you have. That boy is the son of a necromancer, able to live and walk among the dead. He can enter each world at will and nothing and no one can touch him while he\u2019s in the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sleep with a necromancer, you idiot. Lucien can walk among the dead himself.\u201d Anya raised her chin, blue eyes tearing and flashing at the same time. \u201cPlus, I\u2019m Anarchy and I have no mercy. Your pet comes any closer and you\u2019ll get to see me in action.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing her as he did, Gideon knew when she was faking. The woman was operating on pure bravado. She would never be able to harm a child. At home, she constantly rubbed Ashlyn\u2019s belly and cooed to the baby. Auntie Anya is gonna teach you to steal everything your little heart desires, she was fond of saying.</p><p>Gideon reached out, unsteady, vision glazed, and circled his fingers around her hand. \u201cI would find no joy in taking care of this,\u201d he managed to squeeze past the lump in his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014yes.\u201d Slowly the flames died, and Anya nodded. There was relief in her eyes. She bent and grabbed Lucien by the shoulders, dragging him away from the boy. Amun was still babbling, Stefano still demanding the kid somehow shut him up.</p><p>As he wobbled on his feet, Gideon met the boy\u2019s grim, determined stare. \u201cI won\u2019t make the warrior be quiet.\u201d</p><p>Though he spoke a lie, the boy seemed to understand what he meant and nodded. Fighting the weakness and pain beating through him, Gideon leaned down, placing his lips at Amun\u2019s ear. And for the first time in centuries, he was able to offer reassurance without having to resort to the truth. \u201cYou\u2019re all right. This is going to be fine. We\u2019re all going to get out of this alive. Shh, shh now. Everything\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>Gradually the boom of Amun\u2019s voice faded until he was merely muttering under his breath. He still clutched his head, his eyes closed, his body curled into a fetal ball. Back and forth he rocked.</p> <p>An arm wrapped around Gideon\u2019s waist, and he turned. The swift action caused his stomach to roll and his vision to momentarily blacken before he saw who\u2019d touched him. Anya. How much longer could he stay upright? How much longer could he act as though he was racer ready?</p><p>Her strawberry scent wafted to his nose as she tugged him upright, and he nearly toppled. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking. I\u2019ll willingly go with the brat,\u201d she said quietly. To keep Lucien from overhearing?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gideon said, even as he shook his head no. He experienced another stomach cramp, spots once again winking in his line of sight.</p><p>She cupped his face, drew him to her as if she meant to kiss him, did kiss him lightly, then moved her lips to his ear, purring, \u201cOut of this room, my strength might fully return. I could finally take Stefano out.\u201d</p><p>If Lucien awoke and discovered Anya missing...No, Gideon couldn\u2019t allow his friend to suffer that kind of agony.</p><p>When it came to Lucien, Gideon hadn\u2019t quite shaken his guilt. From the onset of their possession, Lucien had been like a brother to him, taking him under his wing, talking Gideon down when he became too wild. Yet when the time had come to choose between Lucien and Sabin, Gideon had chosen Sabin because he\u2019d believed, with all his heart, that the Hunters deserved to die for what they\u2019d done to Baden, keeper of Distrust. Yet Lucien had desired peace. Gideon still believed that, but he also knew Lucien had deserved better from him.</p><p>\u201cTime for you to leave your man,\u201d Stefano announced. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, after I\u2019m done with you I\u2019ll let you return and tell him all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d the boy said, standing. He motioned Anya over with a wave of his hand. \u201cI will force you if I must.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon had to stop her. But how? His strength was still draining, replaced by more and more pain. Soon he would be completely incapacitated, unable to rise on his own for hours, perhaps days.</p><p>Too, the others couldn\u2019t take much more. Would Stefano send in the troops, subduing the warriors by sheer force and separating them? Or did he have to leave the warriors in here to prevent their powers from returning, as Anya suspected? Didn\u2019t matter, he supposed. There was only one way to buy time and figure out how to escape.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to take me instead. Don\u2019t want you to question me,\u201d Gideon said. \u201cStefano, tell the boy to take Anya and leave me.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause as his lie was interpreted.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anya gasped. Then, as if the denial wasn\u2019t enough for her, she grabbed Gideon\u2019s arms and shoved him to the ground. One kick, two, right in his stomach. Unable to stop himself, he vomited, over and over again, until there was nothing left. \u201cSee? He\u2019s in no condition to talk. You\u2019ll take me,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cor no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring them both,\u201d Stefano said, glee in his tone, as if that\u2019s what he\u2019d wanted all along.</p><p>After a slight hesitation, the boy stepped into Anya\u2019s body, disappearing from view. Maybe he had possessed her, because she walked from the room without complaint. Holy shit.</p><p>When the boy returned a short while later, Gideon held up his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t want to do it on my own.\u201d</p><p>That earned him a relieved nod.</p><p>Gideon lumbered to his feet and, with a last backward glance, abandoned his friends.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>GWEN WAS SURPRISED to see her sisters in the media room\u2014grrr, the entertainment room, but same thing, really\u2014when she stepped inside. She was equally surprised that they didn\u2019t spring from the couch and stab her.</p><p>Her gaze shifted to take in the rest of the attendees. Who would support her, and who wouldn\u2019t? Ashlyn, Danika and Cameo were seated at the far table, two heads bent over scrolls, the yellow paper crackling, while one typed on a laptop. Ashlyn\u2019s pretty face was scrunched in concentration. Danika was pale and sickly-looking. Cameo was scowling.William, Kane and Maddox were missing, and she suspected they were in town, searching for any lingering Hunters. Across from the women, Aeron and Paris were playing pool while talking strategy, their bruises mostly faded. Well, Paris\u2019s were mostly faded. It was hard to tell with Aeron, since his entire body was covered in tattoos.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I saw her,\u201d Paris said.</p><p>\u201cWishful thinking or ambrosia-induced hallucinations,\u201d Aeron replied. \u201cWhen we fell, you were conscious. Did you see her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She probably hid.\u201d</p><p>Aeron was merciless. \u201cI\u2019ve been gentle with you to this point, Paris, and that seems to have done no good. You have to let go of your grief. This morning we interrogated a few of the newest Hunters. They knew nothing about her. Afterward you summoned Cronus, asked him if she\u2019d been sent back. And what did he say?\u201d</p><p>Paling, Paris slammed his cue into one of the balls. \u201cWithout a body, her soul withered. Died.\u201d</p><p>A tiny, scaled...thing was sliding around Aeron\u2019s shoulders, stopping to pet the top of his head and kiss his cheek. Aeron reached up and gently scratched the fiend\u2019s neck as though it was a treasured pet, as though touching it was natural, welcome. Not once did he falter in his conversation. \u201cWould the god king lie to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? He wants our help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Paris snarled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d Gwen asked, gaze still riveted on the creature winding itself around Aeron.</p><p>Sabin, who stood beside her in the doorway, burning her exposed skin with his presence, tempting her to forgive and forget and focus on the future, a future with him, smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s Legion. She\u2019s a demon\u2014and a friend. Aeron would rather die than see her hurt, so please don\u2019t try and take her out.\u201d</p><p>That...thing was a girl? Doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ve got things to do. Gwen\u2019s eyes were wide as she finished her study of the chamber\u2019s occupants. Torin leaned a shoulder against the wall, as far away from everyone as he could get. He clutched a handheld monitor in his gloved hands, his attention riveted on the small screen.</p><p>He\u2019d support her, she knew it. One thing she\u2019d noticed about him, he placed his friends above his own welfare.</p><p>\u201cGonna pretend we\u2019re not here?\u201d Kaia stretched her arms over her head, preening like a kitten without a care.</p><p>Yes. No. \u201cHey.\u201d Finally meeting her sisters\u2019 gazes, she offered them a half smile and a wave. She\u2019d spent the last hour thinking about what to say to them\u2014if they were interested in listening to her. Nothing had come to her. An apology wouldn\u2019t work because she wasn\u2019t exactly sorry for what she\u2019d done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taliyah stood, expression as blank as usual. Bristling, Sabin stepped in front of Gwen.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Taliyah said, ignoring him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to say anything about what happened, I\u2019ll get us started.\u201d A pause, then, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d Gwen asked, her voice broken. That was so not what she\u2019d expected to hear. She peeked around her warrior\u2019s big bulk, her oldest sister once more coming into view. Taliyah was proud of her? Nothing could have surprised her more.</p> <p>\u201cYou did what you had to do.\u201d Taliyah closed the distance between them and tried to shove Sabin out of the way. \u201cYou were a Harpy in every sense of the word.\u201d</p><p>Sabin didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>The ice in Taliyah\u2019s eyes would have frozen anyone else. \u201cLet me hug my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gwen could see the stiff set of his shoulders, feel the tension in his back. \u201cSabin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, knowing what she wanted. \u201cThis could be a trick.\u201d Then, to Taliyah, he added, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Bianka and Kaia joined Taliyah, forming a half circle around the warrior. They could have attacked him, but somewhat to Gwen\u2019s surprise, they didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, let us hug our sister,\u201d Kaia said stiffly. That she didn\u2019t threaten to cause him bodily harm...a miracle. \u201cPlease.\u201d The last was offered grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sabin,\u201d Gwen said, flattening her palms against his shoulder blades.</p><p>He drew in a deep, shuddering breath, as if trying to sift through their scents for the truth. \u201cNo tricks. Or else.\u201d He pivoted out of the way and they immediately swept past him.</p><p>Three sets of arms wound around Gwen.</p> <p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m so unbelievably proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone so fierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColor me shocked. You totally kicked my ass!\u201d</p><p>Gwen was frozen, baffled to her core. \u201cYou\u2019re not angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Kaia said, then backtracked. \u201cWell, maybe at first. But this morning, when we were plotting ways to kidnap you and have our revenge on Sabin, we saw you feeding from him. Made us realize he is your family now, and we stepped over the line. You don\u2019t threaten a Harpy\u2019s family, ever, and we knew better.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Wow. Gwen\u2019s gaze skidded to Sabin, who was watching her with fire in his dark eyes. He wanted to be with her, he\u2019d said. He would give up the war for her. He wanted to put her first, make her the top priority in his life. He trusted her not to betray him. He loved her.</p><p>She wanted to believe him, so badly she wanted to believe him, but she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to. Not just because he\u2019d locked her up, but because, as she\u2019d lain in bed, recovering, she\u2019d realized that she was now a weapon, the weapon he\u2019d always wanted her to be. She\u2019d proven herself in battle. He wouldn\u2019t have to leave her behind anymore, wouldn\u2019t have to worry about her. How better to get what he wanted from her than to seduce her, body and soul?</p><p>Did he truly love her? That\u2019s what she wanted to know.</p> <p>He claimed he wouldn\u2019t care if he caught her embracing her father. Maybe that was the truth. But, if he loved her now, would he one day grow to resent her for who and what she was? Would his hatred of the Hunters and their leader extend to her? Would his friends turn on him for bringing an enemy into their house? Would her every word and action be suspect?</p><p>Those doubts weren\u2019t swimming inside her head because of his demon. They were hers. All hers. And she didn\u2019t know how to get rid of them, even though she desperately wanted to be with Sabin.</p><p>When she\u2019d seen him in town, bloody and lethal, her heart had truly stopped\u2014absolute proof it belonged to him. What a fierce picture he\u2019d presented. Any woman would be proud to have such a strong, competent man at her side. She\u2019d wanted to be that woman. Then and always. She lacked the confidence to grab on to the dream, though. Which was funny if you thought about it. Physically, she\u2019d never been stronger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna hate leaving you,\u201d Bianka said, releasing her, and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Now for the hard part. \u201cThen why try? I need you to stay here, at the fortress, and help Torin guard it and the humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where will you be going?\u201d Taliyah released her, too, pale eyes studying Gwen\u2019s face. At least they hadn\u2019t denied her request.</p><p>She squared her shoulders, determination rushing through her. \u201cThat\u2019s actually why I called this meeting. Could I have everyone\u2019s attention please?\u201d She clapped her hands, waiting for the room\u2019s other occupants to turn their gazes her way. \u201cSabin and I will be going to Chicago to find his missing friends. They\u2019ve gone silent, and we think something is wrong.\u201d</p><p>At that, Sabin blinked. That was his only reaction. She knew he was waiting for information from Torin, but she figured it was better to be en route while they waited than stuck here, ineffective.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re going,\u201d Ashlyn said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone told you, but Aeron, Cameo and, yeah, your sister Kaia, took me into town this morning. I heard some things.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. There was gonna be some trouble in the fortress. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone into town. Your man will be ticked if he finds out.\u201d She\u2019d seen Maddox with the pregnant woman only a few times, but once had been enough to assure her of his fierce need to protect.</p><p>Ashlyn waved a hand through the air. \u201cHe knew about it. He can\u2019t take me himself because I can\u2019t hear conversations when he\u2019s with me, so the compromise was to let me go with guards. He knew I\u2019d just sneak out later otherwise. Anyway, some of the Hunters were headed to Chicago, as well. They were afraid of you, unsure of what you could do to them.\u201d</p><p>Hunters, afraid of her. They\u2019d feared her while she\u2019d been trapped in that pyramid, but there had been nothing she could truly do to them. No longer was she helpless. The thought made her smile. Sabin, too, practically glowed with pride.</p><p>Her stomach quivered at the sight, and breath heated in her lungs. When he looked at her like that, she could almost believe he truly loved her and would do anything for her. Mind on the task at hand. \u201cWhat about the prisoners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill locked up.\u201d Facing her, Paris rested his cue on the floor and leaned against it. He was paler than usual, lines of stress around his eyes. \u201cAeron and I, multitaskers that we are, have taken over their...care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe helping,\u201d Legion the female demon piped up.</p><p>Care. Aka torture. Had Sabin interrogated them? She knew he liked to do so, yet he\u2019d barely left her side since that battle. \u201cThe children...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I mentioned earlier, they\u2019ve already been separated and moved to nicer quarters. They\u2019re scared and haven\u2019t used whatever powers they have. Yet. So we\u2019re unsure what we\u2019re dealing with. But we\u2019ll get it out of the adults, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Sabin said.</p><p>Paris nodded with grim determination. \u201cI\u2019ll do it when we get back. I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>Sabin and Aeron shared a heavy look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here,\u201d Sabin corrected. \u201cAll of you are. We need as many warriors here as we can get. We don\u2019t know how many Hunters remained behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than that, Torin saw Galen in town,\u201d Cameo said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet caught sight of him, which could mean he\u2019s hiding, planning to strike again.\u201d</p><p>Sabin approached Gwen\u2019s side and banded a strong arm around her waist. She didn\u2019t protest. Though her mind was unsure about him, her body knew she belonged with him. His lemon scent wafted to her nose, a drug she\u2019d become addicted to. \u201cBut you, Paris...your new favorite thing to do puts everyone at risk. You\u2019ll stay here and get yourself cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Paris opened his mouth to protest.</p><p>\u201cTorin can take care of our travel arrangements,\u201d Sabin continued, cutting him off. Up and down, he caressed her arm, perhaps not even aware of what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to fly commercial,\u201d Torin said, \u201csince the boys have the jet we always charter in the States with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we\u2019re spotted by Hunters? And how will we get our weapons past security?\u201d If they were caught with even one blade, they\u2019d be questioned\u2014a waste of time\u2014and arrested.</p><p>\u201cI have ways.\u201d Sabin kissed her temple. \u201cTrust me. I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. We won\u2019t be spotted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring Reyes and the others home safely.\u201d Danika\u2019s fingers twined, as if she were saying a prayer. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Ashlyn echoed.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget Anya,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cNo telling what kind of trouble she\u2019s stirred up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Gwen told them, and she meant it. But would her best be good enough?</p><p>\u201cTELL ME, what\u2019s a goddess doing with a demon?\u201d</p><p>Anya eyed her lover\u2019s sworn enemy: Galen, keeper of the demon of Hope. He occupied one side of her new prison, and she the other. His long white wings were tucked into his back, the top arches rising over his shoulders. His eyes were blue like the sky, and the more she looked into them, the more she would swear she saw fluffy white clouds. Those eyes were meant to lull, to relax.They only managed to piss her off.</p><p>Ghost Boy had \u201cescorted\u201d her\u2014damned kid had taken control of her body as if it were his own\u2014into this small, sparse hellhole and left her. Where she\u2019d waited. And waited. Alone, enraged. Now she knew the Hunters had left her for their leader\u2014who had remained in Buda until he\u2019d been told of the bounty here.</p><p>Meanwhile, though, Gideon\u2019s screams had echoed through the halls\u2014and with his screams, gleeful laughter from his captors. Poor Lies. She felt a little guilty for kicking him earlier. Had he spilled any secrets?</p><p>\u201cHave you no answer, beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having fun, that\u2019s what.\u201d They\u2019d made the mistake of leaving her unfettered. Although Ghost Boy had accompanied Galen, of course. Apparently, he was their insurance policy. Well, they\u2019d soon learn they should have picked a better policy. Without that strange metal walling her in, her strength was returning. Soon, she would be a living nightmare. And they would suffer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was Lucien recovering as she was? Anya hated being away from him.</p><p>Slowly Galen\u2019s lips curled with amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re feisty. I like that. Lucien is a lucky man. More than lucky. Such an ugly man capturing the heart of one such as you is nothing short of a miracle.\u201d</p><p>Even his voice was meant to calm. Actually, everything about him seemed purposely honed to offer hope, like a bright light in a room of darkness and fear. What he didn\u2019t know was that Anya preferred the darkness. Always had.</p> <p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t ugly,\u201d she said, pacing from one side of the back wall to the other. The more she stayed in motion, the less her actions would be watched, she suspected. \u201cHe\u2019s honorable and loving and wonderfully fierce.\u201d</p><p>A scoff. \u201cBut he\u2019s a demon.\u201d</p><p>She stopped to arch a brow at him. \u201cWell, yeah. And so the hell are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Patient, Galen shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m an angel, sent from the heavens to cleanse this earth of evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d She kicked back into motion. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one. Believing our own press, are we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue my origins with a demon whore.\u201d No longer did he sound amused or tolerant. \u201cNow, tell me what the Lords know of the two artifacts that remain missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says they\u2019re missing?\u201d she taunted.</p><p>There were several beats of silence. \u201cTrue. For all you know, I have one.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. Did he?</p><p>\u201cIf they had all four, they would not be here, at my mercy. They would be searching for the box. Or would have found it.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, though she trembled inside. \u201cSure you have any mercy, angel?\u201d</p> <p>His shoulders lifted in a shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re alive, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her heels clicked against the tile. \u201cBut then, I\u2019m sure you think you can use me in some way.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his massive chest, stretching the fabric of his white shirt. His pants were white, too. Overkill if you asked Anya, but whatever. She doubted he\u2019d want fashion advice from her. \u201cI\u2019m growing weary of you, goddess. Perhaps I should have Death brought in.\u201d</p><p>Meaning he\u2019d rather amuse himself with Lucien\u2019s torture? \u201cLook, I\u2019ll talk to you, tell you everything you want to know, but only if you get rid of the kid. He annoys me.\u201d She didn\u2019t want someone so young to be hurt by her hand.</p><p>\u201cI apologize if I gave you the impression that I\u2019m foolish.\u201d Galen\u2019s mouth curled into a half smile. \u201cHe stays.\u201d</p><p>It had been worth a shot. Time for Plan B. Distraction, then fury. If she couldn\u2019t fly at him, she would make him fly at her. The boy wouldn\u2019t interfere with his leader. \u201cWhy do you hate the Lords so much, anyway? What\u2019d they ever do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA better question is this: why shouldn\u2019t I hate them? They want to ruin me. Therefore, I will ruin them first.\u201d He splayed his arms, an it\u2019s-that-simple gesture. \u201cAll these years, we\u2019ve only been able to injure them, too afraid of releasing their demons. If that happened, the gods would curse me anew. I\u2019ve already been warned.\u201d He smiled faintly. \u201cBut we\u2019re close, so close to changing that. Any day now I\u2019ll know if the demon of Distrust was able to bond with my female. If so...I will lead the most powerful army this world has ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour spineless servant seemed to think you\u2019d use weaklings and lock them away for the good of this world.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cHowever would he get that idea?\u201d</p><p>Okay, thinking cap time. He\u2019d said he would be cursed somehow if he killed the Lords and freed their demons. But not, obviously, if he had somewhere to store those demons. Taking them from the Lords, though, would destroy the immortals. Destroy\u2014kill\u2014Lucien.</p><p>The bottom dropped out of her stomach, and her blood ran cold. \u201cHow did you find Distrust? How did you capture it, a crazed demon?\u201d Stefano had claimed they\u2019d already successfully bonded the demon with another body. Clearly, he\u2019d lied. Again. But the fact that they were trying to do so was just as frightening.</p><p>\u201cUnlike Amun, I\u2019m not one to spill all my secrets,\u201d Galen said.</p><p>\u201cWell, until you do, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another of those half smiles. \u201cI\u2019m devastated, of course.\u201d</p><p>Gods, I hate him! She tapped a nail against her chin, as if she were deep in thought. She\u2019d managed to distract him, and now she would piss him off. \u201cLet\u2019s see, let\u2019s see. If I were a cowardly, jealous demon pretending to be an angel and I wanted to find and control an evil spirit, I would...what? Have others do my dirty work, definitely. Maybe even use children,\u201d she said, gaze flicking past Ghost Boy. Her eyes widened as his narrowed. She\u2019d meant to enrage him with the taunt, but she\u2019d done more than that, she realized.</p><p>She\u2019d found the answer. Somehow, some way, one\u2014or more\u2014of those Halfling children were capable of finding an otherworldly spirit. Maybe even Ghost Boy himself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take them from you,\u201d she said, meeting Galen\u2019s eyes once more. \u201cPrevent you from using them ever again. We\u2019ve won every other battle with you. This will be no different. I mean, we even have a Harpy on our side now. Have you perchance heard of what a Harpy can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will shut your mouth,\u201d the \u201cangel\u201d growled at her.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten to him. Excellent. An emotional man was a man who made mistakes. \u201cAnd you know what\u2019s worse than a Harpy? Cronus, the new god king. He wants you dead. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Galen straightened. \u201cYou lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? The All-Seeing Eye\u2014the Eye you lost to us\u2014had a vision. In it, she saw you try and murder Cronus. Now he\u2019s after you. I don\u2019t know why he hasn\u2019t killed you himself. I\u2019m sure he has his reasons. But believe me, I\u2019ve been his target. He won\u2019t leave you alone until he has what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Galen\u2019s jaw hardened more with every word she spoke. \u201cI would never hurt a Titan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you? You betrayed your closest friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t my friends,\u201d he shouted, slamming a fist into the wall and rattling the foundation.</p><p>That\u2019s the way, big boy. \u201cToo bad they didn\u2019t realize that earlier. But no matter. They still managed to defeat you. Just as they\u2019ll defeat you every time you challenge them. It\u2019s science, after all. You\u2019re weaker.\u201d</p><p>Fury sizzled from him, snapping under his skin. \u201cYour precious Lucien wasn\u2019t strong enough to lead us, Zeus\u2019s elite army. He shouldn\u2019t have been placed in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo rather than challenge him like an honorable soldier, you convinced him to open Pandora\u2019s box, then told the gods of his decision to betray them? You formed an army of your own and tried to stop him. Nope, that\u2019s not cowardly at all.\u201d</p><p>He stalked two steps forward before catching himself and halting. His hands fisted. \u201cI did what I had to do. A good soldier wins by any means necessary. Just ask your friend Sabin.\u201d</p><p>Push harder. You almost had him. \u201cAh, but like I said, you didn\u2019t win, did you? Even though you knew what Lucien and the others were going to do, you weren\u2019t able to stop them and prove them weak. You lost. You were made to look weak. You got cursed to house a demon inside you just like the others. You, you, you.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHow humiliating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to hit me?\u201d Again, she laughed cruelly. \u201cDoes the sweet little angel want to cut out Anya\u2019s tongue? What would your followers think then, hmm? But I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve seen you do much worse. Or do you always have Stefano order that done, so you can appear merciful?\u201d</p><p>For a long moment, he watched her, silent, not lunging toward her as she\u2019d hoped. Then, to her surprise, he smiled. \u201cStefano\u2019s not here, and I\u2019m not feeling merciful. But don\u2019t worry. This will only hurt for a second.\u201d With that, he whipped a small crossbow from between his wings. Before she had time to duck, he fired two arrows, propelling her into the back wall. One cut through her left shoulder, the other her right, pinning her to the brick.</p><p>Pain exploded through her, her vision blurring. Blood cascaded down her arms, so hot it burned her. Sweat beaded on her brow and upper lip, but it didn\u2019t cool her down.</p><p>The boy, she noticed distantly, had paled. His lower lip was trembling.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for Lucien to join our little party,\u201d Galen said. \u201cHe\u2019ll watch everything we do to you. Strip you, take you, hurt you. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019s strong enough to save you, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch him,\u201d she managed to work through clenched teeth, \u201cand I\u2019ll eat your heart in front of you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and oh, how she despised the sound of his amusement. But his laughter was cut short as a boom erupted and the building actually shook.</p><p>\u201cLooks like the cavalry\u2019s here,\u201d Anya said, grinning despite the throbbing in her shoulders. \u201cI knew the others would come for us. I believe I mentioned the Harpy, yes?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, the first stirring of panic in his eyes, then turned his gaze to the door.</p><p>Another boom, another shake.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over. If she fights her way down, fine,\u201d he told the boy as he stomped to the exit, \u201cbut do not let her out of this room.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>THOUGH SABIN AND GWEN hadn\u2019t been spotted by any Hunters or frisked by security\u2014Doubt had earned its keep, making everyone around them doubt everything they saw\u2014the flight to the States had been hard, in every sense of the word. Gwen had snuggled up next to Sabin, hour after hour, and he hadn\u2019t been able to touch her the way he craved. And he wouldn\u2019t, not in front of witnesses and not until she trusted him. Winning her heart and her trust was the most important battle of his life, and for once he\u2019d decided not to rush it.</p><p>I will have her.When they\u2019d deplaned, Sabin, who was used to being around humans, having them stare at his height and muscled strength, hadn\u2019t liked the way males had stared at his woman. Their desire had been obvious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drove him freaking insane. Which was why he\u2019d allowed Doubt to swoop into those human minds and fill them with insecurities about their appearance, their prowess in bed\u2014and why he\u2019d been tempted to erupt into one of Maddox\u2019s famous violent fits. He\u2019d managed to control himself, keeping his eye on the prize: the safe return of his friends. But only because Gwen hadn\u2019t seemed to notice the gaping, the drooling mouths, and the stopping dead in their tracks.</p><p>They\u2019d immediately driven to the house the warriors had been staying at, a house miles from anything and everything. They\u2019d watched it for a bit, ascertaining two things: one, the warriors weren\u2019t there and two, Hunters hadn\u2019t been there and planted little presents. Too bad about the lack of Hunters, if you asked Sabin. He was ready for action.</p><p>He and Gwen had loaded themselves with weapons, each grabbed a ball cap to hide their hair and shield their faces, and headed to the only other place he knew his friends would have gone. Now they walked the street in front of a row of buildings, and he knew he was close to the training facility, but...he couldn\u2019t find it. Each building blended into the next. And each time he counted off, he lost track of their numbers.</p> <p>Gwen paused and rubbed the back of her neck, staring up into the sky. \u201cThis is hopeless. We\u2019re in the right place. Why can\u2019t we find it?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Maybe it was time to bring out the big guns. If the god king would respond to him for once. \u201cCronus,\u201d he muttered, \u201ca little help would be nice. You want us to succeed, right?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed, then another. Nothing happened.</p><p>He was just about to give up when suddenly Gwen gasped. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Sabin followed her gaze, experienced a jolt of shock. There, on the roof of the building to their right, a building Sabin had somehow overlooked time and time again, stood the god king. The building seemed to shake beneath him. His white robe whipped around his ankles. After being ignored for so long, Sabin was being aided? And so easily?</p> <p>\u201cNow you owe me, Doubt, and I always collect.\u201d Cronus disappeared a second later.</p><p>It would benefit Cronus for Sabin to win this day. The god should have been happy to aid the cause, not demanding favors in return.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Gwen asked. \u201cHow did he do that? And do you think my...Galen is in there?\u201d</p><p>Sabin explained about Cronus. \u201cGalen...I don\u2019t know. What if he is? Do you still want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No hesitation this time, though there\u2019d been an edge to her tone.</p><p>Was he asking too much of her? Sabin didn\u2019t have parents. The Greeks had created him already fully formed. As there was no love lost between him and the former gods, he couldn\u2019t even fathom a guess as to how Gwen was feeling.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she added, as if she read his thoughts. \u201cAfter everything he\u2019s done, he needs to be taken down.\u201d</p><p>There at the end, her voice had trembled. Sabin decided then and there to intervene if Galen opted to join the fray\u2014which wasn\u2019t likely to happen as the bastard always cut and run, leaving his lackeys to do his dirty work. Hope placed himself before others, and always had. But Sabin didn\u2019t want Gwen regretting anything; he didn\u2019t want her to later blame him for her actions\u2014or his own, he thought with a sinking stomach. He\u2019d wondered before but couldn\u2019t help doing so again: Would she hate him if he was the one to defeat and restrain her father?</p><p>Only two things mattered to Sabin right now: Gwen and his friends\u2019 safety. In that order. She came first, now and always. Nothing would change that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d she said softly, and trekked forward.</p><p>\u201cBefore we go in there,\u201d he said, keeping pace beside her, \u201cI want to tell you again that I love you. I love you so much I ache with it. I just...I wanted you to know in case anything happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d She stumbled, caught herself. \u201cBut I love you, too. I do. There\u2019s no denying that anymore. I\u2019m still not sure about you, though. I, just, I don\u2019t know. Doubt is like my pet now, and I like that. Really. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She loved him. Thank the gods, she loved him. He drew her to a halt and pulled her into his embrace, hating her words, but understanding nonetheless. He should have trusted her. From the beginning, he should have placed her first. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure all of that out later. I promise. I don\u2019t want any worries on your mind right now. Distractions can get you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled,\u201d she finished for him, smiling. \u201cI paid attention to your lessons.\u201d She tentatively wrapped her arms around his waist, resting her head in the hollow of his neck. Her hair was soft against his skin. \u201cYou be careful in there.\u201d</p> <p>Gods, he adored this woman. Her strength, her courage, her wit. \u201cYou, too. Whatever you do, save yourself. Understand me?\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cI\u2019d be lost without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She gave a half-amused, half-strained smile. \u201cThat\u2019s Harpy code, after all.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. She looked up at him then, her lips puffy and red and he couldn\u2019t resist. He meshed their mouths together, his tongue sweeping inside hers with a possessive thrust. Her hands lifted, tangling in his hair, and she moaned.</p><p>He swallowed the sound, savoring it, letting it fill him up. Here was his life, in his arms, all he needed. But he forced himself to pull away. \u201cCome on. I want to get this over with so that you and I can talk. Why don\u2019t you go through the front door, and I\u2019ll take the back. We\u2019ll scope out each entrance, meet in the middle.\u201d</p><p>With another swift kiss to her mouth, Sabin started forward again. The sun burned bright, glaring down at him. He kept his face down, hoping he wouldn\u2019t be recognized if cameras were scanning the area.</p><p>Can you do this?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>What if you fail?</p><p>I won\u2019t.</p><p>What if Gwen is hurt?</p><p>She won\u2019t be. He would make sure of it.</p><p>\u201cPick up the pace, slowpoke.\u201d A slight breeze caressed his face as Gwen jumped into hyperdrive and passed him, her wings giving her a speed he could never hope to match. That didn\u2019t stop him from trying, though. He didn\u2019t want her in that building alone. He quickened his steps and raced around back. There he found a fence with spikes that stretched toward the sky and electric wires that circled every slat.</p><p>Usually he took his time and disabled such wires. Today, he didn\u2019t have that luxury. He simply climbed. The shocks that worked through him would have killed a human. They were painful, stopped his heart twice, pushed the breath out of him continually, but he still didn\u2019t slow. Up, up, he shimmied, until he was falling to the ground. His boots thumped into concrete, rattling him, and he took off in a run, already going for his guns.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take him long to reach his first quarry. There were three Hunters seated at a round table, an umbrella shading them. Had they not felt the building shake? Their bad. Finally. The party could start.</p><p>\u201c\u2014pissed his pants,\u201d one laughed.</p><p>\u201cShould have seen his face when I shoved those spikes under his nails. And when I cut off his hands...\u201d More laughter. \u201cI hope he continues the silence. I\u2019ve never had so much fun in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons. They deserve this and more.\u201d</p><p>Sabin\u2019s heart sank even as his demon stirred. I want to play, Doubt said gleefully.</p><p>Have fun.</p><p>Needing no more encouragement, the demon swooped out of his mind and into theirs.</p><p>The other Lords are going to be angry. They\u2019ll come for you, make you pay. Everything you\u2019ve done to their brethren will be done to you\u2014magnified by a thousand, I\u2019m sure.</p><p>One of the men shuddered. \u201cWe know the other demons will come for their friends when they\u2019ve healed from that last battle. Maybe we should, I don\u2019t know, pack up soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a coward. I\u2019m staying here and doing whatever\u2019s necessary to pry information from our prisoners.\u201d</p><p>Then you\u2019ll be gutted like a fish, I bet.</p><p>Now the second speaker shuddered.</p><p>\u201cUh, guys. Save it. My beeper just vibrated. An alarm has been tripped. Either someone\u2019s escaped or we\u2019re under attack.\u201d</p><p>They jumped to their feet. None of them had spotted Sabin yet. Silencer on\u2014check. Chamber loaded\u2014check. At one time, he would have drawn their attention, taunted them about their coming death and taken joy as they paled. Now, he simply shot them one after the other in the back of the head. They slumped in their chairs, what was left of their foreheads hitting the glass tabletop with a thump.</p><p>He kept moving, rounding the corner. A group of children were splashing around in a pool. One of the boys had a hand extended, water rising and balancing above it.</p><p>\u201cThrow it at me,\u201d a little girl implored. \u201cSee if it can get through my shielding spell.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, the boy tossed the water at the girl. Not a single drop touched her.</p><p>Sabin had suspected they would be here, but was still shocked to see them. Despite their unusual abilities, they were just children. How could the Hunters use them like this? Place them in such danger?</p><p>Sabin replaced one of his semiautomatics with a tranq gun. He didn\u2019t want to do this, but it was the best\u2014and safest\u2014solution for everyone involved. What was Gwen doing? Was she inside? Hurt? Without pause, he began nailing the kids with darts. One by one, they sank into unconsciousness. He quickly dragged them out of the water and laid them in the shade, never once releasing his weapons.</p><p>Finally, he was ready to enter the house. To help Gwen.</p><p>\u201cYou filthy animal! What have you done?\u201d</p><p>Sabin whipped around. A Hunter had just taken aim at him, fired. A bullet slammed into his right shoulder. Wincing, he hammered out another round from his Sig. One bullet hit the Hunter\u2019s neck, the other his chest. He slumped over, gasping. When his skull cracked against the ground, the gasping stopped.</p><p>Bleeding, unconcerned by the pain, Sabin rushed inside the building, sheathing the tranq in favor of the second semiautomatic. Already Hunters littered the floor, motionless. Gwen. Sabin\u2019s heart swelled with pride. Maybe it was wrong of him, but he really loved her dark side. She was magic on a battlefield. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He followed the trail of adult bodies through the winding hallways. Some of the rooms were bedrooms with multiple bunk beds, some were classrooms. There were tiny desks and artwork on the walls; every single piece showed a demon being tortured. There were even signs. A perfect world is a world without demons. When the demons are gone, there will be no sickness, no death. No evil. Lost someone you love? You know who to blame.</p><p>Oh, yes. The children were being trained to hate the Lords from birth. Fabulous. Sabin had done some bad shit in his life, but never had he taught hatred to an innocent.</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d he heard Gwen shout, followed by a howl of pain.</p> <p>Increasing his speed, Sabin followed the sound, saw a man hunched over and grabbing his crotch. He didn\u2019t know what had happened and he didn\u2019t care to stop and ask. He simply aimed his Sig and fired three rounds. No one hurt Gwen.</p><p>Gwen whirled around, claws bared. Those tiny wings fluttered madly under her shirt. The death-glaze faded when she realized who stood before her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found your friends. They\u2019re hurt, but alive. I released them, but two are missing. Gideon and Anya.\u201d</p><p>First\u2014she\u2019d already found and released them? Holy hell. She was faster and better than even he had known. Second\u2014where the hell were the others? Locked up? \u201cAnya?\u201d he shouted. \u201cGideon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSabin? Sabin, is that you?\u201d a woman called from down the hall. Anya. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn time. I\u2019m back here. With a guard.\u201d</p><p>Sabin looked at Gwen just as three males flew into the room, their expressions wild. \u201cGot \u2019em?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d She faced the newest challenge. \u201cGet Anya.\u201d</p><p>He took off in a run. He would have left any of his men, and Gwen was a better fighter than all of them put together, so he had no doubt of her success. No doubt. The thought made him smile.</p><p>As he moved, he exchanged a gun for a blade. He was almost out of bullets. Thankfully, a knife never needed refilling. Where are you, Anya? He burst through one door\u2014empty. He shouldered his way through another, hinges splintering. Nothing. Three more rooms, and there she was, eyeing a little boy, both her shoulders stained crimson.</p><p>That boy turned to him, expression determined. There was something...off about him, as though he wasn\u2019t three-dimensional.</p> <p>\u201cSabin!\u201d When Anya darted to one side, the boy quickly followed, swiping out an arm.</p><p>\u201cI have to keep her here,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t sound happy about it.</p><p>Slowly Sabin sheathed his blade and reached behind him, curling his fingers around the handle of the tranq gun.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch him,\u201d Anya rushed out, \u201cand don\u2019t let him touch you. You\u2019ll go down without warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnya!\u201d</p><p>Sabin recognized the voice as Death\u2019s, so he didn\u2019t turn as footsteps approached. He kept his gaze on the boy, ready to jump at him despite Anya\u2019s warning if he went after the goddess again.</p><p>\u201cLucien! Stay back, baby, but tell me you\u2019re okay?\u201d Anya\u2019s face lit with a mixture of pleasure and worry. \u201cI have to know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. You? Oh, gods.\u201d Lucien came up behind him and sucked in a breath. Sabin could feel waves of fury pulsing off him. \u201cYour shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a little scratch.\u201d There was fire in the words, a promise of retribution.</p><p>Keeping his hand behind his back, Sabin held the tranq out to Lucien. \u201cNot sure it\u2019ll do any good, but I\u2019m going to leave you to it. Gideon\u2019s still missing.\u201d The warrior took the weapon without a word, and Sabin spun on his heel.</p><p>He continued bursting into rooms. Several were padded. One was filled with computers and other technology. One was stuffed with enough canned food to last a lifetime. Down another hall he turned, shouting Gideon\u2019s name. These rooms had thicker locks and fingerprint IDs. Heart pounding, Sabin pressed his ear to each door until he finally, blessedly heard a whimper.</p><p>Gideon.</p><p>Urgency flooding him, he pried at the slit in the center. His muscles strained, his bones nearly popped out of joint, his wound reopened, but he worked the edge until the metal opened enough to squeeze through. First thing he noticed was the broken and bleeding form strapped to a gurney. A sickening sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hit him.</p><p>He crossed the distance, bile rising in his throat. Gideon\u2019s eyelids were so swollen it looked as if rocks were buried underneath them. Bruises colored every inch of his naked body. Many of his bones were broken and protruding through skin.</p><p>Both of his hands had been chopped off.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll grow back, I swear to the gods they\u2019ll grow back,\u201d Sabin whispered as he pulled at the bonds. They were strong. Too strong, comprised of some sort of\u2014godly?\u2014metal. He couldn\u2019t even hack through them with a blade.</p><p>\u201cKey. Not there.\u201d Gideon\u2019s voice was so weak, Sabin barely heard it. But the warrior motioned to a cabinet with a tilt of his chin. Sure enough, a key dangled there. \u201cDidn\u2019t taunt me...with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave your strength, my friend.\u201d He spoke gently, but rage was pouring through him, consuming him, becoming the only thing he knew. Those bastards were going to pay for this. Every single one of them and a thousand times over. He needed to be punished as well, he thought. He\u2019d sworn never to let this kind of thing happen to his comrade again, yet here they were, practically reliving the past.</p><p>When Gideon was free, Sabin gently gathered him in his arms and carried him into the hall. Strider had been in the process of turning the corner, pale and trembling and stumbling. When the warrior spotted Sabin\u2019s bundle, he released a savage cry.</p><p>\u201cIs he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive.\u201d Barely.</p><p>\u201cThank the gods. Lucien\u2019s got Anya. He managed to tranq the kid guarding her. Reyes is somewhere in back. Stefano\u2019s called for retreat, but you\u2019ll never believe who\u2019s stuck around.\u201d</p><p>At the moment, Sabin didn\u2019t care. \u201cHave you seen Gwen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Down the hall and to the right.\u201d Strider gulped. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for you. I\u2019ll take Gideon. You go help your woman.\u201d</p><p>Dread instantly mixed with his rage as Sabin carefully handed Gideon over. \u201cDid something happen to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go.\u201d</p><p>He ran, arms pumping, legs shaking, until he reached the chamber where he\u2019d left her. She was still there, but she was no longer fighting human Hunters. She was fighting her father. And she was losing.</p><p>Guess who stuck around, Strider had said. Of all the times for the bastard to grow some balls. Gwen was winded, panting, bloody, stumbling every time she lashed out as though her legs could no longer hold her weight. Galen had a long snakelike whip. No, not snakelike. It was a snake. Hissing, teeth gleaming with venom. And every time Gwen managed to cut off the snake\u2019s head, another grew in its place.</p><p>\u201cThe big, strong Lords of the Underworld, relying on a woman. And they call me the coward,\u201d Galen sneered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just any woman,\u201d Gwen gritted out. \u201cI\u2019m a Harpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if that makes a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should. I\u2019m also a half demon. Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d She closed in despite the snake chomping on her calf and slashed for the warrior\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cShould I? All their women look the same to me. Filthy whores.\u201d He expertly dodged, jerking the whip out of her and making her cry out before cracking it again. This time it coiled around her wrist. He gave another tug. Once more she cried out. She fell to her knees, her entire body spasming.</p><p>Sabin couldn\u2019t watch this. Couldn\u2019t let the bastard destroy Gwen, no matter how much Gwen might resent him for interfering. \u201cLeave her alone. I\u2019m the one you want.\u201d Teeth gnashing, he withdrew several daggers and tossed all but one at the whip, severing its hold on Gwen. He threw the last at Galen, nailing him in the stomach. The warrior roared, fell, and Gwen lumbered to her feet.</p><p>Sabin jumped in front of her, blocking her from the crouching Galen. \u201cFinally ready to do this? To admit defeat?\u201d</p><p>Scowling, Galen pulled the knife from his gut. \u201cYou really think you\u2019re strong enough to best me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have. We\u2019ve plowed through most of your forces.\u201d He was grinning as he palmed and aimed his Sig. \u201cAll that remains is your imprisonment. And it looks like that won\u2019t be too difficult to obtain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. Just stop it.\u201d Gwen staggered to a halt in front of him, shoulders squared. She swayed, but didn\u2019t fall, her gaze locked on Galen. \u201cI don\u2019t want you taken until you hear what I have to say. I\u2019ve waited for this day my entire life, dreamed of telling you that I\u2019m the daughter of Tabitha Skyhawk. That I\u2019m twenty-seven years old, and thought to be sired by an angel.\u201d</p><p>Galen laughed as he stood, but that laugh couldn\u2019t hide his wince. He was bleeding profusely now. \u201cIs that supposed to mean something to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. About twenty-eight years ago, you slept with a Harpy,\u201d Gwen said. \u201cShe had red hair and brown eyes. She was injured. You patched her up. Then you left but said you\u2019d be back.\u201d</p><p>His lingering smirk faded as he studied her. \u201cAnd?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound as if he cared, but he didn\u2019t try to escape when he\u2019d clearly lost the battle, either.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s entire body trembled, and Sabin\u2019s rage darkened. \u201cAnd the past has a way of catching up with people, doesn\u2019t it? So, surprise. Here I am.\u201d She splayed her arms. \u201cYour long-lost daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Galen shook his head. At least his amusement didn\u2019t return. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. I would have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you would have gotten a birth announcement?\u201d Now Gwen laughed, the sound tinged with darkness.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m no one\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Behind them, the battle was winding down. The screams were stopping, the grunts fading. No more gunshots. No more pounding footsteps. Then the rest of the Lords were filling the doorway, each wearing expressions of hate and fury. Each dripping in blood. Strider still carried Gideon, as if afraid to set him down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, well, well. Look who we have here,\u201d Lucien growled.</p><p>\u201cNot so tough without a child around to shield you, Hope?\u201d Anya laughed.</p><p>\u201cTonight I\u2019ll dine on your black heart,\u201d Reyes snarled.</p> <p>Sabin studied the grim set of his friends\u2019 faces. These warriors had been tortured, and they weren\u2019t done exacting their revenge. Much as he sympathized, though, he couldn\u2019t let them have it yet.</p><p>\u201cGalen is ours,\u201d Sabin told them. \u201cStay back. Gwen?\u201d</p><p>GWEN KNEW what Sabin was asking. Allow him to imprison her father, or let her father go. That he was leaving the choice up to her proved his love as nothing else could have. If only she could give him what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, voice cracking. Peering into those sky-eyes, eyes she\u2019d once only dreamed about, she was struck anew with the knowledge that her father was here, in front of her, that he represented everything she\u2019d ever wanted as a little girl and then as an adult, while she\u2019d been trapped in that cell in Egypt. How often had she yearned to be held and protected by him?He hadn\u2019t known about her. Now that he did, would he love her? Would he want her with him, as she\u2019d craved all those years?</p><p>Galen eyed the warriors glaring at him menacingly. \u201cPerhaps I spoke too soon. We will talk, you and I. Privately.\u201d He stepped forward and reached out to her.</p> <p>Sabin snarled, and it was the type of sound a beast made just before it flew into attack. \u201cYou can leave, if she allows it, but you don\u2019t touch her. Ever.\u201d</p><p>For several seconds, it looked as if Galen would argue. The Lords certainly were. They wanted this man in chains and didn\u2019t like that Sabin had offered him freedom.</p><p>\u201cNo child of mine would choose to be with the Lords of the Underworld.\u201d Galen held out his hand and waved his fingers at her. \u201cCome with me. We will leave, get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>Did he truly wish to learn about her or did he simply hope to use her as another weapon against his hated enemies? The suspicion hurt, and Gwen found herself grabbing Sabin\u2019s gun, barrel aimed at Galen\u2019s head. \u201cNo matter what happens, I\u2019m not going anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>Sabin hated him. This man had done cruel things. Would continue to do cruel things.</p><p>\u201cYou would kill your own father?\u201d Galen asked, clutching his heart as if she\u2019d truly injured his feelings.</p> <p>In her mind, he was suddenly wrapping his arms around her, holding her close, telling her how much he loved her. Hope. It was there, in her chest, blooming through her entire body. Did it stem from him? Or from herself?</p><p>\u201cYou were so quick to dismiss me,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cYou said you had no children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was merely in shock,\u201d he explained patiently. \u201cAbsorbing the news. After all, it\u2019s not every day a man is given the priceless gift of fatherhood.\u201d</p><p>Her hand trembled.</p><p>\u201cYour mother...Tabitha. I remember. She was the most beautiful sight I\u2019d ever beheld, or have since. I wanted her instantly and meant to keep her, but she left me. I was never able to find her. Had I known about you, I would have desired a place in your life.\u201d</p><p>Truth or lie? She lifted her chin even as her arm fell. Maybe there was good in him. Maybe he could be saved. Maybe not. But...\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she repeated, a hot tear streaming down her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cDaughter...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said go!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly his wings jerked into motion, spreading, fast, too fast, flapping, wind gusting around them. Before anyone could blink, he burst up, through the ceiling and out of the building.</p><p>Unable to hold back any longer, the other warriors fired at him, even tossed their blades. Someone must have nailed him, because there was a howl. It wasn\u2019t too bad an injury, though, because Galen didn\u2019t fall back inside. Gwen hated herself for the relief she felt.</p><p>The sound of heavy breathing filled the room, blending with muttered curses, stomping footsteps.</p><p>\u201cNot again,\u201d Strider groaned, finally placing Gideon on the floor. \u201cWhy would you do that, Sabin? Why would you let her do that?\u201d A second later, the hulking warrior was beside his friend, writhing in agony.</p><p>Sabin\u2019s hesitation had given Galen the chance to escape, and Galen\u2019s escape had meant defeat for the Lords. Defeat for Strider. My fault, she thought. She\u2019d just proven Sabin right. She couldn\u2019t be trusted with his greatest enemy. She\u2019d hesitated to do what was needed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sabin said to his friend.</p><p>I\u2019ll make it up to him. Somehow, some way. She spun, meaning to grab on to him and make him listen to her apology. Instead, she gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll heal. How are you?\u201d His gaze raked her, taking in every bruise and cut. A muscle ticked below his eye. \u201cI should have taken him down when I had the chance. He hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll heal,\u201d she said, parroting him as she threw herself into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. Can you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>He grunted, even as he kissed the top of her head. \u201cI love you. There\u2019s nothing to forgive, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wimped out. I let your greatest enemy go. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. I\u2019m not letting you blame yourself for this. I let him go.\u201d He cupped her jaw. \u201cNow tell me what I want to hear. What I need to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment, his relief palpable. \u201cWe\u2019re staying together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, if I\u2019ll have you? I told you, you\u2019re first in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Slowly her lashes lifted and then she was peering up at him, tears now streaming freely down her cheeks. \u201cYou gave up a victory for me. I can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would give up anything, everything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really do love me. You mean it. Won\u2019t grow to hate me, won\u2019t let war come between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what\u2019s been worrying you?\u201d He snorted. \u201cDarling, I could have told you those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t have believed you. I thought winning was the most important thing in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled radiantly up at him. But that smile faded as the murmurs of the other Lords filled her ears, reminding her of what she\u2019d done. Or hadn\u2019t done. \u201cI should have told you to lock him away forever. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. He needs to be stopped, I know that, but there at the end, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself...couldn\u2019t let you...I\u2019m so sorry. Now he\u2019s going to cause even more trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right. We\u2019ll deal with it. We\u2019ve severely handicapped their army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure how much good that will do us. Galen found Distrust,\u201d Anya said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to place the demon inside someone else\u2019s body, hoping to create an immortal soldier he can control. He was pretty confident about his success.\u201d</p><p>Distrust, once Sabin\u2019s best friend, Gwen remembered. If Distrust were on her father\u2019s side, would Sabin be able to hurt whichever body it resided in? No matter what kind of destruction that person inflicted. She didn\u2019t want her man faced with the same type of decision she\u2019d just had to make.</p><p>Sabin smoothed a hand through her damp hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do,\u201d he said as if he\u2019d read her thoughts. \u201cBut I do now understand how difficult your decision must have been. If you need that bastard free to make you happy, then free he\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d several of the warriors muttered behind him.</p><p>\u201cWe get a say in that,\u201d Reyes growled, rifling through the pockets of the fallen Hunters.</p><p>Gwen sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll come to terms with his capture, I know I will. Seeing him for the first time was just too shocking to process. Don\u2019t worry, though. Next time I\u2019ll do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but worrying is what I do best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. Loving me is what you do best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d she said, squeezing him tight. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some kids to soothe, artifacts to find, Hunters to kill and a box to destroy. After you love the breath out of me, of course.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>ONCE THEY WERE HOME, their injuries healed, they were able to make love like wild animals. Afterward, Gwen had too much energy to sleep. She popped up and started jumping on the bed, daring Sabin to do something about it. He propped himself against the headboard, watching her through bright, amused eyes.</p><p>She tsked under her tongue. \u201cLook at you. Just sitting there, unable to keep up with a little girl who\u2014ahhhhhh.\u201dHe\u2019d kicked her legs out from under her, sending her tumbling to her back. Grinning, he dove on top of her. \u201cWho\u2019s the tired one now, huh?\u201d</p><p>She was laughing as she rolled him over, her hair falling around them like a curtain. \u201cNot me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see what I can do about that.\u201d</p><p>And he did.</p><p>A long while later, she found herself snuggled back into his side, having trouble catching her breath. \u201cSo what\u2019s next, hmm?\u201d she asked, happier than she\u2019d ever been. Who would have thought Gwendolyn the Timid would hook up with the fiercest Lord of the Underworld, throw herself into the midst of a war, and like it? Not her, that was for sure.</p><p>For the moment, though, things were calm. All the couples were safe, secure and reunited. The women (and Legion) were finding new homes for the children, both the ones Gwen had captured during their Budapest battle and the ones they\u2019d rescued from Hunter High. Anya even had a favorite, the one she called \u201cGhost Boy,\u201d and Gwen suspected the goddess would place him with a loving family here in Buda, where she could keep an eye on him.</p><p>Torin was searching for the people on Cronus\u2019s list, and the other warriors were plotting ways to find Galen\u2014and Distrust. Gideon was still healing; that would take a while. Legion disappeared periodically, and both Paris and Aeron were acting strangely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next with us?\u201d Sabin asked. \u201cWell, after my heart starts beating again, I\u2019m going to crawl my way down your body and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a laugh, batting his hand away as he tickled her stomach. \u201cWith the Hunters.\u201d</p><p>He sank deeper into the mattress, his arms tightening around her. \u201cDanika thinks Galen is going to try and pair Distrust with the woman in the painting with him. If he succeeds, it\u2019s gonna be a free-for-all when it comes time for the next battle. They won\u2019t merely try to injure us, they\u2019ll go for our heads. They\u2019ll want our demons free so they can pair them with new hosts of their choosing.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d suspected that, but still shuddered. \u201cBrilliant of my...Galen, to place a piece of your beloved friend inside the body of your enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I wouldn\u2019t have expected anything less from the man who fathered you. Your sisters wouldn\u2019t happen to have come into their powers or whatever it is, would they? If so, maybe we can convince them to stay.\u201d Sabin traced hearts along her spine. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that every Harpy develops some sort of ability after living a few centuries. An ability like time travel. It\u2019d come in handy, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly Taliyah. She can shift into other forms, as her own father could.\u201d Talking about her race was becoming easier. She wanted Sabin to know about her.</p><p>\u201cEven better.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta find those artifacts before Galen does. If he hasn\u2019t already found one. That snake-whip...the more I think of it, the more it reminds me of the creature that was guarding the Cage of Compulsion. The same kind of creature that supposedly guards each of the artifacts. As he\u2019s the keeper of Hope, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have any trouble convincing even a monster to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he has one, we\u2019ll just steal it. I mean, you\u2019ve got a Harpy and the goddess of Anarchy on your side. The odds are in your favor.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cMaybe you and I can visit the Temple of the Unspoken Ones. Something there told us about Danika, the All-Seeing Eye. Maybe whoever\u2014whatever\u2014it was will help us find something else.\u201d</p><p>Gwen traced her finger over his chest, loving the contrasting tones of their skin. \u201cAnd if we find those people listed on the scrolls, we can convince them to help us. You don\u2019t have to worry about Doubt causing trouble. He knows I\u2019ll spank him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he does.\u201d He kissed her temple. \u201cBut yes, I\u2019ll do anything\u2014within reason\u2014to win this war, including convincing criminals I helped incarcerate to help me. And actually, that should be easy. After all, I convinced the fiercest Harpy of them all to give me her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would you do anything\u2014within reason\u2014to keep that Harpy happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d She grinned up at him. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She was on her back in the next instant, giggling like a schoolgirl, her body and soul Sabin\u2019s, just the way she liked it. </p> </body></html>"]
