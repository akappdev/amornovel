His fingers are splayed on the small of my back and I swear I can feel his skin burn through my dress as I try my best not to melt in his hands. We dance, slowly. We\u2019ve been dancing this way for what seems like hours. I sigh and lean more of my weight against him. I had dreams of how my wedding would go as a child, but this surpasses it. Seth surpasses all of my wildest dreams and fantasies. He\u2019s sweet, protective, fierce, and loyal wrapped up in a tight, delicious body and face sexier than any other. Underneath my ear, his heart beats in even, spellbinding rhythms through his crisp suit and the sweat on the palm of his hand mixes with mine.</p><p>He is my Seth.</p> <p>My husband.</p><p>When I met Seth, I never imagined our lives twisting together in such a way. I wanted him. I wanted to taste him, to touch him. It was pure sexual attraction... then something changed. We connected, and once our souls touched, they refused to let go. Now we\u2019re here as husband and wife, underneath the prettiest crystal Elise chandelier I\u2019ve ever seen, dancing to slow songs I\u2019ve never heard before. Our mothers played the biggest part in organizing our wedding. Seth and I wanted a small wedding, hell, eloping in Vegas was an option at one point, but our parents refused both, claiming we needed something memorable. I didn\u2019t need extravagance to make it memorable; Seth was enough, yet here we stand after having caved to our mothers\u2019 wishes. They got what they wanted\u2014extravagance, elegance, and every family member we have all lumped into the one room in their finest clothes to watch their \u2018babies\u2019 get married. I don\u2019t mind because I have what I want, too. Him. I have him and he\u2019s all I want. He\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever want.</p><p>I feel his body shift as he lowers his head closer to mine. \u201cAre you ready to get out of here?\u201d he asks in that deep, goosebump inducing voice of his.</p><p>I nod as butterflies explode in my stomach. I\u2019ve wanted to get out of here for hours now. Seth looks positively delicious in a black three piece suit, but personally, I think it\u2019ll look better on a floor somewhere\u2014maybe thrown over the seats in the car. I pull back from Seth and I\u2019m met by his mesmerizing, dark chocolate eyes. I\u2019ve always liked his eyes\u2014even more so now that they\u2019re officially attached to my husband. I see his happiness in his eyes and underneath his happiness, I see his naughty intent and suddenly my heart won\u2019t stand still. Seth and I have had sex plenty of times\u2014more times than I can count\u2014but this time is different. This time it\u2019ll be the beginning of the rest of our lives.</p><p>Husband.</p> <p>Hus...band.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of mentally thinking that word\u2014not that I\u2019ll ever admit it out loud. Seth has a habit of tormenting me until my face is red and burning. He loves it. He loves getting under my skin, and as much as I love seeing his eyes flare, pleased with my reactions or his over-confident smirk that makes me want to suck his lips right off his face, it\u2019s annoying. He is annoying\u2014quite possibly the most annoying man I\u2019ve ever met, and I fucking love him. I love him with everything I have, and tonight I promised I will for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dying to ditch our families since we kissed at the church,\u201d I mumble breathlessly so Seth\u2019s grandparents don\u2019t hear.</p><p>They smile and wave at Seth and I as they waltz by and we return it with awkward chuckles.</p><p>\u201cSince we kissed?\u201d he asks, smiling that Goddamn smile at me. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I feel my cheeks warm. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>His glowing brown eyes flare. He wants to tease me, I can see it. His lips curl ever so slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s awfully slack on your part.\u201d</p><p>I frown and he leans forward, bringing his lips right to my ear. His warm breath blows over my earlobe, weakening my knees. If Seth weren\u2019t holding me up, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d dissolve into a puddle of tingles and moans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dying to run away with you from the moment I saw you step through the door.\u201d</p><p>I laugh once. \u201cThat was only six or seven minutes before our kiss.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, rocking me from side to side and pressing me hard against his body. \u201cOkay, so I\u2019m six or seven minutes more attracted to you than you are to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be more attracted to me than I am to you? Have you seen you?\u201d</p> <p>Seth angles his head, his eyes smiling along with his lips. His hand, still holding my lower back, descends further and he brushes his pinky over the curve of my ass. \u201cHave you seen you?\u201d</p><p>My breathing deepens as his hand slips even lower onto the curve of my backside. He pulls me harder against his body and I feel every firm inch of him. I drop my head against his chest with a quiet moan and he chuckles darkly under his breath. His fingers twitch on my ass before he releases a heavy exhale and reluctantly returns his eager paws to a safer position on my back.</p><p>\u201cYou better stop that,\u201d he warns. \u201cOr this whole room is going to see just how hot you get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me to stop it like it\u2019s possible around you.\u201d I chuckle, snuggling into him.</p><p>My feet ache, my face muscles hurt from smiling too much, but I couldn\u2019t be happier. I\u2019m so happy I can barely contain it. Every now and then my fingers involuntarily twitch in Seth\u2019s hand and I giggle for no reason.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting out of here. It\u2019s time to test your acting skills,\u201d he mutters, before wrapping and arm around my shoulders.</p><p>Huh? I try to angle my head to look up at him but he squeezes me against him, tucking my head into his chest. My God he smells good, like soap, cologne and him. It sets fire to my blood, threatening to burn the dress from my body.</p><p>\u201cTired, is she?\u201d I hear Mom ask, feeling her hand brush over my hair not a second later.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very tired,\u201d Seth replies with a sigh. His voice rumbles in his chest, vibrating me from head to toe. \u201cWe might head off.\u201d</p><p>He lessens his grip and nudges me out of my comfortable spot. I guess it\u2019s my turn to act. Luckily for him, I passed drama in school with flying colors. I fake a yawn as I turn to Mom, ignoring Seth, who swears under his breath. What? I\u2019m not doing that bad a job. Mom looks great in her plum gown and subtle makeup. I haven\u2019t seen her wear makeup in years, but the smoky eyes and deep plum lipstick suits her. She brushes a short lock of hair from her eyes and genuinely looks concerned with how tired I am. I give Seth a subtle smug glance and he rolls his eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cI need a bed,\u201d I tell her. \u201cMy feet hurt and my eyes are aching.\u201d</p><p>Mom pats my shoulder and slightly pinches the flesh in that comforting way only a mother can do. \u201cYou go, sweetheart. You\u2019ve had such a big day.\u201d She turns her suddenly accusing eyes on Seth and he barely bats an eyelid. \u201cHow much have you had to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a drop.\u201d</p><p>Her sharp eyebrows furrow. \u201cI saw you at the bar a couple of times tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChilled water only, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She studies him for a little while and Seth isn\u2019t fazed in the slightest by it. When I was a kid, her stare could make me admit anything. True story. She can be quite scary when she wants to be, just ask Selena. She\u2019s petrified of my mom.</p><p>\u201cFine, I believe you.\u201d Her lips twitch. \u201cYou have fun. I\u2019ll see you both after your honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>She pulls us into a hug and lingers for a few seconds. \u201cYou made us all very proud today.\u201d She sniffles. \u201cPicture perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t cry,\u201d I tell her, laughing.</p><p>She lets us go and swipes at the tears that roll down her face. She grips my arm and pulls me in, planting a soft kiss on my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I say, squeezing her arm.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d</p><p>Seth takes me by the elbow and quickly pulls me from the hall. I admit, I do feel a little bad for bailing on our families but I can\u2019t be with Seth a second longer without tearing his clothes off. He pulls me along next to him as he breaks into a quick jog.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s eager,\u201d I joke, focusing really hard on not rolling my ankle. I can barely keep up with him and his eagerness to get out of here. \u201cI\u2019m wearing heels, you know.\u201d</p><p>I gasp as he tugs on my arm, sending me forward, and I lose my breath as he scoops me up into his strong arms. \u201cI\u2019ll carry you, then.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around his neck and hold on as he carries my down some stairs. \u201cYou could\u2019ve stopped long enough for me to take off my shoes.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his smile saying a million naughty words. \u201cThe shoes need to stay on.\u201d</p><p>When we reach the car, he opens the door and sits me inside, careful not to catch my dress when he closes it. I watch him walk around the front of the car, fishing his keys out of his pocket. He stops under a streetlight to feel deeper into the fabric and I admire him from my seat. Under the bright light, he looks so angelic and pure\u2014so pure I half expect him to grow wings and fly away. But, when he looks up at me from under his brow and the shadows obscure the majority of his face, I see his darkness. I see the demon he really is, and although I admire the sweet, angelic side of Seth, I will be forever consumed by his dark side, the side that does what it wants and takes what it believes it\u2019s owed.</p><p>Tonight we were married, and what comes after isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business but Seth\u2019s and mine. I have many things planned for him\u2014things I know will drive him wild. I\u2019ve never been one to kiss and tell... Seth, however, will undoubtedly tell the whole world.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Seth</p><p>The warm bases of my feet are cooled as they tap against the cold concrete beneath me. I walk quick and determined up the corridor toward the huge double doors in front of me. My gaze falls onto the MMAC\u2019s slogan painted onto the back of the door. Be strong. Be smart. Be great. I was strong, smart, and great when I fought Moset. Now? Now I\u2019m pissed, I\u2019m vengeful, and I\u2019m hungry. I shake my arms as I bounce on the balls of my feet and I roll my head from side to side. I feel warm. My whole body is alight with a fire I\u2019ve never felt before. My chest isn\u2019t heavy like it usually is before a fight because this time I fight for myself. I\u2019m not fighting to impress my father or to state my position in the MMAC. Fuck \u2018em both. I\u2019m sick of trying to impress people. I\u2019m sick of giving them everything I have only to have it thrown back in my face. This time\u2014this fight\u2014it\u2019s for me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got this, baby,\u201d Olivia purrs in my ear, pulling me from my thoughts. \u201cThis is your fight.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and see her beautiful face. Her green eyes glow lovingly at me and I know win or lose, she\u2019ll be waiting for me, right where I leave her. She brings my mouthguard to my lips and I open my mouth as she pushes it inside. As my lips close around the guard, I kiss the very tips of her fingers, making her chuckle and her chest jiggle... my two favorite things.</p><p>I smile to myself before forcing my mind from Olivia and back to the fight. Don Russell. Our whole relationship has led to this. It began with me fucking his girlfriend and it ends now with me beating him to a pulp in the cage. He will get no mercy from me.</p><p>I hear the announcer call my name and the doors in front of me are pulled open. Thousands upon thousands of people begin to scream and I watch them, dragging my gaze over the massive arena. Hearing them scream for me sends a crackle of electricity through my body and I grind my teeth into my guard, fighting off a shudder that threatens my spine.</p><p>I live for this.</p><p>I worked hard for this.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Get out there,\u201d Darryl shouts in my ear, but I ignore him and continue to watch the crowd, completely struck.</p><p>Olivia rests the palm of her hand against mine and that\u2019s all the push I need. I grip her hand and drag her along next to me. I feel her fingers nervously squeeze mine as I pull her through narrow walkways and in between throngs of people. They reach out for me, men slapping my back and women raking their fingers through my hair as I pass them. Sensing Olivia\u2019s tension, I pull her in, wrapping an arm around her waist and mentally declaring war on anyone that touches her.</p><p>I don\u2019t look at Don, who waits in the cage for me. Instead, I keep my eyes on my corner. I can feel his eyes on me, analyzing me. I know what he\u2019s thinking and I know how cocky he\u2019s feeling. He\u2019s spent the last few months being told how great he is by his training camp. He\u2019s been told he\u2019s going to win, that he is going to completely destroy me. The problem is so have I, and only one of us can come out on top. Unfortunately for him, Darryl has never lied to me a day in my life, so I know I\u2019ve got this in the fucking bag.</p><p>My blood sings to me. It\u2019s fired up and ready to go. My muscles contract and retract of their own accord, listening only to my vengeance. The second that bell rings, I will have no control over my actions and whether he ends up dead or alive at the end of it doesn\u2019t concern me.</p><p>Before I know it, I roughly kiss Olivia on the mouth and tug my hoodie over my head and toss it to the floor. I show the ref my gloves and mouthguard, bound up the steps, and enter the cage before Jackson and Darryl can even touch me.</p><p>In the cage, I don\u2019t make a show of it. I storm to my corner, stand there, and finally lift my gaze to Don. He stares back at me with that smug little twitch on his lips and I can\u2019t wait to knock it clean off his face.</p><p>The announcer does the introductions and rattles off a great big list of sponsors. I hear none of it. All of my attention is focused on the pussy of a man who threatens everything I\u2019ve worked so hard for. Every second that passes I grow more and more anxious. I begin to pace\u2014left a few steps and then right a few steps. My fingers clench and unclench involuntarily and I can hear Darryl and Jackson in my corner telling me to get out of my own head, to not let Don get to me. I can\u2019t. My hatred for him is consuming me inch by inch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeth,\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice filters through my ears over the roar of the crowd and drowns out Darryl and Jackson.</p><p>I turn toward her. She\u2019s up on the ring, her slender fingers hooking around the cage, and as soon as my eyes lock with hers, my anxiety floats away.</p><p>\u201cYou are in control,\u201d she tells me as I step closer to her. \u201cHe underestimates you. He thinks you\u2019re a stupid boy who poses no threat.\u201d Her plump, pink lips curl into a sexy, dark smirk\u2014the kind of darkness I only see in her when we\u2019re seconds away from fucking.</p> <p>\u201cShow him how dangerous you are. You\u2019re stronger than him in every way and I want you to prove it.\u201d</p><p>I grip the cage and bring my face closer to hers. Our lips barely graze through the links and if my blood wasn\u2019t already boiling and rushing through my veins, I\u2019m sure it would have pooled in my cock, making it hard for all to see.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to hurt him?\u201d I ask, desperately wanting her to nod.</p><p>Instead, she shakes her head and I feel defiance grow in my chest. Nothing can stop me from putting Don in his place, not even Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI want you to destroy him,\u201d she whispers.</p> <p>Well, I\u2019ll be damned. I never thought I\u2019d see the day Olivia would encourage me to beat the shit out of someone. I guess I\u2019ve rubbed off on her in more ways than one. I hook a finger around a cage link, only just managing to catch the collar of her \u2018SETH\u2019 shirt. I pull her forward, closing the tiny gap between our lips. I flick my tongue against her bottom lip, but she refuses to open her mouth to me. She\u2019s too shy to kiss on television, how cute. I suck her bottom lip into my mouth and bite down. Like I planned, she opens her mouth with a gasp and allows me a few quick and hungry strokes of her tongue. She pulls back, panting heavily.</p><p>\u201cWin for me?\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cWith pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I face Don with a new passion, the same passion that has driven me to work harder\u2014to give Olivia everything she has ever wanted. I don\u2019t care how pussy I sound. I can\u2019t play indifferent when it comes to her, I never could. I\u2019ll take all of the \u2018pussy whipped\u2019 and \u2018I can see your vagina\u2019 comments with a wide smile on my face.</p><p>Not a second later, the bell rings and I\u2019m out of my corner and in the middle of the ring. Don extends his arm to me, his palm wide and expecting. He is out of his fucking mind if he thinks I\u2019m going to touch him with anything other than my fists. I have no respect for him and he deserves no respect from me. He\u2019s lucky I don\u2019t snap his fucking wrist right this second. I grit my teeth as he pulls his hand back and smiles at me, exposing his red mouthguard. I launch forward, swinging with everything that I have and connecting with his stomach. He stumbles backwards, completely dazed by my abrupt attack. I had no better plan other than \u2018destroy him.\u2019 The more I hit him (and when I say hit him, I mean absolutely slam my fists into his stomach), the more I realize he\u2019s no longer moving. His body has stopped reacting to my hands. I hit him again and again but draw no satisfaction from it. Only anger. I stop, completely out of breath and glance around the cage. The arena is empty. We\u2019re alone. I turn back to Don, he\u2019s gone and the figure replacing him is a face I despise just as much.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p> <p>I take in his lifelike form\u2014tall, solid, graying hair and angular features... he seems healthy, nothing like the sickly thin man I saw on his deathbed.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d he asks, almost smiling as he gestures to the empty seats.</p><p>I frown, taking in the abandoned arena. There\u2019s nothing here... not even rubbish. \u201cThey were here a second ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re gone now. What\u2019d you do to scare them off?\u201d</p><p>I step toward him but I\u2019m stopped in my tracks as Don appears out of thin air and hits me square in the mouth before disappearing again. I stumble backwards, clenching my mouth as pain radiates through my jaw. I can\u2019t taste my blood, but I can feel it trickling from my mouth. I spit and watch the red blood collide with the clean mat. I hate bleeding.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come to torment me?\u201d I snap. Heat floods me, filling my chest with a fury he isn\u2019t going to like when it bursts open and tears me in two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to level you. You\u2019re getting too full of yourself. You have a high paying job, a big house, cars\u2014even a beautiful wife, but don\u2019t think for a second they\u2019re yours forever.\u201d</p><p>Pain slams into my kidneys and I\u2019m thrust to the side. I snap around... but Don is gone. I hear my breathing in my ears as my chest begins to rise and fall rapidly. My temper is getting the best of me... if I\u2019m not careful I\u2019m going to end up punching my own father in the mouth. Somehow, I\u2019ve managed to avoid it for most of my life, but right now he\u2019s dancing dangerously close.</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I growl, my suddenly bare fingers twitching at my sides. \u201cI\u2019m not as bad as you say I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because she told you you\u2019re good?\u201d</p><p>I inhale slowly in an effort to calm myself. It works... temporarily at least. \u201cI am good.\u201d</p><p>Dad tosses his head back and laughs. \u201cI hate to break it to you, boy, but she is in no position to call anyone good.\u201d I frown. \u201cYou think she\u2019s good? She might\u2019ve been once upon a time, before you sank your dirty, spoiled claws into her.\u201d</p><p>How fucking dare you! My entire body tightens\u2014my muscles threatening to cramp\u2014and I spring forward before punching my own father in the mouth. It tosses his head to the side, but he recovers quickly. The hit barely causes damage... and it\u2019s a sad realization when you discover you\u2019re more upset about not splitting your father\u2019s lip than acting out and hitting him. I growl until it burns my throat and I try again. Same result. I want to hurt him, damn it! I try again and again until my chest burns and my knuckles ache. Fail... it\u2019s all I ever do when it comes to him. With a heavy exhale, I fall to my knees at his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I ever do to you?\u201d I pant, shaking my head.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt so weak in my life and the sound of my own voice pleading at his feet disappoints me.</p><p>\u201cYou exist, you poison people, and you have no respect for anyone\u2014take your pick.\u201d</p><p>I glance up at him. \u201cThe way I am rests squarely on your shoulders. I\u2019m the consequence of your inability to be a decent parent.\u201d My lips begin to pull wider as I look at him. \u201cMom became an alcoholic, did you know that? She lost her job, she lost everything, and guess who helped her?\u201d I push myself back onto my feet and draw myself to full height. \u201cYou remember your good daughter, Maddison? Yeah, well she was stripping for cash in Vegas and guess who helped her out of it? As for Olivia, she was stuck in a dead-end relationship with a guy who treated her like shit. Want to take a shot at guessing who helped her out of that one, too?\u201d</p><p>Dad glares at me, his brown eyes feeling like daggers in my flesh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, old man. Me! I helped her and I treat her like the fucking queen that she is. Sure, she likes to get a little naughty, but that doesn\u2019t affect who she is deep down.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cAs for Mom and Maddi, I was the one that put our lives back together after your inconvenient death tore it apart. While we\u2019re at it, and seeing as you claim to know everything about my new life, ask yourself how many times I\u2019ve visited your grave?\u201d He pales in the face and the thought of hurting him as much as he\u2019s hurt me spurs me on. \u201cAsk yourself how many times I\u2019ve brought you up in conversation other than to shit on your memory?\u201d</p><p>I wait for his reply. Nothing. My lips twitch. \u201cThought so.\u201d</p><p>Then his hand whips out and slaps against the side of my face before I see it coming. My skin burns as heat spreads over the surface, but I don\u2019t dare let my eyes fall from his pissed off face. I wonder if his face would crack and fall to pieces if he smiled? I continue to glare at him as he fades away into nothing. Good.</p><p>I shake my forearm as an unbearable pressure radiates from my elbow. I blink once, no, twice and before I know it, I\u2019m on my back and Don has his legs over my chest while he straightens my arm out. I feel my joint pop and I shout out in pain. No, no, no, no, no. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I try to pull away but it only makes the pain worse.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Multiple people are screaming my name, but I can\u2019t single them out.</p><p>There\u2019s a second pop and my free arm feels heavy, like it\u2019s made from solid gold and I can\u2019t tap. Under my straightened arm, the one being squeezed against Don, I feel his chest vibrate with laughter and then he flicks his hips forward...</p><p>...and my arm breaks.</p><p>I shoot up in bed, panting as though I\u2019ve run a mile.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d I hear her husky, tired voice before I feel her warm, soothing hands on my body. I hang my head as her soft skin travels across my chest and down my spine simultaneously. I close my eyes and let her bring me back to reality. I\u2019m not in an arena fighting Don. I\u2019m in bed with my wife, my good wife... my damn good wife.</p><p>I fall back against the bed and lift an arm up for Olivia. She snuggles right into my chest and I sling my arm around her shoulders, pulling her in as close as I can.</p><p>\u201cYou have that dream again?\u201d she asks as her fingertips slide up the center of my stomach, dragging over my muscles and dipping into the ridges between them. It feels good. A soothing energy flows from the tips of her fingers and the palm of her hand, calming my racing heart.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She slides closer, pressing her firm, silky body harder against me. \u201cIt\u2019s over now,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re here with me.\u201d</p><p>I let the words sink in. You\u2019re here with me. She presses her lips against my side and my body shivers. It\u2019s not a normal shiver. It\u2019s the kind of shiver only she can draw out of me, the kind that causes goosebumps to erupt over my skin. The shiver electrifies my blood, sending it pumping rapidly through my system down to my cock, stirring it from its sleep. Olivia drags her fingers delicately down my stomach to my hips and her fingers dance in small circles that would\u2019ve put me to sleep if I wasn\u2019t so painfully hard. I flex my hips into her hand, hoping she\u2019ll get the hint\u2014and she does. Her fingers hook around the band to my shorts and I lift my hips as she tugs one half of them down. Being the gentleman that I am, I help her with the other side. Olivia sits up, slinging a leg over my body and straddling me low on my hips. I can feel her bare, wet pussy on my flesh as she rubs her hands up and down my chest. She leans forward, barely putting any pressure on my body, and kisses me right on the chest. Again and again she kisses me while her hands glide over my skin. I groan as she lifts her ass, letting my cock slip between us, then she lowers herself, letting her center press against my shaft. My breath hitches as her hot, wetness coats me. She\u2019s teasing me, allowing me to feel her without letting me inside and I like it. I don\u2019t want her to give it to me straight away. I want her to toy with me, to drive me crazy with her body, and when I can\u2019t take it anymore, I want her to give it to me, forcing me to start the sweet torture all over again. She knows exactly what she\u2019s doing, something I never guessed when I met her. In public, Olivia appears innocent. Her eyes are bright and sweet, tricking you into thinking she\u2019s never touched a dick before in her life, but when we\u2019re alone, she changes. Her inner darkness is brought out, the innocence fades and the bright lights in her eyes dim, morphing into a naughty smolder. Behind closed doors, she knows exactly how to handle me. Olivia is an undeniable force on long legs and subtle curves all wrapped up with pretty green eyes. The perfect package. She often says that she is consumed by me, but it is I that is consumed by her. Her mind doesn\u2019t work like anyone else\u2019s. Someone looks at her and she thinks there\u2019s something wrong with her dress or her hair, but when I see them look at her, I see the desire and envy as clear as day.</p><p>Dragging her kisses up my neck, she begins to rock her hips, sensually sliding herself up and down my length. She feels amazing\u2014beyond amazing\u2014and I haven\u2019t even entered her yet. I close my eyes while her hands delicately massage my chest and she leans forward, resting her forehead against mine. I wish it was bright in here so I could see her face, so I could see her body against mine and the look on her face when I make her come.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it when I go slow?\u201d she whispers, her voice labored and husky as she catches her bottom lip between her teeth.</p><p>I smile and drag the very tips of my fingers along her thighs. Her muscles tremble as I lift my head off the pillow and suck her bottom lip into my mouth. She gasps, her hot breath flowing from her in excited pants.</p><p>I release her lip. \u201cYou know I love it.\u201d</p><p>In response, she slides against me again and again, pushing me closer to the edge. I grip her hips, unable to keep my hands off her for another second. I dig my fingers in, forcing her to move in quicker strokes. \u201cYou know what else I love?\u201d</p><p>She moans, her hands no longer massaging my chest, but digging in.</p><p>\u201cMaking you come.\u201d</p><p>Olivia whimpers and her thigh muscles squeeze my hips. \u201cYou love it?\u201d</p><p>I shiver. \u201cFuck yeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it,\u201d she demands. \u201cPlease.\u201d She shudders against a tremor and inhales sharply as she moves more frantically. \u201cPlease do it.\u201d</p><p>I feel my own lips twitch as I buck my hips and roll her off me. She gasps as I push her hard into the mattress and reach between us. Her heady breath is almost a sob as she feels my hand glide against her inner thigh. I\u2019m barely making contact and yet she shivers at the slightest graze. I lower my mouth and kiss her neck while I rub my hard cock up and down her lips. Immediately, Olivia\u2019s body moves of its own accord, lifting to push against mine and urging me to take her. Her hands move up my shoulders and tighten in my hair as my lips continue to explore down her neck and over the rise of her collar bone. Fireworks are going off inside me, setting off every cell and every vessel, but I manage to keep my composure. My strategically placed kisses find her mouth again, and I kiss her hungrily\u2014passionately. The passion I show my wife is a different kind of passion than I show (or have shown) to anybody else. The passion I spend on Olivia is fueled by love and lust. It\u2019s never been like this with anyone else. Make no mistake, anyone can be passionate, but it takes real love to be passionate over and over, time and time again. I\u2019ll never tire of her warm skin, firm or soft. I\u2019ll never tire of her big, round breasts, perky or not, and I\u2019ll never tire of her warm smile or bright green eyes. She\u2019s mine, in sickness and in health, till death do us part\u2014scratch that\u2014even in the afterlife she\u2019s mine and I\u2019ll fight any spirity-ghost bastard that attempts to fuck this up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I completely consume her mouth with my own, tasting every inch of her as I push myself inside the sweet opening between her legs. She\u2019s warm\u2014so fucking warm\u2014and I stop as her walls clench me. Jesus. I shut my eyes briefly and swallow hard. I didn\u2019t stop to tease her, I stopped because I\u2019m close to combusting.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she rasps against my lips.</p><p>I push further, abandoning her mouth and dropping my forehead against hers. It\u2019s going to take a hell of a lot of focus not to let myself go and fuck her into oblivion. Olivia\u2019s back arches and I grit my teeth. It\u2019d be easier for me not to come if she wasn\u2019t so Goddamn sexy.</p> <p>\u201cMore,\u201d she demands, rocking her hips. \u201cAll of you, I want all of you.\u201d</p><p>How can I ignore such a plea? I stare her dead in the eyes, and even in the extremely dim lighting, I see them flare.</p><p>\u201cYou want all of me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She nods and I thrust hard. She digs her nails into my hips, pulling me closer, but I stop again and she growls, making me chuckle under my breath. She rolls her hips and I thrust into her again and again. I go harder and harder until I feel her deliciously tight pussy grip me. After that, it doesn\u2019t take long for her to completely break apart underneath me, milking me into my own orgasm. I ride it out until my body spasms at the mere touch of her soft walls. My arms tremble and I lower myself, careful not to drop all of my weight onto her smaller frame.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel better?\u201d she whispers, stifling a yawn and running her fingers up my side.</p> <p>I kiss her shoulder. \u201cI felt better the second I woke up and heard your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dreams will stop once this is all over.\u201d</p><p>I nod, choosing not to tell her that her words don\u2019t sound as convincing as I\u2019m sure she means them to be.</p><p>\u201cAnd no matter which way it goes, you\u2019ll always have me.\u201d</p><p>I lift my head and search for her eyes in the faint light. \u201cThat means more to me than anything else.\u201d</p><p>She kisses me softly, and it\u2019s in times like these I\u2019m glad no one else is around. The mere thought of anyone else listening in on our private sappy conversations makes me cringe. Whenever Darryl speaks to his wife on the phone, he makes no effort to hide his love-struck side and I tease him for it, calling him pussy related names. I know, how contradictory of me. I can\u2019t help it. I deflect. It\u2019s what I do. If there\u2019s one thing Olivia has made me see it\u2019s how I contradict myself. I told Olivia I didn\u2019t want to have sex with her... and I had sex with her. I told her that I didn\u2019t want a relationship, then I asked her to be my girlfriend, and then I married her. That is C.O.N.T.R.A.D.I.C.T.I.O.N. in its purest form, my friends. Since then, I\u2019ve contradicted myself a million times, I\u2019m aware of that. Now, for the easy part. Ask me if I care... Do I care? No. I don\u2019t.</p> <p>The poets have it right, you know, love makes you do things you swear you\u2019ll never do. Those sons of bitches need medals or something because I\u2019m living proof of their words.</p><p>I roll off Olivia and onto my back. Instantly, she tucks herself into my side. In all seriousness, I\u2019m glad I contradicted myself. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d have missed out on Olivia. I\u2019d have missed out on the chance to be good.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Olivia</p><p>His hands hit the large gloves in quick patterns and my entire body vibrates, humming with arousal. It\u2019s mesmerizing. Every retraction and strike captivates me, forbidding me to look away. My lips part as his large, firm arms extend until they\u2019re fully straight, showing off all of his delicious ropes of muscle that make up those fucking fantastic limbs. Man, if I was given a dollar every time I was rendered useless just by watching him, I\u2019d be a millionaire... and then I\u2019d spend that money on a home gym and watch from the comfort of my own house. That\u2019s the life.</p><p>\u201cYou should take a picture, it lasts longer,\u201d Seth teases from the cage.</p><p>I sigh and watch his thick fingers curl around the wire of the cage. Wait, what? I blink quickly and drag my gaze to his. He smiles down at me wickedly, and I feel my cheeks burn. I swallow my embarrassment at being caught staring at him and cover it with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too cocky for your own good, you know.\u201d I shift my weight onto my right leg and fold my arms. \u201cI was merely watching your technique. You don\u2019t seem to punch as hard as you used to.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m messing with him. Seth is forever trying to impress me, and of course he always does, but I\u2019m in the mood to torment him today. He deserves it. This morning in the shower he said there was a huge spider in the drain. Of course there wasn\u2019t, but it still made me cry. I should\u2019ve known he was only messing with me\u2014the whole time he was laughing. Seth\u2019s smile fades and his brows furrow.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d I ask, pushing further. \u201cDid you eat enough for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he snaps, whirling on his heel and storming back to the center of the ring. He lifts his gloves, bringing them closer to his face. He nods to Jackson, who shakes his head at me. I shrug. If Jackson can\u2019t take one of Seth\u2019s full power punches, then maybe he shouldn\u2019t get into the cage with him. Jackson has been nominated as Seth\u2019s new in-house sparring partner. When Seth first started his training camp, the MMAC provided him with eight new sparring partners, but Seth being Seth, refused them all. He doesn\u2019t trust the MMAC. Matt Somers has been playing both sides of the field since he announced the third and final fight months ago.</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d Darryl sighs, strolling up beside me.</p><p>I fold my arms. \u201cI had to get him to stop looking at me like that somehow.\u201d</p><p>Our conversation ends as Seth\u2019s gloved fists slam into Jackson\u2019s wide, black gloves with a loud slap.</p><p>Slap.</p><p>Slap, slap.</p><p>Slap.</p><p>Slap after slap sounded, making my heart stutter every time, and soon I fell back into \u2018la la\u2019 land, watching my hot-as-hell husband duck and dodge as he throws combos at Jackson. Seth looks amazing\u2014better than amazing\u2014he looks flawless, more flawless than he ever has\u2014which is an accomplishment all on its own. Not everybody can improve upon perfection. His muscles are more prominent, his arms wider, his legs thicker, and his determination stronger than ever before. Don Russell took from Seth and Seth doesn\u2019t fare well when his things are taken.</p><p>Darryl exhales and scribbles notes into his green clipboard. \u201cI suppose it wouldn\u2019t hurt to push him harder. His times are slacking since his last fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s having trouble sleeping, too,\u201d I confess, glancing briefly at Darryl who widens his eyes at me, offended. You\u2019d think he\u2019s a best friend I\u2019ve been keeping secrets from. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he needs to sort his shit out before it gets the best of him. If he loses this fight, his time in the MMAC will be over before it even begins.\u201d</p><p>I nod, watching Seth and the way his sweat glistens off his hard torso. We know the repercussions of this final fight... we know the MMAC is exploiting the relationship between Seth and Don for their own monetary gain, but they\u2019re also fishing to see who\u2019s the better fighter. Darryl thinks there are a few people on the MMAC board that believe Don is a better fighter and would love to see Seth be replaced.</p><p>\u201cTalk to him about it, Darryl. You\u2019re his coach.\u201d</p><p>He laughs once. \u201cThat means nothing anymore. You\u2019re the only one he listens to, and besides, we\u2019re the same sex. He\u2019ll punch me in the mouth long before he punches you.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. Fantastic.</p><p>For forty minutes Seth pushes himself harder and harder. The harder he hits, the more frustrated he gets and I wonder if maybe I shouldn\u2019t have teased him. I take in his entire form... tall, muscular, and dangerous. He holds a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and I don\u2019t care who you are, no one is strong enough to carry the weight of the world.</p><p>\u201cTime!\u201d Darryl shouts, making me jump.</p><p>Seth lowers his hands, panting heavily. I gulp as he strides across the ring, each step seeming more aggressive than the last. In no time flat, he\u2019s leaning against the cage, and though I thought he was angry, he smirks at me. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to agree, but Darryl chimes in over the top.</p><p>\u201cBetter than this morning, but not as good as last month. What\u2019s wrong, Seth?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes narrow and his lips purse. Without a word, he pushes off the cage and storms over to the gate. My entire body tightens with anticipation as he pulls it open and storms down the steps. His dark stare flicks onto my face and I\u2019m trapped\u2014unable to look away. My knees turn buttery the closer he gets and if I focus hard enough, I can hear my hormones multiplying by the second. I catch the corner of my lip between my teeth and thank God humans can\u2019t read minds. Seth would have me locked up in an insane asylum pronto if he heard half of the crazy, obsessed thoughts I have about him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he growls as he passes Darryl. \u201cNever better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be, but you\u2019re times aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Seth snatches my elbow, squeezing tightly as he pulls me away from the cage. I glance over my shoulder at Darryl and he closes his clipboard, giving me \u2018the look.\u2019 I know exactly what it means. It\u2019s up to me to talk to Seth, to motivate him. According to everyone else, I\u2019m the only one he listens to. According to me, he doesn\u2019t do anything I say unless I\u2019m begging him to fuck me.</p><p>I let Seth pull me through the training room without a fight. Its set up is state of the art and it\u2019s obvious the MMAC spares no expense when it comes to their fighters. I\u2019ve never seen so many machines. Seth pulls me all the way into the shower room and finally releases my arms as the door closes behind us. Sadly, I\u2019m getting used to the inside of a males only bathroom. The cool, white bricks are cold against my skin as I lean against the wall. I let my head angle lazily to the side as Seth pulls his black tank top over his head and tosses it to the floor. His back is to me and my stare automatically sticks to every rise and depression. I know his body so well I can feel it under my fingertips without even touching him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Darryl is right...\u201d I say, feeling confident now his intense eyes aren\u2019t on me.</p><p>Seth doesn\u2019t rush to respond. In fact, he doesn\u2019t even look at me. Instead, he leans in to turn on the open floor shower. Immediately, the hot water begins to steam up the room, feeling heavy in my lungs as it settles. I wait, patiently, for Seth to speak to me. Two minutes pass and all he\u2019s managed to do is hold his hand under the stream of hot water.</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>He whips around and glares up at me from under his brow, making me gasp. Only he has the intensity to make someone gasp aloud.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to give me a lecture now, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He starts forward, his aggressive and predatory steps swallowing the distance between us and forcing me to swallow my words. I brace myself against the wall, expecting some kind of show of dominance, instead he stops three feet away. Strangely, I feel cold... I want his warm body on mine.</p><p>Unable to resist his pull, I inch closer. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to lecture you... I just want to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help,\u201d he snaps at me and I back up an inch. \u201cI\u2019m fine going at my own pace.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cAnd when Don beats you?\u201d</p><p>He jolts forward, pushing me hard against the wall. There\u2019s the show of dominance I was expecting. I don\u2019t falter, not because I\u2019m not scared\u2014no, I\u2019m scared\u2014I\u2019m fucking terrified. I don\u2019t falter because I know it upsets him when I let him get to me. His chest is flush against mine and his thigh forces itself between my legs. I\u2019m pinned\u2014completely immobilized.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019ll beat me?\u201d Seth growls and I rapidly shake my head.</p><p>His breath is warm and quick on my face and I want nothing more than to back down, but I have to be the one to tell him to go hard. No one else has the balls to, and besides, he needs to hear it anyway. I\u2019ve lost count of his sleepless nights and can no longer calculate his fluctuating moods. He\u2019s unpredictable\u2014even more so than before\u2014and for the first time since we started dating, I don\u2019t know how to read him.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll let him.\u201d</p><p>He leans even closer, stealing my breath from me. \u201cIf you can look me in the eye and tell me that you honestly think I\u2019m not working hard enough, then I\u2019ll push myself harder, just like I did today.\u201d</p><p>I rake my teeth over my bottom lip. I think Seth\u2019s doing all right, but I\u2019m not the one who studies him and takes the notes.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to try harder, not for me or Darryl, but for yourself. You didn\u2019t take it so well when you lost to Don last time.\u201d I allow my fingers to graze his hard sides. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d He states, harshly, and this time, I flinch.</p><p>I\u2019m not trying to fight him... I don\u2019t ever want to intentionally upset him, but sometimes things need to be said. How he wants to take it is up to him. My intentions have never been anything other than wanting to help him. He exhales, leaning his forehead against mine. The previously tense muscles of his arms relax, and he lets them fall from their defensive position on the wall before gently stroking my cheek.</p><p>\u201cMentally, I\u2019m exhausted and I need to sort it out before I start pushing my body to its limit. I can\u2019t be both mentally and physically exhausted, O\u2014it\u2019s not good for anyone.\u201d</p><p>I nod, caressing him. That\u2019s understandable. I catch his hand on my cheek and pull it over to my mouth. His eyes flutter shut briefly as I kiss the palm of his hand. It smells and tastes like sweat and rubber, but I don\u2019t mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He drags his thumb along my bottom lip and I resist the urge to suck it into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI need you to be with me, not against me, and I need you to ignore whatever Darryl says because I\u2019m already aware of it. I know I\u2019m not pushing myself. I know I need to train harder, but I also know that I... I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I almost pout. \u201cIs it something I did? Is there something wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>Seth grips my face, forcing our foreheads to press together. \u201cBaby, this has nothing to do with you. You pacify my erratic thoughts, you know that. All of this is about me and letting Don and my father get into my head.\u201d</p><p>I nearly sag in relief. \u201cHow do we get them out?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and releases my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know... but I\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>His brows furrow and even deep in thought he\u2019s sexy. I can\u2019t help myself. The longer I look at him, the needier I become. I can feel fire swirl through my stomach and flow south. It moves slowly, but burns hot like lava, and when it hits my center, it explodes like a barrel of gun powder. In my head I imagine crushing my lips against his and taking exactly what I want from him. I imagine hair pulling and swearing, screaming and groaning. I imagine biting, sucking, and licking to the hardest degree, fucking until he doesn\u2019t remember who Don is\u2014until he doesn\u2019t remember his own name. I force myself back to reality with a dry, hard swallow.</p> <p>\u201cI have a temporary idea,\u201d I say, sounding more nervous than sexy.</p><p>The golden rivers of honey in his irises flare and he flicks his tongue across his bottom lip. I squeak as he manages to tug me forward and grip my ass. The zipper of my jean shorts digs into my clit and the friction causes surges of arousal to pulse through me.</p><p>\u201cYou better watch yourself,\u201d he murmurs in a sexy, gruff tone that has me breathing deeper. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many hits my resistance can take.\u201d He nods at my shirt. \u201cAnd I\u2019m already having a hard time keeping my hands off of you in this tight-ass shirt.\u201d</p><p>I look to his lips again, briefly, and then back to his eyes. God! My insides are liquid.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I whisper, dropping my hands. \u201cThis shirt is awfully tight. You should take it off.\u201d</p><p>He smirks and leans in. His hands release my backside and find my hips. He squeezes them as he urges me harder against him. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re going to regret that, but we both know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, catches his bottom lip between his teeth and releases it. \u201cWhen I\u2019m finished, you\u2019re going to beg for more, not regret that it happened.\u201d</p><p>I smile and find myself staring at his mouth again... such a sweet, vulgar mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if anyone has ever told you, but you\u2019re confidence levels are annoyingly high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, there was one girl who repeatedly referred to me as over-confident and annoying. She also claimed she hated me once... or something very close to that.\u201d</p><p>I laugh once under my breath and he continues.</p><p>\u201cIt turns out she was a terrible liar with a serious case of denial. She ended up marrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He nods ever so slightly, bringing his mouth dangerously close to mine. His full, warm bottom lip grazes mine and my breath hitches. \u201cMaybe, but she\u2019s my idiot now.\u201d</p> <p>Only Seth can make an insult sound so sickeningly romantic... or maybe there\u2019s something wrong with me. In the eventual case that it is me, I don\u2019t ever want to be right. I push the thought from my mind. There\u2019s nothing wrong with me. I\u2019m sure any girl would lose all train of thought with a mouth as tempting as Seth\u2019s close to their lips... or his naked torso pressed so flush against them. He teases me for a few seconds, holding his mouth close and grazing. I want to launch closer and kiss him, but I\u2019m paralyzed\u2014useless. It\u2019s like his mouth has control of my nervous system and he\u2019s locked everything in place.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to kiss me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I breathe my response. Yep, my mouth was too dry to speak so I breathed my response at him. There\u2019s definitely something wrong with me. He chuckles low and deep, striking all of the right chords.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d he teases, flicking his tongue out and swiftly licking my bottom lip.</p><p>Sweet mother of Satan. \u201cY-yes, badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow badly?\u201d he asks, squeezing his thigh harder between my legs and making me sigh.</p><p>\u201cLike you need an explanation,\u201d I manage to squeeze out, sounding like a normal human being who isn\u2019t on the verge of sexually assaulting another human being for a change.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, sweetheart, I need a very good explanation. I want to hear all of the naughty thoughts that are currently buzzing around your sexy little brain so I can make them a reality, right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>His words awaken something playful inside of me. It\u2019s been a little while since Seth has been his usual cheeky, sexy self. Lately, I\u2019ve been treated to silent cuddles, rough sex, and an overall grumpy Seth. Occasionally, sweet Seth shows his face, but it\u2019s usually not without extreme encouragement from me.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have enough time for you to make all of my naughty thoughts a reality. At least, not here anyway.\u201d</p><p>He counters, \u201cWe have plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t let my presence stop you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even have to look. I\u2019d know that voice anywhere. Don \u2018the asshole\u2019 Russell. Seth and I snap our heads toward the door. The second I see him, any bodily fluids that Seth enticed from me dry up.</p><p>He leans lazily against the wide door frame, smiling at us like we\u2019re old friends. His grey tank top allows for his snake tattoo to be on show and I scowl at it. Someone should really cut it off. The number of poor stupid girls it must have traumatized should be enough to start a petition.</p><p>Don\u2019s eyes flick between us as Seth peels himself off me and steps forward. I grab his wrist and force him to stay put. The last thing I want is a fight to break out right now. Thankfully, Jackson appears at the door frame beside Don and steps inside. He eyes Don with the intent to kill, I can see it as clear as day. What makes me nervous is the fact that I truly believe Jackson would kill for Seth. It\u2019s admirable, to say the least. When we were fifteen, Selena threw me in the path of a barking dog in fear of it mauling her to death. Luckily (and not that she cared) the dog was on a chain... sometimes I wonder why she\u2019s my best friend. Anyway, it\u2019s clear Jackson\u2019s here to have Seth\u2019s back in case anything gets out of hand. I\u2019d be scared of Jackson, all tall and muscular with his outrageous tattoos, but Don ignores him like he doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d Seth demands. His entire body is tense and ready to attack at a moment\u2019s notice\u2014all of it I feel by the touch I have on his wrist.</p><p>Don reaches up and scratches his bald head, still smiling away like he\u2019s won the lottery. \u201cOh, Matt didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>My jaw clenches.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re training under the same roof.\u201d He snickers before letting his slimy gaze focus solely on me. His eyes rake me up and down, lingering on all of my private sections. It\u2019s creepy and I step slightly behind Seth to block it. \u201cWhich means no more after training fuck sessions... unless you\u2019re inviting me, of course.\u201d</p><p>He winks one of his beady eyes at me and Seth starts forward. I use the momentum created by his body to quickly throw myself in front of him. Desperately, I press myself against his torso and finally he stops, but not without an annoyed growl that tingles my hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big girl,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI can handle myself.\u201d I turn to Don, pressing my back against Seth. I feel his stomach muscles contract and relax, tighten and release.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting,\u201d I spit at Don, and his smile turns into a sneer.</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d he counters.</p><p>\u201cArrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassionate.\u201d</p><p>I clench my fists tighter with every counter. \u201cYou are obnoxious, evil, childish, stupid, and vile.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019s smile widens, exposing his annoyingly perfect teeth as he looks at Seth. \u201cCareful, Seth, hate and lust are separated by the thinnest line.\u201d</p><p>I gasp. How dare he even insinuate that I\u2019d ever \u2018lust\u2019 over him? I\u2019d go with Jackson or Darryl before Don\u2014hell, I\u2019d even climb back into Blade\u2019s bed before Don\u2019s. The fact he has the balls to stand there and disrespect me and my relationship in front of my husband is appalling\u2014an act only someone still in high school would do. I start forward, seeing only red.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bit\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wind is knocked out of me as Seth\u2019s strong arm seizes me. His thick arm wraps around my waist before he lifts me and throws me over his shoulder like I\u2019m a child who doesn\u2019t want to leave the playground.</p><p>\u201cSeth! Put me down!\u201d I clench my hands into fists and smack his back with the base of my hands. Blood rushes to my head, making pressure build up behind my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCall Matt,\u201d Seth orders Jackson, his voice surprisingly calm. \u201cI will not train in the same center as this fucking asshole.\u201d</p><p>Don chuckles, and as we pass by him I feel his fingers rake through my hair. I glance up and see my chocolate strands slip through his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d I snap, slapping him away and earning another laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>I see the floor of the training room pass under Seth\u2019s feet as he carries me away.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Darryl calls from somewhere. I try to find him, to ask him to tell Seth to put me down, but my head spins and I grit my teeth together. \u201cI\u2019ll get this sorted out.\u201d</p><p>Seth ignores him and before long, I find myself in the hallway just outside the gym doors.</p><p>\u201cYou can put me down anytime now...\u201d I say, but Seth chooses to ignore me, too.</p><p>I sigh. Stupid Don. I could be in the shower having epic sex with my epic love right about now. Instead, I\u2019m being carried off like a sack of meat.</p><p>Thanks a lot, Don. I owe you one, asshole.</p><p>After Seth brought us back to the hotel and showered in the safety of our own room (alone, might I add) he left to attend a press conference and sort things out with Matt Somers. He wasn\u2019t too keen on attending the conference. Ignoring the fact that Don will also be there, it turns out my confident fighter is a little interview shy and actually hates talking about himself. Ha! Who would\u2019ve thought?</p><p>When he left, I lay down on the couch and fell asleep, only to be awoken an hour later by excited banging on the door.</p><p>\u201cOlive?\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and squint around the hotel room. Maybe I\u2019m hearing things? I close my eyes and pull my knees into my chest, snuggling further into the couch.</p><p>\u201cOlive?\u201d</p><p>Whoever it is, they\u2019re singing the word in a high pitched opera voice before bursting into fits of giggles.</p><p>Olive? Really? I think I have plenty of nicknames and I definitely prefer \u2018Olly\u2019 over \u2018Olive.\u2019 I lift my head and my brain spins in my skull. My eyes feel heavy and the strength it takes just to keep them open is enough to exhaust me into another nap.</p><p>\u201cOoooooliiiive! Open up!\u201d</p><p>I groan. I have to nip this one in the bud before it spreads to someone who enjoys tormenting me like Seth or Selena. I drag myself off the couch, feeling worse than I did before my nap. I pull the door open and immediately frown when I see Seth\u2019s sister\u2019s face beaming at me.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha\u2019 doin?\u201d She smiles lazily, running her slender fingers through her dark hair.</p><p>Even drunk off her tit she\u2019s annoyingly beautiful... just like her brother. Man, does their family have good genes or what?</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d She chuckles, gripping the door frame and looking at me like I\u2019m certifiably insane.</p><p>\u201cI was napping, thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNapping? Geez, you\u2019re even starting to act like my brother.\u201d She pushes past me, and as I go to close the door behind her, Selena jams her hand in.</p><p>\u201cChrist, O,\u201d she swears as I pull the door open. \u201cI\u2019m here, too.\u201d</p><p>I open the door wider and let her in. \u201cSorry.\u201d I say. I pinch a small curl between my fingers and tug on it. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>Selena swats me away as Maddi struts eagerly over to the kitchen bench and slips right onto the stool. When Selena joins her, I take in their appearance. Maddi is wearing skinny jeans that cling to the curves of her backside and legs. Her white backless shirt that dips low in the front complements her tan nicely and the whites seems brighter with her black hair draped over her shoulders. I try not to stare, but a good portion of Maddi\u2019s breasts are on show for all to see. When she\u2019s not looking, I peek at them a few times, trying to decide if they\u2019re real or not. I think they are, but unless I touch them, I\u2019ll never know. Instead of skinny jeans, Selena opts for a sleek royal blue blouse that clings to her body before being tucked under the waistline of her pencil skirt. She looks smart and sexy, everything a business woman should be. The only thing she\u2019s missing is a business. I glance down at my jean shorts and tank top.</p><p>\u201cAm I missing something here?\u201d I ask, scratching my head and stifling a yawn at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be if you get dressed.\u201d Selena smiles at me, but the smile doesn\u2019t make her eyes wrinkle like it usually does.</p><p>\u201cDressed for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA night out\u2014just us girls.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell no. I shake my head. I haven\u2019t been out in Vegas since the Spearmint Rhino and I\u2019m not about to change that tonight. If the past year has taught me anything it\u2019s that I don\u2019t do well in clubs. Whenever I\u2019m in one, karma manages to pinpoint my exact location and hone all of her energy in on me. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say no, Olivia,\u201d Maddi counters. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be us and I\u2019m taking you to one of my favorite places. I know the owner, the manager, the security\u2014everybody. We can drink and have fun without any hassles, and besides, Selena really needs a drink right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr two,\u201d she adds meekly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cJackson and I are going through a bit of a rough patch and I kicked him out of our room.\u201d She says it like it\u2019s no big deal and quickly shrugs her shoulders.</p><p>My mouth drops open. Should I be offended I\u2019m only finding out about this now? After Maddi? \u201cYou two broke up?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs again, slumping into herself. \u201cYes\u2014no\u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know if we were dating in the first place.\u201d</p><p>I step forward. \u201cSel, why didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought he\u2019d fix it by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJackson has always been difficult,\u201d Maddi says, slipping from her stool. \u201cAnd he\u2019s easily the most fucked up guy I know, but don\u2019t completely rule him out. He\u2019s also passionate and caring. He\u2019d never do anything to hurt you on purpose, that I know for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Selena asks, sounding hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI just do, now come on, are we going to sit around and talk or are we going out?\u201d</p><p>Maddi grins at me, her light brown eyes gleaming. How can I turn her down? She\u2019s my sister-in-law after all, and I\u2019m sure Seth won\u2019t mind me hanging out with Maddi for the night. I can\u2019t let Selena deal with this all alone, either. She needs my support and if that means hanging out at a bar against my will, then so be it.</p><p>I exhale and turn around. \u201cGive me ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Seth</p> <p>I chew my toothpick and twist a tiny piece of paper between my fingers, doing anything I can to distract myself from reaching over Matt and punching Don in the mouth. I keep my eyes on the table, ignoring all of the flashing lights and eager people. If there\u2019s one thing I hate about going pro, it\u2019s the attention. The odds of me saying or doing something stupid are high. One wrong word and I\u2019ll be plastered all over newspapers and magazines\u2014the internet, too. I feel Jackson close to my back. His tension is rolling off him in waves and I know it has nothing to do with our current situation. Selena kicked him out and clearly expects him to apologize first. I don\u2019t know what happened between them, but I do know Jackson has never said the word \u2018sorry\u2019 in his entire life, even when he\u2019s to blame.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Seth?\u201d a husky, feminine voice asks.</p><p>Her voice is a lot like Olivia\u2019s, and that in itself is enough to make me lift my gaze to the sea of reporters in front of me. I look at the girl holding her tape recorder the closest. Although she sounds like Olivia, she sure doesn\u2019t look like her. Her hair is auburn and cropped at her ears, like a little pixie. She blinks at me, waiting for my response.</p><p>Fuck. I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about. To buy time, I reach up and pull the toothpick from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon called you out, bro,\u201d Jackson mutters, kicking my chair.</p><p>I drop the paper I\u2019m twisting in my hand and fiddle with my toothpick instead. \u201cDon has no idea what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d The reporters snicker. \u201cI made it here on my own. He made it here on my name, because he was the guy I beat to get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile that may be the case,\u201d Don responds, \u201cI still beat you last round, kid, and I\u2019m sure you have the hurt pride to prove it\u2014not to mention it was video recorded.\u201d</p><p>I peer around Matt, my vision blurring a little red around the edges. If I\u2019m not careful, I\u2019m going to jump this table and beat his ass right now. \u201cYou cheated, and who the fuck are you calling kid, you motherf\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you can see,\u201d Matt interrupts, tapping a small white card against the table and cutting me off. I lean back in my chair and stuff my over-chewed toothpick into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSeth and Don still have a lot of stuff to sort out, and you can witness it all on July 16th.\u201d</p><p>I grind the toothpick between my teeth and flick it with my tongue.</p><p>Matt glances sideways at me before he continues. \u201cSeth is a little on the cranky side tonight. He found out earlier that he and Don will be training in the same center. This morning, Don was early for his session and walked in on an... intimate... moment between Seth and his wife, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>The spectators \u2018ohh\u2019 at me and wolf whistle, like they have any right to be privy to that kind of information. Slowly, I turn my head in Matt\u2019s direction. What has that go to do with anything?</p><p>I hear Don chuckle. \u201cSeth\u2019s a lucky man...\u201d</p><p>I know exactly where this is going. I clench my fists and tighten my jaw. The toothpick snaps in half between my teeth.</p><p>\u201c...Olivia has quite the ass.\u201d</p><p>I react without thought and push off of the table, throwing my chair back and launching to my feet. Don does the same, and all with a huge fucking smile on his face. Jackson\u2019s arm comes up under my armpit and around my shoulder blade, the other around my chest as Matt rises to his feet. He angles his body towards me and extends his palms in a calming gesture. His hands get closer and closer and I shove Jackson off before shrugging away from Matt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me,\u201d I growl and it takes every fiber of willpower in my being to turn around and not knock them both on their asses.</p><p>I push past Jackson and storm down two small steps before pushing out a side door and into a hallway. Before the door closes, I hear the reporters go crazy, bombarding Matt and Don with excited questions. Of course they entertain them like fucking show ponies. Jackson follows me out and I begin to pace. Forward seven steps. Turn. Seven more steps. I\u2019m lucky Darryl isn\u2019t here. He\u2019d be chewing my ass off this very second if he was... or maybe he\u2019d be proud that I walked out without hitting anyone.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jackson exhales, leaning against the wall. He rubs the back of his tattooed neck. \u201cThat went a lot better than I expected.\u201d</p><p>I stop pacing and frown at him. Jackson seems pleased with the outcome of the conference. His sparse upper lip is quirked, like he\u2019s trying not to smile. Relax, I tell myself. You got out of there without hitting anybody. Quickly, my frown turns into a smile and I laugh under my breath as I unclench my fists \u201cYou thought I\u2019d hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit yeah, I would have.\u201d He bends his leg at the knee and completely relaxes against the wall while I stuff my hands into the pockets of my jeans.</p><p>\u201cDarryl is going to be pissed,\u201d I say.</p><p>Jackson shrugs. \u201cNah, we managed to get out without costing you your MMAC contract so I think he\u2019ll be happy regardless of what happened.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cHe\u2019s playing us, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Darryl?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cMatt. He\u2019s stirring us up like wild dogs, knowing we can\u2019t touch each other until we\u2019re in the cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is his blockbuster fight of the year, he wants it to be intense. I don\u2019t know why he goes out of his way to piss you off, though. I mean, all Don\u2019s gotta do is look at you and you want to throw down.\u201d</p><p>I smirk, pulling my phone out of my pocket. \u201cYeah, well, there\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity, right? He wants us to be at each other\u2019s throats right up \u2018til the fight.\u201d</p><p>And I get the feeling that\u2019s not going to be a problem. I glance down at my screen and see two missed calls and one text message from Olivia. I open the message:</p><p>FROM: OLIVIA. TIME: 6:26 P.M</p><p>Hey! I\u2019m not sure when you\u2019re coming home,</p><p>but don\u2019t freak out if you arrive and I\u2019m not there.</p><p>Maddi and Selena have kidnapped me for a girls\u2019 night.</p><p>We\u2019re at Salem\u2019s, if you want to stop by. &lt;3</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I lock the screen and drop it back into my pocket. I hope they know what they\u2019re doing. Olivia and I have a formal dinner with the MMAC at nine.</p><p>\u201cMaddi and Selena have taken Olivia out for a girls\u2019 night.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and pushed off of the wall. \u201cSo what are we doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>Jackson is implying a lot with his words, but he\u2019s out of his mind if he thinks I\u2019m going out. I\u2019m done with the club scene. What\u2019s the point in it? I can get drunk, have sex, and save money in the comfort of my own home. Besides, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving Olivia out in Vegas alone with my ex-stripper sister and Selena.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to meet them at Salem\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Jackson shakes his head. \u201cNah, man, things ain\u2019t good between me and Selena right now.\u201d</p><p>Normally, I brush off Jackson\u2019s \u2018Selena\u2019 troubles, mostly because she\u2019s irritating, but I\u2019ll bite this time. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>I nod, half smiling. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and his stare falls to the ground. I watch him ponder for a second, working his jaw tightly. It won\u2019t surprise me if he decides to pass on telling me. He\u2019s not one to really share his problems... not until Selena, anyway.</p><p>He exhales and lets himself fall back against the wall. \u201cShe told me she loved me.\u201d</p><p>I inhale sharply, making a noise one would make when they\u2019ve cut their finger. Suddenly, I feel bad for Selena, but surely she has to know that Jackson isn\u2019t the kind of guy to get heavily involved with a girl... hasn\u2019t he told her that? Hasn\u2019t he set up clear lines to define the type of relationship he originally wanted with her? He wants sex. All he ever wants is sex.</p><p>\u201cI just looked at her, Seth, like a deer in headlights and barely nodded.\u201d He slaps his hand over his face and groans. \u201cHow could I be so stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d I ask and I feel a small bubble of excitement in my chest.</p><p>Jackson, my best friend, my brother, and the best man at my wedding, deserves to be happy. He deserves to be in love, to be filled with the same passion Olivia fills me with every day. Not the broken shell that bitch-whore woman, Amelia, left him as.</p><p>He begins to shake his head then stops and cringes. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means anymore.\u201d He keeps his eyes on the floor, deep in thought. \u201cDo I care for her? Does she mean a lot to me? Yes. I don\u2019t want her to get hurt and I don\u2019t want to share her with anyone else... but at the same time, I look at you and Olivia and you two are happy together. It kind of makes me sick.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, extending calming palms to me. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of making her as happy as you make Olivia. I\u2019m happy just existing... and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m happy doing it alone, or with Selena. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out.\u201d He bites his lip before saying, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to let go of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say before her name falls from his lips. \u201cHer.\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard. \u201cI haven\u2019t told Selena the full story. She knows there was a girl and that it didn\u2019t work out... but she doesn\u2019t understand how I\u2019m still stuck where I was... with her. I loved her. I gave her everything, I bent to her wishes, molded myself into the man that she wanted\u2014completely losing myself in the process... and I can\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms. He doesn\u2019t have to explain anything to me. \u201cI get it... but I don\u2019t think she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d He exhales, pushing off the wall for the second time. \u201cBut I\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>He always does, but for now I need his company. If the girls are drunk, I can\u2019t carry all three of them home. \u201cYou know you have to come to Salem\u2019s with me, right?\u201d</p><p>He starts towards the door at the end of the hallway and chuckles. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Salem\u2019s Lot\u2019 is a biker bar. Of course Maddi would drag the girls here. My sister has always had an unhealthy obsession with fast motorbikes, tattoos, and leather, so it makes total sense that she\u2019d find the biggest club in Las Vegas advocating her favorite things.</p><p>I exit my car and slam the door behind me. To my left, I hear a woman gasp and I look in the direction of the noise. A man and a woman lay suggestively on top of a Harley Davidson. To my... unfortunate surprise, the woman doesn\u2019t manage to cover her nipple in time for me not to see the dragon tattoo that surrounds it. I look away and laugh. \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d</p><p>I love tattoos, but the thought of having one carved into my nipple makes them suck into themselves.</p><p>The rock music that pours from the establishment is loud, but not loud enough to drown out the horrendous laughing and drunken stories from the occupants inside. I\u2019ve decided, in the little time that I\u2019ve already spent here, that Olivia, my sister, and Selena will not be staying another minute.</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself, Seth,\u201d Jackson shouts in my ear as I grab the handle to the front door. \u201cThis is the last place you want to get into a fight.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. A fight here would (probably) be a very bad move for me. Who knows what kind of crazy shit these guys are into? I pull the door open and step inside. Immediately, I make my way through crowds of people, careful not to brush against anyone\u2019s leather. Not because I\u2019m scared, but because I\u2019d hate for the smell to stick to my clothes. Thankfully, when I get in deep enough, the smell of stale beer and peanuts overbears the scent of leather. As I push toward the bar, I let my eyes scan over the patrons, scouting for brightly colored short dresses and high pitched giggles. The girls are way out of their usual zone tonight. Every other female in here is wearing some variation of leather and shiny buckles. They\u2019re covered in tattoos and piercings, and most of them sport a half shaven head. Beautiful? Some. Scary? Fuck yes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I approach the bar, I see a bright hue of pink fabric flash in the corner of my eye. I turn, but two large men step in my way, blocking the dress. It\u2019s either Selena or Olivia. My sister wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a Vegas club in pink, despite the fact it\u2019s her favorite color. I pause and wait patiently for the men to move, they do eventually and when they do, I see Olivia sitting at the bar wearing a short, pink dress. I also see Maddi standing beside Olivia giving her shot after shot. I mentally count a total of four. It turns out Maddi is quite the drinker. Olivia, however, can barely keep her shit together after a single glass of wine and should know better than to over-drink when I\u2019m not around to take care of her\u2014especially in a place like this. As Maddi steps away, a tall, boyish looking biker wearing a leather vest and dark jeans slips into her spot and leans into Olivia, breathing all over my wife.</p><p>I start forward, but Jackson snags my arm. \u201cWatch,\u201d he shouts in my ear. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re here, see how she handles it.\u201d</p><p>He keeps his grip on my arm, not allowing me to step in and help. Olivia smiles politely at the creep who is so obviously (and so creepily) ogling her. I hate it. I yank my arm from Jackson\u2019s grasp and start forward. As I reach her, the guy leaves his chair and slumps away from the bar. I want to shout after him, but for the sake of the situation, I decide against it. I go unnoticed as Olivia slumps onto the bar, dropping her head onto her arms, so I reach out and brush a lock of hair away from her cheek. She jolts upright, slapping my hand away. The surface of my skin prickles and my eyes catch hers. The fierce look in her glare is that of a wild cat and I smile. Good. She should be slapping hands away. When her eyes focus on my face, the scowl on hers fades, replaced by an excited smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou scared me!\u201d she slurs, launching herself off her chair and into my arms. \u201cPlease, please, please take me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Selena?\u201d Jackson asks Olivia, casually scanning the bar.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s face falls and I can see her drunk self can\u2019t conceal the frustration she feels toward Jackson. I guess Selena told her.</p><p>\u201cShe went home,\u201d she replies bluntly. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in the mood, thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like I did her liver a favor,\u201d Jackson retorts.</p> <p>Olivia scowls and shakes her head at him. It\u2019s typical fucking Selena dragging Olivia out somewhere and then deciding she\u2019s not in the mood. A lot of the time, Selena only looks out for herself and that\u2019s my biggest issue with her. Selfish to the core, that woman is.</p><p>\u201cAw, please tell me you\u2019re not taking away my only drinking buddy?\u201d Maddi pouts, slipping in front of us. She signals to the bartender and he puts down two more shots. She sways on her feet as she downs the two tiny glasses of whiskey. I should glare at her or tell her off for coming here, but I know better. Maddi does what she wants.</p><p>\u201cGrab her,\u201d I say to Jackson, turning away from the bar. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to check my phone to know I only have an hour and a half until dinner. A dinner Olivia and I were supposed to attend together. It seems I\u2019m going solo, something I haven\u2019t done in a while... in every sense of the word.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Olivia</p> <p>Jackson and Maddi occupy the front half of the car, leaving Seth and I alone in the back. I finger the button to Seth\u2019s jeans and he swats me away. I can\u2019t help a giggle as I try to get his pants open again and again.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he warns me, his voice low and rough. \u201cKeep your hands to yourself.\u201d</p><p>It would have been threatening if he wasn\u2019t biting back a smile. I sit back in my chair, reach down, and quietly unclip my seatbelt. Then, I twist in my seat and look at Seth. He watches the buildings whip past us, completely oblivious to my next attack. I\u2019m not going to do anything, at least not while Jackson and his sister are here, but I enjoy making him feel uncomfortable\u2014as he so often does to me. I put my hand on his knee, and his lips twitch. I trail it further, moving my fingers along like a spider. He peers sideways at me and I smile innocently up at him. As I reach his mid-thigh, Seth unclicks his own seatbelt and I yelp as he grabs me, bunches me up in his strong arms, and pushes me flat against the backseat. He crushes me under his weight to the point of being unable to breathe, and brings his mouth right by my ear.</p><p>\u201cIs this want you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted attention,\u201d I say, breathlessly. \u201cBut this is nice, too.\u201d</p><p>I shiver as his warm tongue traces my earlobe and my head spins\u2014most of it is due to alcohol\u2014that I know, but there\u2019s a small section of my brain that feels like it\u2019s detached and spinning in the opposite direction. That section spins only because he is close. His clean scent filters into me and I drag in an inhale.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot,\u201d he whispers to me, kissing my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cForgot?\u201d</p> <p>Seth lifts himself off me and oxygen floods into my lungs. I use my elbows to push myself into a sitting position and I rest my head against the back of the chair to keep from tipping over. Seth\u2019s expression becomes pinched\u2014his lips pursed into a thin line.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot that we have dinner in an hour.\u201d</p><p>I still. Jackson reaches down and turns on the radio, giving Seth and me a little more privacy. Maddi glances over her shoulder, wide-eyed and sorry. Oh no. He\u2019s right, I did forget. For two weeks he\u2019s reminded me of this dinner... and I freaking forgot!</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I utter, pressing the palm of my hand to my forehead. \u201cI forgot. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he simply says.</p><p>I shift in my seat, moving closer to him. I rake my fingers through my hair and slap my face a few times. Seth grabs my hands in his large, warm ones and pulls them into his lap with a throaty laugh. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sobering myself up,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need. You\u2019re not coming.\u201d He reaches up and strokes my cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home, put you in the shower, and get you to bed. I\u2019ll go alone.\u201d</p><p>I snuggle into his hand before dropping my head to his shoulder. I\u2019m not going to argue. I\u2019m in no state to be walking around in a tight dress and heels. \u201cI really am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are, but don\u2019t be. It\u2019s all right, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, really?\u201d</p><p>He ponders for a second before smiling down at me. \u201cReally, really. I cart you around to all of my events. You deserve a night off.\u201d</p><p>My heart swells. At times, I\u2019m scared of Seth\u2019s reaction to things. It can go either way, and most of the time, his reactions go south, but every now and then he throws me a curve ball. It\u2019s the curve balls I live for. They keep me on my toes and keep him unpredictable... just the way I like it. I grab his face and pull it towards mine before crushing my lips to his. I expect him to pull away, instead, he opens his mouth to me and I dip my tongue inside. My entire body vibrates as his rough hand glides up one of my thighs, inching my fabric higher and higher. I want more. My heart threatens to beat its way out of my chest and I know if I open my eyes and see his face, I\u2019ll burst into flames.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Now?\u201d Maddi complains from the front seat, turning the music up louder. \u201cYou two are gross.\u201d</p><p>Seth nips my bottom lip and takes his delicious mouth away. I pout and snuggle back into him. I want to kiss him forever. I want to feel the rush that his body creates inside of me. When he touches me, I feel like a volcano ready to burst its lid, and when I eventually spill over, my entire being is hot. The heat cannot be quenched, it pours slowly, bubbling and burning everything its wake. It\u2019s an unstoppable force... an inevitable side effect to Seth Marc\u2019s powerful touch.</p><p>And I can\u2019t get enough.</p><p>I open my eyes and cringe away from the bright lights. I feel my entire body weight being suspended above the ground as I\u2019m carried to my room. My head spins worse than it did in the car and if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say Seth was spinning me around and around and around just for the fun of it. I groan and he squeezes me against him with a light chuckle.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><p>My eyelids are heavy, as heavy as stone, and I close my eyes again. The next time I open them, he\u2019s carrying me up the stairs, through the bedroom, and into the bathroom. He puts me down and leans me against the wall, all while keeping a firm grasp on my shoulder. He stares at me with his suddenly bright, brown eyes as I kick off my heels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to undress you, baby, and then put you in the shower, okay?\u201d</p><p>I giggle as a playful feeling bubbles to the surface. \u201cI love it when you talk dirty.\u201d</p><p>He laughs once, his eyes catching mine. \u201cI\u2019m sure you do, but I mean business right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do,\u201d I mock him, doing my best Seth impression. I grip the collar of his shirt and pull him into me. \u201cLet\u2019s have some fun.\u201d</p><p>He crushes his body to mine, presses me against the wall, bringing his face inches from mine. Bees fill my tummy, threatening to tear through the lining and wreak havoc in other parts of my body.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to show you a good time, I\u2019m on a tight schedule tonight and can\u2019t afford to miss dinner.\u201d</p><p>I catch my lip between my teeth and curl my fingers around the hem of his shirt. Between my legs, I pulse in hot, agonizing rhythms and I can\u2019t possibly allow him to leave just yet. \u201cWho cares if you miss dinner... you can have dessert if you stay.\u201d</p><p>His lids grow heavy and his eyes thin, turning me on beyond anything I\u2019ve ever felt before. I can see the gears working behind his eyes\u2014he\u2019s trying to find a way to make it work\u2014to stay with me. His eyes flutter shut and he expels a calming exhale. When he opens them, the lusty slits I like so much are gone.</p><p>\u201cThis dinner is important.\u201d</p><p>My face falls and I sigh, turning around. I guess I can keep it in my pants for one night at least. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll behave. Unzip me.\u201d</p><p>He tenderly brushes my hair out of the way, but in the brief second the very tip of his finger touches the skin on the back of my neck, my entire body is alight with volcanic intensity again. I feel the zip drag down the length of my back and I even hear Seth let out a small exhale as he pushes the pink dress from my body. I drop my forehead against the tiled wall as he runs his thumb down my spine. Up and down, up and down. I smirk.</p><p>\u201cHave you changed your mind, Seth?\u201d I tease, arching my back slightly.</p><p>\u201cDinner is important,\u201d he says again, but I think it\u2019s more for him than me.</p><p>He unclips my bra and it falls to my feet. I wait for a few seconds, expecting his fingers to curl around my underwear, but nothing happens. He doesn\u2019t move to take off my last piece of clothing, so I turn around. His stare quickly drops to my breasts before coming back to my face. I step closer, happy with the fact I manage not to stumble or sway, and take his hands in mine. I draw him in, placing his hands just below my hips, right on the hem of my underwear.</p><p>\u201cOne last piece,\u201d I tell him, smiling devilishly.</p><p>His face pinches together in a slight strain that makes my heart race. \u201cDo you really need my help with this tiny piece of fabric?\u201d</p><p>I nod innocently. \u201cWhat if I fall over?\u201d He doesn\u2019t move and I bite back a smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you afraid you\u2019re not going to be able to leave once I\u2019m naked?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darken as he accepts the challenge. Our eyes remain locked as he hooks his fingers around my panties and pushes them off my hips and over my ass. He crouches low as he gently drags them down my legs to pool with the rest of the fabric on the floor. Almost immediately, his hands fly to my legs and I feel his mouth on my inner thigh, kissing me gently. I moan and lean against the wall as my knees quiver, threatening to buckle. I push my fingers through his hair and he stops kissing to rest his head against my thigh.</p><p>\u201cDinner. I have to go to dinner,\u201d he mumbles before pushing himself to his feet. He turns and opens the shower door.</p><p>\u201cWow. Way to be a tease.\u201d</p><p>With a swift gesture of his hand, I slump my shoulders and step inside. He pushes the shower head out of the way and turns on the tap. The cold water bounces off the tiles and hits my skin, causing goosebumps to erupt. Not long after, the water turns warm and I\u2019m able to stand under the flow. The water feels nice as it beats down on my neck and shoulders. It clears my head and forces off some of the effects of alcohol. The whole time I stand under the stream, my body refuses to ignore Seth\u2019s presence. He\u2019s still standing with the door open, watching me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a dinner to get to?\u201d I ask, biting a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get ready once you\u2019re dry and in bed. I don\u2019t want you slipping and breaking your neck while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>So sweet and caring, as always. I turn and bend down for the shampoo, making Seth swear behind me. \u201cYou enjoy making this really painful for me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I straighten my posture and glance over my shoulder, batting my eyelids. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze shampoo into my hair and massage it into my scalp. I close my eyes as I tilt my head back and let the harsh stream of water blast it from my hair. I do the same with the conditioner, but as I squeeze it into my hand, I squeeze too hard and extra liquid pours out. It drops onto my chest, coating my left breast. Ignoring it, I run the conditioner through my hair and massage the ends before tilting my head back under the water. As I rub the soap from my scalp, I feel his warm large hand close around my breast. I stiffen, lean out of the water and open my eyes. He\u2019s in the shower, clothes and all. The image of his half wet shirt and soaked jeans sends my heart rate sky-rocketing, setting me on fire. He closes his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have an important d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say dinner one more time, I swear to God I\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u201d His eyes open and the branches of honey in his irises brighten, making my insides light up, too. \u201cYou didn\u2019t jump in the shower fully dressed to tell me you\u2019re going to dinner, did you?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and I step closer. As I graze against him, his shirt sticks to my wet body. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be, Seth? Dinner or dessert?\u201d</p> <p>I watch closely as he runs his tongue across his bottom lip, pondering what to do next and I pray he doesn\u2019t choose to go out. I want him to stay right here with me. I wait patiently on the outside for him to say something\u2014anything. He moves abruptly then, pulling his shirt off over his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send Darryl to dinner. He can talk on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>His shirt falls from his hand and hits the shower floor with a heavy slap. His hand finds my hip and I gasp as he tugs me against him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not too drunk?\u201d he asks, brushing a wet strand of hair out of my face.</p><p>I hook my finger under his belt. \u201cI could be sober or completely intoxicated and I\u2019d still want you.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly\u2014painfully\u2014he lowers his mouth to mine. But before he touches, he grins devilishly. \u201cTurn around, put your palms on the wall, and spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>Excitement bubbles inside of me. I must\u2019ve teased him too much. Seth is only controlling and demanding for sex for two reasons\u2014one\u2014we haven\u2019t had sex in a while, or two; I\u2019ve dangled myself in front of him for too long and he can no longer wait. Without any complaints from me, I turn around and do exactly as I\u2019m told.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Seth</p><p>One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Olivia catches her sexy, plump lip between her teeth. Dammit! One... Two... Three... Four... she bends to pick something off of the floor and I see right down her top. Those breasts... the same breasts I had pressed against the shower wall last night. I shake my head and start my count from the beginning. Fuck it. What\u2019s the point? I\u2019ve been counting my steps as I jog on the treadmill in order to distract myself from Olivia. When I work out I work myself up in more ways than one and I\u2019m not about to have her in the shower room, not when Don is set to start his training after me. I was going to ask Olivia not to come to training this morning, but she bounced out of the bathroom looking all cute and shit in her tiny black shorts and loose pink tank top. She likes being here. She likes watching me and feeling like she\u2019s a part of this. It\u2019s nice. I like that it makes her happy and when she\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Darryl shouts from across the room, pulling me from my thoughts. I slow my treadmill down to a stroll and hit stop. I walk it out, until the belt stops moving.</p> <p>\u201cCage, now,\u201d he demands, and with a nod, I step off the treadmill.</p><p>I grab my towel and wipe off my face as Darryl nods to Jackson, who puts on his head gear and gloves and bounds up the stairs into the cage. I cross the gym, stepping over kettle bells and stray bags of sand. I take my gloves, ignoring the head gear as Darryl shakes his head, tossing the gear over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get hit,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>I playfully jab his shoulder and join Jackson in the cage. I shake my arms, loosening the muscles. Jackson is good\u2014easily the hardest sparrer I have. I\u2019ve always told him to join MMA, but he doesn\u2019t fight anymore. He used to. It was our plan to be in the MMAC together, but after all of the shit with Amelia, he lost himself. According to him, he got in too many fights because of her and now the thought of fighting puts him on edge. These days, he helps me achieve my dream while abandoning his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to go easy on you, pretty boy.\u201d Jackson laughs, bringing up his fists. \u201cPlay time is over.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. Pretty boy? That\u2019s awfully rich, coming from him. \u201cGood. It\u2019s about time you step up your training routine. I was starting to get bored.\u201d</p><p>I peer at Olivia, who\u2019s standing by Darryl\u2019s side. They\u2019re engaged in a conversation, her lips are pinched together and she shakes her head, pointing a finger at his chest. The clear determination on her face is sexy... I love it when she\u2019s fierce and I hope she\u2019s telling Darryl off for yesterday. If he has a problem with my training, he should come to me, not go through her. He always goes through her, putting her in tough situations.</p><p>\u201cHands up,\u201d Jackson orders, and I bring my attention back to the cage. I comply. I\u2019m in the mood for sparring today\u2014especially after the interview with Don yesterday. I glance at the large, steel clock. I have forty minutes until Don and his team comes through the doors. I want to be out of here before then. I figure the best way to keep him out of my head is to avoid him and his snarky comments until fight night.</p> <p>I barely settle in my stance before Jackson throws his fists, letting them fly like never before. Most I manage to block, but a stray few connect with my sides. By the end of it, I feel bruised and I ache all over. As I rest my hands on my hips, Jackson pats my back. I zero in on the cut that splits his otherwise smooth lip. I even smirk at it.</p><p>\u201cYou did well.\u201d He smiles and I shrug him off with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI did well? Check my times then come back with a decent compliment.\u201d</p><p>Jackson chuckles and saunters over to speak with Darryl. As he opens the cage and leans out, Olivia squeezes her way in and bounces over to me.</p><p>\u201cYou are amazing!\u201d she exclaims.</p><p>I extend an arm to her and she starts to take off my glove. \u201cNow? Or last night?\u201d</p><p>I watch her cheeks turn pink and she avoids my eyes, biting back a smile. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shy all of a sudden? You weren\u2019t shy last night when you suc\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d she squeals, snapping forward and punching my stomach. I flinch with a laugh and step back, extending my arms to her. Her face turns a sexy, darker shade of pink and it spreads down her neck to her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh again. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m shouting it at the top of my lungs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill!\u201d she whispers harshly. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else to hear.\u201d</p><p>Tormenting her is too much fun. It always has been. I love her reactions and the passion it brings out in her. Feeling rather playful, I say; \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell them anything. They stay in the same hotel, I\u2019m sure they heard you for themselves.\u201d</p><p>Olivia launches forward, abruptly swallowing the distance between us and I dip out of the way. She comes at me again and again, and I let her chase me around the cage. The floor rocks under my weight with every step I take, matching the same tempo as my chest. Soon the other side of the cage is within reach and at the last second, I side step and whip around, grabbing Olivia\u2019s arm. She half squeals, half chokes on a startled laugh as I spin her and push her back against the cage. In my hands, her wrists are tiny and I squeeze them as I press them into wire, making her green eyes sparkle.</p><p>\u201cWill you two knock it off?\u201d Darryl shouts, but we ignore him, lost in our own little bubble.</p><p>\u201cHow do you move your large body so quickly?\u201d she asks, giggling. She doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m hot or sweaty. \u201cSeth Marc: so awesome he even defies the laws of gravity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not without incredible skill, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cIs this the part where you try and seduce me with your said skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to try and do anything. I can say eleven words right now, and have you eating out of the palm of my hand.\u201d</p><p>Her chest rises and falls against mine\u2014a quick pant\u2014one of my favorite movements of hers. I take it she\u2019s accepted my challenge.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember?\u201d I ask, lowering my mouth to her ear. \u201cWhat I did to you against a cage?\u201d</p><p>Her breath is immediately warmer against the side of my neck and I feel the muscles in her wrists contract and relax. I even hear her swallow.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d she whispers eventually, clearing her throat.</p><p>I pull back to look her in the eyes. Her lids are heavy, her lips incredibly moist and I smile triumphantly. \u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not fazed in the slightest,\u201d she lies. I can feel her squeezing her thighs together. \u201cI win.\u201d</p><p>Liar. I tighten my grip on her wrists. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>Her pink lips curl at the corners and she blinks her lids innocently. \u201cHow can you ever prove it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour words might be saying one thing, sweetheart, but your body is singing another.\u201d I grin, glancing down at her chest. \u201cThe next time you want to lie about being turned on, don\u2019t wear a thin sports bra. You\u2019re nipples are cutting through it like it\u2019s nothing.\u201d She glances down and chokes on a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She looks back to me and her face is once again red. \u201cMy own body betrays me.\u201d</p><p>I drop one of her wrists to cup her breast, making her entire body tighten. I let my thumb flick over her concealed nipple and her breath hitches. The smile fades from her face as her eyes lock onto mine. I know the look\u2014the look of pure animalistic desire. Here we are, doing the same thing that started the epic three hour long fuck session last night. Only here I can\u2019t take her from behind, or on her back, or let her sit on top of me. My options are limited... I hate when my options are limited.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re loyal to me because I treat them well.\u201d I say with a subtle smirk.</p><p>Olivia leans off of the cage, bringing her mouth closer. She kisses me\u2014she presses her lips gently against mine\u2014and my entire being stills. No thoughts float through my head, no muscles tense and my stomach doesn\u2019t grumble, all I hear is the steady pound of my heartbeat. Then, her phone rings and all of my previous disturbances come flooding back to me. Training, Don, and food\u2014all of it seems to matter now that her lips aren\u2019t on me. I release her and let her fish through the pocket of her shorts for her phone. She pulls it out, taps the screen, and brings it to her ear.</p><p>\u201cHello? Hi, Maddi...\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms and watch Olivia\u2019s expression for any hint on exactly why my sister is calling her.</p><p>\u201cYou ask him,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know how your brother is.\u201d</p><p>Olivia hands me her phone, but I don\u2019t take it. \u201cWhat does she want?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She pushes the phone into my hands. \u201cTalk to her and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy exhale, I take the phone and bring it to my ear. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d She greets me with exaggerated happiness. Something is definitely up. \u201cHow\u2019s training going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>The line goes quiet and after a few seconds, I hear her click her tongue. \u201cOookay,\u201d She draws out awkwardly. \u201cListen, Kye is playing at this bar\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m going to say.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot say, ask. You\u2019re going to ask if I want to come and watch your boyfriend play at a bar. My answer is no.\u201d</p><p>Surely she had to know that before she asked me. She knows how I feel about Kye. I don\u2019t like him and I never have. He\u2019s a smartass punk in a band who bangs my little sister.</p><p>\u201cHe looks up to you, you know. The least you can do is pretend to care.\u201d</p><p>He looks up to me? No. He\u2019s scared of me because I\u2019ll kick the shit out of him if he hurts my sister. I could\u2019ve told her that... instead, I keep my mouth shut. Telling Maddi she shouldn\u2019t be with Kye only makes her want him more.</p><p>Maddi exhales. \u201cPlease, Seth. It would mean a lot to me if you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever sleep?\u201d I ask, raking my fingers through my hair. She giggles as I peer at Olivia.</p><p>Seriously, though. Maddi is out and about twenty-four seven, I swear. She always has something going on.</p><p>\u201cThis is Vegas, Seth. There is no sleep for the wicked.\u201d</p><p>Olivia excitedly chews on her index fingernail, waiting for my answer. It seems she wants to go\u2014God knows why\u2014she\u2019s still hung over from last night. I made breakfast for her and she almost vomited over the kitchen bench. She raises her eyebrows and I exhale. I\u2019m going to say yes. Dammit. I know I am... I can\u2019t deny Olivia anything.</p><p>I exhale. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>She stifles a squeal. \u201cIt\u2019s at The Cage\u2014the official bar of the MMAC.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cGee, I wonder whose name he dropped to get that gig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it for them... and your name helped a little, thank you.\u201d</p><p>I blow air from my cheeks, shaking my head. \u201cTime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighty-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come, but only for an hour. You know I don\u2019t think that band of his has any talent.\u201d</p><p>Olivia angles her head and her long, chocolate hair falls further over her shoulder. She thinks I\u2019m being unfair, but she\u2019ll see. Kye\u2019s band sucks. Now that I think about it, I don\u2019t even know their name.</p><p>\u201cThanks, bro!\u201d</p><p>I hand Olivia her phone back and she slips it into her pocket. I plant my hands on my hips as she steps closer and circles her arms around my neck. It doesn\u2019t take long for me to cave and wrap mine around her waist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good brother,\u201d Olivia tells me, pulling my forehead down to meet hers. \u201cMaddi loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love her, but I have no idea why she keeps seeing that asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s not that bad,\u201d she insists, kissing me on the mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re just being protective of your sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see tonight. He has these beady, blue eyes that stick to everything with a skirt, so wear jeans, loose ones.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, squeezing me. \u201cYou are unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf by that you mean unbelievably certain a loose top will go good with the loose jeans too, then yeah.\u201d</p> <p>She flicks her hand, still laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t own a pair of loose jeans.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, unable to hide my smile. \u201cYou can borrow a pair of mine.\u201d</p><p>Olivia pulls away from me and heads toward the open door. \u201cCome on, crazy,\u201d she calls over her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, I follow her. I pull off my remaining glove and toss it over my shoulder. Maybe I am a little crazy. Maybe I read into things and assume the worst of people, but it\u2019s usually not without reason, and Kye is a good enough reason to be labeled crazy.</p><p>I down the last mouthful of scotch and Coke as I grit my teeth through the last verse of the song. I like the sound of most genres\u2014rap, rock, jazz, metal and even pop\u2014but I can\u2019t stand the music Kye\u2019s band makes. Scratch that. His band plays well\u2014I like the drums, guitars, and bass\u2014but I don\u2019t like his voice. It\u2019s deep and husky\u2014loud and irritating. Judging by the swaying crowd, I guess I\u2019m the odd one out.</p> <p>Beside me, Olivia bounces along to the beat, completely mesmerized by the band\u2014whose name is \u2018Relentless 21\u2019. Not that it makes any sense at all. She went against my semi-serious suggestion of loose clothing, choosing a tight, white halter neck with a plunging neckline and tight denim short shorts. She looks fucking amazing\u2014absolutely edible\u2014and I\u2019m not the only one thinking it, either. Stares linger on her from every direction and I hate it, but I\u2019m trying to be a better person than I once was, so I ignore them. To make matters worse, she\u2019s not wearing a bra, either, and every time Kye hits a low note, I see her nipples harden against the fabric.</p><p>The Cage is full to the point of bursting at the seams. Maddi says we\u2019re lucky to get a booth in the front, but it seems her and I have two very different perceptions of the word \u2018lucky.\u2019</p><p>The electric guitar strums out the last chord and the song finishes. I almost slump in relief. Maddi and Olivia turn back into the booth, giggling like little school girls.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re amazing!\u201d Olivia gushes, leaning across the table to my sister.</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d She pushes a shot in Olivia\u2019s direction, but Olivia slides it to me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you I\u2019m extremely hung over. No alcohol for me ever again.\u201d</p> <p>As she finishes, Kye announces another set after a five minute break and climbs down off the stage before moving in our direction. I take the shot and slam it back without a second thought. If I have to talk to him, I\u2019m going to need it. Olivia slides closer to me, hooking one of her arms around mine.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not strong enough to carry you home.\u201d</p><p>Kye slips into the booth next to my sister, planting a forceful kiss on her mouth. When he\u2019s finished, his blue eyes flick between Olivia and I.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d he says, deciding to start with me first. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, man.\u201d</p><p>I watch him, drawing out the silence. He has a new hairstyle, short and unruly... it\u2019s slightly better than the long blond fringe, but still just as feminine. Olivia nudges me subtly (but hard) in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too,\u201d I reply bluntly.</p><p>Maddi rolls her eyes and I shake my head at her. She knows I\u2019m not one to fuck around. If I don\u2019t like you, you\u2019ll know straight away. Coincidently, I don\u2019t like Kye. I don\u2019t like the way he looks, the way he talks, or the way he acts, and he knows that.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is your wife?\u201d</p> <p>He turns his ice blue gaze onto Olivia and they rake over her with obvious appreciation. I tap my index finger in an even beat along the top of the table. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Olivia,\u201d she says, taking over and extending her hand to him.</p><p>He takes her hand in his and I find myself glaring at him as he leans forward and kisses the top of her hand. She smiles at him, looking perfectly polite.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware people kiss hands anymore,\u201d I state, not bothering to hide my discomfort.</p><p>Olivia peers sideways at me with warning clear in her eyes, but I ignore it. There are two halves to everything, good and bad, yin and yang\u2014good cop, bad cop. She\u2019s the cute, bubbly one who tends to be a lot nicer than me. She\u2019s better at greetings and being kind to people. I\u2019m shit at first impressions, even worse at being nice when I don\u2019t want to. What more can you want from a better half? I\u2019m egotistical, spoiled and arrogant. She\u2019s kind, generous, and thoughtful. They\u2019re called \u2018better halves\u2019 for a reason, I guess. You can\u2019t have one half that\u2019s worse than you. It\u2019d be a disaster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to finally meet you. Your band is amazing.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, exposing his white teeth. Most new musicians are humble and even blush a little when you compliment them. Not Kye. He takes compliments like he deserves them.</p><p>\u201cWe are, aren\u2019t we?\u201d he replies, his eyes quickly flicking to her chest.</p><p>My sister has never cared when Kye\u2019s caught ogling other women or flirting. She claims he only does it to boost his band, but I know better. I see it on his face. It\u2019s so obvious it might as well be written in permanent marker for all to see. He\u2019s untrustworthy and he\u2019s going to fuck over my little sister any day now. I\u2019ve told her a million times that I know guys like him\u2014I used to be just like him\u2014but she refuses to listen. Blinded by love. It\u2019s such a stupid thing and yet we all fall for it at one point or another. Kye reminds me of Blade... maybe that\u2019s another reason my distaste for him has grown over the last few months.</p><p>\u201cMarried now, eh?\u201d He flicks his eyebrows at me. \u201cYou did all right for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Olivia gives out a nervous laugh and my eyebrows draw together. \u201cI know I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be seedy.\u201d Maddi giggles, shoving him with her shoulder. \u201cSeth will kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Kye slings his arm over the back of the booth and relaxes. He seems pretty content. He seems to believe I won\u2019t pull him across the table and smash his face in.</p><p>\u201cSeth wouldn\u2019t kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>I pluck a quarter of a lemon from the bowl in the middle of the table. I need something to keep my hands busy. \u201cCareful,\u201d I warn, managing to hold a bored tone in my voice. \u201cI just might.\u201d</p><p>Of course, he laughs it off like it\u2019s no big deal\u2014like I\u2019m playing some kind of game. I don\u2019t play games... not outside of my bedroom, anyway. I bring the lemon between my lips and suck in the juice. It\u2019s sour\u2014very sour\u2014but I manage to keep a straight face.</p><p>\u201cI gotta head back to the stage, but I\u2019m down for going out afterwards if you guys are. Maddi can sort it out.\u201d He plants a quick kiss on Maddi\u2019s head and leaves before Olivia or I can protest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going out,\u201d I tell Maddi and she nods, knowing not to push her luck. She already got me here... she should be counting her lucky stars.</p><p>Shortly after Kye\u2019s departure, Maddi slips from the booth to give out business cards and free t-shirts. I watch her as she mingles with the crowd. The band is lucky to have my sister. They wouldn\u2019t be able to get half of the gigs they pull without the help of her pretty face.</p><p>I drop the lemon skin on the table and exhale. I\u2019m about ready to go now. I\u2019ve had one too many drinks and there\u2019s a familiar tingle in my stomach that spreads to my hands... it\u2019s the same feeling I get when I always drink, the feeling that urges me to punch or fuck something. My head spins and my mouth is numb, but Olivia is having way too much fun to want to go home now. We\u2019ve only been here an hour and she seems interested enough in the band to want to see the rest of their set. Unfortunately for her, I don\u2019t think I have the stomach to sit through another song.</p><p>I shift closer to Olivia, knowing exactly how to get her attention. I rest my arm along the back of the booth and run my index finger in soothing circles over her shoulder. Her posture straightens and she angles her head, her lips pursed as she tries hard to come off as unimpressed.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing and it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows, feigning shock. \u201cMe? I\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d</p><p>Olivia leans in close\u2014so close I feel her breath on my ear. Phantom pins and needles flood the tips of my fingers and burn with the urge to touch her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you seduce me into leaving. As of this very moment\u2014and for the remainder of the night\u2014I\u2019m declaring my body a no go zone for you, Mr. Marc.\u201d</p><p>I pull back, smiling. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t resist me even if you tried.\u201d</p><p>Her brows arch. She hates it when I challenge her. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>I nod, feeling as confident as ever. She can\u2019t resist me, we\u2019ve played this game too many times and I still come out on top\u2014pun intended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite capable of resisting you.\u201d She shifts in her seat, turning her back to me. \u201cJust you watch.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring me, she watches the band. I lean toward her and brush her chocolate hair over one shoulder. Her scent\u2014the scent of grape body wash mixing with pomegranate shampoo, filters in through my nose. My brain rolls in my skull again and another urge begins to build in the pit of my stomach\u2014whether the urge is one of arousal or the acceptance of a challenge is beyond me. I drag my lip over her shoulder, drawing closer to the base of her neck. I feel goosebumps erupt over her skin and I smile against her soft flesh.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d I say, circling her waist with my arm. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, but otherwise ignores me. I pull her back, almost into my lap. I don\u2019t like being ignored. It\u2019s a strange feeling, one I\u2019m not used to.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou think I\u2019m asking for your permission?\u201d</p><p>I drop my mouth back to her shoulder, all while holding her tightly by the waist\u2014her back flush against my torso. She feels good and I would be as hard as a rock if it weren\u2019t for Kye\u2019s shitty voice in the background. Olivia squirms in my grasp. She should know better... the more she reacts, the further I want to go. I slip my hand underneath her shirt and glide it across her firm, warm navel. I feel her muscles clench and relax\u2014tighten and soften\u2014all in sync with my lips. After a few small eternities pass me by, she turns her head, looking at me from over her shoulder. Her mouth calls to mine, drawing me nearer, like a moth to a lamp. Her lips graze the corner of mine and she drags an inhale through her nose, before expelling it slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou win,\u201d she utters. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>I fight a cocky smile. A suggestive brush of my lips was all it took for victory to be mine.</p><p>\u201cIn the shower room and now in a public bar? Do you two ever stop?\u201d</p><p>I freeze as Don\u2019s \u2018seedy\u2019 voice stops her lips in their tracks. Underneath my hand, Olivia\u2019s stomach tenses. \u201cI half expect to see a tribe of kids following you two around by how frequently you get it on.\u201d</p><p>She slips from my lap with a heavy exhale. I angle my body back into the table and grab the nearest coaster. I distract myself from his ugly face by tapping it to the beat of the music I don\u2019t like. I can\u2019t leave the bar now... Don will think I\u2019m running from him.</p><p>\u201cAlways a pleasure to see you, Don,\u201d Olivia deadpans, peering around him and towards the band.</p><p>\u201cFun fact,\u201d he says, ignoring his obvious dismissal.</p><p>I look at him in his white tank top and baggy black jeans. He\u2019s a grade-A douchebag, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard my name and \u2018pleasure\u2019 in the same sentence.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth and crush the coaster in the palm of my hand. My imagination goes rampant as I picture myself kicking the crap out of him. I imagine dragging him over to the stage and throwing him at Kye, too. What\u2019s the saying? Two birds with one stone?</p><p>Olivia laughs once. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t count when you say it to yourself. Now go, we\u2019re trying to watch the band.\u201d</p><p>With a flick of his palms and a devilish grin in my direction, he strolls over to the bar with one of his boys in tow. It takes a lot of effort on my part to sit here and not talk to him. I want to talk to him\u2014to chastise him for being a loser, for bringing nothing to the sport but cowardice and dishonesty. If someone like Don is what the MMAC admires, then why do I strive so hard to be a part of it? I\u2019m not an angel, but I\u2019m straight forward. What you see is what you get. I don\u2019t try to be nice or play people against each other... Matt Somers needs to realize that I\u2019m a grown ass man, not a child he can manipulate.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d Olivia mutters when Don isn\u2019t looking.</p><p>I shake my head. I can\u2019t stomach the thought of Don believing he affects me. I need to stay here... to prove to myself that he can\u2019t get into my head. Before Olivia\u2019s father passed away, he told me that \u2018no one can bother you unless you let them.\u2019 So I tell myself over and over; Don doesn\u2019t bother me. He doesn\u2019t bother me. I tear the coaster into tiny pieces and drop it onto the table. I inhale, ignoring the way the room spins, then exhale. If Don stays on his side of the bar and away from me and Olivia, I\u2019ll be fine. But if he so much as takes a single step closer to us, I won\u2019t be responsible for my actions.</p><p>Olivia</p><p>Relentless 21 is amazing. Their music is fast and loud\u2014the lyrics relevant and motivating... Seth isn\u2019t enjoying it as much as I am, however. I think it has more to do with the fact the lead singer, Kye, is with his sister rather than the music. I wonder if Seth is threatened by Kye? I mean, Kye is no Seth, but he\u2019s easily one of the hottest guys I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014if not a little too pretty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bright lights shine down on him, making the thin coat of sweat on his forehead glisten. His blue eyes scan the rather large crowd and every now and then, his lip will twitch with the beginnings of a smile. I\u2019ve always enjoyed watching live bands play. I like the way they all wear their passion on their face\u2014much like Seth when he\u2019s in the cage. Nothing in this world is as striking or as captivating as Seth when he\u2019s focused. Right now, he seems focused on ignoring Don by picking apart an innocent coaster. I can feel his tension radiating off him and he\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s bothered by Don\u2019s sudden appearance. You know that heavy feeling that presses into the pit of your stomach when someone you don\u2019t like is in the same room as you? That\u2019s what I have, and Seth is undoubtedly feeling the same way.</p><p>A loud, sarcastic laugh catches my attention and I allow my gaze to flick between the stage and the bar, where Don is chatting to a less than impressed Maddi. She stands in front of him with her hand on her semi-exposed hip. She looks great in her tight, black tank top and denim skinny jeans\u2014Don clearly thinks so, too. He reaches out and pinches the thick strand of straight, black hair that drapes down her chest and curls over her breasts. She quickly swats him away, but I see the telltale blush that heats her neck and blushes her cheeks. My brows furrow as Maddi shakes her head at him. Her lips move fast as she tells him off and I bite back a smile. She pushes past him and rolls her eyes at me as she passes by before disappearing into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWould you look at that?\u201d Seth says, shifting in the booth. \u201cMy sister does have a brain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has good taste in men.\u201d</p><p>Seth scoffs. \u201cLet\u2019s not go as far as to claim Don and Kye as men.\u201d</p><p>I choke on a laugh. \u201cDon, maybe not, but Kye is all right.\u201d</p><p>Seth surveys me, his eyes thinning. I guess I hit a nerve. \u201cYou think Kye\u2019s attractive?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, suddenly regretting what I said. \u201cSure. I mean, he\u2019s definitely not unattractive.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs once, nudging me in the ribs with his elbow. I flinch, leaning away from him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He pauses, all traces of amusement gone. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>Since I started this conversation, I might as well finish it. I\u2019m in too far to say \u2018just kidding\u2019 and hope he lets it go. \u201cOf course I am. Are we looking at the same Kye? He\u2019s hot as hell.\u201d</p><p>Seth blinks at me in that adorable way only he can before he grips my shoulders and pulls me into him. I eat a mouthful of his shirt and some of his shoulder as he squeezes me tightly against his torso. His body vibrates under my face as his laugh fills my ears. I push off of him, only managing to separate his body from mine by an inch or two. I\u2019m glad he finds it so funny.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you,\u201d he says between gasps of air. It pricks at me, slowly spiking my annoyance levels. \u201cHim? Really?\u201d</p><p>He laughs a little more, pushing me higher and higher.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I demand. \u201cHe has dirty blond hair, bright blue eyes, and a killer smile. Ask any girl in here and they\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>His laugh fades and his eyes flare as his brows draw closer. He\u2019s jealous... I can see him imperceptibly working his jaw. \u201cIs that what you want? Blond hair and blue eyes?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve had my fun with him now. Seth\u2019s not the kind of person I like to see jealous. I\u2019ve seen him get all King Kong \u2018mine\u2019 type of jealous with Mason and Blade and it wasn\u2019t pretty. Besides, it\u2019d be unfair of me to release a jealous Seth on Kye when he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, and Seth is just looking for an excuse to destroy Kye. Anyone can see that.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll take funny and annoying over hot as hell any day.\u201d</p><p>I wink and he pulls me in again, squeezing me relentlessly against his stone-like body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as funny as you think you are,\u201d he tells me and I can hear a smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p> <p>I open my mouth to protest, but Maddi appears out of nowhere, planting her hands on the table. \u201cDo either of you want a drink?\u201d</p><p>Seth releases me and I sit upright again, pulling my shirt back down over my tummy. My stomach churns at the thought of drinking alcohol so I shake my head, making yet another mental note to never touch another drop. Ever.</p><p>\u201cRum and Coke,\u201d Seth says, bunching up the remnants of his coaster and squeezing them in his large hand.</p><p>With a nod of her head, Maddi turns from the table and stalks toward the bar. As she passes Don, she keeps her head down and angled away from him, but that does nothing to deter him. She could be wearing spikes and escorting a Rottweiler on a chain and he\u2019d still have a go at her. I\u2019ve come to learn that Mr. Don Russell isn\u2019t exactly the smartest man on the planet.</p><p>As she steps by, he hooks his finger through one of her jean loopholes and tugs her into him. As soon as it happens, I\u2019m startled to my feet. The entire booth rocks as Seth leaps from his seat. I turn into him, blocking his path. Thankfully, the only way he\u2019s getting out of here is through me and I\u2019m not about to step out of the way.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d he growls, not taking his eyes off Don and his sister.</p><p>I shake my head and extend my palms to him. I bring them close to his chest, careful not to touch. \u201cRelax. I\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>His intense, volcanic eyes flick onto me and my heart slams into my ribcage over and over. \u201cLike hell you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I tell him, my voice low and stern. \u201cI said I\u2019ll handle it. I\u2019m going to go over there and let Maddi know that we\u2019re leaving. If she has any problems with Don, I\u2019m sure Kye can handle it.\u201d</p><p>Kye can\u2019t handle it. I know that. Don is at least twice his size and I doubt Kye\u2019s pretty face has ever taken a decent punch before. I may hate what Don stands for, but he has heavy hands, I\u2019ll give him that. Seth clenches and unclenches his fists as he ponders what I said. My heart pounds in my ears like a bass drum. I\u2019m nowhere near big enough to stand between Seth and Don, and I can\u2019t stop Seth even if I try, but I\u2019m hoping he has his wits about him. I know he\u2019s been drinking and I know he gets a little amped up when he drinks, but he needs to listen to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you thirty seconds and then I\u2019m coming over.\u201d He throws his torn coaster across the table and it scatters as he drops back into his seat and folds his arms tightly over his chest. Not wasting a second, I quickly make my way over to the bar as Maddi tries to slap her way out of his hold.</p><p>\u201cMaddi, can you tell your brother to go get the car. It\u2019s getting late and I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019s seedy green gaze falls onto me, and with a victorious smile, he immediately releases Maddi.</p><p>\u201cThanks, asshole,\u201d she mutters at him before slipping away and over to Seth.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d I snap at Don, planting my hands on my hips. \u201cYou can\u2019t go around tugging people wherever you want.\u201d</p><p>I almost laugh at the idiocy of telling a fighter not to tug people into them. They all do it. They all break the personal bubble rule without so much as a sorry. With most, it\u2019s sexy, but with Don, it\u2019s the complete opposite.</p><p>\u201cJealous of baby Marc, sweetheart?\u201d He pinches the fabric of my shirt and pulls me closer, exposing the bare skin on my belly. There he goes with that tugging shit again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the whole time I do her I\u2019ll be thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>I snatch my shirt back, making space between us again and I even manage it without looking helpless.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you not to touch me?\u201d</p><p>He smirks. \u201cUntil you finally beg me to touch you.\u201d</p><p>I snort and roll my eyes. I wonder if he can hear how stupid he sounds? \u201cWhen hell freezes over, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be that long. Tonight works for me, too.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re out of your fucking mind.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my heel. I\u2019m done bantering with him, it gets me nowhere. He exists only to piss people off and he doesn\u2019t see it, but he\u2019s a pawn in Matt Somers\u2019 game to increase his own bank.</p><p>I barely make one step before his large, warm hand snatches my wrist.</p><p>\u201cDon!\u201d I hear Seth shout from the table. I also hear Maddi begging Seth to sit down. A pounding in my ears intensifies, completely drowning out Kye\u2019s unique voice. I have to get out of this and fast.</p><p>\u201cYou keep playing this game, baby, but I know you\u2019re into me. I can feel the sexual tension radiating from your tight little body.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously never experienced sexual tension.\u201d</p><p>Bickering with Don is not grounds to claim sexual tension. I\u2019ve had sexual tension, and trust me when I say this is nothing. When Seth and I were getting to know each other, that was sexual tension. Although I hated him, I wanted to eat him. I wanted to wrap my legs around him and lick him from head to toe. It\u2019s not like that with Don... with him my insides dry up at the thought of his mouth anywhere near mine.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so special, don\u2019t you?\u201d he snaps, releasing my arm. \u201cYou think that you\u2019re so damn special because you\u2019re married to that\u2014that asshole.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cLet me be the first to tell you this, you\u2019re not special. You\u2019re a whore, like everybody else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whore?\u201d I almost laugh.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou are nothing but a gold-digging, cock sucking whor\u2014\u201d</p><p>I clench my jaw and swing at him. I swing with so much force my fist aches as I scrunch it. When I connect with his face, pain shoots through my hand and straight to my elbow. In the distance, I hear Maddi cheer. I want to scream, to kick him for hurting my hand, but I figure it\u2019ll look more badass if I just grit my teeth and bear it. I hit him right in the nose and he quickly shields it with his hand, groaning like a little bitch.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I spit at him through gritted teeth.</p><p>I want to shout more things at him, call him all of the horrible names I\u2019ve been wanting to call him for months, but strong arms seize me before I get the chance. They pull me into a hard, laughing body and I can\u2019t see as I\u2019m hoisted up and carried away. I want to see Don\u2019s face\u2014I want to see the damage I did. That should teach him not to disrespect another woman. Instantly, there\u2019s a swirling mass of guilt in my stomach, but my brain counters it. I\u2019ve put up with a lot of his shit\u2014a lot more than I should have\u2014and there\u2019s only so much sexual harassment one girl can take before she stands up for herself. That\u2019s what I did... I stood up for myself. I clasp my hand and manage to pull my face from Seth\u2019s chest. He beams down at me, smiling widely. All traces of his previous anger are gone, replaced by absolute happiness and pride.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>I drop my head against his chest. I hit Don... in the face. I\u2019m not a violent person... in fact, I hated violence of all kinds once upon a time. I\u2019m different now... and hitting Don in the face was way too easy for my liking.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything as Seth carries me from the club, and I\u2019m unable to say goodbye to Maddi or thank Kye for the performance. It\u2019s all for the greater good, I guess. I can\u2019t imagine my night getting any better sitting in there with Don a few feet away.</p><p>Outside the air is cool on my burning cheeks. It gathers my scattered thoughts, stacks them and neatly files them away in the \u2018deal with it tomorrow\u2019 drawer. All I want now is comfort and reassurance from my husband. I\u2019m not a bad person... and I\u2019m not a whore, either.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should send you into the cage for me. Killer swing you\u2019ve got there, lady.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, wincing as I squeeze my hand. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that... that was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? Don got what was coming to him.\u201d Seth squeezes me harder against his body. \u201cYou did me proud, and let\u2019s face it, he was going to get a smack in the nose tonight regardless. He\u2019s lucky it was by you and your cute hands.\u201d</p><p>People stare as he carries me down the street, but I don\u2019t mind. We\u2019ve been seen like this too many times to be embarrassed now. Don\u2019s words weigh on my chest and I feel stupid, mulling over it. I shouldn\u2019t put so much stock in his words. It is Don, after all.</p><p>\u201cDo you see me differently now?\u201d I ask, watching the dark concrete. \u201cNow that we\u2019re together... am I a different person than the girl you met?\u201d</p><p>Deep down, it\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been pondering for a while, but I didn\u2019t think anything of it until Don called me out. When I think about it, and I mean really, really, think about it, I feel different... Seth has made me different. He\u2019s made me crave things I never really did before him. Is there a line you can\u2019t cross, even when you\u2019re married?</p><p>\u201cYes, I see you differently,\u201d he says and my stomach ties itself up in knots. \u201cI no longer see you as that weak girl everyone took advantage of.\u201d He kisses me on the top of my head, sending pins and needles through my body down to the tips of my toes. \u201cYou\u2019re a badass, independent woman who knows exactly what she wants and how to get it. You\u2019ve changed, but you\u2019re still you. You\u2019re still just as good, just as beautiful, and just as amazing as you were when I met you.\u201d</p><p>I fight a smile and he squeezes me. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling, I let my head fall firmly against his chest. He smells good, like a spring afternoon in the woods after a long night of rain. I cringe inwardly. Thank God thoughts are internal because that has to be the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever thought in my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happens between you and me when we\u2019re alone stays between you and me,\u201d he continues. \u201cI would never think any less of you no matter what you do to please me. I wouldn\u2019t say a word\u2014even if you wanted to play with handcuffs and whips.\u201d</p><p>I snort. That\u2019s a big call coming from Seth. He\u2019s not into kink. \u201cYou\u2019d put up with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you happy, I\u2019ll take a lashing on the ass for breakfast every morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d Laughing, I lift my sore hand. \u201cOn a more serious note, I think I broke something.\u201d</p><p>All amusement fades from his features. \u201cCan you move it?\u201d</p><p>I close my fist and wince before opening it again. \u201cI can, but it\u2019s extremely tender.\u201d I smirk. \u201cHe really does have a thick skull.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring my joke, he puts me down on the sidewalk right next to our car and gently takes my hand in his. For a guy who\u2019s downed as many drinks as Seth has, he\u2019s impressively still.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d I hiss as he bends it backwards. I snatch my hand away, cradling it against my chest. \u201cI told you it was sore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, give it back. I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p><p>I inch forward then hesitate. \u201cYou\u2019ll be gentle?\u201d</p><p>His lips curl a little at the corners and he nods. I slowly extend my sore hand to him and watch his movements closely for any sign of impending pain. He drags his finger tips over the top of my hand. Like he promised, his thick, callused fingers move lightly and I barely feel it. In their wake, trails of tingles dance over the surface of my skin and my entire body hums. One by one, he bends my fingers, all while keeping his intense eyes on my face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in your hand. It\u2019s in your wrist.\u201d His voice is low and smooth as he slides his fingers over the back of my hand. Pain flares the lower he gets, and as his fingers wrap around my wrist, I wince and pull back again.</p><p>\u201cWe should get it looked at to make sure it\u2019s not serious. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s broken, but a fracture is possible\u2014or a sprain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fracture?\u201d I spit, tilting my head to the sky and running my fine hand over my face. \u201cI\u2019m being punished.\u201d</p> <p>Seth scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019re not being punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. This is why you shouldn\u2019t assault people.\u201d I look at him. He\u2019s watching me\u2014all of his features alight with amusement. \u201cKarma has always liked the way I taste. She can\u2019t get enough.\u201d</p><p>His lips curve into a cheeky smile. \u201cWell, it\u2019s good to know Karma and I have one thing in common.\u201d</p><p>Of course he went there.</p><p>\u201cSex jokes?\u201d I deadpan. \u201cYou want to crack sex jokes right now?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, I\u2019m frustrated. I\u2019m frustrated in myself. I know better. I know that violence is wrong. I know that violence doesn\u2019t solve anything... and yet, I punched Don in his stupid, fucking face. I don\u2019t care how irritating he is, I shouldn\u2019t have put my hands on him. My dad always told me that no one has the right to put their hands on anyone without permission and I hate that I disregarded his advice so quickly.</p><p>Seth shifts his weight and leans back against the car. \u201cDon\u2019t be so uptight, O. You punched Don in the face. The universe fucking loves you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I sigh, tapping my index finger along my arm. \u201cI did the universe a favor.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m sure even Karma has a small list of people she\u2019d punch in the face. Seth pushes off of the car. \u201cLet me take you home where you\u2019re safe and won\u2019t have the urge to punch anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Automatically, I glower. \u201cExcept Jackson. I swear if he brings another girl home tonight, I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to fill a void,\u201d Seth interrupts. \u201cIt\u2019s how he copes. I\u2019m sure Selena is doing the same thing.\u201d</p><p>She isn\u2019t. I spoke to Selena this morning. She\u2019s a freaking wreck. I\u2019ve never witnessed Selena cry over a boy until now, and the worst part is, she won\u2019t even tell me. She refuses to open up about Jackson. His personal life is the one thing Selena can keep to herself. It\u2019s the one thing that won\u2019t slip past her lips. Jackson has been crashing on one of our couches. Jackson has also been banging girls on all of our couches, the kitchen benches, the floor, the stairs and the spare bathroom. He\u2019s probably done the deed on the balconies and in my bed, too.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Selena.\u201d Not entirely. \u201cWe need privacy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he simply says.</p><p>Seth doesn\u2019t have the same issue with Jackson as I do. Mostly because he\u2019s not too fond of Selena, but also because he\u2019s used to Jackson and the way he does things. Seth sleeps through all of the begging, spanking, and eardrum bursting orgasms. Not me. Before Seth, I lived alone in a small apartment. It was quiet, it was peaceful, and it was refreshing.</p><p>I cradle my arm and step closer to him. \u201cIf we ever have a break or an argument, don\u2019t do to me what he\u2019s doing to Selena... I don\u2019t think I could ever come back from that.\u201d</p><p>He frowns, and it\u2019s a frown that absolutely terrifies me. \u201cDon\u2019t ever assume our relationship is like theirs. We\u2019re different. You and I fix things when they break, we don\u2019t damage them further... that\u2019s what they do. They break things beyond repair. They\u2019re not like us. Our love is healthy, theirs is...\u201d He pauses as he ponders the right word. \u201cPoisonous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoisonous?\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on between them, but whatever it is, it can\u2019t be healthy.\u201d</p><p>I nod ever so slightly and Seth expels a heavy breath. \u201cAnyway, if Jackson is home, he\u2019ll be able to tell us what\u2019s wrong with your hand. I\u2019ve inched too far past the \u2018tipsy\u2019 mark to make sense of anything. In the meantime, support it and keep it straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight? How?\u201d</p><p>He glances around and I pray that it\u2019s not to find a stick that he can tape to my arm. Giving up, he glances at his own chest and pauses.</p><p>\u201cBut I like this one...\u201d He sighs before pulling his shirt over his head.</p><p>Jesus. Even in the dim light his body looks fantastic. It pools in all of the right places, heating all of my \u2018right places.\u2019 Then he pulls on the collar, tearing the perfectly fine shirt in two. My mouth drops open.</p><p>\u201cReally, Seth?\u201d I gasp. \u201cYou had to rip your shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I give him my arms and he tightly wraps his shirt around my hand, wrist, and arm. I clench my teeth together every time he tugs a little too hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being romantic,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cRomantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ripped one of my favorite shirts for you. That\u2019s pretty fucking romantic, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</p><p>He ties a knot at my elbow. \u201cMost men give jackets or umbrellas to their girls, but they always take it back when it\u2019s over. I\u2019m giving you my shirt and now there\u2019s absolutely no way of me getting it back. I think it\u2019s extremely selfless and sickeningly romantic.\u201d He ties a second knot and pulls his hands away. \u201cI want you to keep your hand still and straight until we get home.\u201d Seth strokes my cheek. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ve had a lot to drink, so you\u2019re going to have to drive.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. \u201cMe? Drive? My hand is busted.\u201d</p><p>He nods, rubbing the back of his neck and smiling comfortingly at me. It\u2019s not convincing, he looks terrified.</p><p>\u201cI know your hand is busted, but you\u2019re our only option. You didn\u2019t drink. I drank too much and that makes you the designated driver.\u201d</p><p>I avoid driving in Vegas at all costs. Shit is crazy out there on the roads\u2014especially at night. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m scared too, but if you keep your eyes on the road, stick to the speed limit, and try really hard not to crash, we\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>He pulls the keys from his pocket and hands them to me. I take them with a groan and drag myself around to the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>It\u2019s going to be a long drive home.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Seth</p><p>I let the hot water gush over my fingertips before it splashes into the bath. Bubbles touch my forearm, threatening to fall over the edge of the porcelain tub. Olivia needs a bath\u2014a nice, relaxing bath. If dealing with Don wasn\u2019t enough, when we got home she was lucky enough to see Jackson receiving a blow job against the kitchen bench. I laughed when I realized he didn\u2019t make it to a couch or a bed\u2014that has to be some kind of record for him. While I found it amusing, Olivia was mortified. With a glare in my direction, she stormed up the stairs and slammed the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cYou said you lived alone, asshole!\u201d the girl shouted, wiping her mouth and drawing herself to full height. She was tall, lean (easily a nine) and embarrassed as all hell. Jackson opened his mouth to explain, but she left before he got the chance to. I looked away as Jackson fixed himself up and placed all pieces of flesh back behind fabric. When I glanced back at him he nodded, reading my expression. It wasn\u2019t an angry expression. It was neutral, pleading even. Whether he liked it or not, what he did was disrespectful to Olivia, and although he was my best friend, my loyalties lay with my wife. I had to make it right with her. I\u2019m the man of the house, the husband\u2014fuck it\u2014I\u2019m the king, and I had to make my queen happy.</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d He exhaled, reading my mind. \u201cI\u2019ll crash at Darryl\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Which brings me to now.</p><p>Jackson has taken his business elsewhere, but Olivia is still wound up and pacing around the bedroom, trying to decide if she should call Selena or not. Naturally, I advised her against it. She didn\u2019t like it, not one bit.</p><p>I shut the bath off and relax into the armchair. I dragged an armchair into the bathroom from the reading corner in the bedroom. It really hurts my ass to sit on the tiles and Olivia\u2019s baths can take anywhere from fifteen minutes to three hours. I like to watch her while she bathes. Don\u2019t ask me why, I just do.</p><p>At the sound of the bath shutting off, Olivia strolls into the bathroom. Her hair is disheveled, her bottom lip puffy and red from biting it too much.</p><p>\u201cI should tell her.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and Olivia\u2019s shoulders square. She\u2019s ready to contest anything I say to defend Jackson, but honestly, I couldn\u2019t give a shit about Jackson or Selena right now. Their relationship is exactly that, theirs. I want no part of it.</p><p>I relax in the armchair and tap my knee. \u201cForget them. Let me take a look at your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget them? Selena is my\u2014\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes and she purses her lips together. With the smallest nod, she steps forward and drops onto my lap. I tear off the makeshift bandage and toss it away as I take her soft, tiny hand in mine. Already I notice how swollen it is. It\u2019s not too bad, but a hell of a lot bigger than her other hand. She sighs as I run my fingers over the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d I ask, resting my cheek against her shoulder. I bend her wrist and this time, she doesn\u2019t wince or pull away.</p><p>\u201cNot as much as it did before,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a sprain, but we\u2019ll have Darryl check it out in the morning just to be safe.\u201d I poke her in the side and she jerks away from me. Smiling, I say, \u201cClothes off. Your bath is waiting.\u201d</p><p>With an eager smirk, Olivia slides from my lap and pulls at the knot behind her neck that holds up her shirt. The ties fall along with the shirt, exposing her perfect breasts.</p><p>\u201cStare much?\u201d She giggles, turning away from me. I drag my gaze down her spine and over her hips as she curls her fingers underneath the hem of her shorts. She pushes them down her legs, taking her underwear with it. Her whole body is exposed to me and I admire her new softness. Her stomach is softer, as are her thighs and her ass. Her curvier body only enhances my attraction. She\u2019s put on weight because I make her full, wholesome meals and have banned those shitty \u2018snack bars\u2019 from the kitchen. I\u2019ve always been a fan of soft, feminine figures and now I have one all to myself. She smiles sweetly at me as she turns and heads for the bath. As she passes my chair, I snag her waist and pull her into me. With a squeal, she falls into my lap. I immediately notice how her soft skin feels like silk against mine.</p><p>\u201cYour bath is waiting,\u201d she mocks me with her best Seth impersonation.</p><p>I smile against her skin as I nip her shoulder, moving my lips along the top of her back and into the base of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI suddenly feel like getting a little dirty first.\u201d</p><p>She shivers on my lap, sending an intense surge of arousal through my body. Of their own accord, my fingers dance along her thigh, moving inwards, until the tips of my fingers touch the top of her bare core. She inhales sharply and I catch her sight in the reflection of the shower door. Her big, green eyes widen and she catches my hand, stilling it against her flesh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think here\u2019s a good place to do that.\u201d Her voice is breathless\u2014needy\u2014and I wonder if she can hear it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to deprive me of watching now, are you?\u201d</p><p>She catches her lip between her teeth, clearly uncomfortable with the idea. I lick her shoulder, keeping my eyes on hers and watch as they narrow into lusty slits. That\u2019s all the coaxing it takes for her hand to slip away, allowing me to move and touch her freely again. I shift my position, pulling her legs apart with my knees. Her whole body tenses while her breathing deepens. She looks away from the reflection, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m stuck, completely mesmerized by the scene\u2014by her. My cock is hard, ready to burst through my zipper and take what it wants\u2014what I want. But this isn\u2019t about me... What I\u2019m about to do to her isn\u2019t about me and what I want. It\u2019s about her\u2014about relaxing her and winding her down after a stressful night. Even with her legs apart, her lips stay close together. Everything is tight and in place\u2014a mere slit in an otherwise smooth, bare portion of flesh. I run my fingers over her clit, moving my rough pads around her sweet bundle of nerves. A few minutes in, her lips part as she expels heady breaths and her hips rock to the same tempo as my fingers. Her eyes are closed, her head against my shoulder and angled away from the reflection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she mutters, her voice trembling.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take my eyes off of you even if I tried.\u201d I kiss her neck, the spot right by her ear. \u201cYou are fucking perfection, O.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d I chuckle under my breath. \u201cI want to be in you so bad.\u201d I catch her ear between my teeth, making her gasp. \u201cI want to fuck your perfect little body and I want to watch it all.\u201d She smirks, catching her lower lip. \u201cI want to see your tits bounce and your legs quiver while I\u2019m buried deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes snap open, immediately zeroing in on mine in the reflection. I see it then\u2014all traces of her previous discomfort gone. All I see now is darkness\u2014the darkness that comes over her when she wants nothing more than to please me.</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d She breathes, shivering. \u201cI want to see it, too.\u201d</p><p>I spring off the couch, bringing Olivia up with me. I force her forward until she\u2019s pinned against the shower door. Her breath fogs the glass as quick, heated pants fall from her lips. She arches her back under the weight of my body as I press hard against her.</p><p>\u201cHurry up,\u201d she moans.</p> <p>\u201cAlways impatient,\u201d I tease, planting a kiss on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou know I am when it comes to you, Seth.\u201d</p><p>I lower my hands to the button of my jeans and pop it. I quickly push my jeans down my legs, without taking my body from her, and grip her hips. I manage to step out of my jeans and pull her back to the couch without stumbling. In one fluid movement, I have her sitting on my lap again and I\u2019m back to watching her in the reflection of the glass. My eyes catch hers, and this time, she doesn\u2019t look away. Her eyes are gleaming, pleading for me to touch her, so I run my fingers over her taut belly and slowly snake them between her legs. I groan as her wetness coats my fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking wet.\u201d</p><p>She nods, letting out a desperate moan. I grip her perfect breast with my free hand, tweaking her nipple as I bite at her neck. Olivia arches into me, finally letting her stare fall from the reflection as her head falls back against my shoulder. Her movements are ones of complete surrender and I happily accept it. I drink it all in as if this is our last moment and tomorrow doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>Olivia</p><p>Pleasure exudes from my core and wraps around my organs. It curls up my spine, wrapping tightly around each vertebrae and seizes my chest. I can feel his hard length against my backside as Seth\u2019s thick, rough fingers slide with skill over every inch of exposed flesh. I don\u2019t look but it\u2019s not because I\u2019m shy. I don\u2019t look because I\u2019m scared to peek at his devastatingly handsome face in fear of this whole thing disappearing. I\u2019m afraid he will disappear. Poof. All gone in a puff of smoke and I\u2019m back where I started... in a small apartment with no purpose, no real ambitions and no one who loves me as much as Seth does.</p> <p>Another pulse of white hot pleasure jolts through my body and my breath hitches in my throat. His mouth explores my neck. Inch by inch his lips move as if they\u2019re singling out every pore and hair follicle. He really does know how to make a girl feel special, as if every cell in her body should be appreciated for merely existing. His fingers interchange between pressures and speeds. Soft and hard, hard and slow. Soft and slow, hard and quick. My head spins in my skull as my body pushes itself to the brink of complete chaos. My body goes into a state of anarchy whenever he touches me... it becomes selfish, untamable and insatiable. He knows it, too. He knows exactly how to touch me\u2014how to make me bend to his every whim. I\u2019m not going to lie, it doesn\u2019t take much. All he has to do is look at me with those intense, dark chocolate eyes or smile his killer smile and I turn to putty in his hands.</p><p>\u201cSeth...\u201d His name falls from my lips of its own accord. When his hands are on me, I have no control over my body. It does and says whatever it believes Seth wants to hear in order for him to bring me quivering, panting, and shaking into ecstasy.</p><p>Against my back, I feel Seth\u2019s body vibrate with a growl and his fingers fall from me and he lifts me up, slipping his cock forward until it\u2019s pressed against my opening. I angle my hips enough for the head to press into my entrance and I expel a heavy breath. The friction is already enough to send me over the edge.</p><p>\u201cGod, baby,\u201d he moans, flexing his hips ever so slightly. He\u2019s barely in me and already I feel full. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re doing to me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my hips, sinking myself lower onto him. I lift my head enough to watch in the reflection as his beautiful, clean cock pushes into me, stretching me to my limits. My stare meets his in the reflection and I survey his gorgeous face. His lips are parted and his eyes thinned into lust-filled slits. The corners of his lips turn upwards in a devilish grin and his fingers dig into my hips before he slams me down hard onto him, filling me to breaking point.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I scream as shooting pleasure almost renders my body useless.</p><p>\u201cYou like it hard, don\u2019t you?\u201d he whispers in my ear as he pulls me up again. I don\u2019t get the chance to respond before he roughly pulls me back down again.</p><p>\u201cYes, oh, fuck,\u201d I cry, one hand digging into the arm rest, the other clawing at his leg.</p> <p>I look at my own reflection and I barely recognize myself. There\u2019s a look of determination on my face as well as a look of complete and utter arousal. One would think looking at yourself while having sex would make you feel, well, slutty. But it doesn\u2019t\u2014or at least it doesn\u2019t make me feel slutty. I feel... in power. I feel sexy, I feel wanted and a million other things.</p><p>Seth thrusts harder and harder, over and over, and I watch my breasts jiggle and my body jolt with every movement. Suddenly, I feel like the solid floor has been ripped out from underneath me and we\u2019re balancing on water.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I gasp, increasing my grip. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>My walls tighten and my thighs inch closer together as my orgasm builds. He thrusts hard, pounding me relentlessly before snaking his hand between my legs and rubbing my clit. As soon as the rough pad of his thumb brushes over me, I\u2019m done. He sends me shooting over the controlled arousal line and straight into the abyss of total chaos. I come. I come so fucking hard I can\u2019t hold my tongue and his name falls repeatedly from my lips.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, O,\u201d he groans, as I grind my hips into him. \u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>I barely recover from my orgasm as he grabs me and forces me to my feet. His cock falls from me and I feel empty. I\u2019m nowhere near finished with Seth, not yet. I move my feet as best I can as he forces me over to the bathroom sink. Looking at my flushed face in the mirror is different to the reflection in the glass. The glass didn\u2019t show the depth of my arousal... not like the mirror does. I see my eyes glisten and my cheeks turn pink. Before I can look at Seth, he grabs the back of my neck and forces me to bend over the sink. Excitement bubbles in my chest and arousal pulses between my thighs at the thought of him being so forceful. I\u2019m not usually into forceful sex, but I take one look at Seth\u2019s arms and want to be held down by them. The things muscles can do to a girl...</p><p>He forces my legs apart and rubs himself all over me. When he lowers his hands to my hips, I grip the edge of the counter, ignoring the pain in my wrist, and look at us in the mirror. Instantly Seth\u2019s dark eyes are on mine and with no warning, he propels himself deep inside of me. My mouth parts as a choked sigh escapes me. He grips my hips hard, so incredibly hard I can\u2019t move my body towards him or away from him. He\u2019s anchored me to this one position, to go as fast or as slow as he pleases.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d I pant, holding onto the porcelain for dear life.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep talking to me, baby, I\u2019m going to blow.\u201d</p><p>I lick my bottom lip before catching it between my teeth. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, clenching his jaw. \u201cNot until you come again.\u201d</p><p>As the words roll off his tongue, a familiar sensation threatens to seize the lower half of my body. \u201cYou want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby. I want to feel you squeeze me again.\u201d He bends a little at the knees, angling the head right against the roof of me. A strong urge to pee builds up, getting stronger and stronger until I\u2019m begging him to go harder and faster. He does, too. He flicks his hips quickly, pulling mine along with him. His eyes are on my face, I can feel it. Mine are squeezed shut as I beg myself to let go. I need it. I need to come again more than I need air. My lungs don\u2019t believe me. They\u2019re inhaling and expelling air too quickly to be fooled by my train of thought, but for a split second, my breath catches and light blinds my eyes as my brain rolls in my skull. I hear Seth panting and groaning my name, but it sounds far away in the distance. I feel his body stiffen as his cock pulses wildly inside of me and as I slowly come back to now, I feel a warm set of lips trail down my spine. His warm, suddenly gentle, hands roam my body, caressing all of the places they recently gripped. I open my eyes and instantly my vision is blurred with tears. What the hell?</p><p>I straighten up and swipe my arm over my face. It does nothing. I turn around to face Seth and as he runs his hands over my stomach, a betraying tear rolls off my nose and onto his arm. He pauses and looks at it before glancing at my face. I peer up at him and the sight of his worried expression makes my heart stutter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying?\u201d He grabs my face, pulling it close to his. His nose grazes mine and the sensual touch sends more tears streaking down my face. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and swallow a laugh. \u201cNo, no you didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you crying? Did I do something?\u201d His lips part, almost panicked. \u201cDid I say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re perfect.\u201d I swipe my nose, sniffling. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m crying.\u201d</p><p>Even I realize how stupid it sounds. His brows furrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI punched someone in the face and hurt my hand. Then, I came home and witnessed my best friend\u2019s boyf\u2014whatever he is\u2014receive a blow job in my kitchen and then I had epic sex with my husband... I guess my emotions are a little thrown.\u201d</p><p>Seth fights a cocky smile and fails. \u201cEpic sex, huh?\u201d</p><p>I slump against the wall, fighting my own smile. \u201cThat\u2019s all you took from what I said?\u201d</p><p>He grabs my shoulder and pulls me into a hug. \u201cThat\u2019s not all I took from it... to be honest, you had me at \u2018blow job.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d I giggle against his moist skin.</p><p>I squeak as he scoops me up in his arms unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cBath time, Mrs. Marc.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll never get tired of hearing that. I don\u2019t know how he does it, lifting me up without straining, I mean. In his arms I feel light, like a pillow full of feathers. When I stepped into the bathroom earlier, bubbles practically poured from the tub. Now, they\u2019re spread sparsely over the top of the warm water, building up on the sides. He lowers me into the water.</p><p>\u201cThe water was hot earlier, I swear.\u201d Seth laughs, stepping in and lowering himself into the water just by the tap.</p><p>I watch him as the water level rises, lapping at the tan skin above his nipples. I relax against the bath, yawning as Seth pulls the plug and turns on the hot tap. The warm water drains down the pipe as new, hot water fills the bath. When my skin turns pink and my chest feels heavy, he shuts off the hot tap. The water splashes against my collar bone as he shifts in the bath, pulling my legs between his. His large hands rub my left ankle and then my calf. I shut my eyes, enjoying the way his fingers dig into my muscles.</p><p>\u201cSeth, do you want children?\u201d My eyes shoot open at the sound of my own voice asking the question. I don\u2019t know what came over me... it was a passing thought that fell from my brain and onto my tongue. I never intended to say it.</p><p>His gaze flicks to mine before dropping back to my legs. \u201cYes... eventually.\u201d</p><p>My chest elates, swelling like a balloon and I manage to keep it from my expression. Since when did the thought of children make me excited and clucky?</p><p>\u201cI never used to want kids,\u201d he mutters. \u201cBut that was before you. Now... well, now I want three.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help it. This time I smile. The way Seth\u2019s cheeks quickly blush with pink doesn\u2019t pass me by, either. Of course he\u2019s handsome, strong, protective and blushes when it comes to children. Seth Marc is officially an atomic bomb to my ovaries.</p><p>\u201cA boy and two girls,\u201d I say, nodding. That\u2019s the combination I want. A boy first so he can protect his baby sisters. Seth shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cThree boys.\u201d</p><p>I sit forward a little. \u201cNo girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell. If you think Karma likes the way you taste, wait until she finds out I have daughters. She\u2019ll make sure they bring home Seth after Seth, douchebag after douchebag.\u201d</p><p>I hate when he puts himself down, talking like he\u2019s not a good person. Fine, Seth wasn\u2019t exactly a contender for Mr. Sweetheart when we met, everyone knows that, but he wasn\u2019t a bad person. Still isn\u2019t. Worst case scenario; my daughters bring home a boy like Blade. Sure, all Seth wanted was sex, but at least he was up front about it. Not once did he give me a false sense of security. I knew exactly what I was getting into. Seth has always been honest\u2014maybe even a little obnoxious\u2014but always honest. Frowning, I say, \u201cThey\u2019d be lucky to find someone like you.\u201d</p><p>Seth pulls my foot from the water and presses it against his chest as his hands massage the spot under my knees.</p><p>\u201cThree boys,\u201d he repeats, ignoring me. \u201cNo girls.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I run my tongue quickly over my bottom lip to stop from contesting him.

It wouldn\u2019t be fair to bring them into our life when we live like this.\u201d</p><p>I glance around the large bathroom. The bathroom in itself is bigger than the bedroom I grew up in. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA hotel in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly a place for children.\u201d He purses his lips together before speaking again. \u201cTraining, fighting, parties, punching people in clubs... it\u2019s not the kind of life I want to be living when we bring a baby into this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat life do you want for your child?

I want their dream to become my dream, too. I want to support them\u2014to be the father yours was and mine never cared to be.\u201d His eyes flick to mine and lock me in place. \u201cFor my child I would give up everything I own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I purr, pulling my legs away from him. I press my hands to the bottom of the bath and push myself closer to him. I keep going until I\u2019m tucked nicely between his legs and my face is an inch from his. \u201cI don\u2019t give you enough props for being as sickeningly sweet as you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound shocked.\u201d When he speaks, his voice is low and rough. I swear it vibrates through the water, creating ripples against my sensitive parts.</p><p>\u201cI am. Sometimes I forget just how perfect you can be.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t often use the word perfect around Seth, it tends to go to his head. Judging by the way his eyes flare and his lips curl into a confident smile, it\u2019s done exactly that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not all bad,\u201d he replies, planting a soft kiss against my bottom lip. \u201cYou taught me that.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me again, softly. \u201cI will give you children, Olivia, but not yet.\u201d</p><p>His full lips mold to mine once more and hold me in place. My eyes flutter shut on instinct and my mind becomes dazed. After Dad died, Mom told me that if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll meet someone who fits perfectly into your world. You become bonded to each other, joined at the hips, and you can\u2019t picture your life without them. Seth is that person to me. He is my soul mate, my other half. He is the love of my life, the one person who stormed into my world demanding attention and saved me from myself. I can feel it now... I am different.</p> <p>I\u2019m no longer Olivia James, the insecure girl who couldn\u2019t stand up for herself. I\u2019m Olivia Marc, the strong wife of a fighter who would do anything to protect her own.</p><p>And I\u2019ll do my best to remember that the next time I question myself.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Seth</p><p>I bound down the stairs with an extra spring in my step. Not only did I have a fantastic night with Olivia and even manage to avoid an argument about Jackson, but this morning, Darryl and I are going down to the MGM Grand to get a feel for the arena. I\u2019ve fought there before, but Darryl thinks seeing the place I lost at last time will boost my times. I\u2019m tagging along not because I think it will help keep Don out of my head, but because I want to see the cage I took Olivia against. I want to see the cage that changed my life for the better and then for the worst. It\u2019ll help me decide if this is what I want anymore. Last night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was up staring at the ceiling, trying to find the right way to tell Darryl and Jackson that I want out. I don\u2019t want to fight anymore... I want to be like Rick. I want to run a gym and help others. I don\u2019t want excess stress. I don\u2019t want to keep putting my body in the firing line all for money and a room of bloodthirsty strangers to clap at me like I\u2019m some kind of animal. Mostly... I want out for the sake of my family, the family that I think I\u2019m ready to start.</p><p>I tighten the strings to my pants and pull up my hoodie. My sneakers squeak on the last stair as I step onto the carpet. Before I meet up with Darryl, I want to go for a run and time myself, keeping it off the books and away from judgmental eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you off?\u201d Jackson calls from the kitchen. \u201cI was going to cook breakfast to make up for last night.\u201d</p><p>I stroll into the room and sure enough, Jackson has all the ingredients for a mean breakfast out on the counter. My stomach grumbles at the sight of the bacon. Fuuuuck. I haven\u2019t had bacon in weeks. He flicks on the stove top and swipes his arm across his forehead, keeping his head down, angled away from me.</p> <p>\u201cI figured I should apologize for what happened.\u201d</p><p>I pull out a nearby stool and drop into it with a chuckle. \u201cBy cooking breakfast in the same kitchen you had your dick out in? I\u2019m sure Olivia is going to find that very appetizing.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head before looking at me. A dark, black bruise circles his left eye and his lip is split. The last time I seen his face so busted was when he was dating Amelia... the shit she\u2019d make him do ended with him fighting his way out ninety-nine percent of the time.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, what happened to your face?\u201d I ask, pulling a slice of rye bread off the large white plate in front of me and ripping it in half.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says, cracking an egg and pouring its contents into the frying pan. \u201cI paid one of our old stomping grounds a visit, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, stuffing a piece of the bread into my mouth. \u201cYou signed up, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>It feels like a lifetime ago now, but Jackson and I used to fight in these messed up underground clubs for cash. We weren\u2019t old enough to join any real tournaments so we went low-key and participated in a few rounds every now and then, grabbing extra cash here and there. The one in Las Vegas was underneath Lucky\u2019s Bar. Jackson and I have never lost a fight there. When I stopped showing up, Jackson didn\u2019t. He was going through a really dark phase with Amelia and participated in any fight any club would let him in. It was his way of expressing his frustrations... it was his way of coping with their fucked up relationship.</p><p>\u201cAnd you got your ass beat?\u201d I wonder aloud.</p><p>He frowns, clearly offended. \u201cMe? Get my ass beat? Get the fuck out of here. I\u2019ve never lost a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>He throws an eggshell at me and I duck out of the way as it sails over my head and crashes on the tile.</p><p>\u201cPiss off, I was sixteen, and in my defense he got me with pepper spray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, man.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cBut if Selena is driving you back to these places, be done with it. I don\u2019t know what you see in her, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jackson smirks at me, his green eyes darkening a fraction. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her naked.\u201d</p><p>I smile. It\u2019s a typical Jackson answer. It\u2019s always physical with him. God forbid a girl have a kind heart. \u201cNo, I guess I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Before Olivia, I would\u2019ve used that saying myself. But I know now that a woman\u2019s worth is not measured by the look or shape of her body. It is measured by her heart, her compassion, and her strength. All of these things you can\u2019t see on the outside, naked or not.</p><p>He cracks another egg and then another one. \u201cShe\u2019s a difficult person to be with,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s strong willed, passionate, and has a lot of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t get it. She doesn\u2019t understand why I am the way I am.\u201d He tosses a dripping eggshell into the plastic bag on the counter. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t leave me alone. There\u2019s a constant flow of questions that fall from her mouth, questions I\u2019ve been pushing to the back of my mind and haven\u2019t answered myself yet. Do I still love the other girl? Do I still think about her? Would I dive back into that relationship if I was given the chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d I ask, clenching my fist, ready to slam some sense into him if he answers it wrong. Jackson\u2019s green gaze falls to my face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Selena is the only thing that makes me think clearly. Her feelings are the only thing stopping me from answering Amelia\u2019s calls and responding to her texts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders square. \u201cBecause I fucked her up. I\u2019ve changed her... I\u2019m her Amelia and I can\u2019t leave her knowing that I\u2019ve wrecked her for anyone else. What I\u2019ve done to her\u2014what she\u2019s let me do to her\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be fair to leave.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightens and the sudden urge to defend Selena settles on my shoulders. \u201cYou can\u2019t drag her along, Jacks. If you don\u2019t love her, let her go. She\u2019s given you an ultimatum. Be a man and give her a fucking answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like you, Seth. I can\u2019t settle down and play happy families. I need excitement. I need constant thrill spearing through my chest or I cease to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it? Instead of taking control of your own life you\u2019re going to ruin the lives of others?\u201d I shove my stool back and rise to my feet. Jackson barely flinches. He\u2019s one of the few people I can\u2019t intimidate. \u201cYou know what you do, Jackson? You sit and you sulk, hiding behind your mask. This isn\u2019t you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice rings out through the kitchen, but I ignore it. Jackson needs to hear this.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been yourself for a long time. Before you met her you were un-fucking-stoppable! You did what you wanted. You had dreams and ambitions. Now what? You sit around and wait on me. I\u2019m living your life, Jacks! I fight the fights you want to be in. I have all of this fame and money\u2014the wife and the house\u2014I have all of the things you wanted and the things I claimed I never did.\u201d</p><p>His green irises darken as his fingers grip the counter so tight they turn white.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, asshole. You may have forgotten your ambitions, but I haven\u2019t. I remember the person you were and you need to start remembering too, because once I\u2019m done fighting Don, I want out of this superficial life.\u201d</p><p>His brows furrow, his face pinching into a glare.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to be ringside\u2014if you want to feel the wire of a cage and be amongst screaming crowds, then you do it, because I don\u2019t want this anymore. I\u2019ve lived my dream and I hate it.\u201d I turn to Olivia and am relieved to see her in black sweat pants and a tank. \u201cPut your sneakers on. We\u2019re going for a run.\u201d</p><p>Her sleepy, green eyes widen. \u201cA run? Now?\u201d</p><p>Before I answer, she disappears from the room and I look back at Jackson.</p><p>\u201cYou need to wake up and decide what you want.\u201d My voice is lower when I speak this time and Jackson refuses to look at me. \u201cYou\u2019re happy with Selena, the happiest I\u2019ve seen you in a long time, and whether or not that means anything to you I don\u2019t know, but cut it off if you only plan on wasting her time. Selena may be a pain in my ass and I might not like her much, but Olivia does, and that\u2019s enough for me to know she\u2019s a good girl deep down and she deserves better than you.\u201d</p><p>I storm from the kitchen and head down the hall. Olivia is waiting by the door, her eyes now wide and alert. There\u2019s a worried curve to her eyebrows, but I\u2019m not about to dive into what happened in the kitchen with her. There\u2019s too much to it. To understand means she has to learn all about Amelia, and unfortunately, Jackson is the only one who truly knows that story.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast for one, then?\u201d Jackson shouts after us and I slam the door.</p><p>When I drop Olivia back to our room, it\u2019s empty. The kitchen is clean and Jackson is nowhere to be seen. In my chest, I feel something I don\u2019t feel very often: bad. I feel bad for attacking him and then leaving, but he needed to hear it. While we ran, Olivia and I didn\u2019t talk. She let me process everything that happened this morning on my own. The steady pant that fell from her lips was all the support I needed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d Olivia calls as she bounces up the stairs, inbound for the shower. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>I close the door and head down the hallway. I stuff my hands into the pockets of my black hoodie and pull my shoulders in, ducking my head. A tiny old lady seven feet away catches my attention and I look at her from underneath my hood. Her eyes rake me with judgmental fear, and as I pass by on the way to the elevator, I smile and nod at her. She turns away much quicker than I expect for someone her age and hurriedly swipes her keycard. Her door opens and she throws herself inside, slamming the door behind her. I arch a brow at her closed door. She\u2019s very judgmental for an old lady who\u2019s staying in Vegas. Little did she know (or care to know) I\u2019m the kind of guy that would help her cross the street or carry her bags if they were too heavy. I laugh under my breath.</p><p>It\u2019s the little things in life.</p><p>I take in the arena all lit up and polished from the back row right down to the cage. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m going to miss, it\u2019s the feeling of it all\u2014the excitement my job brings out in me. There\u2019s a swirl of apprehension in the pit of my stomach and it makes me revert back to my decision to quit... post-epic sex will do that to a man, you know, mess with his brain.</p><p>Do I truly want to quit? Can I exist without my passion? Can I function without it? The questions build up in the back of my mind\u2014an all you can ask buffet.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Darryl asks, smiling widely at the open space in front of us. His voice pulls me from my thoughts, thankfully taking me away from the questions that fill my skull and threaten to explode from my ears. I take in the arena, more importantly, the cage. Its thick black wire sends heat surging through my body and I picture Olivia\u2019s perfect porcelain skin against it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod, placing my hands on my hips. \u201cShe sure is.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s nice being with Darryl. I haven\u2019t seen him much, not outside of training, anyway. His wife is in Vegas to stay for a few weeks and they\u2019ve been spending quality time. That or he\u2019s avoiding me because we haven\u2019t been getting along much recently.</p><p>\u201cI heard about the club last night. It\u2019s all over the internet\u2014even in the paper.\u201d</p> <p>With my hands in my pockets, I trot down the stairs, slowly making my way to the massive cage in the middle of the room.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it was quite the spectacle. He\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t kick his ass right then and there.\u201d</p><p>Darryl snorts. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. Olivia did it for you.\u201d</p><p>I smile and don\u2019t even try to hide it. Darryl stops walking and leans against a plastic chair lining the stairs. I let my eyes roam the arena before coming back to him.</p><p>\u201cDo me a favor and avoid the paper for the next couple of days. You\u2019re not going to like the stories they\u2019re spinning.\u201d</p> <p>Of course they\u2019ve found a way to make last night the biggest issue in Vegas.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to everyone else, Olivia is banging both you and Don.\u201d</p><p>My fists clench and I laugh once. \u201cI bet Don is loving that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee it, and he\u2019s going to use it to get further into your head. You need to be more careful, Seth,\u201d he says, folding his arms. \u201cHe can take everything from you.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cHe can try.\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head, raking his hand over his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not often I lecture you, but it\u2019s very important that you listen to what I\u2019m about to say.\u201d</p><p>I take a step back and lean against the plastic chair opposite him, opening the floor up for him to speak his mind.</p><p>\u201cMatt Somers knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s been in the game for a long time and he knows exactly what generates money. There are three things that sell tickets in this industry; sex, rivalry, and grudge matches. Who do you think is spinning the stories? He knows you can\u2019t stand Don, he knows Don wants to bang your wife, and he knows it barely takes a glance from Don in your direction to make you want to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to learn how to walk away. I need you to learn how to tolerate assholes and not give this company the information it needs to make money off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? How do I stop Don and Matt from getting inside of my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirstly, you drop the alpha-caveman \u2018mine\u2019 shit. Don\u2019s brain works like a child. If you tell him \u2018no\u2019, he only wants it more. Secondly\u2014and most importantly\u2014you train hard, eat, sleep, and live well.\u201d He pauses and blinks at me, making sure I\u2019m taking it all in. \u201cAnd lastly, you stay home.\u201d</p><p>I drag my teeth over my bottom lip in thought. When I stay home, I have the dreams, the dreams of Don and my father. When I\u2019m out and about, I exhaust myself until I\u2019m too tired to even dream. I prefer that.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay home. I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>Darryl\u2019s face pinches together with a frustrated scowl. \u201cDoing what? The only thing you have to do is prepare for your next fight.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. \u201cAnd Olivia? You expect me to force her to stay home, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does whatever you want her to do. All you have to do is ask and bat those pretty eyelashes of yours and she\u2019ll agree to never go outside again.\u201d</p><p>I blow air out of my lips with skepticism. \u201cShe\u2019s a lot more stubborn than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo everyone else, maybe, but you have that girl wrapped around your glove. She\u2019d do anything for you even if it means she misses out.\u201d</p><p>I turn from Darryl and continue down the stairs. Olivia is the only one who knows about the dreams, she soothes me, comforts me with her words, and pacifies me with sex, but maybe Darryl can help. Besides Jackson, no one knows me like Darryl does. He knows how I work and he knows my next move before I even make it.</p><p>I hear his shoes patter against the concrete as I saunter towards the cage. It stands above me now, looming over me, teasing me. My chest tightens and my heart pounds in my ears. A faint, familiar pinch of panic seizes my chest and I grit my teeth, refusing to let it overcome me. In my dreams, this is the exact cage I get my ass beat and my body broken in. I\u2019ve never been one to analyze the crazy shit my mind dreams up...but this time I wonder if there\u2019s an underlying message. If I give up this life and choose a slower one with Olivia... would that make my father proud? Making my father proud means losing to Don, destroying my own pride in the process. Beating Don means I disappoint my father and give the MMAC exactly what they want. I lose something no matter which way I go... and on second thought I don\u2019t give a shit what makes my father proud anymore.</p><p>\u201cHe can take everything you\u2019ve worked so hard for, Seth,\u201d Darryl mutters, pulling me from my own head.</p><p>I glance around. I\u2019m in the cage, standing directly in the center while Darryl leans against the wire from the outside. There\u2019s a sincerity in his eyes and I believe him. I believe that Don has the ability to take everything from me. Not because he\u2019s stronger, faster, or meaner, but because he knows how to play dirty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having these dreams,\u201d I tell him, strolling to the edge of the cage. \u201cI\u2019m about to fight Don, the crowd is going crazy, people are shouting and cheering\u2014you\u2019re there, so is Olivia\u2014and Jackson, too. The bell goes off and I start laying into Don, hit after hit... but it doesn\u2019t affect him, and when I look up, it\u2019s my father looking down at me with those beady, judgmental eyes.\u201d I run my fingers along the cage, feeling the cool wire under my fingertips. \u201cHe talks to me, tells me I\u2019m shit.\u201d I laugh once under my breath. \u201cYou know, the usual, and as I\u2019m talking to him, Don keeps hitting me from every direction before disappearing into thin air. Dad slaps me, disappears, and suddenly the room fills again. Everyone is shouting at me to get up and there\u2019s a heavy pressure on my arm. Don has me in an arm bar and I can\u2019t break free.\u201d My fingers trail over the spot where I proposed to Olivia and I swear the metal heats under my skin. My lips twitch and I turn back to Darryl. \u201cHe snaps my arm and then I wake up.\u201d</p><p>He watches me closely, his face void of any emotion, be it amused or worried. \u201cYou want to know what it means?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing,\u201d he repeats with finality. \u201cI know you, pal. I know how you get when fights draw closer and I\u2019ll tell you the same thing I always tell you when you get anxious. It\u2019s not a big deal. Win or lose, it doesn\u2019t matter. If you lose, Olivia will still be here tomorrow, so will I\u2014and Jackson, too. The same goes if you win.\u201d A wide smile spreads over his face. \u201cYou made it to the big leagues. You beat all of your opponents in the tournament and you beat Junior Moset at this own game with an arm bar. You need to start realizing your own potential. Don is nothing. He\u2019s just a lonely man paid by the MMAC to boost sales. They truly don\u2019t want him to win. You are their prized possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say with absolute confidence. What\u2019s in a dream, anyway? I feel invigorated, like a new person entirely. Before I came here, I was tired and I wasn\u2019t pumped to see the arena. Now, every cell in my being is alive and buzzing, like I\u2019m holding onto an umbrella after a bolt of lightning has struck it.</p><p>I\u2019m not done with my career.</p><p>I rule this arena.</p><p>This is my kingdom and I am the king.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Olivia</p><p>Seth came back from the arena a different person than the one he has been for the past few weeks. He seems happy\u2014genuinely happy. I haven\u2019t seen him smile like this since our honeymoon. Whatever Darryl did or said worked a treat. I can\u2019t talk sense in Seth sometimes, not like Darryl or Jackson can.</p><p>As I lie lazily on the bed, I smile into my book as his voice filters in from the bathroom. He\u2019s humming a tune I don\u2019t know. Seth saunters into the bedroom, pulling a nice blue shirt over his head. It clings to his chest and arms, loosening at his stomach. His black knee length shorts and white as white sneakers top off his casual yet sexy outfit.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say, peering over the edge of my book. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still in your pajamas.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at my bed pants and overly large \u2018SETH\u2019 shirt Selena bought me during my first live fight. \u201cAm I supposed to be wearing something else? It\u2019s seven p.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a load of inappropriate comments I can make in response to that, but it\u2019ll only get me excited, which will make us late. Right now, I\u2019m going to take the high road\u2014the road without the sexual comments and hilarious humor\u2014and let you know that we\u2019re going out for one last dinner before I lock us up in here until the fight.\u201d</p><p>Lock us up? In here? The thought is both exhilarating and absolutely terrifying. \u201cBut the fight is months away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, but Darryl thinks it\u2019s for the best and so do I.\u201d</p><p>I nod, hesitantly. If Seth thinks it will help him, then I want to be on board. \u201cOkay. If that\u2019s what you want, we can do it. What time\u2019s dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>I sit upright, alarmed. Rough tangles of chocolate hair fall into my face and I brush them away as I shake my book at him. \u201cThirty minutes? Seth! I have a whole chapter to finish!\u201d</p><p>He stares at me, eyes wide like I\u2019m the craziest person on earth. \u201cSo pause it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPause it? It\u2019s a book, not a movie. There are certain details that I\u2019ll have to re-read if I stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a boo\u2014\u201d I pause and take a breath. Non-readers just don\u2019t get it. When I get into a book I won\u2019t stop unless there are gushing tsunamis, erupting volcanoes and twirling tornadoes heading straight for me. I\u2019m talking real end of the world shit\u2014not dinner. What\u2019s food when you\u2019re in the middle of a good book?</p><p>\u201cThis is more than just a book. It\u2019s a story about cowboys and damsels in distress.\u201d</p><p>He blinks at me. Of course this is all alien language to him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re racing this horse and carriage alongside a rushing steam train\u2014okay, it doesn\u2019t sound as awesome when I say it like that, but the hero and the heroine are about to declare their love for each other. You can\u2019t just tear me away now.\u201d</p><p>Seth crosses the room with a smile on his face\u2014it\u2019s an innocent smile and it puts me on edge. Nothing Seth does is innocent.</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d he says in a voice too sweet for my liking as he pries my book from my hands. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p><p>He dog-ears my page and closes the book. My mouth drops open. Is he insane? \u201cYou did not just do that.\u201d</p><p>Who dog-ears pages anymore? Has he not heard of a Goddamn bookmark?</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>I keep my stare on the book in his hands. \u201cDog-ear my page.\u201d</p><p>Seth frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>I throw myself back against the mattress, exhaling. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His large, warm hands seize my ankles and I squeal as he yanks me down the bed, stopping me with his hands on my hips before I completely slide off. He lowers his face to mine. \u201cWe\u2019re having pizza for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Pizza: the one word that instantly brightens my mood. Here I am thinking he was going to take me somewhere that only do salmon and other weird lean stuff I can\u2019t pronounce. I haven\u2019t had bad food in such a long time. When Seth eats well, you can\u2019t find anything bad in the entire house\u2014not even chocolate. His nutritionist tried to convince me that we can substitute chocolate and make things from cocoa instead, but I tried cocoa and it is definitely not chocolate. Most of the time I sneak to Selena\u2019s room and load up on bad carbs. He chuckles at me as my lips stretch into a smile.</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d I ask, caution thick in my voice. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I expect him to laugh at me or admit he\u2019s playing some kind of sick, twisted joke. Instead, Seth plants a kiss on my mouth. It\u2019s quick, too quick to enjoy and I almost pout. \u201cReally. Now get up. I\u2019ll meet you downstairs in twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I call after him. \u201cYou mean actual pizza? Not a weird kind of healthy pizza made on lettuce leaves, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Piggy.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI mean real authentic pizza\u2014bread, meat, cheese\u2014the lot. Now come on. You\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>He straightens his posture, tosses my book onto the bed, and leaves the room. I slide off the bed, landing on my ass. It hurts, but I couldn\u2019t care less. I\u2019m having pizza!</p><p>We pull up outside Gusto Pizzeria and the smells of cooked bread and meat seep into the car through Seth\u2019s open window. My stomach grumbles, begging me to eat something. I reach for the seatbelt clip and before I click it, Seth speaks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell no. If he doesn\u2019t want pizza he can get something else because I\u2019m getting one\u2014no, two\u2014I\u2019m getting two for the road.</p><p>\u201cOn the pizza?\u201d I feel my pout forming.</p><p>He laughs and reaches across. I pull my shoulders in as he pinches my cheek between his index finger and thumb, and I wince as he squeezes. \u201cNo, not on the pizza, you cute shit. Wait here.\u201d</p><p>He slips from the car and I jump as he slams the door. He pulls his phone from his pocket and makes a call. I wait patiently as he disappears into the busy pizza shop. Groups enter and emerge at the same time. When one group goes in hungry, another comes out with swollen bellies. I want a swollen pizza belly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Twenty minutes later, Seth comes back with four large boxes of pizza, opens my door, and drops them on my lap. The smell engulfs me, making my mouth water. I can smell the sauce mixing with the meat and bread, daring me to open it and take a peek.</p><p>\u201cDo we really need so many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He shuts the door and climbs back in via the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cYou\u2019ll see why when we get there.\u201d</p> <p>He pulls out of the parking lot and drives off, away from the city. We drive for ages, until there\u2019s nothing but desert and sand. It\u2019s dark\u2014the only light is the light coming from our headlights. If we shut them off, we\u2019re left with the off-yellow glow from Las Vegas Boulevard in the distance and the pretty glow from the millions of stars above us.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re eating pizza out here in the desert?\u201d I ask, my fingers tightening around the boxes. \u201cYou know the desert is full of sand, right?\u201d</p><p>He grins at me as he opens his door. \u201cWe\u2019re in the desert at night and your biggest worry is sand? Scorpions and snakes don\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until now. Thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, O, I\u2019ll protect you from the big bad animals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMuscles don\u2019t intimidate snakes,\u201d I mutter to myself as he slams the door. \u201cThey eat alligators, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d A few seconds later, Seth opens my door. \u201cI\u2019m smaller than an alligator. How hard could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, sending me a rather strange look.</p><p>The quirked eyebrow on him is cute as hell... I shake my head, making him chuckle. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever stop thinking for one second and just enjoy life?\u201d</p><p>I hand him the boxes of pizza and peer at him playfully over the top. \u201cSure, but it depends where your hands are.\u201d</p><p>He groans and turns around with the boxes in his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t get naughty on me now. We don\u2019t have enough time.\u201d</p> <p>I kick off my heels and slide from the car. \u201cEnough time for what? It took us long enough to get out here, I\u2019m sure the pizza can\u2019t get any colder.\u201d</p><p>My feet sink into the sand and it\u2019s still hot from the daytime sun. What if I step on glass? Or needles? I shudder.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d My voice cracks, making me sound helpless and panicked.</p><p>He turns abruptly. \u201cWhat? Did a spider run up your leg?\u201d</p><p>My entire body stiffens. \u201cThere are spiders out here, too? Jesus! Did you bring me here to die?\u201d</p><p>Seth smiles his devastatingly handsome smile while walking back towards me. \u201cNot in the beginning, but now I\u2019m contemplating it.\u201d</p><p>He walks across the sand like it\u2019s solid, even ground. If it were water, he\u2019d probably walk effortlessly across that, too... or not. I\u2019ve seen him in the pool. He sinks just like everyone else.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d I deadpan.</p> <p>\u201cIf I feed them you, they won\u2019t touch the pizza.\u201d He stops three feet in front of me. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s not such a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cI need your help. I can\u2019t walk on the sand with heels and I\u2019m not about to walk across barefoot\u2014not after your horror stories, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a princess,\u201d He states with a sigh as he steps closer and turns around. Seth crouches lower, offering me his back. His back... the only proof I have that maybe (just maybe) God is female. \u201cJump on, your highness.\u201d</p><p>I pull my small black dress down, but it only reaches mid-thigh. I shrug. It\u2019s dark so it\u2019s not like anyone is going to see my red, lacy panties. I grip his shoulders and my insides just about melt. \u201cThank you, my royal ass.\u201d</p><p>I jump onto his back, wrapping my arms around his neck and my legs around his hips. Once again, Seth doesn\u2019t struggle under my weight.</p><p>\u201cI think you mean \u2018steed\u2019. I\u2019m your noble steed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think \u2018ass\u2019 will do just fine.\u201d</p><p>Balancing the pizzas on one hand, he reaches around and pinches my ass cheek. \u201cHey!\u201d I squeal, dropping an arm from his neck to swat him away. His entire body vibrates with laughter and I squeeze him tighter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very noble of you,\u201d I chastise, bringing my mouth to his ear.</p><p>He shrugs, pressing the side of his head against mine. \u201cYou said it yourself, I\u2019m an ass.\u201d</p><p>I kiss his ear, unable to resist the urge. \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite ass.\u201d</p><p>Seth walks forward, following the glow of the headlights. In front of us, the sand looks pure and untouched.</p><p>\u201cHere will do.\u201d He exhales, stopping in his tracks.</p><p>I glance around, waiting for him to lower me or do something. He does nothing... just stands around waiting for something.</p><p>I tap his shoulder. \u201cOookay, now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny second now, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s any second now?\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, I see a car speeding down the highway in the distance. It gets very close, very quickly, and pulls off of the road before pulling up on the sand. My nerves prick up as I watch the car closely. The headlights shine directly on us, blocking us from seeing anything. I tighten my grip on Seth and swallow hard. Is this what he was waiting for? Who is it, exactly?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Seth calls out, making me jump.</p><p>\u201cYou know how Selena is,\u201d a familiar voice shouts back. Jackson. \u201cGirl can\u2019t leave the house without makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr without straightening her hair,\u201d Darryl\u2019s voice adds. \u201cOr without shoes to match her outfit. Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey get it,\u201d Selena chimes in. I hear a car door slam and seconds later Selena steps out in front of the headlights in skinny jeans, sneakers, and a light coat. I wish Seth gave me a heads up or at least asked me to put pants on.</p><p>\u201cBut seriously, Seth?\u201d she continues. \u201cDinner in the desert? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s secluded and no one can harass us\u2014I think it\u2019s kind of romantic,\u201d Seth replies, defending his choice and making me laugh.</p><p>Darryl chuckles, coming into view. You can tell he\u2019s dressed for the desert. He has sand shoes on, long, thin pants, and a light tee. It seems I\u2019m the only one who had no idea we\u2019d be having dinner in the desert. I guess this is the thing Seth changed his mind about. Instead of dinner indoors, we\u2019re having dinner outdoors. Way, way, way outdoors.</p><p>\u201cBoy, you and I have two very different perceptions of the word romance.\u201d</p><p>Jackson laughs his agreement from somewhere behind the lights.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jackson,\u201d Seth calls out. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a romantic bone in your entire body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Selena retorts, defending Jackson. \u201cJackson can be quite romantic, actually.\u201d</p><p>We all stare at her, waiting for an example at least. After a few silent minutes, she rolls her eyes and flicks her hand at us. \u201cFine, I got nothing. Jackson is the least romantic person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere in the background, Jackson scoffs. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Selena squares her shoulders and turns into the light. \u201cYou literally run when you hear the word \u2018love\u2019. Love and romance kind of go hand in hand, you ass.\u201d</p><p>Darryl swears. \u201cNot this again. I had to listen to these two bicker the whole way here. Like children, they are.\u201d</p><p>Seth angles his head, peering sideways at me. \u201cI can be romantic... right?\u201d</p><p>I smile and pat his head. \u201cSure, honey.\u201d</p><p>Seth can be romantic, but the romance is usually short lived. The second the passion sets in, all romance is torn away... usually along with my clothes. Is passion the same thing as romance? I have no idea, but I do know I love Seth regardless of whether he prefers passion to romance.</p><p>I look back to the others and\u2014well... I didn\u2019t see that coming. Darryl shakes his head, turning away as Selena and Jackson are locked in an epic tongue battle. Their sexual tension radiates from them in waves, heating the entire desert and all of my insides. My throat dries at the way he holds her\u2014aggressive and possessive\u2014my (suddenly) two favorite things.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cWell... should we turn around?\u201d</p><p>The last thing I want is for my best friend and her\u2014whatever he is\u2014to get me all hot and bothered.</p><p>\u201cGive them a minute,\u201d Seth replies. \u201cThey\u2019ll be back to fighting any second now.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, as soon as Seth says it, Selena shoves Jackson away from her, panting. \u201cReally, Jackson?\u201d Even from here I can see her lips swell from the passionate kiss.</p><p>\u201cHey, you kissed me!\u201d he shoots back.</p><p>Sadistically, I smile. I love this. I love our group. The bickering, the bantering... it\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s us.</p><p>\u201cYou two can keep arguing or you can eat. Which is easier on the stomach?\u201d Darryl interrupts, slipping in between the two.</p><p>They glare it each other over Darryl\u2019s shoulder. Jackson is the first to pull away and he quickly swallows the distance between us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to know that if you quit fighting, you can always become a camel,\u201d Jackson murmurs low enough for only us to hear. \u201cBreakfast was delicious, by the way. I made omelets and everything.\u201d</p><p>Seth mocks Jackson and shoves the boxes of pizza into his hands. \u201cMake yourself useful, for a change.\u201d</p><p>Now that Seth\u2019s hands are free, he holds onto my legs. I brace myself, prepared for another fight between the two men... then the strangest thing happens, they laugh and Seth pats Jackson on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo hard feelings, Jacks,\u201d Seth says and Jackson nods his agreement.</p><p>\u201cNo hard feelings.\u201d</p><p>Selena retrieves a blanket from the car and lays it on the uneven sand. Thankfully, the air is warm and no wind blows the sand skittering across the surface. I slip from Seth\u2019s back and we all sit down on the blanket. It\u2019s quiet out here, dead quiet, and I can almost hear the buzz of the electrical current flowing between Selena and Jackson as they glare at each other from opposite sides.</p><p>\u201cI take it you two still haven\u2019t sorted it out,\u201d I blurt out as I bite into my not so warm pizza.</p><p>Seth and Darryl give me identical looks\u2014the kind of looks that tell me to shut up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jackson answers, dragging his green eyes onto me. \u201cWe haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we won\u2019t,\u201d Selena adds with finality.</p><p>An awkward silence falls\u2014I can\u2019t even hear the sounds of chewing anymore. I swallow a dry mouthful.</p><p>There goes the group.</p><p>I groan, lying with my head in Seth\u2019s lap as I look up at the stars. \u201cI hate pizza.\u201d</p><p>Next to us, Darryl snores, filling the otherwise quiet desert. Seth looks down at me, smiling the world\u2019s most amused smile. \u201cI told you to stop at three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut number four begged me to eat it and it looked so good.\u201d</p><p>A cool breeze blows now, pushing a strand of hair into my face. He brushes it away.</p><p>\u201cAnd number five?\u201d</p><p>I groan again, rolling onto my side. \u201cShut up, Seth.\u201d</p><p>He wraps a warm arm around me and I shiver as the breeze rolls up my dress and tickles my spine. Goosebumps immediately spread over the surface of my skin and Seth shifts underneath me.</p><p>\u201cI have a jacket in the car,\u201d he informs me.</p><p>I push myself up into a seated position, ignoring the way my stomach feels like it\u2019s going to rip open at any second. \u201cI\u2019ll get it. I need to walk off some of this pizza.\u201d</p><p>By some miracle, I manage to gracefully push myself to my feet. It\u2019s the waddle to the car that\u2019s embarrassing. The extra weight in my belly makes my bare feet sink deeper into the sand, but I\u2019m too cold and too full to care. I sat on a blanket on the sand and nothing touched me so I think I\u2019ll take my chances. As I approach Seth\u2019s car, ignoring the feeling of sand and sticks between my toes, I hear a gasp. I pause, holding my breath. Worst case scenario, there\u2019s a snake out here with lungs big enough to gasp like a human... the best case scenario, it\u2019s a cute little bunny who found a pretty little flower. I shake my head. What am I, twelve?</p><p>The palm of my hands brushes against the cool hood of the car and I peer around the corner. My lips part and my body instantly buzzes, humming and vibrating like metal after you hit it with a hammer. The churn in the pit of my stomach tells me it\u2019s from embarrassment, that what I\u2019m witnessing isn\u2019t meant for me to see. But the light feeling pressing against the roof of my stomach tells me otherwise. I know arousal when I feel it.</p><p>Selena and Jackson...</p><p>So this is where they disappeared to.</p><p>He has her hard against Seth\u2019s car, pressing her bare ass into the cool metal. Their mouths are entwined in punishing kisses and his tattooed hand is firm on her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re naughty,\u201d Seth whispers into my ear. I jump and he quickly clamps a hand over my mouth, pulling me away from Selena and Jackson. Holding the majority of my weight, he pulls me around to the other side of the car. My heart beats its way through my pizza-filled stomach and races into my throat. He presses my back against the car and removes his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou little voyeur, you,\u201d he whispers with a light chuckle. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>I slap his chest and he flinches away, swallowing a laugh.</p><p>\u201cStop it. I am not.\u201d</p><p>His eyes scan my face and rest on my undoubtedly flushed cheeks. Seth\u2019s lips turn up in a cheeky smirk. \u201cYou liked that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d My cheeks burn brighter, making my eyes water. He\u2019s giving me this look\u2014one that has \u2018busted\u2019 written all over it. \u201cYour jacket is on that side and they caught me off guard. To be honest, I\u2019m a little embarrassed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifts his hand, bringing it toward my chest. With an extended index finger, he brushes the tip across my collar bone. \u201cYou\u2019re not only embarrassed. You\u2019re something else, too. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The knowing look on his face takes the bones from my legs and suddenly I\u2019m standing on wobbly muscle. I shake my head as he moves his fingers higher to trace my throat and I swallow hard as his suddenly scalding fingertips brush over my windpipe.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asks gingerly. My breath hitches in my throat as he leans in and traces my jaw with his lips. They\u2019re warm and moist, sending scores of tingles from my head right down to my toes.</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He quirks an eyebrow and opens his palm. He runs the palm of his hand and the tips of his fingers down the side of my throat. \u201cThat didn\u2019t sound very convincing.\u201d</p><p>I slap his hand away and grab the collar of his shirt. I draw him in and crush my mouth to his. He parts his lips and the strong flavor of mint tickles my tongue as I slide mine against his. I moan into his mouth before catching his bottom lip between my teeth. I pull back a little until Seth winces, and then I let it go.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say again, this time with a hell of a lot more confidence in my voice.</p><p>He rubs his bottom lip with his index finger and checks for blood. I didn\u2019t bite him that hard.</p> <p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he replies with a twitch of his lips. \u201cNo choking.\u201d</p><p>What I felt when watching Selena and Jackson wasn\u2019t the allure of \u2018hard sex\u2019. I was drawn to the passion that those two have\u2014that Seth and I have. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to see... and yes, it also happened to be arousing\u2014not that I can help that. It works like this; the human body absorbs smells, sounds, and colors (obviously). As you process things, your body makes you feel and react to the things you\u2019re witnessing and that\u2019s exactly what happened. I saw something that I find beautiful and arousing so my body reacted to it. It doesn\u2019t mean I want what they have. In fact, I shudder at the thought.</p><p>The cool breeze blows harder, taking my heated blood with it.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I mutter, hugging myself. \u201cNow we have to find a way to get the jacket without disturbing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d He turns away and trudges through the sand before disappearing behind the car. I wait in the silence. I lift my hand to my mouth to chew on my thumb nail, waiting for their reaction. How Seth can interrupt them without feeling uncomfortable is beyond me. I\u2019d hate to be caught in a situation with my pants down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d I hear Seth tell them. Selena squeals and I slap a hand over my mouth to stifle a laugh. \u201cOlivia is cold, and by the looks of it, so are you. Try not to scratch my car with those things.\u201d</p> <p>Selena lets out a frustrated growl and the car door opens and shuts. Not a second later Seth saunters back around to me.</p><p>I push off of the car unable to hide my smile. \u201cReally, Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you know I never miss an opportunity for a nipple joke.\u201d</p><p>He holds the jacket out and I slip my arms in one by one and pull it on over my shoulders. I stand on tippy toes and kiss him on the cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He scoops me up into his arms and carries me back toward the blanket. As we round the front of the car, Selena storms off in one direction and Jackson in the other, raking his fingers through his short hair.</p><p>\u201cRemind me not to invite these two to dinner next time,\u201d Seth murmurs in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy they\u2019re finally talking to each other again.\u201d</p><p>On the blanket, Darryl\u2019s still snoring away, completely oblivious to what was occurring over by the car. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s so at peace out here in the wilderness. I\u2019m too scared to even blink for a second too long. Selena drops onto the blanket, pulling her cell phone from her pocket.</p> <p>\u201cNo reception,\u201d she states, stuffing it back in. \u201cI hate Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Seth lowers me onto the blanket and I shuffle towards Selena while Seth lies down flat on his back and closes his eyes. I guess that\u2019s his subtle way of giving Selena and I some girl time. I turn my back to him and tuck my knees into my chest. I grip the ends of the jacket and force the fabric over my knees and down my legs. Ah. That\u2019s better. Now I\u2019m a little ball of warmth. Selena leans back on the palms of her hands and stretches her legs out before crossing them at the ankles. I glance down at her\u2014at her legs\u2014and my gaze flits to uneven fabric by her crotch. Whoops. Open zipper. Nothing is more awkward than an open zipper. How do you tell someone their pants are open without feeling like a creep? Screw it. I just witnessed her and Jackson in the middle of something, the least I can do is tell her that her fly is open.</p><p>\u201cUh, Selena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat and lean in close to her ear. \u201cYour zipper...\u201d</p><p>She looks down and chuckles, her cheeks turning a violent pink. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s these jeans. The zipper is always falling down.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head, pursing my lips against a smile. I decide against taunting her about Jackson. If she wants to tell me, she will... if only she would, then maybe I could help or offer some sound advice. Then it hits me, Jackson and the random girls he brings over. She has to know... and now is as good a time as ever to tell her.</p><p>\u201cSel, there\u2019s something I have to tell you. I don\u2019t want to, but as your best friend I feel I probably should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it my nipple?\u201d Selena peers down at her zipper again and then at her chest\u2014clearly inspecting her clothing.</p><p>I giggle. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cAs you know, Jackson has been staying with us... and he\u2014\u201d I catch my lips between my teeth. Jesus Christ, this is harder than I thought it would be. \u201cHe brings home girls\u2014girls who aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she avoids my face. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d I spit out. If I\u2019m not careful, my eyes are going to bulge right out of my skull.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>And that was the end of that. For the first time since meeting Selena, we fall into an awkward silence with nothing to say and it hurts. Is she changing? Am I changing? Selena and I always have something to talk about. Always.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I drawl, pushing our previous, strange convo behind me. \u201cAny plans coming up?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have the stomach for Vegas anymore. I\u2019m over it.\u201d She pauses, sucking her lips into her mouth and letting them go with a pop. It\u2019s her go to move when she\u2019s nervous... and Selena is never nervous, so the movement puts me on edge. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about going home early, O,\u201d she mutters, tilting her head back to the sky.</p><p>I shift in my jacket. \u201cBut we still have months here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have months here. I\u2019m here because of Jackson, and now...\u201d She drags in an inhale through her nose and expels it quickly. \u201cNow I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>She can\u2019t go. Without her, what am I going to do? Hang out with Maddi? Not that I have anything against Maddi, it\u2019s just, Selena is my best friend\u2014my sister.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d I beg her, pushing my legs out of the jacket and sliding closer. \u201cPlease, Sel, I need you. I can\u2019t do this without you. Who\u2019s going to sit next to me at the fight? Who\u2019s going to hold my hand and cheer when I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me. In my room,\u201d I blurt out. The words fall without thought and I pause momentarily. No objection comes from Seth and I don\u2019t dare look over my shoulder in fear of the death stare he\u2019s probably sending straight into my back. \u201cGive Jackson his place back and stay with me for the remainder of the trip.\u201d My voice is pleading, desperate to get her to stay with me.</p><p>\u201cAnd Seth wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d she asks, lowering her voice.</p><p>I gulp and finally peer over my shoulder. Like I expected, his dark eyes are on me. I watch him, trying to communicate with my eyes, and after an intense staring contest he closes his eyes for three seconds and then opens them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says and my shoulders slump. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>A weird, excited squeaking noise forces its way up my throat and out my mouth. I twist around and pounce at Seth. I wrap my legs around his perfect hips and grab his perfect face. I kiss him over and over and over as he squeezes me against him.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ve got that to look forward to,\u201d Selena deadpans as I smother my amazing husband in kisses.</p><p>Seth pulls away and angles his head toward Selena. \u201cAfter what I witnessed a couple of minutes ago against my car, you owe me.\u201d</p><p>I giggle as Selena rolls her eyes. \u201cI get the feeling I\u2019m never going to live that one down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in a million years, pokey.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Olivia</p><p>Seven weeks later.</p><p>T-minus seventeen days until Seth VS. Don</p><p>I squeeze the ceramic toilet bowl in my arms. This is the third time in my life that I\u2019ve fallen victim to Selena\u2019s chicken stir-fry. Food poisoning. It gets me every time she cooks it and as luck would have it, I\u2019m the only one in the house who doesn\u2019t have an iron stomach. Selena, Seth, Jackson, Darryl and his wife ate it, but it seems I was the only one who got the dodgy pieces. The only reason I ate it was because Seth and I are on lock down and have been for weeks. I was growing tired of his macho, get lean and mean meals. My stomach rolls and I quickly tuck a stray lock of hair behind my ear. I gag. I gag again. I gag until I can\u2019t breathe and my throat burns. Then, my stomach stills and the urge to vomit leaves me. I release the bowl and slump against the bathroom wall, completely exhausted. Strange, considering I woke up less than an hour ago. I drop my head onto my knees and close my eyes. I hate being sick. I hate being sick more than anything in the world. You don\u2019t realize how healthy you are until you\u2019re feeling unwell.</p><p>\u201cO?\u201d Selena calls from my bedroom. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t call back. I\u2019m scared that if I make one small movement, my stomach is going to escape through my mouth. There\u2019s a small knock on the bathroom door and I groan my \u2018come in\u2019. Even I\u2019ll admit that it sounded more like a seal dying than a human giving permission for another to open the door.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d she asks, her voice filling an otherwise silent bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d I grumble, not lifting my face.</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, O. Stay away from my stir fry if you can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>The words \u2018stir fry\u2019 make me cringe. I never, ever want to eat any variation of it again.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I chill in here for a little while? Jackson is here and I don\u2019t really want to see him today.\u201d</p><p>I nod. This has to be the worst room in the house to hide in, especially when someone is throwing up last night\u2019s dinner and stomach acid, but hey, it\u2019s her choice. There\u2019s a routine Selena and Jackson follow every few days. He comes over. They talk. They have sex. He comes (literally). They argue. He leaves. He\u2019s here so that means it\u2019s \u2018fuck\u2019 day. My stomach churns at the thought. I\u2019m really starting to regret the arrangement we have with Selena... and the amount of arguments Seth and Jackson have had between the two of them is ridiculous.</p><p>I think Seth is also going mad being locked up in here all the time. He never leaves and because of the whole \u2018Don\u2019 issue, he even trains at home. The living room is a mess, filled with weights, treadmills, jump ropes, barbells, boxing gloves and other weird shaped gloves\u2014our house has become a gym and Seth has established his own routine. Sex. Train. Eat. Sex. Train. Eat. More Sex. Don\u2019t rinse, just repeat. He\u2019s so caught up in his routine he doesn\u2019t seduce me into sex anymore. He gives me this look... this sexy, dark look from under his brow that says \u2018clothes off\u2019 and away we go. He\u2019s aggressive and moody, and he has been for the last four weeks. He does tend to change a little in the lead up to a big fight so I won\u2019t hold it against him. I only hope that when it\u2019s all over, I get my Seth back, the Seth I married\u2014the one who\u2019s charming, sweet, passionate and caring.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d Seth calls through the wooden door, pulling me from my own thoughts.</p><p>Exhaling, I lift my head and let it fall back against the wall. Selena sits against the cupboards under the bathroom sink. Her blonde curls are tied up in a cute, messy bun on the top of her head and she pulls her fluffy dressing gown around her shoulders more.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the time?\u201d I ask Selena and she retrieves her phone from the inside pocket.</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cSeth has finished training and he\u2019ll want a shower.\u201d</p><p>Wow. His routine has gotten so extensive I actually know the times of his showers.</p><p>Selena raises her palms to me and rises to her feet. \u201cSay no more. I\u2019ll go hide out in another room until Jackson leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute. Maybe I can scare Jackson off with my deathly pale face,\u201d I tell her, and with an uneasy smile she exits the bathroom, letting Seth in.</p><p>I stay seated against the wall, watching while Seth pulls his sweatshirt over his head. It\u2019s three shades darker than it was when he put it on and all the sweat it holds makes it fall quickly to the floor as he lets it go. My sight rakes over his back as he turns his body in my direction. I wait patiently, trying to decipher which Seth I\u2019m going to be dealing with this morning.</p><p>\u201cFeeling any better?\u201d</p><p>I think about his question. My stomach no longer hurts, my throat no longer burns, but I still feel lethargic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling a lot better now that I\u2019ve thrown up all of Selena\u2019s chicken.\u201d</p><p>Seth laughs and extends his large hand to me. I glance at it, but hesitate taking it. Seth frowns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared that if I stand up... I might throw up everywhere,\u201d I confess, pulling my knees into my chest.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you. Go slow.\u201d</p><p>I take in his sweet demeanor, confused. \u201cWhy do I need to get up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to shower you. It\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Strange. Seth has taken all of his showers alone since training at home. When I asked Darryl about Seth and the way he\u2019s acting, he assured me it\u2019s all part of Seth\u2019s \u2018mental preparation\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Olivia?\u201d he asks, his hand still outstretched.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t showered together in weeks,\u201d I remind him. \u201cAre you sure you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to shower together this morning.\u201d His voice is low and commanding. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>Without a second thought, I slip my hand into his and he brushes a rough thumb over the back of it as he pulls me to my feet. I sway minutely and he pauses, waiting to see if he needs to bend me back over the toilet bowl. Thankfully, my stomach stays in its place. Seth grips the hem of my shirt before tugging it over my head. In the cool morning air, my nipples harden and my skin bubbles with goosebumps. Seth takes in my breasts and their hardened peaks and opens his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say a single nipple joke I swear to God I\u2019m going to hit you where it hurts.\u201d</p><p>He closes his mouth and turns his attention to his drawstring pants. I knew it! I knew he was going to say a nipple joke. One by one he pulls at the strings while I make quick work of my underwear and toss them aside. I step past Seth and into the shower. Seth likes his showers hot so I turn the handles. Eighty percent hot tap and twenty percent cold tap. Personally, I prefer cooler temperatures, where it flickers between warm and cold. I stay out of the way of the hot stream, wetting only a sponge and adding a drop of pomegranate body wash. Seth says he hates my fruit scented shower gel, but I think he secretly likes it. We\u2019ve been together for a while now and I haven\u2019t seen him replace it yet.</p> <p>Seth comes into the shower and immediately soaks his large frame underneath the steady flow of water. He tilts his head back, letting the water run over his face and down his body.</p><p>A few minutes pass and he glances at me over his shoulder. I stand on the sidelines with my soaped up sponge, just waiting for him to let me know if he wants my help. Droplets of water roll off the sharps edges of his face before dripping onto his chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I hear the concern in his voice, and although Seth has been a little distant and obnoxious, he\u2019s always been protective and concerned about me. That hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019m just staying out of your way.\u201d</p><p>His naturally well-shaped eyebrows pull together. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He steps out of the shower and closer to me. His body is a slight shade of pink from the hot water and even a shade so feminine looks great on him.</p><p>I shrug, dropping my stare to the floor. \u201cYou\u2019ve been different lately. Distant and hard to handle...I don\u2019t know what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is still the same,\u201d he tells me, hooking a finger under my chin and drawing me closer. \u201cBear with me, O. Once this is over, I\u2019ll be back to normal, I promise.\u201d</p> <p>I nod again and hold the promise close to my heart. Seth takes the sponge from my hands.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Doing as I\u2019m told, I turn around and give him my back. He shifts my hair out of the way and presses the sponge to my shoulder. I almost moan aloud as he circles my left shoulder blade and then my right. I lean forward, resting my forehead against the cold tiles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to know my Seth is still in there somewhere,\u201d I murmur as he follows my spine with the sponge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still here,\u201d he responds, brushing my hair away from my neck. \u201cI\u2019m under a lot of pressure, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>I smile. That\u2019s all I need to hear.</p><p>Seth</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Jackson announces from the couch as Olivia and I walk down the stairs. \u201cSelena\u2019s cooking really did a number on you.\u201d</p><p>Jackson\u2019s eye has healed up completely and the only thing giving away the fact he\u2019s been back to Lucky\u2019s is the cut across the bridge of his nose. I\u2019m curious to see if he can still fight\u2014if he\u2019s as good as I remember.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jackson,\u201d Selena snaps from the kitchen.</p><p>Olivia leans most of her weight against me, but I don\u2019t mind. She doesn\u2019t weigh much. She insisted on climbing back into bed, but I managed to convince her that being out of the dark room and with her friends would make her feel better. I forgot that her friends currently hate each other and make every second you\u2019re around them a living hell. This is why you don\u2019t fuck people in the same social circle. It gets weird and makes everyone uncomfortable. I think if you\u2019re going to set up any rules in regards to friendships that should be one of them. There\u2019s a thought, if I quit fighting I could always make those quote plates that people stick on their cars. You know the ones that say \u2018honk if you\u2019re horny\u2019 or \u2018my other car is a BMW\u2019. Mine will say, \u2018If you want to join my social circle, don\u2019t bang my friends. Shit gets REAL weird, REAL quick\u2019. If only I could go back in time and slap Jackson\u2019s hands away from Selena... that would save the present me so much stress and time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had a problem with my cooking, Jackson,\u201d Selena adds.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve cooked twice and both times we had to leave and get take out.\u201d</p><p>As I walk Olivia to the couch and lay her down, Selena storms from the kitchen with her eyes narrowed in on Jackson. His lips twitch as she snaps at him. I have no idea what she\u2019s saying\u2014when Selena gets mad she talks too fast. Add a frustrated Jackson to the mix and you\u2019ve got a loud mess no one can understand.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d I shout, making everyone in the room jump. \u201cOlivia is sick. If you want to fight, do it somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>They shut their mouths immediately.</p><p>Olivia rests her feet on Jackson\u2019s lap and he moves his hand before placing it on her ankles. The gesture is too casual for my liking, especially when his thumb brushes over the ball of her ankle. He\u2019s protective of Olivia, too and I know he doesn\u2019t mean anything by it. Jackson is my loyalist friend and would never betray my trust, but Olivia is my wife. I should be the one to comfort her when she\u2019s ill, not someone like Jackson, who\u2014let\u2019s face it\u2014doesn\u2019t deserve to touch someone as sweet as her.</p><p>I step forward and grab Olivia\u2019s legs, holding them off of Jackson. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Jacks.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk, he slips from the seat and I take his place. I grab Olivia\u2019s knees and pull her down more until her legs completely drape over me and her ass is against my thigh.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d she teases, shaking her head at me.</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d I smile, dropping my hands to her legs as Jackson settles in the arm chair on the other side of the room.</p><p>I like him over there, where he isn\u2019t influencing my wife and making her breathless. She claims she likes the \u2018passion\u2019 that Selena and Jackson have, but I saw the desire in her eyes when she saw them against the car in the desert. She likes Jackson\u2019s intensity, his aggressiveness. I\u2019d be jealous of him if I wasn\u2019t, well, me. Jackson Quinn is badass, but he\u2019s no Seth Marc. I clear my throat and make a quick mental note to never refer to myself in third person again.</p><p>\u201cYou two have a lot of sex,\u201d Selena states, slinging a tea towel over her shoulder. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ve knocked her up.\u201d</p><p>My entire body goes rigid and I feel Olivia\u2019s body do the same. I look at Olivia, who\u2019s glaring at Selena.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe your cooking is just shit, Sel,\u201d she replies with all of the confidence in the world. It relaxes me. Women know their bodies better than anyone... right?</p><p>We spoke about children in the bath briefly a while ago and I want kids with her, but I decided I don\u2019t want kids right now. I glance at Jackson, who\u2019s watching me intently. There\u2019s no emotion on his face, but I know what he\u2019s trying to say to me; \u2018she better fucking not be\u2019. I give him a subtle shake of my head and he imperceptibly relaxes back into his chair. I don\u2019t know why I felt the need to assure him she isn\u2019t pregnant. It\u2019s none of his Goddamn business. Both Jackson and Darryl are scared of my relationship with Olivia. They\u2019re worried she\u2019ll ruin everything we\u2019ve worked so hard for. They don\u2019t give her the respect she deserves. If it wasn\u2019t for her, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am. It was her that spurred me on when I didn\u2019t want to continue. It was her that picked me up after my fight with Don.</p><p>\u201cNow that I think about it,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cI feel a little off as well.\u201d</p><p>Selena whips her towel off, bunches it up in her small hands and throws it at him. Her blonde bun tied up on the top of her head sways as she archs up. \u201cYou\u2019re talking shit, Jackson. You loved my stir fry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMaybe I only said that to get in your pants.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and looks at me for validation, but I\u2019m not stupid. I don\u2019t willingly stick myself inside Selena and Olivia\u2019s kill circle. He\u2019s an idiot who lacks the self-preservation gene.</p><p>\u201cScrew you, asshole.\u201d Selena whips around on her heel and disappears.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, jerk,\u201d Olivia snaps at Jackson. She attempts to swing her legs off me and gets up to follow Selena, but I drop the weight of my arms on her legs, preventing her from leaving. \u201cStay out of it,\u201d I warn her.</p><p>Her gorgeous green eyes flare at me, daring me to try and stop her. I look at Jackson and don\u2019t say a word. A second later, he exhales and pushes off of the couch. \u201cFine.\u201d He runs the palms of his hands over his shirt, straightening out the green fabric. \u201cI\u2019ll go sort it out.\u201d</p><p>When he leaves the room, it becomes silent and awkward. Olivia fiddles with a rogue string on the sleeve of her hoodie\u2014my hoodie, actually.</p><p>\u201cYou feel normal?\u201d I ask, after a few painful minutes.</p><p>She nods. \u201cAs normal as one can be with food poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I run the palm of my hand up her leg and back down again. \u201cI don\u2019t need a distraction like that right...\u201d I swallow. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could handle it at this point in my career.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t told Olivia that I changed my mind about quitting the MMAC. It\u2019s been months, but I was waiting for the right opportunity to break it to her. She hasn\u2019t exactly been the greatest person to live with these past few weeks either, making it a lot harder to be open with her. I think being locked up in here is making her feel a little trapped, and I know she\u2019s looking forward to me quitting, though she\u2019d never admit it. Avoiding eye contact with me, she nods her head.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019d hate to put you out by growing a baby inside of my belly and birthing it out of my vagina. I\u2019m sure that would make things very hard for you.\u201d</p><p>I drop my head back against the couch. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, Olivia, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>She exhales, shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I said that. We shouldn\u2019t fight over something that isn\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>Olivia pulls her legs from me, sits up, and rises to her feet. \u201cBut if it does happen one day, I hope you remember everything you said to me in the bath... there are a lot of things in this world I can handle, but lies aren\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never lie to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d she replies over her shoulder as she strolls towards the stairs. I watch her back as she drags herself slowly up the steps and disappears behind the bedroom door.</p><p>Olivia</p><p>I can\u2019t resist a glance at Seth as I pass him on the way to the bathroom. He lies on the bed facedown with his entire back exposed. His black sweatpants sit low on his hips, almost revealing the tempting curve of his ass. The room is dark\u2014to be expected for ten p.m., I suppose. After I left Seth on the couch this morning, I came back to our room and had a nap. When I woke up, all traces of nausea, exhaustion, and cramps were gone. It\u2019s good to know Selena\u2019s poison didn\u2019t linger too long in my body.</p><p>\u201cI can feel you staring,\u201d Seth speaks into the pillow. \u201cDo you like what you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the way you\u2019re just lying there, not saying a word, then yes.\u201d</p><p>He rises up on his elbows and I quickly dip into the bathroom and lock the door before he gets a retort in. Seth hates not getting the last word. Smiling, I open the shower door and flick on the water. Then, I hook my fingers around the hem of my sweatpants and push them to the floor. The jets quickly fill the bathroom with steam, making my lungs fill heavy and warm. I\u2019m happier now nausea isn\u2019t weighing down my stomach, and the fact that Seth has decided to continue with his career doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s not my call to make and I\u2019ll support him no matter what he chooses to do. I just hope that although his mind changes, his promises don\u2019t.</p><p>I pull my shirt over my head and throw it to the side. I\u2019m dying for another shower. Even though I slept all day, the oil on my skin feels heavy and gross. I step into the stream and inch the cold taps until the steam ceases to bellow from the water. I turn and tip my head back, letting the water collide with my scalp and wash away today\u2019s problems. As the water beats steadily on my head, I lean sideways and reach out for the shampoo. Suddenly, a jet of water directly collides with my nipple and it freaking hurts! I wince and clasp my hands to my chest, turning my body away from the shower. My nipples tingle, sending a radiating sensation through my body. Sickness in the morning... nipple sensitivity... I recall my high school Health Ed classes and my entire being stills as all sounds fall into the distance. Oh no. No, no, no, no. This can\u2019t be happening. In my head, I try to count how many days it\u2019s been since my last period. I take my pill regularly... that\u2019s, after I forget and have to catch up. Though I take my pills late sometimes... that doesn\u2019t mean it becomes less effective, right? I can hear Selena\u2019s voice in my head. \u2018You gotta treat your pill instructions like your bible. Read that shit every morning\u2014make sure you follow every rule, note every important instruction and pray to God that it all works out.\u2019 That\u2019s awfully rich coming from her. One, she doesn\u2019t own a bible. Two, she skipped every religion class in elementary and high school, and three, well, she doesn\u2019t believe in anything she can\u2019t drink, wear, or put on her face. The doctor told me \u2018take one at the same time every day. If you miss it, you have 24 hours to catch up.\u2019 Alcohol also reduces the effectiveness... but I figured Selena drinks like a camel, so what are the odds of my pill failing before hers? I lean against the glass, still cupping my own breasts. Maybe you\u2019re just reading too much into this... Your breasts hurt just before you get your period, too. The thought would offer comfort if I knew when I was due for my period exactly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust wait it out,\u201d I whisper to myself. I run my hands over my face and tuck my wet hair behind my ears as I expel a short breath. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>I grab the shampoo, turn my back to the harsh jets, and finish off my shower, mindlessly scrubbing my body and ignoring any thought that passes through my head.</p><p>In the dark, I slide my feet along the carpet to feel for abandoned pieces of clothing or shoes. Tripping in the dark isn\u2019t fun, especially when your room is filled with glass tabletops and random ceramic ornaments. You\u2019d think they\u2019d take all of their breakables out when they hear Seth is coming to town.</p> <p>Not far away, I hear his steady breathing and it sends guilt swirling in my stomach. It\u2019s the kind of guilt that eats at your stomach lining and feels like there are rocks in your intestines. Even though I\u2019ve done nothing wrong, I feel like I\u2019m hiding something from him... like all of the thoughts I had in the shower were behind his back and he wouldn\u2019t approve. My toes glide against the edge of the bed and I hunch forward, reaching for the mattress with my hands. I slide myself into bed on my belly, like a quiet seal. Rolling onto my back, I use my feet to slide the satin sheets out from underneath my ass. I move as little as I can as I grip the edge of the sheet and cover my body in the smooth fabric. Sleeping in your underwear is an amazing idea when you have sheets as silky as these. I turn away from Seth, curling up into a ball. I don\u2019t hold him while he sleeps... in fear of him smelling my thoughts. Not a second later, his large body shifts in my direction. I hold my breath, hoping\u2014praying\u2014he doesn\u2019t wake up. For the first time ever, I cringe as his hard arms circle me and drag me in to him. I breathe him in\u2014he smells amazing.</p><p>\u201cNot in the mood for snuggling tonight?\u201d he asks and I can sense the smile on his lips.</p><p>He\u2019s warm\u2014incredibly warm\u2014and it soaks into my skin, heating my organs. I press against him. \u201cI thought you were asleep.\u201d</p><p>Not a complete lie.</p><p>He squeezes me tighter against his body, letting his thumb brush over my flimsy bed bra. His thumb brushes my nipple and I grit my teeth. The sensitivity is too much to bear. It\u2019s almost painful. It hardens immediately and I\u2019m sure he can easily feel it through the ultra-thin lace fabric.</p> <p>\u201cWithout you? Nah.\u201d</p><p>My lips twitch as he kisses my head once. Twice. Three times. When he\u2019s done, he nestles his head against the back of mine, burying his nose into my damp hair. \u201cGod, you smell good,\u201d he murmurs, breathing hot air onto my scalp.</p><p>His hands drop to my tummy and he runs the rough palm of his hand up and down, hesitating at my panty line, before returning to my ribs. His touch makes my skin prickle, yearning to feel it all over my chest\u2014between my legs. He does it over and over for a few minutes, almost lulling me into dreamland. Then, his hand stills and grows marginally heavier.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d I mutter. I squeeze my eyes shut suddenly hoping I don\u2019t get a response.</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d His chest vibrates against my back, waking every cell in my body. I feel them gravitate toward him, trying to pull his body into mine.</p><p>Dammit. Here goes nothing.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in this together, right? For the long haul, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He pauses and the air becomes tense. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d His voice is loud and awake\u2014all traces of sleepiness gone.</p><p>\u201cNothing... I\u2019m just thinking about what Selena said.\u201d</p><p>He exhales and shifts on the bed, pulling his arms away from me as he rolls onto his back. He takes the warmth with him and I place my hand on his hip just to feel it again.</p><p>\u201cSelena talks just to hear her own voice, you know that better than anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but what if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, if you\u2019re that worried, take a pregnancy test and see for yourself. You\u2019ve been taking your pill. I\u2019ve seen you do it.\u201d</p><p>I roll towards him with more confidence to talk about the \u2018issue\u2019. \u201cAnd if the test is positive? What happens then?\u201d</p> <p>Another long, tense pause fills the room and I hate it. \u201cIt won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Olivia,\u201d he interrupts, rolling his body away from me. The disappearance of his body mixes with the darkness of the room and if I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d assume I was alone in here... it sure feels like it. Weight settles on my chest and I inhale in an attempt to clear it. No such luck. Weeks ago, this kind of conversation was welcomed... then he went and saw the MGM arena with Darryl and all doors that lead to children and progressing as a family have been locked and the key hidden under a rock that I can\u2019t locate. It\u2019s conversations like these that make me worry about him... about the promises he\u2019s made.</p><p>Trust. At the end of the day, I have to trust Seth. He\u2019s my husband... I\u2019m the girl he chose to spend the rest of his life with. I have to trust that no matter how this pans out, he\u2019ll be there the whole way supporting me like he\u2019s always promised. He\u2019ll support me like I support him... I know he will.</p><p>Tomorrow I\u2019ll take a pregnancy test and get this over and done with.</p><p>It\u2019ll be all right... we\u2019ll be all right.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Seth</p><p>I shake my forearm as an unbearable pressure radiates from my elbow. Before I know it, I\u2019m on my back and Don has his legs over my chest while he straightens my arm out. I feel my joint pop and I shout out in pain. No \u0327 no, no, no, no.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I try to pull away but it only makes the pain worse.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Multiple people are screaming my name, but I can\u2019t single them out.</p><p>There\u2019s a second pop and my free arm feels heavy, like it\u2019s made from solid gold and I can\u2019t tap. Under my straightened arm, the one being squeezed against Don, I feel his chest vibrate with laughter, then, he flicks his hips forward...</p><p>...and my arm breaks.</p><p>I jolt back to reality, breathing hard. I take in my room, subtly lit by the rising sun. I run my hands over my face, clearing off a small layer of cold sweat.</p><p>I\u2019m home.</p><p>I haven\u2019t lost.</p><p>It\u2019s not over yet.</p><p>I ignore the rapid, unsteady thrum of my heart. It\u2019s beating through my chest like a jackhammer to concrete. I stretch my arm out in search of Olivia\u2019s warmth. There\u2019s a brick of despair in my stomach as I ponder the possibility of her not being here. After I shut her out last night, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. When my fingers brush against her spine, the despair disintegrates and I slide closer. I bunch her up in my arms and feel her tiny body relax, as if I\u2019m all she needs in order to sleep well. My heart slams against my ribcage and I wonder if she can feel it through her back. I bury my nose in her hair and inhale. Her smell, the sweetest, sexiest scent I\u2019ve ever smelled in my life, pours into my lungs. It works its magic. It flows from my lungs and into my ribcage... it grips my heart and soothes it, returning it to a normal pace. I exhale and relax completely as I run my fingers over her taut belly, feeling her abdomen for something... I don\u2019t really know. I felt cold last night... when I turned away from her. I shouldn\u2019t have, but she already had my confidence wavering. What if Selena\u2019s right? Could it be happening? Could I be well on the way to fatherhood? No... I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not ready. I need time to learn something\u2014anything about being a father. No. I need to focus on my career. I need to beat Don before I think about anything or anyone else. I\u2019ve been working way too hard these past few weeks to give up now. I\u2019ve stopped as much emotion as I can\u2014I\u2019ve even resorted to treating Olivia like shit in order to keep my mind on track. You\u2019d be surprised how easy it is to push yourself harder when you force yourself not to care. I peer at the window and the luminous glow that seeps in around the edges. It has to be close to training time. I glance over my shoulder at the alarm clock on my bedside table and sure enough, I have two minutes before I have to get up and begin training. I\u2019d much rather stay in bed with my semi-naked, smoking hot wife, but alas, I have routines to perfect and assholes to beat. With incredible difficulty, I pull away from Olivia and slide from the bed.</p><p>When I go downstairs, Darryl and Jackson are already waiting for me. I regret giving the hotel permission to give Darryl a key card. Perhaps then I could skip on a few sessions and remain in bed, where I truly want to be.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, Seth?\u201d Darryl calls from the bottom of the stairs. He bites down on a crunchy, green apple and beams up at me.</p><p>I nod once. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>By the time I\u2019m done, my chest is heaving and my body is coated in a thick sweat. Darryl and Jackson lean against the window\u2014Darryl is filling things out on his little clipboard and Jackson rests his head back against the glass\u2014topless and just as sweaty as I am. All of his tattoos are on show\u2014from his right hip to the top of his neck. I warned him against the excessive tattoos, but it seems he has no problem looking like a drug dealer.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to say I hate living here,\u201d Selena announces, smiling to herself as she drops onto the couch with her bowl of cereal. Her eyes rake over Jackson and I, and we smirk at her. She\u2019ll say just about anything that comes to her pretty little head.</p><p>By the windowsill, my phone rings and I dive for it, silencing the annoying ringtone before it wakes Olivia. I still can\u2019t believe she\u2019s asleep. The amount of noise we made during this training session I thought would\u2019ve woke the entire hotel. I pause and look toward the stairs. Nothing. Olivia is still asleep.</p><p>\u201cI take it she\u2019s not a morning person?\u201d Jackson chuckles, his green eyes glowing at me.</p><p>He enjoys seeing me like this\u2014wrapped around a female\u2019s finger. \u201cNot at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Darryl asks, not glancing up from his paperwork.</p><p>I look at the screen and freeze. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Matt Somers. I slide the green key and bring the phone to my ear. \u201cI have the feeling I\u2019m going to regret answering this.\u201d</p><p>Matt chuckles. \u201cC\u2019mon, Seth. Why do you always assume I have some secret agenda every time I call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you do, but if by some miracle you don\u2019t this time, leave me alone. I can\u2019t stand small talk.\u201d</p><p>Darryl and Jackson lean closer, straining their ears.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He laughs nervously. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d touch base and see how you\u2019re doing. How are things? How\u2019s your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall talk,\u201d I warn him with a growl. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d He laughs once. \u201cI called you because Don\u2019s training team noticed you haven\u2019t been using the gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey finally noticed? I haven\u2019t been training there for a while, Matt.\u201d</p><p>Jackson and Darryl\u2019s eyes widen then narrow.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d All amusement has drained from his voice and taken on a new edge.</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly why. I\u2019m not training under the same roof as that pig and I\u2019m not playing your fucking game. I know what you do. I know you feed off our confrontation so I\u2019ve locked myself in my hotel room.\u201d</p><p>He snorts. \u201cYou\u2019re running, Seth? I didn\u2019t pick you to be that kind of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running,\u201d I snap. \u201cThis may be a joke to you, but this is my life and my career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour career, you say? Well then, since you put it that way, as your boss, I\u2019m telling you to crawl out of your fucking shell and make some public appearances. If you want to survive in this business, kid, you best listen carefully. I own you, do you understand? You do what I fucking tell you to. You punch when I say punch, sit when I tell you to sit, and jump when I say jump.\u201d He pauses and my phone creaks as I squeeze it in my hand. The nerve of this asshole. \u201cI\u2019ve had punks like you before, Seth. Ask me where they are now? It\u2019s in your best interest to listen to me, and for your sake, the fight better make it into the history books or your ass is grass.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up and I lower the phone before dropping it on the carpet. He\u2019s going to force me into his game... and I don\u2019t have a choice. I have to play right into their hands or risk losing everything.</p><p>That\u2019s it. I know what I have to do.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out,\u201d I announce, storming toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Jackson calls after me.</p><p>\u201cTo find Don.\u201d I clear the steps two at a time. If Matt wants a public appearance, he\u2019s gonna get one. He\u2019s gonna get the biggest spectacle he\u2019s ever seen. I\u2019ll start a Goddamn riot and bring it down on the MMAC. Matt Somers is going to wish he never asked me to play his game. I like games\u2014more importantly\u2014I like to win, and I will win.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to locate Don. Selena found his Twitter page and the moron posted a photo of his location with a slim blonde perched nicely on his lap. It\u2019s nine a.m. and he\u2019s at the Aria\u2019s ellipse pools with the girl, sipping on daiquiris. It seems he\u2019s not as serious as me about his training. If he thinks he\u2019s got this in the bag, there\u2019s something wrong with him.</p><p>Darryl warned me to stay away from Don. He begged me to ignore Matt\u2019s words, but I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m going to destroy Don\u2014not physically, not this time. The game I play will be purely mental. I\u2019ll hit him so hard he\u2019s going to enter the training room and not come out until the night of the fight. I want him to steam from the ears and swear on his life that he\u2019s going to obliterate me. It\u2019s time I get into his head and keep him from mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I left Olivia in the bathroom when I left this morning. She wasn\u2019t feeling so good and seeing her on the floor, lying sleepily against the cool the tiles sent dread slamming into my stomach. She\u2019s going to take a test today and I have to prepare myself for the outcome... whatever it is. I told her I loved her and that I\u2019ll stay out of trouble... even though I knew the second part was a lie.</p><p>The Aria casino is gorgeous. It stands tall, looking shiny and beautiful with its subtle curves. If I ever come back to Vegas, this is where I\u2019ll stay. Olivia would love it, too. With another mutter of disapproval, Darryl pulls up in front of the casino.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you know what you\u2019re doing, Seth?\u201d Jackson asks from the backseat.</p> <p>I nod. \u201cThis is the only way to keep Don and Matt out of my life until the fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after the fight, then what happens?\u201d Darryl chimes in, his voice patronizing and aggressive.</p><p>I shrug my shoulder and open my door. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Darryl throws up his hands in exasperation. \u201cWe\u2019ll see?\u201d</p><p>I slip from the car and straighten my black tee. Both Jackson and Selena follow suit, but Darryl remains seated, his fingers gripping the steering wheel.</p> <p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d Jackson calls to him over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI want no part of this.\u201d</p><p>I push my door and it slams shut. I don\u2019t need Darryl\u2019s help, anyway. At most places, he sits like an angel on my shoulder, telling me what to do and what not to do. I can\u2019t have that today. I need to revert back to a time when I didn\u2019t give a shit, to a time when I only had Jackson and my own free will.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for us to find the pools. Selena is quite the wiz with her phone and managed to find directions directly to it. I told Jackson not to bring her, but now I\u2019m glad we did. It saves us having to sweet talk our way through hotel staff in order to get in. Instead we walk around like we\u2019ve been here for years and when curious stares linger too long in our direction, we throw our arms around passing drunks and pretend we\u2019re a part of whatever they\u2019ve got going on. It\u2019s not fool proof, but it works.</p><p>The pool is full for this time of the morning and there are a lot more intoxicated people than I anticipated. I scan the area, looking up and down the ellipse pool for a bald headed man who\u2019s probably smiling too hard, laughing loudly, and being a total dick.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Selena points out. \u201cOver by the bar.\u201d</p> <p>Sure enough, in the enclosed area on the other side of the pool was an obnoxious, bald-headed Don, laughing his ass off as he pinches his lady friend on the ass. She squeals and swats him away. She\u2019s beautiful\u2014long, golden hair, a killer body, and long legs. I feel sorry for the girl... not because she\u2019s stupid enough to mix with Don, but because I\u2019m going to use her to tear this place apart. His entire team is there, too\u2014from his coach right down to his sparring partner. If shit goes down, that might be a problem for us. Jackson and I can\u2019t take on six guys, no matter how good we are. However, I\u2019m hoping this doesn\u2019t escalate to a physical level... or Don and I are both done for.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Selena, go have fun. Jackson and I have some shit to do.\u201d</p><p>She slips in front of me\u2014preventing me from stepping any closer to the bar. \u201cLike hell, you\u2019re going to need me.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms tightly over my chest. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I saw you looking at that girl. If you want her attention, you\u2019re going to need my help.\u201d</p><p>Jackson snorts, making me chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m going to need your help getting a girl\u2019s attention? Jackson\u2019s right, you are crazy.\u201d</p><p>Selena narrows her eyes. \u201cListen to me, Mr. Macho, I have no doubt that you can get her attention, but Don is going to see you before you get within reach. When he does, there goes your plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d</p> <p>Without a word, she grips the hem of her shirt and pulls her sky blue tank top over her head. She stuffs it against my chest and adjusts her tiny, tiny white bikini. \u201cI\u2019ll get his attention.\u201d</p><p>The fabric exposes large portions of her generous breasts and is so thin I can just see the dark circles of her nipples underneath. I clear my throat and look away, peering over my shoulder at Jackson. He shrugs, all with a lazy smile on his face. I would be forcing my shirt onto Olivia and dragging her ass back to the hotel if the roles were changed.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind,\u201d Selena says, glaring around me at Jackson. \u201cWe\u2019re not anything, right?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer straight away, but when he does his voice is dark and punishing. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk, she unbuttons her denim skirt and pushed it down her legs before scooping it up with her toes and wrapping her phone in the fabric.</p><p>\u201cThis is my plan now. Get the other girl\u2019s attention and then go along with whatever I do.\u201d She thrusts her stuff at me and turns away. Before she leaves she quickly turns back, her eyes suddenly pleading. \u201cShit is probably going to get a little weird, so whatever you do, don\u2019t tell Olivia. She\u2019ll hate me forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you at least tell me what the plan is so I know?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and teases her hair with her fingers. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019re not going to like it, but I promise you it will piss Don off more than anything you come up with on your own.\u201d She winks over her shoulder before strutting off toward the bar with a seductive sway on her hips.</p><p>She knows exactly what she\u2019s doing... she knows exactly how to get a man\u2019s attention and Don is going to eat it up.</p><p>Jackson and I circle the pool, going counter-clockwise until we\u2019re at the opposite side of the bar. We take up two stools against the wooden bench and order a beer each. I wasn\u2019t planning on drinking mine, but it seems Jackson has another idea. He downs his beer in less than thirty seconds and signals for another.</p><p>\u201cThirsty, Jacks?\u201d</p><p>He flips me off and goes back to his beer. I guess this is harder on him than he thought it would be. Selena\u2019s in view, casually strolling along the poolside and using her hand to shield her eyes from the morning sun. She slowly turns her body and steps toward the bar. Then she stops and nods her head at something on the far side of the pool.</p><p>\u201cBeer?\u201d she shouts, drawing the attention of every bar patron in sight. \u201cA pitcher of beer?\u201d</p><p>Selena gives her phantom friends a wave and a thumbs up. Then, she jogs, her breasts jiggling, as she makes her way toward the opening where Don sits. I look at him\u2014his attention is no longer on the girl beside him whose ass he was squeezing a few minutes ago. It\u2019s on Selena\u2014his attention is sticking to her like hot glue, and judging by the way Jackson downs his second glass and orders another tells me he noticed, too.</p><p>Selena leans against the bar beside Don, jutting her ass out as she chats with a bartender. He dismisses the other blonde and shifts closer to Selena. She peers over Don\u2019s shoulder, tilting her head towards the pouting blonde, who comes to rest against the bar beside me. I guess I\u2019m up.</p><p>The other blonde orders a martini and I wait for my chance to engage her in conversation. She handled her dismissal like a lady. There was no bitterness, no swearing, or cat fighting\u2014only an understanding nod of the head. A bartender places her drink down and walks away. She grasps the stem between her two slender fingers and twists it slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to drink all by yourself, are you?\u201d I ask, angling my knees in her direction. I lean my elbow against the bar and smile at her. My smile feels forced and fake, but I doubt she\u2019ll notice. The girl turns her head to me and her entire body tightens. Her lips part as her eyes take me in and she lets out a slow, steady exhale. She didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cNot if I don\u2019t have to.\u201d She slides her martini glass along the bar until it\u2019s up against mine. Just like that, I have the fly in my web. She inches closer and her eyes flare.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asks, tapping a long, slender index finger on my thigh.</p><p>\u201cSeth.\u201d I point over my shoulder. \u201cThis is my friend, Jackson.\u201d</p><p>He gives a half-assed groan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tahney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you got dumped there, Tahney,\u201d Jackson states and a small laugh rolls off the end of his sentence.</p><p>I roll my eyes. We\u2019re supposed to be seducing her, not depressing her. Idiot. Tahney\u2019s body stiffens and she reaches for her cup. She takes a long sip and returns it to the surface.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be able to please her, anyway,\u201d he adds. \u201cShe\u2019s into some really strange shit.\u201d</p><p>Fucking hell. The girl giggles, forgoing her previous discomfort. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Jackson shrugs with a wicked smile. \u201cShe gets around\u2014and Don Russell\u2019s dick is tiny. He\u2019d never be able to satisfy a girl like her\u2014or you.\u201d</p><p>We all look at Don. He presses a small cube of ice to Selena\u2019s chest and drops it into her cleavage. The melting ice slides between her breasts and down over her firm stomach. She doesn\u2019t move, nor do her muscles tremble. That\u2019s some amazing control. I have to give her that. I pant and wince like a bitch when it\u2019s ice bath time. I can\u2019t stand cold.</p><p>Jackson spits under his breath. \u201cTolerance to ice. I taught her that, you know.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Of course he did. God forbid he teach a girl a normal trick like, I don\u2019t know, how to give a blow job. Not everyone likes to play with ice... blow jobs, on the other hand, everyone wants one of those. Suddenly the music fades out and the conversation between Selena and Don can be heard. I strain my ears to listen for a hint on what I\u2019m supposed to do next.</p><p>\u201cYou look very familiar,\u201d he says to her. \u201cAre you sure we haven\u2019t met before?\u201d</p><p>Selena licks her cherry colored bottom lip, keeping her eyes locked on his. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Tahney perches between my legs, rubbing my thigh through my jeans. I look sideways at Jackson, who shakes his head and goes back to sipping on his beer. It\u2019s all for the greater good. So Olivia and I can be left alone. She\u2019ll understand.</p><p>Selena leans in close and Don doesn\u2019t move. He\u2019s completely entranced by her, caught up in her spell. I hear Jackson growl beside me, but I don\u2019t move. As their lips are about to graze, her irises flick to mine and she pulls her head away, gasping.</p><p>\u201cSeth Marc?\u201d she squeals, fleeing Don\u2019s grip. She bounds over to me looking all horny and excited. It makes me uncomfortable. \u201cOh my God! I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Tahney swears under her breath and goes to grab her glass, but I snatch her wrist, keeping her in place. I can feel the uneven strum of her pulse and I hate that I\u2019m affecting someone who isn\u2019t Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Selena,\u201d she states, clasping her chest. \u201cI\u2019m such a big fan.\u201d</p><p>It takes all of my will power not to laugh or roll my eyes. She\u2019s good at acting, that\u2019s for sure. Selena turns to Tahney and the gleam she gets in her eyes sets me on edge.</p><p>\u201cI love your hair.\u201d Selena runs her fingers through Tahney\u2019s hair, tugging slightly. \u201cIs it natural?\u201d</p><p>Tahney nods, pinching the tip of Selena\u2019s hair between her fingers in return. \u201cYours is natural, too?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m no idiot. I\u2019ve seen this before and now I know exactly where Selena\u2019s going with her plan. Why take one girl from Don when you can take two? I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m terrified by her genius or impressed. I wonder how many times she\u2019s done something like this. It rolls off her shoulders too naturally for it to be her first time. Selena moves her face closer until her lips are barely an inch away from Tahney\u2019s. I watch intently because... because I\u2019m a fucking guy and it\u2019s happening right in front of me. Before their lips touch, Selena moves her mouth to Tahney\u2019s ear and whispers something I can\u2019t hear. Then, both pairs of eyes fall onto me. There\u2019s no innocence in their eyes... the blue ones held lust, the green? Determination. They move in, digging their nails into my legs as they bring their lips closer to mine. I look over their heads at Don, who turns in his seat, confused as he watches us. I glance back at Selena and keep my eyes on her. I don\u2019t know why... I guess it makes me feel like less of an asshole, like I\u2019m closer to Olivia. If I kiss Selena, maybe there\u2019s a higher chance of forgiveness if she finds out later on. Her eyes reflect my own discomfort and I can see her apology flare in the green depths of her eyes. Not a second later, they both suck my bottom lip into their mouth and I feel... fucking horrible. I\u2019m not a genius, but I know this is technically cheating. I try to reason with myself... this is for the greater good. Matt won\u2019t put extra stress on me after this. When I\u2019m stressed, I take it out on her. What I\u2019m doing now will make me a better husband. A calmer husband.</p><p>\u201cMarc?\u201d Don snarls, pushing off of his stool. It slams against the bar, making the bystanders nervous. \u201cDoes your wife know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>The girls release my lip.</p><p>\u201cWife?\u201d Tahney spits. I shrug as she snaps her body away from me and storms off without a glance over her shoulder.</p><p>I don\u2019t chase after her. I don\u2019t even try to offer an explanation and it\u2019s simply because it means nothing to me. With her gone, I can breathe better.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d I reply, casually picking up my beer and sipping it.</p><p>I\u2019ve come this far. It can\u2019t all be for nothing. I wrap my arm around Selena\u2019s waist, grip her jaw, and pull her into me. Her eyes widen and her head shakes minutely. I had to go through with her plan, now she can put up with mine. Don isn\u2019t pissed off enough for my liking. I crush my mouth to hers, but make damn sure to keep my tongue where it belongs. In the distance, I hear chairs being shoved out of the way and people screaming. As I release Selena, she\u2019s yanked from my arms by one of Don\u2019s men. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking think so!\u201d Jackson shouts, pushing past me. He advances on the man, and with a yelp, Selena ducks as Jackson grabs a fistful of the guy\u2019s shirt and drives his fist into his face. He releases Selena and stumbles backward, clenching his face as blood leaks from his nose and seeps through his fingers. There\u2019s a pause... a long, tense pause, then there\u2019s a shout and all hell breaks loose.</p><p>I bunch up Selena\u2019s stuff and hand it to her. \u201cTake your things and meet us at the car.\u201d She takes off without hesitation as security and people swarm into the bar. Chairs are flying and blood is going in every direction. A riot. I actually started a riot. Don is glaring at me from the other side of the bar, over the top of the brawl. He can\u2019t hit me, but I can see it on his face, he\u2019s never wanted to hit me as badly as he does now and I take it as a win. I beat him at his own game.</p><p>I\u2019m pulled from my stare down with Don as I\u2019m shoved forward. My heart rate increases and I whirl around. It\u2019s Don\u2019s sparring partner... all seven feet of him. I\u2019ve never fought anyone so much taller than me before. He swings and I duck, wrapping my arms around his hips. I drive him backward until we crash and fall over the prostrate stools. I pin him to the floor and rear my fist back. As I let it go, it\u2019s caught and doesn\u2019t connect with his face. I look over my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cDarryl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out, Seth!\u201d he snaps, pulling me off the guy. \u201cI warned you and look what\u2019s happened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarr\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turns his dark eyes on me and I nod. I\u2019ve never seen them look so dark. I\u2019ve pissed Darryl off a lot in the past\u2014probably more than I should have\u2014but never have I ever seen him this mad. I push through the fighting, ducking and dodging stray fists. Security guards are swearing and demanding people to back off. In the distance, I hear police sirens blaring and I wipe the sweat off my head. As I make my way through the hotel, my heart continues to pulse at a rapid speed and a heavy feeling sinks in my stomach. Now I have to go home to Olivia... the girl whose lips mine weren\u2019t against just minutes ago. Forget what Selena said, I have to tell her. She\u2019ll understand when I explain it. If there\u2019s one thing Olivia is, it\u2019s understanding. I have to make it up to her. I don\u2019t want her to think for a second that I desire someone else.</p><p>She is mine...</p> <p>I slump against a wall and drop my head. ...I don\u2019t want anyone else.</p><p>My phone buzzes in my pocket as Darryl drives us back to the hotel. Selena and Jackson sit in the back, but they\u2019re ignoring each other\u2014everyone is ignoring each other. I don\u2019t mind it. The silence gives me time to gather my thoughts and work out exactly what I\u2019m going to say to Olivia. With a heavy exhale, I reach for my phone. I don\u2019t bother looking at the screen as I bring it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Seth. I can\u2019t say I was expecting you to answer my call.\u201d Matt Somers\u2019 voice rings through my ear. \u201cQuite a mess you left for me to clean up today. You cost me a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I wanted was a display of feathers, maybe a little rough housing. Not a Goddamn riot.\u201d</p> <p>A tense silence fills the ear piece and then he chuckles under his breath. \u201cI want to be mad at you. I want to demand that payment for the damages comes out of your pocket and you deal with the legal proceedings... but, I won\u2019t. Your stunt sold an extra three thousand seats.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cIt did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Taking both of Don\u2019s girls, that was genius. He\u2019s gone mad, posting how badly he wants to destroy you all over the social networks. He even did an interview for the local paper. People are buzzing and that\u2019s exactly what we want.\u201d</p><p>Matt is counting this as a win... so why do I feel like shit? \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re over our margin, too, so no more pressure for public disturbances. I don\u2019t want you costing me anymore money.\u201d</p><p>I relax at his words, letting my head fall back against the headrest. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hey, maybe Olivia and my wife can get together sometime and share tips. My wife loses her shit when she catches me with other girls.\u201d He laughs a sinister laugh and farewells me before hanging up. I lower the phone, resting it against my thigh. Now it\u2019s over... I\u2019m really starting to regret it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not mad,\u201d I tell Darryl, who doesn\u2019t blink an eye in my direction. \u201cAnd he said I shouldn\u2019t have to make another public appearance with Don.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Now all that\u2019s left for me to do is feel sorry for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me,\u201d I cut him off bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel sorry for you.\u201d He snaps his head in my direction, his dark eyes narrowing. \u201cA man could be holding me at knife point, threatening to slit my throat and I still wouldn\u2019t betray my wife. It\u2019s Olivia I feel sorry for. She has to be seen out in public with you after you\u2019ve been seen with a random woman and her best friend. \u201d He looks back to the road. \u201cI thought I taught you better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Darryl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d I growl at him. \u201cOlivia will understand.\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s what upsets me.\u201d</p><p>My entire body tightens and my fists clench. \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is going to forgive you\u2014even you know that. Olivia doesn\u2019t know any better... and it upsets me because she deserves better. She deserves better than Blade... and she gets stuck with you. After you tell her, and you will tell her, you best spend the rest of your life making it up to her... or someone else will.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head towards the window. I don\u2019t want to talk about it with him anymore. He has a unique talent for making you feel worse than you already do. I\u2019ve always known that Olivia deserves better than me and I tell myself that every damn day... and now I\u2019ve given her a reason to tell herself that every day, too. She\u2019s going to look at me and see me as the monster that put his career before her\u2014who put his lips on her best friend.</p><p>I feel sick.</p><p>I feel like a fucking sell out.</p><p>Softly, I tap my fingers against the door to our room. I\u2019m not quite ready to bring myself to swipe the keycard. Once I open the door, my life is going to change\u2014our relationship is going to change regardless of whether I tell Olivia what happened today or not.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to open the door?\u201d Selena asks, her voice thick with attitude.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at her. Jackson didn\u2019t say a word to either of us as we entered the hotel. Him and Darryl went their separate ways, leaving Selena and I to handle Olivia. They were both pissed at us... maybe I shouldn\u2019t have kissed Selena that second time.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</p><p>Selena\u2019s voice takes on a cautious tone. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell her, are you?\u201d</p><p>Squeezing my eyes shut, I pinch the bridge of my nose. \u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is my wife!\u201d I snap as quiet as I can. \u201cI can\u2019t keep secrets from her... and I won\u2019t. The kiss didn\u2019t mean anything, we did it for Matt, right?\u201d</p><p>She nods her head in confidence. \u201cRight, but Olivia isn\u2019t going to see it that way. Trust me, Seth, I know her better than anybody. She\u2019s going to explode, like a grenade.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s when people say these kinds of things to me I wonder if they know her at all. Olivia doesn\u2019t explode, she talks. She wants to know every thought and feeling behind every decision. I\u2019m going to hurt her and I\u2019m probably going to make her cry, but I won\u2019t lose her. I know she\u2019ll understand. She has to understand.</p><p>\u201cYou might know her better than Darryl or Jackson, but you don\u2019t know her better than me, and if you\u2019re so driven to keep something like this from her, perhaps you should surrender your best friend title.\u201d</p><p>She blows out an offended breath of air. \u201cYou can deal with this one on your own, then. I\u2019m going to see Jackson.\u201d She whirls around on her heel, sending her curls everywhere. \u201cDon\u2019t come crying to me if she explodes in your face.\u201d</p><p>Choosing to ignore her dramatic exit, I swipe my keycard and enter the room. It\u2019s dead quiet and it forces a guilty panic to rise in my throat. Does she already know? I close the door, straining to hear any sound coming from Olivia. Nothing. I peer around every corner and around every object before finally making it to the stairs that lead to our bedroom. Step by step I take until I reach the very top.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d Olivia sniffles from the bathroom. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>Her voice crashes into me and I stop. I run my hand over my face, inhaling heavily and expelling it quietly. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I waited for you...\u201d</p><p>I step closer to the bathroom and each shoe feels like it\u2019s filling with wet sand.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could do this together... if you want.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the room I\u2019m standing in becomes claustrophobic. It doesn\u2019t feel like my place. I feel my pulse pounding away in all major points of my body\u2014neck, wrist, chest, ankles\u2014and my ribcage clamps down on my lungs. I run the palms of my hands over my jeans to reduce some of the sweat, but it keeps coming.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d She peers around the bathroom door and the sight of her bright, green eyes still me. Have they always been so bright? So beautiful?</p><p>My pulse slows to normal and I feel it only in my chest. Her hair is a tangled mess, her cheeks are pink and flustered and her lips a swollen red. I\u2019ve been out doing stupid, selfish shit and she\u2019s been here the whole time worrying about us, thinking about us. I swallow my anxiety... because she needs me. She needs my support. I stroll closer and the sand filters from my shoes with every step I take, getting lighter and lighter until she\u2019s in my arms. Her small limbs wrap around my body, squeezing me to her as hard as they can.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d she whispers, her fingers digging in.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d I don\u2019t hesitate with my response... maybe if I say it fast enough it\u2019ll come true.</p><p>Olivia drags in a shaky inhale and releases me. Swiping at her eyes, she turns around. We enter the bathroom, a bathroom that suddenly seems too small to fit us both. I lean against the sink as she paces back and forth, making me nervous. She taps the test in the palm of her hand, over and over to some irregular beat. I don\u2019t rush her. Instead, I watch... just waiting for her to decide when to do it and secretly hoping she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she mutters under her breath. \u201cIt\u2019s now or never.\u201d</p><p>Nervously, she taps the little white stick against her hand again before dropping her hands to the buttons on her jeans. They pop open and she drags the denim down her legs before quickly lowering herself onto the toilet. My pulse stutters as she peers shyly up at me through her long, dark lashes. \u201cCan you look away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I say, feigning insult. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a girl pee on a stick?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, giving her a lazy smile. \u201cI\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d Olivia cringes with a giggle. \u201cI guess I kinda walked into that one, huh?\u201d</p><p>I nod, laughing. \u201cI guess you kinda did.\u201d</p><p>She pulls the cap off of the stick, revealing a small white tab. She swiftly slips it between her legs, hiding it from sight. \u201cFine, you can watch, but don\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing less than six feet away. How am I suppose\u2014\u201d I pause and stick my fingers in my ears. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>Her plump little lips curve into an innocent smile and her lips move, but I don\u2019t hear what she\u2019s saying. She drops her eyes to the floor and surveys the tiles. I do the same. Thirty seconds barely pass and she shifts on the toilet, pulling my attention. She brings the stick back into view and I hold my breath as she stares at it. Her eyes don\u2019t falter or betray any sign of what it says. She reaches for the cap and clips it back into place. I look away again, giving her privacy while she finishes what she\u2019s doing. When she\u2019s on her feet with her jeans all buttoned up, I pull my fingers from my ears and cross my arms tightly over my chest. Olivia\u2019s face is neutral and it\u2019s like I\u2019m a ghost she can\u2019t even see. She crosses the bathroom and places the stick face down on the counter so I can\u2019t peek. I grow anxious... I chew the inside of my lip and stare down at the stick... what does it say?</p><p>She turns to me, finally, but she avoids my face.</p><p>\u201cOne means no,\u201d she whispers. \u201cTwo means\u2014\u201d</p><p>An invisible balloon in my chest deflates as she falls against the counter, her hands flying to her face as she cries into her palms. I\u2019m unable to move... completely frozen by what I\u2019m seeing. I reach for the stick and roll it over.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I guess two lines mean yes...</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Olivia</p><p>Five tiny breaths. I take five tiny breaths and lower my hands from my face. The stick confirmed my fear... the fear of a small baby growing inside of my body. Already my body feels alien to me, like I\u2019m split in two. Seth stares at the stick... his face void of any emotion.</p><p>\u201cSay something...\u201d I utter, raking my teeth painfully over my bottom lip. \u201cSay anything...\u201d</p><p>He runs a large hand over his mouth before squeezing his chin. When it drops from his face, he pushes off of the counter and rakes his fingers through his hair. I watch him closely and I see him become more and more anxious with every second that passes. It\u2019s going to be okay, I comfort myself, he promised... and Seth has never broken a promise to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been taking your pill?\u201d His question is quiet. So quiet I barely hear it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly an effective reminder for birth control, Seth. I mean, look at you. You take your shirt off and my brain stops working, my ovaries ache, and my body forces itself into ovulation regardless of Mother Nature or the pills I\u2019m taking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be parents?\u201d he asks, not once looking at me.</p> <p>\u201cI... I guess so.\u201d My bottom lip quivers. \u201cSeth-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be a father,\u201d he whispers, crouching low and cupping his face. \u201cI can\u2019t be a parent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit too late for that, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I snap, stepping forward.</p><p>Abruptly, Seth straightens and towers over me, but I refuse to cower from him. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>I flinch as my breath hitches painfully in my throat. He would never suggest I do anything like that... abort my baby\u2014our baby? \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind if you think I\u2019m going to hurt our child.\u201d</p> <p>He frowns, genuinely perplexed with my response. \u201cIt\u2019s not a child, not yet.\u201d</p><p>My heart splinters and jabs painfully into my lungs. I can\u2019t breathe. Tears burn my eyes, but I don\u2019t dare pull away from his stare\u2014his dark, chocolate stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying to me...\u201d My voice cracks and my nose runs, but I don\u2019t care. \u201cIs not something a husband is meant to say to his wife...\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s pain in his face... I can see it as clear as day, but he won\u2019t express it. He\u2019s not giving me a reason to sympathize with him. He wants to be blamed, he wants me to hate him, to make it easier on him. Seth\u2019s looking for a way to hurt himself, I know it. It\u2019s what he does.</p><p>\u201cYou say you always want the truth from me. There you go.\u201d</p><p>I growl as I shove my hands into his stomach. He barely flinches, taking a subtle step back. \u201cWhy are you doing this? You said we were going to be okay!\u201d</p> <p>I shove him again and he takes another step. I\u2019m ugly crying\u2014my eyes feel puffy, my throat clogged with sobs. He promised...</p><p>\u201cAnd we will be okay, but we need to sort this out.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s nothing to sort out. If he\u2019s too scared to be a part of this, then fine, I don\u2019t need him to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep it, Seth,\u201d I sob. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not asking for your permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re backing me into a corner!\u201d he snaps. Regret immediately fills his glistening eyes, but that is the last straw.</p><p>\u201cIs that what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m backing you into a corner? How do you think I feel?\u201d My shouts echo through the bathroom, bouncing off the walls. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I feel trapped? You don\u2019t think I\u2019m fucking petrified? I\u2019m not ready to be a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you know you\u2019ll be a good mom. I can\u2019t be a good father, I\u2019ve had no one to learn from\u2014hell\u2014how can I be a good dad when I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m a good person?\u201d</p><p>My fight softens... it always comes back to Seth and his inability to see the good in himself. \u201cYou are a good person.\u201d I swipe away the inundating tears. \u201cHow many times do I have to say it before you believe me?\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head and pushes past me. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>I turn with his body, watching his back as he enters the bedroom. \u201cWhat? Where are you going? If you walk away from me now, then every good thing I\u2019ve ever thought about you isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond, he just leaves... slamming doors in his wake. I stay rooted in my spot, expecting him to come back with a beautiful smile on his face and laugh it off, telling me it\u2019s all part of some sick joke.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t come back. I stand still, waiting for twenty minutes but he doesn\u2019t come back. A single, scalding tear falls from my eye and tolls down my cheek. I wipe it away, along with my sadness. The only thing that fills me now is rage... He fucking left? Just like that? I storm through the room, scooping up a pretty lion ornament. I pull the bedroom door open and, for the first time in my life, I throw something... it sails over the stair banister and onto the floor, shattering into a million tiny pieces, just like my relationship, the relationship that I defended from the beginning. I turn on my heel and throw myself onto our bed. It smells like him\u2014of course it fucking does. God forbid it absorbs my scent, something that doesn\u2019t set me on fire or crush my soul. I bunch up the satin sheets and bury my head in them. He\u2019ll come back. I know he will... but even as I think that, there\u2019s an uncertainty swirling around my stomach. I have to call him. I sit up as I pull my phone from my pocket and dial his number. It rings out, going straight to voicemail. After the beep, I leave my message.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come home... I need you to come home.\u201d I swallow a sob. \u201cThis whole time that I\u2019ve let you have me\u2014let you do whatever you want to do to me\u2014was because I love you and I believed you would take care of me no matter what. I don\u2019t blame you, Seth. I don\u2019t blame you because I tricked myself into believing that you weren\u2019t the person that everyone said you were. My heart is telling me that you are a good man, but my brain is telling me that a good man would never have walked out on his wife when she needed him most. I\u2019m scared, too. I have a human in my belly that I have to take care of. I have this baby that\u2019s half me and half you that I have to share my body with and I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m terrified that I\u2019m responsible for another life when I can barely look after my own.\u201d I angrily wipe away a tear. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready for this? I\u2019m the one that has to take all of the risks and I\u2019m mad! I\u2019m mad that you were man enough to stick it in, but not stick around. I\u2019m alone in our room... it\u2019s empty and it\u2019s cold, and it smells like you.\u201d I can\u2019t help the smile that pulls at my lips as his amazing smell filters in through my nose with every inhale. \u201cYou know, my father promised me that you were a good man... he vouched for you when no one else would. Please don\u2019t make him a liar. Come home to me, Seth... I love you.\u201d</p><p>I hang up the phone and fall against the soft mattress. I let my fingers trail over my abdomen and I wonder if the baby can feel how sad I am... am I making it sad? Can it hear me? Does it have ears yet? I\u2019m pregnant... and I have no idea what that entails exactly. I\u2019m not mad at Seth anymore... I forgive him. He\u2019s scared and I want him to come home.</p><p>I close my eyes and take calming breaths. In my chest, my heart still beats fast and my throat tingles. Seth\u2019s face flashes through my mind. I see his gorgeous brown eyes and heartbreaking smile, and I lose it. Sobs erupt from my throat and I roll onto my side, gripping the sheet and pulling it into my face to catch the tears...</p><p>He left.</p><p>Seth</p><p>\u201cYou know, my father promised me that you were a good man... he vouched for you when no one else would. Please don\u2019t make him a liar. Come home to me, Seth... I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her sad voice plays through my phone speaker and I rake my teeth over my bottom lip to stop it from trembling. To hear her so destroyed and knowing it\u2019s because of me makes it so much worse.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d I shout as I throw my phone against the concrete wall.</p><p>It impacts with tremendous speed, sending pieces of cell phone in every direction. Leaving it in on the floor, I keep heading down the hallway towards Darryl\u2019s room. I know he\u2019ll give me some good advice or help me in some way. I didn\u2019t mean to bail on Olivia... I panicked. I subconsciously knew the test would be positive... but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be, if that makes any sense at all. I\u2019m not ready for this. A kid is a big deal and I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m going to do.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying to me,\u201d her voice cracks, \u201cis not something a husband is meant to say to his wife...\u201d</p><p>I drop my head. I told her to get rid of our child... more or less. I didn\u2019t mean to tell her to get rid of it. I don\u2019t want that, not at all, but I said it and once I said it, it seemed like a sound solution. We can always try again when we\u2019re both ready, right? I\u2019m an idiot... a heartless, selfish idiot.</p><p>I knock on Darryl\u2019s door and wait a few seconds. I don\u2019t expect him to answer. I pissed him off pretty badly today and I don\u2019t know if I can come back from it. What I do know, though, is that I need his advice more than anything right now. I need him to kick me in the ass and send me right back upstairs to Olivia, who\u2019s probably crying her ass off and not sure if she\u2019ll ever see me again. I need someone to tell me it\u2019s not a big deal and that I should stop being selfish and be happy\u2014excited, even.</p><p>To my surprise, the door opens almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling I was going to see you,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m a little caught up with this ridiculous riot on the news, so you\u2019ll have to come back later.\u201d</p><p>He attempts to shut the door, but I jam my foot in and prevent it from closing. \u201cIt\u2019s about Olivia.\u201d</p><p>Darryl smirks. \u201cDid she have enough sense to leave your ass?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>His body stills and he drops his hand from the handle. Darryl always expects me to do something stupid so it\u2019s not often I surprise him like this. \u201cShe\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Olivia\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He steps back from the door, giving me enough room to slip in. He watches me closely\u2014shocked as all hell\u2014as I enter his room and stroll down the hallway. His room is nice\u2014a little too small\u2014but still nice. I step into the living room, and sure enough, the riot he was talking about was the one Jackson, Selena, and I started at the Aria casino. The sight of it makes my stomach churn. As I drop into a leather armchair, Darryl leans for the remote off the coffee table and switches off the T.V.</p><p>\u201cSeth, what are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, what am I doing? I don\u2019t need this distraction two weeks out from a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He folds his arms, making his bright orange shirt tighten around his biceps. \u201cWhat are you doing here? You need to be upstairs with your wife.\u201d A smile splits his face and he lowers himself onto the edge of the coffee table, directly in front of me. \u201cYou\u2019re having a baby!\u201d</p><p>I quirk an eyebrow. He\u2019s happy? \u201cWait... what? You\u2019re okay with this?\u201d</p><p>His smile doesn\u2019t falter. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I just assumed you\u2019d be pissed. A child is a huge distraction.\u201d</p><p>His groomed brows pull together. \u201cI should slap you. A child is a blessing, not a distraction, and it\u2019s attitude like that that makes me think you\u2019ve absorbed more of your father\u2019s stupid advice than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blessing? Well... I never thought of it like that.\u201d Even so, the word doesn\u2019t ease the absolute fear of being the head of a family\u2014an actual family\u2014with a kid and all. \u201cI fucked up,\u201d I groan, dropping my head into my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having a baby, I\u2019m sure Olivia can bring herself to forgive what happened today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. I... I told Olivia to\u2014I\u2019m not ready for a baby, Darryl. I freaked out and I yelled and I told her to\u2014\u201d Jesus Christ. I can\u2019t even bring myself to say it. I\u2019m shittier than I thought.</p><p>Darryl doesn\u2019t need a further explanation. The silence tells me everything, and when I lower my hands, the look of disgust solidifies his silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he demands. His voice is low and laced with bitter disappointment. \u201cShe\u2019s your wife... not some one night stand you picked up at a club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you treating her like it?\u201d</p><p>I drop my gaze to the carpet. I have nothing to say to that... I can\u2019t contest something that\u2019s true. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been treating her well\u2014like the princess I promised her father or the queen I promised her brother on our wedding day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d I mutter. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something I\u2019ve ever admitted aloud before.</p><p>\u201cI know. The first time is always the scariest, but by tomorrow, you\u2019ll come to terms with it.\u201d He slaps my knee. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide down here, Seth. You need to be upstairs.\u201d</p><p>I almost cringe. Olivia isn\u2019t going to want to see me. What if she wants to end it? To leave me for what I said?</p><p>\u201cIf you think she doesn\u2019t want to see you, then you\u2019re stupider than I thought,\u201d he says, reading my mind.</p><p>\u201cI told her that when I have kids, I don\u2019t want to fight anymore...\u201d His face remains neutral and I clear my throat. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to do this... then Don is my last, Darryl.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m expecting him to say... maybe he\u2019ll call me selfish? Maybe he\u2019ll tell me I can have both. I wait with bated breath until he nods at me finally, and with a proud smirk, he says, \u201cSo I\u2019ll call your lawyers in the morning. We have more than enough proof to claim a breach of contract. If you want out, I\u2019ll get you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>He flashes his palms before running them over the thighs of his pants. \u201cJust like that.\u201d He pushes himself to his feet. \u201cNow get the hell out of here. You have a lot of sucking up to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d My chest fills with something light and warm. Love? Happiness? Acceptance? Excitement? I can\u2019t tell. \u201cI guess I do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leave the armchair and Darryl follows closely behind me as I head back to the door. I reach for the handle, but he catches my shoulder. \u201cDo me a favor and tell Jackson before you go back to Olivia. He\u2019s not going to take it very well... it\u2019ll give him the day to cool down.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cCan you call her and tell her I\u2019m coming back after I see Jackson?\u201d I open the door and step out into the hallway. \u201cI would, but I smashed my phone.\u201d</p><p>Darryl leans against the door frame and stares at me with that fatherly disapproval. \u201cOf course you did.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes and turn away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I stroll down the hallway toward the elevator. From memory, Jackson\u2019s staying on the floor above Darryl.</p><p>\u201cHey, Seth!\u201d Darryl calls, making me turn around. His lips pull up at the corners, curving into a wide smile. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were singing a different tune this morning,\u201d I tell him, but his smile stays plastered in place.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t you, that was the old Seth. The new one makes me proud every day.\u201d</p> <p>He slips back inside his room and closes the door. I catch myself smiling stupidly at the wood and quickly drop it. It\u2019s still too early to be happy, I have to tell Jackson and make it up to Olivia before I\u2019m in the clear and it isn\u2019t going to be an easy feat. The way I see it, it can go two ways. One, Jackson punches me in the face (hard) and tells me to go fuck myself. I have a feeling he\u2019s still pissed about what happened between Selena and I. And two, Olivia is also going to punch me in the face (hard) and tell me to go fuck myself. I hear those pregnancy mood swings aren\u2019t too good for the man responsible for them. I step into the elevator and hit the glowing button above the current one. Now that I have a clearer head, it\u2019s time to do some damage control.</p><p>Selena answers her door quickly and pouts when she sees my face. \u201cOh, it\u2019s only you. How\u2019d she take it?\u201d</p><p>She makes no move to open the door and let me into the room. That\u2019s fine by me, it\u2019s not like I really want to go in there, anyway. Selena plucks a chopped strawberry from the container she\u2019s holding and stuffs it into her mouth. She\u2019s on edge\u2014cranky, too. I\u2019m assuming things didn\u2019t go too well with Jackson after the whole Aria incident.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her,\u201d I admit on exhale.</p><p>\u201cOh, awkward. I hope you\u2019re not here to declare your love for me.\u201d She smirks. \u201cIt was only a kiss.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at her. It\u2019s way too soon for \u2018we kissed\u2019 jokes, but it beats an awkward silence, I guess.</p> <p>\u201cFirstly, if anyone is falling in love with anyone, it\u2019s you. I\u2019m that good a kisser.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cAnd secondly, sorry, but I prefer brunettes. Where\u2019s Jackson?\u201d I leave no room for more small talk. I just want to know where Jackson is so I can tell him that Don is my last fight.</p><p>She shrugs, popping another strawberry into her mouth. \u201cWell, he yelled at me a little bit and didn\u2019t want to discuss what happened, so he left for a place called Lucky\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I turn away and head for the elevator. It\u2019ll take me straight to the ground floor. I should have known Jackson would disappear to Lucky\u2019s. Now that he and Selena are on a rocky path, that\u2019s where he spends all of his time outside of training. It\u2019s classic tortured Jackson bullshit. I find it strange he\u2019d go there. I know for a fact Lucky\u2019s doesn\u2019t have day fights. Their fights start after eleven p.m. so Jackson is either going there to start a fight or drink until there\u2019s nothing left.</p><p>\u201cSeth? Where are you going?\u201d she calls after me. \u201cIs it Jackson?\u201d</p><p>I ignore her, but only because I know if I tell her, she\u2019ll insist on coming with me and, if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019d rather not spend any more time with Selena. When I reflect back on my day later on\u2014when I\u2019m telling Olivia about it\u2014I don\u2019t want Selena\u2019s name to pop up more times than it should. I don\u2019t want Olivia to think for a second that Selena means anything to me. Selena is Olivia\u2019s friend, and most of the time I dislike her. She helped me out today and that was it. I want nothing else to do with her.</p><p>Lucky\u2019s bar. I haven\u2019t been here in years. I rest my arm against the window frame and survey the seedy tavern. It looks the same. It has the same old busted, stone exterior and green trimmings. It has the same old picture windows and low door frames, and it definitely lacks the classy prestige the rest of Las Vegas has, but so did many other bars in this part of town. The only difference between then and now is the thicker blanket of sand shrouding it. On the surface, it looks like your classic run down bar, but underneath its floorboards, there is a whole new world. The surfaces were cleaner, the women hotter, and the alcohol more expensive. Amidst all of the new age decals and accessories, situated in the center of the room, was a tall, steel cage. The cage wasn\u2019t like the rest of the room\u2014polished and clean. It was worn and spattered with blood. I used to love it here. This place instilled in me the passion to fight. This is where my love for Vegas began... back then, though, I only saw this joint at night time. In the middle of the day, all of its appeal didn\u2019t, well, appeal to me.</p><p>\u201cHere I go,\u201d I breathe, stepping out of the car. The hot Vegas air fills my lungs and I try not to breathe too much of it in. On this side of town, there\u2019s only so much piss-filled air you can ingest before you throw up all over the sidewalk.</p><p>As I approach the steps of the establishment, I hear shouting coming from the alley adjacent to the bar and I don\u2019t need to look to know who it is. There\u2019s only one angry man walking around Vegas at this time\u2014the rest are still asleep. I break into a quick jog and sure enough, I see Jackson, drunk and shirtless, trying to take on two of Lucky\u2019s security guards.</p> <p>\u201cJackson, you\u2019re drunk. Go home.\u201d the taller one orders, turning his back.</p><p>\u201cFight me, you pussies!\u201d he demands, spitting onto the gray gravel beside him.</p><p>The second guard barely flinches. He\u2019s relaxed, not threatened in the slightest by Jackson\u2019s show of aggression. Instead of acting on Jackson\u2019s drunken demand, the guard throws his shirt at him. \u201cCome back when you\u2019re sober, man.\u201d</p><p>They disappear back inside, leaving Jackson outside on his own. He growls ferociously before cocking his hand back, turning and letting it fly into the concrete wall.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He shakes his hand and flexes his fingers. \u201cFuck! Fuck you!\u201d</p><p>Blood flows from his knuckles, dripping onto the colorless stones. I step forward and my shoes scuff on the gravel. Cradling his hand to his chest and smearing it with blood, he snaps his head in my direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Well... I guess someone isn\u2019t in the mood to see me. His aggressive tone doesn\u2019t affect me. I let it roll right off my squared shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to talk.\u201d I stuff my hands into the pockets of my jeans.</p><p>Jackson snorts and unknowingly begins to pace. \u201cYou\u2019re shit out of luck. I\u2019m not in the talking mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never are.\u201d</p><p>Silence falls as he wraps his hand in his black tee. \u201cLet me guess. You\u2019re here because Olivia doesn\u2019t forgive you and you want me to make it better?\u201d</p><p>I clench my jaw and then relax it. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to do anything. I can handle Olivia. I\u2019m here because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014because Selena\u2019s upset I yelled at her and she called you in to save the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you shut up and let me finish?\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cNo, you shut up!\u201d He shakes his head, taking a hostile step forward. \u201cI\u2019m done hearing you talk. I\u2019m done always coming second to you!\u201d</p><p>He marches forward until he\u2019s right in my face. I want to hit him. I want to punch him square in the eyes and kick start his brain. He smells of whiskey and cigarettes\u2014not on his breath, but on his skin. \u201cWhy\u2019d you come looking for me? To talk about today? To talk about what you did?\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cWhat I did?\u201d I have to think hard, then it hits me. Ohh, he\u2019s talking about Selena. \u201cThat didn\u2019t mean anything, Jacks. It was all part of a plan\u2014an act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the second time? When you grabbed her like she was yours?\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on my hips, realizing what this whole childish act is about. He didn\u2019t like the way I put my hands on \u2018his\u2019 woman. In my defense, she isn\u2019t his. \u201cI think you\u2019re blowing this way out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>Minutely, he shakes his head. \u201cBlowing it out of proportion? That\u2019s awfully rich, coming from you, asshole. Just the other morning you made me switch seats when Olivia rested her legs on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? At least everyone knows she\u2019s mine. At least I make it clear to her that she belongs to me. You can\u2019t claim something you don\u2019t truly want the minute someone else touches it. What are you, seven?\u201d</p><p>He steps back, his face pinching into a violent scowl. \u201cYou know what I want? I want to hit you.\u201d</p><p>I smirk. That\u2019s the difference between Jackson and I. He threatens, I follow through. If that was him kissing Olivia, I\u2019d have destroyed him at the Aria. \u201cDo it, if it\u2019ll make you feel better, but you wanna hope you can outrun me.\u201d</p><p>On a heavy exhale, Jackson runs his shirt over his face, collecting drunken sweat. \u201cWhy did you find me?\u201d His tone is even and calm. I savor the moment because the second I tell him about Olivia, he\u2019s going to lose his mind. \u201cI get the feeling it\u2019s not to save me from myself.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou know I let you handle your own shit. It\u2019s too complicated for me.\u201d</p><p>He scoffs, taking another step back, but never dropping his slack, intense eyes from mine.</p><p>\u201cOlivia is pregnant.\u201d Like I expected, the air grows tense again. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a dad, Jacks.\u201d</p><p>The bright sun above illumines his skin, making it seem extra pale\u2014even green\u2014between his myriad of tattoos. \u201cThat\u2019s why you came out here? To pass on your \u2018good\u2019 news while I\u2019m drowning in my own fucking problems?\u201d</p><p>Fucking hell. I lift my hand and pinch the bridge of my nose. There\u2019s no reasoning with a drunken Jackson. No matter what I say to him, he\u2019ll flip it on me, dragging me into his shit and making everything my fault.</p><p>\u201cWhy does my happiness piss you off so much?\u201d I ask. Fuck beating around the bush.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeats, shouting. \u201cC\u2019mon, Seth, you said it yourself. You have everything that I wanted and you claimed you never did. I wanted the fighting career, the good wife, the big house\u2014a family\u2014I wanted a family.\u201d</p><p>He stumbles as he takes another step back and I inch forward, but he thrusts his hands at me, warning me off. When he straightens, he begins to pace, back and forth.</p><p>\u201cYou can still have those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like you!\u201d he snaps. I take in his scrunched face and dark eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t fight publicly. When I fight, it reminds me of Amelia and I can\u2019t break apart in front of thousands of people. I sure as shit can\u2019t have a relationship like you because I\u2019m fucked. I\u2019m fucked from head to toe and there\u2019s no redemption for me!\u201d I watch as he stalks toward Lucky\u2019s and slumps against its dirty wall, defeated. \u201cI\u2019m going to be stuck here.\u201d He gestures to the bar. \u201cFighting in illegal establishments and hooking up with random girls. I\u2019m going to die alone. No one can love me like Olivia loves you\u2014I don\u2019t deserve that kind of love.\u201d</p><p>I shift my weight onto my left leg. \u201cSelena lov-\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014Selena loves what I do to her.\u201d He rakes his teeth over his bottom lip repeatedly before speaking again. \u201cShe wants to change me... but even I know if you\u2019re deeply in love with someone, you love them for all that they are, not what they could be.\u201d</p><p>Easy fix. \u201cSo leave Selena and find someone else.\u201d</p><p>Jackson\u2019s shoulders pull in and he sags, putting an unnatural curve in his spine. \u201cI can\u2019t leave her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of moral obligation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of desire!\u201d He straightens his back and squares his shoulders. \u201cOut of possession and lust. I\u2019m stuck to her, like a grenade strapped to her hip. I can\u2019t bring myself to leave, even if I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love her.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and it\u2019s like an etch-a-sketch, all his lines fade away, softening his features. \u201cBecause I love what she does to me... because I love the passion she brings out in me. Others see the fire in my eyes and they fear it, but not her, no.\u201d His lips twitch and he drops his stare to his shoes. \u201cShe sees the fire and wants to play with it.\u201d</p><p>Sounds like love. He\u2019s in love. The idiot is in love, but refuses to see it. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to stop focusing on what you deserve and more on what you have,\u201d I say... and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s for him or me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I stand there watching him in silence, but after the first ten minutes it\u2019s clear our conversation is finished. Regardless, I stay a little while longer to show him that I\u2019m here for him. It\u2019s the least I can do considering I\u2019m the reason he\u2019s spiraling out of control. When the sun becomes too hot to handle, I walk away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to quit fighting, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jackson calls out, forcing me to stop and turn around. It doesn\u2019t sound like a question... more of an \u2018I know you are\u2019 kind of statement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod, squinting away from the sun. \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>I made promises to Olivia that I have to keep\u2014that I want to keep. I made promises to myself, too. I\u2019m going to be the parent my father never was. My home is going to be happy and warm, not cold and sterile.</p><p>Jackson keeps his eyes on his shoes. \u201cCongrats, man,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>I let one side of my lips pull into a semi-smile and turn around. That\u2019s the best I\u2019m going to get out of him and I\u2019ll take it.</p><p>Quickly, I make my way to my car and get in. After I turn my key in the ignition, I pause. If Don is going to be my last fight, I have to win it. I will not quit on a loss... my pride won\u2019t let me. If I\u2019m going to win, I need to keep a clear head... which means I have to hold off on telling Olivia what happened at the Aria casino today. I rake my fingers through my hair. I don\u2019t want guilt to weigh on me if she leaves. I know it\u2019s not right and I know it\u2019s messed up. I don\u2019t like keeping things from her, but once this is over I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life making it up to her, treating her like the queen I promised her father and her brother.</p><p>I swear it.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Olivia</p><p>I fall asleep with my head on Darryl\u2019s lap, but I don\u2019t dream. He came to tell me that Seth is coming back soon and I\u2019m elated that he\u2019s willing to make this work. I knew he would... Seth Marc is many things, but a liar he is not. He said he\u2019ll take care of me. He promised me that we\u2019re going to be okay and now he\u2019s coming to deliver that promise.</p><p>I fell asleep to Darryl telling me stories about Seth as a teenager. They made me smile\u2014he was such a little troublemaker. Once, Seth was arrested for running naked through a church during a Sunday morning sermon. It turns out they didn\u2019t appreciate his God-like figure quite like I do. Indecent exposure, Darryl called it, making me giggle. Everything Seth does is indecent, and although Darryl is telling me these stories of his carefree youth, I don\u2019t believe them. To me, Seth has always been stern and a little intense. Sure, he can be over-confident and playful, too, but for the most part he\u2019s a serious guy. I can\u2019t imagine him running naked for fun or skateboarding and surfing like the other stories Darryl\u2019s told me. I see him as the big guy with the heavy hands... maybe having a child will bring out Seth\u2019s inner boy?</p><p>Sudden weightlessness overcomes me and I\u2019m awoken from my nap. I peer through barely open eyes and I\u2019m met with a strong jaw, darkened by five o\u2019clock shadow and some full, kissable lips. I stare at them for a few seconds, trying to get my bearings, and it isn\u2019t until I meet his gorgeous brown eyes, I realize my husband has finally come back to me. The golden rivers of honey deep in his irises flare brightly\u2014apologetically.</p><p>\u201cO, I\u2019m so sor\u2014\u201d</p><p>I throw my arms around his neck and crush my lips to his. I kiss him hard\u2014desperate for us to mold together and never separate, like play dough when you mix the colors. He can say sorry all he wants, but it doesn\u2019t matter, not to me. We all make rash decisions, we all run when we\u2019re mad or afraid, and it\u2019s okay. Sometimes it\u2019s not the apology that means the most... sometimes coming back is enough to fix everything.</p><p>In the distance, I hear the front door close. Darryl is gone, leaving Seth and I alone. He pulls away from me, cautiously taking in my face. \u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me?\u201d</p><p>I cup his face and run my fingers through his hair just to make sure he\u2019s real and I\u2019m not still dreaming\u2014to make sure he\u2019s here with me. \u201cNo, not anymore.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze his hair between my fingers and force his mouth back to mine. I want to feel him against me\u2014inside me. I want nothing to be exchanged between us but hot air and long, needy stares. We exchange punishing kisses up the stairs and into the bedroom before he lowers me onto our messy bed, pressing his hard, heavy body against mine. I can feel every inch of him and the rough denim of his jeans cause goosebumps to break across every inch of the exposed flesh of my legs. His obvious arousal presses firmly against my core as his mouth hungrily consumes mine. I moan against his lips as his rough hands reach under the hem of my shirt and grasp my bare hip. His hand lingers there for a few seconds before he runs a living finger along my side, making me shiver. And then he stops. He pulls his mouth back, barely an inch from mine.</p><p>\u201cWe should talk about what happened.\u201d</p><p>Desperately, I grip the hem of his shirt and squeeze it in my hands. \u201cWe can talk... we can talk later, I promise,\u201d I tell him breathlessly. \u201cBut for now let\u2019s touch. Only touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you a lot...\u201d he admits. \u201cI did and said some fucking horrible things today... things I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re ever going to forgive me for. I\u2019m willing to explain everything to you right now, O. Are you sure you want to wait?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pleading in his expression\u2014like he\u2019s asking me not to wait, but I need him now. I need him more than I\u2019ve ever needed him... I need him to make me feel loved before he ruins it. Yep, I know he\u2019s going to tell me something that\u2019s going to ruin this. Darryl gave me a heads up\u2014not intentionally\u2014but I know a warning when I hear one. Darryl came here and spoke about a little stunt Seth played for the MMAC today. He didn\u2019t say what happened, only that Seth will tell me. It\u2019s playing at the very back of my mind and I\u2019m choosing to ignore it... because I trust him. If he thinks it\u2019s worth telling, he will. Seth isn\u2019t Blade. He\u2019s not a coward or sneaky. Seth\u2019s straight up... if he\u2019s done something wrong by me, he\u2019ll admit it. Besides, Selena was there. If he did anything she thought would hurt me, she\u2019d defend me. She\u2019d tell me... like I told her what Jackson was doing, even though she knew already.</p><p>With a small, confirming nod of my head, Seth comes out in full force, managing to undress us both quicker than ever before. I kneel on the bed and Seth, and all of his naked glory, joins me. He plants his hands firmly on my hips and lowers his mouth to my neck. A moan ripples from my chest as he kisses my collar bone, sucking the flesh between his supple lips. Inside, my blood burns and heats my flesh as he cups my breast. Releasing my skin, he brings his face directly in front of mine and he\u2019s smiling his Goddamn smile\u2014a smile I feel like I haven\u2019t seen in forever.</p><p>\u201cI thought I lost you today...\u201d he tells me. \u201cI thought I was going to have to break some serious laws to get you back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you can hang your outlaw hat up, cowboy,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019ll never lose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get that in writing?\u201d</p><p>I smirk. \u201cHow about I seal it with a kiss instead?\u201d</p><p>I press my lips to his and shiver as he glides his hand over my skin. His rough fingers snake between our bodies before slipping between my legs. The second he touches my center, he groans into my mouth and the low sound causes a sudden flash of heat to shoot down my spine. I\u2019m unable to get into a groove before Seth scoops me up and turns me around, and I gasp as he shoves me onto my knees and I catch myself on my hands.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to show you?\u201d he moans into my ear, taking a fistful of my hair as he palms my ass with the other. \u201cDo you want me to fuck you like I lost you?\u201d His voice is rough, and I can feel him pressing against my ass as his other hand holds me in place.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I swallow, nodding. \u201cI want you to.\u201d</p><p>I try my hardest not to let him know how his desire and aggressive force is making me wet for him, but fail when he trails the very tip of his index finger between my creases. Amazing sensations seize my entire body and I roll my hips back on him. He pinches and squeezes me everywhere, like he\u2019s missed every inch of me in the small amount of time he was gone. I really do love the way he handles me. No one can build me up quite like Seth does. Hell, he does me better than I do myself.</p><p>He moves his own hips, grinding himself low on my backside, forcing me to feel all of him against my back. He feels good, he always feels good.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you want, Olivia?\u201d he rasps in a gravelly voice that makes my skin tingle. I moan as his hand claims my nipple between his fingers and he bucks against my back. \u201cYou want me to treat your body like I haven\u2019t touched it in ages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, yes,\u201d I groan in a soft, breathy voice that barely sounds like my own. \u201cI want passion. I want you, Seth.\u201d</p><p>I love it when he makes me beg for him because it\u2019s in those moments I can show him how desperate I am to have him close. Both of his hands palm my breasts now, and it feels like he builds me up using only my breasts for hours before his mouth finally claims my neck and breaks up the sensation. While he teases me, touches and caresses me, all I can think about is tasting him. When the need becomes unbearable, I still his hands by placing mine on top.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I pant, my breath coming out quick and fast.</p><p>He stops and removes his hands from me. I try not to pout as his warmth leaves the surface of my skin and I remind myself that he\u2019s going to touch me again soon. First, I have to please him. I turn around and take in his entire form. He stares down at me through lusty slits as I let my eyes devour him. He looks fantastic\u2014every developed inch of him. I take his rock-hard erection in my hand, sliding the palm of it up and down his shaft a few times. His eyes widen, realizing my intent as I lean in and lick the very tip. He groans, letting his head fall back and his thick fingers run through my hair. He tightens his fist, gripping until my scalp burns...and I love it. I suck the head between my lips, keeping my eyes trained on his exposed throat. He swallows hard, making his Adam\u2019s apple bob, before angling his head back in my direction. Our eyes meet and fireworks explode inside of me, setting my organs alight as I circle him with my tongue, collecting a sudden amount of precum. My strokes are purposely shallow, rarely moving my lips past his head and I know the technique both thrills and frustrates him.</p><p>He tastes good\u2014he always tastes good. In my hair, his fingers contract and relax, over and over again. It makes my skin erupt with goosebumps. I love working him up this way, playing only with the very tip.</p><p>\u201cFuck, O. Go deeper,\u201d he commands, but never pushes any further.</p><p>I smile. He can never stand it when I tease him for too long. Conceding, I suck him further into my mouth, moving my fingers lower on his shaft, and every now and then, without warning, I abruptly take him deeper, making his fingers tighten, his chest rumble and the bed shake. This is where I need him... right here with me\u2014inside of me. I don\u2019t care how just as long as he is.</p><p>Loosening his grip on my hair, he grabs my head and pulls me off of him. The head slips out from between my lips with a pop as he encourages me upward. Without a word, he crushes my lips to his and kisses me passionately, forcing his tongue into my mouth. He kisses me until I\u2019m out of breath, until I\u2019m certain all color has drained from my face and pooled in my lips.</p><p>\u201cGod, Olivia,\u201d he says softly, moving down to scatter my throat with kisses and licks. Eventually, my back arches as he lowers his head, taking my incredibly hard nipple into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou have the nicest tits I\u2019ve ever seen, I swear,\u201d he mumbles with a mouth full of my breast. As he teases my nipple on the tip of his tongue, his hand ventures south and he slowly lowers me onto my back. The cold, satin sheets cool my burning skin, creating a new sensation I feel from the tips of my fingers right down to my toes, and it\u2019s not another moment before he spreads my legs with his hand, parts me with his fingers, and rubs my clit, eliciting a verbal shudder from me.</p><p>Finally, he\u2019s touching me where I need it the most. His fingers slowly rub me up and down, pinching my clit between his thumb and forefinger before sliding right to the entrance. I flex my hips, encouraging him to just fucking take me already. I need him to. I need him to catapult me over the edge of insanity so I can lose myself for a few minutes. A few minutes of bliss only Seth can provide are what I want. Slowly but firmly, he slips a finger into me. I grip the sheet, bunching them up in my hands in an attempt to keep myself still. Don\u2019t come yet. Not yet. I want this to last.</p><p>\u201cYou're so fucking pretty down here, baby,\u201d he says, making my cheeks heat up. \u201cAnd wet\u2014so fucking wet.\u201d He adds another finger and now I feel full\u2014full to the point of exploding. I barely have time to register the second finger before his tongue flattens against my clit. Inevitably, my hips buck into his mouth, forcing him harder against me\u2014even catching some teeth. It feels good\u2014he makes me feel good. I feel a familiar tingle begin to work its way from my core outwards, not stopping until it wraps tightly around my spine and radiates down all of my nerves. As I start to edge off into an abyss of ecstasy, Seth deprives me of his mouth and I\u2019m suddenly yanked up and thrust towards the head of the bed. I grip the headboard as he grabs my hips and pushes on my lower back, making my ass jut outwards. He strokes my ass cheek with his stiff shaft\u2014once, no, twice\u2014before he slips it between my legs, coating himself in my wetness. In a swift, forceful movement, he enters me completely, taking me off guard. My fingers dig into the wood and I cry out at the sensation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming unless it\u2019s on my cock,\u201d he whispers harshly in my ear. He nips at the lobe, making me moan and wince at the same time.</p><p>In another swift movement, he pulls out of me completely, leaving me feeling totally empty. I drop my head against the wooden headboard. I can\u2019t take much of his teasing, not right now.</p><p>\u201cSeth...please,\u201d I beg.</p><p>\u201cI nearly lost you, baby,\u201d he says, and I can hear the smile in his voice. \u201cI want to take my time with you.\u201d</p><p>He enters me again, slower this time. Inch by inch he pushes it, making my head spin, until he\u2019s fully inside me. My lips twitch as he holds himself there, kissing my shoulder ever so sweetly. His body molds so perfectly to mine and he fits so perfectly into me that it assures me we are meant to be together. He is mine and I won\u2019t share him... not for another nine months, at least. I grip his hands and pull them around my stomach and up to my breasts. He takes over, squeezing them roughly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis body is going to change...\u201d I murmur over my shoulder and against his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose this body, Seth. Show me how much you\u2019re going to miss it.\u201d</p><p>I move my hands to the headboard again, bracing myself, hoping that he\u2019s going to take my advice and run with it. In the next five minutes I want him to drive us both home with the hardest orgasm we\u2019ve ever felt together. With a dark chuckle, he grips my hips and plunges hard into me, almost stealing my breath. I breathe his name loudly whenever my lungs gather enough air. He reaches points inside me that are almost painful, but I can\u2019t feel anything other than his hard length, taking me higher than I\u2019ve ever been.</p><p>\u201cDo you want it hard, Olivia?\u201d he asks in a tone so dark, it\u2019s almost taunting.</p> <p>It makes me so fucking hot and I grind my ass into him, making him moan for a change. \u201cYes, Seth. Fuck me,\u201d I demand as he nips my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFuck you how?\u201d He thrusts again, slower this time.</p><p>I can\u2019t stand it... I need more! I need force!</p><p>\u201cHard,\u201d my voice was barely a moan. \u201cHard... please, hard.\u201d</p><p>I push back into him, and he thrusts hard, meeting me. Both of his hands dig into my hips as he takes control, pulling me back against him in time with his thrusts. He grips my hips so hard, I\u2019m almost certain I\u2019ll be bruised in the morning, but I don\u2019t care. Right now, all I care about is being thoroughly fucked, by the man I thought I lost. I can\u2019t remember ever needing his touch as badly as I do now.</p> <p>Without warning he pulls out and roughly turns me around, throwing me down against the mattress. His body falls with mine, careful not to put his weight on me, and he places himself between my legs. He grabs my thigh and hooks my leg around his hip before forcing himself back into me. As my lips part, I look into his face, and in his eyes, I see his desire. A desire that I\u2019m sure reflects my own. His eyes are dark\u2014all traces of sweet, golden honey gone, and they bore into my own as he fucks me thoroughly. His lips curl with the beginnings of a smirk before he locks his mouth against mine and kisses me so hard I become dizzy. I lock my legs around his waist, unwilling to let him move away from me. This is it. I want to come now with his face barely an inch from my own. This new position filled more parts of me, hit new spots, and I cry out as he hits me hard, deep, and at the right angle. In the pit of my stomach, the balls of my feet, and the tips of my fingers, I feel my climax growing. I grasp Seth\u2019s shoulders, his back, his hair, anything that\u2019ll pull him deeper into me. I feel it then, igniting my body like a firework. I sink my teeth into my lip and groan as my orgasm builds to maximum point and pops over the edge like a champagne cork. I cry out, unable to keep my teeth in my lip as I\u2019m tossed into the throws of orgasm. My nails dig hard into the skin of his shoulders, making Seth hiss. My orgasm barely winds down as Seth kisses me forcefully as his own orgasm claims him. He groans and pants my name in my mouth and against my own lips as I feel him emptying into me. A few minutes later our movements slow, but don\u2019t completely stop as we each come down from our high. I smile lazily at Seth. All I wanted was to feel him inside of me... to fuck all of this morning\u2019s problems away. They say sex doesn\u2019t solve everything... but it\u2019s a damn good starting point. Maybe there\u2019d be no war if everyone was getting regular, mind-blowing orgasms.</p><p>Being with Seth is the best feeling in the world. There are no outside problems. It\u2019s just us, all alone, consumed by passion and the need to take each other to the brink of chaos. It\u2019s in those moments that I feel like everything is okay, that everything is perfect. Seth lowers his head to my chest and holds me tightly</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d he murmurs, sounding tired as hell.</p><p>I run my hand through the back of his hair\u2014up and down\u2014massaging his scalp. \u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you... something I did today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the Aria?\u201d</p> <p>His entire body hardens against mine... and I can\u2019t say that\u2019s a good sign. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Silence falls and I wait patiently, trying my hardest not to assume the worst. I keep my fingers moving in carefree, soothing patterns.</p><p>\u201cHow many days are there until the fight?\u201d</p><p>I frown, mentally counting the days. \u201cMaybe fifteen?\u201d</p><p>Seth lifts his head, bringing his amazing eyes to mine. His damn face is innocent and pleading, like a Goddamn puppy. \u201cFifteen days. In fifteen days I\u2019ll tell you what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen days?\u201d I sound offended. Seth notices too and quickly brings his hands to my face, cupping my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2014don\u2019t freak out. What I did isn\u2019t catastrophic. Trust me. You might blow it out of proportion a little, but I promise it\u2019s not as bad as you\u2019re probably thinking. You\u2019ll understand the second I explain it to you. I know you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so sure I\u2019ll understand, why can\u2019t you tell me now?\u201d</p> <p>His stare flickers to my lips before settling back on my eyes. In that brief movement, I see everything. They say more than his words ever can...</p><p>\u201cBecause you might lose me...\u201d I whisper, tears stinging my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re worried you might lose me?\u201d</p><p>He nods, kissing my chin. \u201cGive me a chance to explain what happened. In fifteen days I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightens, making the next few words I want to say feel painful. \u201cDid... did you have sex with someone else?\u201d</p><p>He flinches, like the very question caused him physical pain. \u201cNo, I would never.\u201d</p><p>I let out a breath I didn\u2019t know I was holding and suddenly, all is right in the world again. \u201cThen I can wait fifteen days.\u201d</p><p>Seth kisses me hard, forcing his tongue between my lips and stealing my breath. I kiss him back, letting him know that I\u2019m here for him\u2014forever.</p><p>No matter what he\u2019s done, he has my forgiveness. To me, sex is like giving away pieces of your soul. Every time you have sex, your partner takes a piece of your soul and vice versa. I believe you have a soul mate, so you can take those pieces back every other time you\u2019re intimate together. As long as Seth hasn\u2019t given a piece of him to anyone else, there\u2019s little he can do to lose me. I\u2019ll forgive him for anything and everything as long as his penis doesn\u2019t leave his pants... as long as he doesn\u2019t share his soul\u2014my soul\u2014with anyone else.</p><p>And the main thing is; he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Seth</p><p>I\u2019m awoken in the morning by Olivia diving over me, making the mattress bounce as she makes a break for the bathroom, clutching her stomach and covering her mouth. If that isn\u2019t enough to wake me up, I\u2019m wide awake the second she slams the bathroom door.</p><p>Running a hand over my face, I turn over and look at the clock. 8:00 A.M. I guess I missed training... Olivia and I stayed up late last night talking, and then having sex, and then talking some more. Yesterday I was so certain she\u2019d never want to see me again\u2014especially after I all but demanded she abort our child. She forgave me... she said she understood where I was coming from, and then left me lying here, wondering what great deed I did in my life for destiny to throw me such a fucking amazing girl. She even agreed to wait the fifteen days until after the fight... what kind of woman willingly waits fifteen days to find out a secret from their spouse? A crazy one? Try one that\u2019s crazy in love with you and trusts you, idiot.</p><p>I shake my head and kick back the sheets. Faintly, I hear Olivia groan and then spit before the bathroom tap turns on. I\u2019ll make her some breakfast. If she\u2019s going to be throwing up for the next couple of weeks, the least I can do is keep her belly full.</p><p>Rubbing sleep from my eyes, I stagger over discarded clothing and over to the door. When I pull the door open, I pause as the distinct smell of freshly blended juice and eggs assaults my senses. Closing the door behind me, I descend the stairs and walk into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Darryl cheers, raising a glass of orange juice.</p><p>I take in the scene before me\u2014Jackson is preparing bacon to fry on the pan and Selena is putting celery through a juicer. What the hell is going on?</p><p>\u201cUh... morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making breakfast,\u201d Selena tells me, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I swear, stepping toward Darryl, who sits on a bar stool by the bench. \u201cDid I forget someone\u2019s birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s for...\u201d Selena\u2019s brows furrow. \u201cIt\u2019s for... I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s for, but it was Jackson\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>I look at Jackson, who glances at me and quickly shrugs his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just a nice family breakfast.\u201d</p><p>A family breakfast... I like the sound of that.</p><p>\u201cSeth? Are you cooking?\u201d Olivia shouts from the top of the stairs, making Selena jump. She gives me a questioning look over shoulder that asks \u2018did you tell her?\u2019 I really wish she\u2019d stop freaking out and looking at me with those large, worried eyes. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re having a secret affair. It was a kiss\u2014two kisses\u2014and I haven\u2019t thought about it since. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d Darryl snaps under his breath.</p><p>Selena turns the juicer up, drowning out the sound of Olivia coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I told her I\u2019ll tell her after the fight. Thanks for your little input last night, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to\u2014morning!\u201d Darryl cheers over my shoulder, falling back into his happy, cheery persona. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she replies, slipping her hands around my bare waist and pressing her warm face to my back. She kisses me twice before slipping away and sliding onto the bar stool.</p><p>\u201cNo more food poisoning?\u201d Selena asks, switching off the juicer and pouring Olivia a fresh juice.</p><p>An awkward silence falls and Olivia, Jackson, Darryl and I exchange glances. Selena is the only one who doesn\u2019t know O\u2019s pregnant.</p><p>\u201cNope. No more food poisoning.\u201d</p><p>She hands Olivia the glass and we curiously watch the exchange between the two. \u201cI thought so. You\u2019re glowing this morning.\u201d</p><p>I noticed too, and I have to admit I wonder if it\u2019s because she\u2019s pregnant or my bedroom skills are just that good. I lost count how many times I made her break apart in my hands and I snort, setting off a chain reaction with Darryl and Jackson.</p><p>Selena scrunches up her nose. \u201cOh, ew.\u201d</p><p>With a blush as red as cherry, Olivia brings the glass to her lips and drinks the juice, all while shaking her head at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself, Seth.\u201d Jackson chuckles, throwing rashers of bacon down on the pan.</p><p>They sizzle and pop, filling the room with the most delicious smell. I rest against the bench beside Olivia, leaning most of my weight onto my elbows. She shifts uncomfortably and takes a long, nervous sip of her juice. She leans forward on the counter, leaning her mouth against the side of her hand. I feel my eyes widen in realization that she\u2019s about to puke, and sure enough, Olivia twists on the stool and makes a run for the stairs. We watch until she\u2019s slammed the bedroom door and we hear the second slam of the bathroom. Selena looks at me and Jackson drops his stare to the pan, pretending that he\u2019s tending to the bacon. If I look closely, I\u2019m sure I can see his ears straining to hear who\u2019s going to be the one to tell Selena. Darryl scoops up a nearby magazine and pulls it up to cover his face. Pussies. Of course they\u2019re going to make me do it. I reach for Olivia\u2019s glass and take a long sip. Celery, apple, lemon and ginger tickle my taste buds. I lick my lips and set the glass back down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your juice tastes that bad. She\u2019s just over-exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>Selena crosses her arms tightly over her chest as hidden snickers come from Jackson and Darryl. I bite my lip, trying hard not to join them.</p><p>\u201cDid you re-heat the chicken stir-fry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh so hard\u2014until my stomach burns and I\u2019m certain I\u2019m going to die. Jackson and Darryl do, too. \u201cOlivia has been throwing up in the morning for the last few days, she\u2019s glowing, she can\u2019t handle the smell of bacon, and you assume I reheated some of your stir-fry and fed it to her?\u201d I laugh again. \u201cHoly shit, Selena, you\u2019re lucky you decided against a career in law. You can\u2019t put clues together for shit.\u201d</p><p>She pouts her glossed lips, growing more frustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t get it...\u201d</p><p>Jesus. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d get it even if I wrote it all down for her. Jackson must\u2019ve come to the same conclusion as me too, because he groans, \u201cSeth knocked Olivia up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth and Olivia are starting a family together.\u201d Darryl corrects him with stern eyes, making the entire thing sound a hell of a lot more classy than the way Jackson put it.</p><p>Selena\u2019s eyes widen and she covers her mouth with her hand. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>I nod, unable to help a small smile.</p><p>\u201cWith yours?\u201d</p><p>Well, there goes my smile. \u201cOf course with mine. Who else\u2019s would it be?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks blush pink and she shakes her head quickly, making her curls bounce. \u201cRight, sorry.\u201d She falls against the cupboard, staring at me in disbelief. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Is she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she look okay to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>As I finish, Olivia strolls back into the room, drawing everyone\u2019s attention. She moves slowly as she takes it all in. \u201cWell... this is kind of creepy,\u201d she mutters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Selena demands, pushing off of the cupboard.</p><p>I clench my jaw. Selena has no right demanding anything from Olivia, considering she\u2019s keeping her own secrets.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad,\u201d Olivia pleads with Selena. I tug on the belt to Olivia\u2019s dressing gown and pull her in close, tucking her under my arm. Even over the bacon, I can smell the mint on her breath. \u201cI only found out yesterday and Seth and I had some things to sort out first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf anyone has the right to be mad, it\u2019s Seth. Now he has to stop buying bacon,\u201d Jackson interrupts, flipping the first crunchy piece of bacon onto a plate. I laugh, but quickly stop when Selena\u2019s perfectly shaped eyebrows furrow. Swiftly, her angry features smooth out into worry\u2014genuine worry for her best friend and it kind of irks me.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d She steps forward and touches Olivia\u2019s forehead, like a mother does when her child is sick. Beside me, Darryl swears under his breath. Is Selena always this dramatic?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant,\u201d I tell her, feeling a surge of pride in my chest. \u201cNot dying.\u201d</p><p>Selena drops her hand, cradling it to her chest. A look of sympathy crosses her features and I squeeze Olivia even tighter.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how far?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia shrugs. \u201cI tried working it out, but I don\u2019t know how accurate it is... maybe ten weeks.\u201d</p><p>She barely absorbs O\u2019s information before asking another invasive question. \u201cBut you\u2019re still so young... are you going to keep it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelena!\u201d Jackson and Darryl snap at the same time. I don\u2019t blame them\u2014even my body stiffened at the way she said it. I get that this is going to affect her. She\u2019s going to lose her best friend even more than she already has and that can\u2019t be easy, but Jesus Christ, have some kind of sensitivity.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to keep it. It makes no sense to get rid of a child I\u2019ve created with Seth. We\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>Selena presses forward. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you want to do before children? Like travel or study?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shakes her head and I peer down at her. She has a small curve to her lips that makes my heart pound. \u201cYou\u2019re saying it like I can\u2019t do those things with a child. A baby doesn\u2019t restrict you from doing what you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut there\u2019s so much going on in your life right now. You live in Vegas, Jackson lives at your home back in Portland, and Seth\u2019s career is hardly the kind of caree\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck my career.\u201d I shrug, straightening my posture and squaring my shoulders.</p><p>The kitchen falls silent and only Selena and Olivia stare at me. How dare Selena come in here and try to pull this shit right in front of my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Selena murmurs.</p><p>\u201cI said fuck my career and fuck you too, Selena.\u201d My voice comes out louder than I expected.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Olivia snaps, stepping away from me and closer to Selena.</p><p>\u201cYeah, watch it, Seth,\u201d Jackson warns me, but I\u2019m not afraid of him\u2014or any one of them. I don\u2019t dare pull my stare from Selena\u2019s narrowed slits.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and let you try and push my wife towards an abortion. She\u2019s made up her mind and she\u2019s going to keep it. Don\u2019t try and suck happiness from other people\u2019s lives because you don\u2019t have any in yours.\u201d</p> <p>Selena face contorts in offense. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to push her toward anything. As her best friend, I\u2019m looking out for her, trying to help her make the right choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right choice? What choice is there to make? It\u2019s happened, she\u2019s pregnant. The deed is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d Darryl interrupts, rising to his feet. \u201cThis has gone far enough. Here\u2019s how the rest of this morning is going to go; Selena, you\u2019re going to mind your own business. Seth and Olivia have decided to keep and raise their baby in Portland, with or without your permission. Seth, you\u2019re going to sit your ass down and relax while Jackson keeps cooking that glorious bacon. I\u2019m hungry, which means I\u2019m not in the mood for this. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Keeping my eyes zeroed in on Selena, I drop onto my stool. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>I look at Olivia, and seeing her all cute and shit in her robe makes my anger seep from my pores and then disintegrate into nothing but love. I\u2019m just trying to defend her, to defend us. Olivia had to put up with enough abortion talk from me yesterday and I never want to hear the word again. Selena turns back to her juicer and flicks it on, ignoring the rest of the kitchen. To be honest, I really don\u2019t mind it. I twist on my chair, inviting Olivia to come stand between my legs. She does without a word, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because she wants to be here or she doesn\u2019t want to make me mad. Again, I really don\u2019t mind as long as she\u2019s near me... where I can touch her and protect her.</p><p>Once breakfast is served, and Olivia has thrown up three more times, we move to the dining table to eat. While everyone else loaded up on the eggs, bacon and bread, Olivia filled her plate with fresh fruits and dry toast. It was funny watching her.</p><p>\u201cOf all the foods it had to be bacon.\u201d She pouted, watching Darryl and Jackson eat strap after strap.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I tell her with a smile.</p><p>The sadistic bastards cooked so much bacon, knowing well and truly that I can\u2019t eat it. My fight is two weeks away and I have to make sure I weigh in at the right weight. One single, miserable piece was my limit and I took it all in one bite.</p><p>When breakfast was over, I sent them on their way so Olivia and I could have some alone time before my training session this afternoon. I lay propped up with cushions on the couch just watching the clouds roll by outside of my window. They blow over quickly. It must be a windy day in Vegas.</p><p>Footsteps draw my attention back into the room and my gaze focuses on two cute little feet with pink toenails. They get closer and closer and I finally lift my eyes to Olivia\u2019s hands and watch them slowly undo the furry belt that holds her robe together. She pulls it open, revealing her pink, see-through babydoll\u2014the one she changed into last night that provoked our second act of passion. My eyes zero in on her flat tummy and slowly rise to her perky, swollen breasts... coincidently\u2014besides the matching underwear\u2014it\u2019s the only fabric that isn\u2019t see through. A woman designed the outfit, obviously. No man would ever tease another man so horribly. They know exactly how uncomfortable it feels to be teased.</p><p>The robe falls down her arms and she flicks her long, chocolate hair over her shoulders before sliding onto me. Her body feels so fucking good against mine\u2014so warm and perfect. I eye her cautiously, waiting for the catch. She hasn\u2019t really spoken to me since I snapped at Selena and now she\u2019s all over me. There\u2019s something wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy with this now?\u201d she asks, her voice light and hopeful as she places a hand on her tummy.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I reply, reaching up and tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not going to be perfect and I\u2019m probably going to mess up a bunch of times, but I\u2019ve got you. Whatever you want, whatever you need, and whatever you crave, I\u2019ve got you covered.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she leans forward and sensually kisses my chin, waking all of the cells in my body.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate what you did for me,\u201d she says, this time kissing my lower lip. I suddenly notice her bare thighs pressing firmly against either side of my hips and I feel my cock stir.</p><p>\u201cWith Selena?\u201d I clarify and she nods.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>She nods again, taking my hands in hers and placing them on her firm ass. She pulls on my wrists, forcing my hands to lift her flimsy babydoll and subtly flexes her hips into me.</p><p>\u201cI know it came from a good place.\u201d She kisses me again and again. \u201cI love it when you defend me.\u201d</p><p>O lowers her mouth to my neck, catching a small fraction of skin between her teeth. I groan, pressing her ass down and pushing her right against my arousal. Through my sweatpants, she\u2019ll undoubtedly be feeling it. She shifts her hips, pressing her core against me, and even through the fabric I can feel her warmth radiate from between her legs. I grind my hips into her and she moans, moving against my concealed cock. If I\u2019m not careful, I\u2019m going to ruin my favorite pair of sweatpants. Who am I kidding? Coming to her grinding on my cock isn\u2019t the worst way to lose a pair of pants.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d I moan, pulling her forward, pressing her forehead to mine.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her breath hits my face in a needy burst of air.</p><p>She closes her eyes and swallows hard, but her hips never stop moving. She grinds them into me, moving them strategically\u2014urgently\u2014and I know what she wants. She wants to come now. She doesn\u2019t want the whole show. She just wants to come selfishly, by herself. I smile. I\u2019ll give it to her. It\u2019s the least I can do, really.</p><p>Releasing her ass, I tug on her babydoll and pull it off over her head before tossing it to the floor. Her breasts are exposed, bouncing and jiggling right in my face, and I watch, completely mesmerized. There\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be right now. This is fucking heaven. I pinch one nipple between my thumb and index finger while sucking the other between my lips. Her back arches, her eyes never leaving mine. I watch her closely\u2014from her parted lips to her lust slits. She\u2019s close, I can tell by the way her cheeks turn pink like a late sunset. I thrust hard once as she grinds her hips.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d she cries in a husky, tired voice before her thighs squeeze my hips and her body moves unevenly against mine.</p><p>She comes. She comes without me putting anything inside her and without using my fingers to rub her. When she\u2019s come down from her high, she stares at me with her breast still in my mouth and her breath hitches as she fingers the string on my pants.</p><p>\u201cTake these off.\u201d She orders in a harsh whisper and I let her nipple go with a smirk.</p><p>Well, shit. I think I\u2019m going to like this pregnancy thing.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Olivia</p><p>I don\u2019t know what happened. One minute Seth is mad that I\u2019m pregnant and the next he\u2019s bending over backwards for me. I went to the doctor and had an ultrasound done. I\u2019m eleven weeks now and everything\u2019s looking good. Of course, Seth asked if there\u2019s any way he can tell if it\u2019s a boy or a girl, but the radiologist couldn\u2019t, obviously. When we left, Seth was more excited than I was. Then again, he wasn\u2019t the one that had to hold their bladder while the radiologist smeared jelly on his abdomen and pushed down on it. Hard.</p><p>From there, he took me to the Fashion Show Mall on Las Vegas Boulevard to do some shopping. Thankfully, I managed to talk him out of buying a whole heap of ridiculous things like bassinettes and cots (yes, plural), baby monitors (yes, plural again) and even potties. I didn\u2019t, however, protest when he wanted buy a book on pregnancy... and now I\u2019m starting to regret it. He reads it constantly, and now that Darryl has stopped Seth\u2019s training one week out from the fight to avoid incidental accidents and swelling, it\u2019s all I hear about. In the back section of the book is a small recipe booklet filled with pregnancy safe meals. Following that, Seth threw out all of his bacon, all of the processed meats that I used to be able to eat, most of his fish, all of the cold roast chicken, the semi-soft cheeses\u2014just to name a freaking few. He\u2019s filled the fridge with even more fresh fruits and vegetables, which should impress his nutritionist. She hated looking in our fridge most weeks.</p><p>\u201cO!\u201d Seth shouts from the living room. \u201cO! You gotta hear this!\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and stroll from the bathroom, dragging my feet. I walk through our bedroom and lean against the door frame at the top of the stairs. I can\u2019t help but smile when I see Seth lying on the couch, his nose glued to the book. He peers up at me from over the pages and sweet mother of God he looks good with his nose in a book. If I watched porn, this would be it. This image right here would be at the top of my bookmarks list.</p><p>\u201cWhat can\u2019t I do now?\u201d I tease, folding my arms.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sit on hard surfaces because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I exhale, cutting him off. \u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>Forgetting his tip, he nods.</p><p>\u201cClose the book and come here.\u201d</p><p>With a stupidly adorable and extremely suspicious kink in his eyebrow, he closes the book and drops it on the floor. I tap my fingers along my arm as he makes his way over to me, causing the bottom of my feet to vibrate as he carries his large body up the stairs. He waits, his body inches from mine. The body heat that pours from him makes my breast swell harder and my nipple squeeze against my confining bra. I step forward and wrap my arms around his neck, pulling his face closer to mine.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what you told Selena last week?\u201d</p><p>His body tenses slightly, like it always does when I mention Selena these days. I know they have a bit of a rocky relationship... but lately it seems like there\u2019s no hope for them to become friends. Seth shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cYou told her that I\u2019m pregnant, not dying.\u201d</p><p>He visibly relaxes. \u201cThat was different. I can take care of you and I can fret over you, she can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Of course only Seth would be jealous of his wife\u2019s best friend\u2014not that he\u2019ll ever admit it. He doesn\u2019t like it when someone else takes care of me or asks me if I\u2019m okay. As far as he\u2019s concerned, he\u2019s the only one capable of taking care of me and I love him for it, but there are other important people in my life, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not different. You\u2019re weighing in tomorrow, so don\u2019t worry about me. Worry about what you\u2019ve got going on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wraps his arms around my waist, holding me close. \u201cI just want to make sure everything goes okay.\u201d He kisses my nose then bites back a nervous smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anything so badly in my life than to have this child with you.\u201d</p><p>And just like that my heart melts from the sudden blaze that rips through my veins. I look at him from under my brow and his eyes flare.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Mr. Marc, your words are making my hormones want to do naughty things.\u201d</p> <p>His hands slide from around my waist to my breasts and he strokes a heavy thumb over the nipple. My breath hitches in my throat as I let my head fall against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd my hands?\u201d he murmurs in a low, gravelly voice, right by my ear.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not changing anyone\u2019s mind, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d I tell him, suddenly breathless.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He kisses my lips and my eyes flutter shut. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>I nod, urgently. I want him so badly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you something,\u201d he says with a cocky smile, then he pulls away and heads down the stairs. Slowly, my wits start coming back to me.</p><p>\u201cSeth! That\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d I call as he reaches the bottom. He smirks back at me from over his shoulder before disappearing into the kitchen. I get the feeling he knows that\u2019s not what I meant. \u201cDoes your book say anything about teasing a pregnant woman?\u201d I shout after him. \u201cHave a look in the glossary. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it under the parental headings, \u2018not cool\u2019 and \u2018absolute must not\u2019s for potential fathers if they want to live.\u2019\u201d</p><p>His beautiful laugh echoes around the hotel and I slump against the wall, waiting for my knees to stop wobbling and my blood to slow down. What. An. Ass.</p><p>I smile to myself as I push off the wall and head down the stairs. I guess I could go with a sandwich...</p><p>In the kitchen, Seth is piling spinach, lettuce, freshly cut roast beef, and tomatoes onto a slice of rye bread. I\u2019m not a big fan of rye bread, but Seth read that it was the best kind of bread to eat... which means that\u2019s the only bread I\u2019m allowed to eat. I slip onto the stool and rest my elbows as I watch Seth make my lunch.</p><p>\u201cLooks absolutely delicious,\u201d I say, sarcasm dripping from my words.</p> <p>\u201cKeep talking, Olivia. You\u2019ll beg for more after this one.\u201d His eyes flick to mine and flame brilliantly. \u201cYou always do.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks grow warm as he grins and puts on the top piece of bread. He cuts it into two triangles, plops it on a plate, and slides it across the counter.</p><p>\u201cNot hungry?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m weighing in tomorrow and I\u2019m a tad over the expected weight. Can\u2019t eat or drink until it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. I\u2019m used to it now.\u201d</p><p>I feel bad now, eating when he can\u2019t. As I sit, contemplating a way to get out of eating his sandwich, there\u2019s a knock at the door. Seth leans across the counter, pushing the plate closer to me.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he orders before marching from the kitchen.</p> <p>I take a quick bite while he\u2019s gone and I\u2019m not going to lie\u2014it tastes amazing! There are a lot of unbelievable things Seth can do with his hands and I\u2019m adding sandwich making to the list. As I chew, I can hear Darryl\u2019s low, mumbly voice in the background. A couple of minutes later, they join me in the kitchen. Darryl has a wide smile plastered on his face as he takes in my \u2018SETH\u2019 shirt and jeans.</p><p>\u201cExcited for the fight?\u201d Darryl asks, dropping himself on the stool next to me.</p><p>\u201cNope. I just figured a baggy shirt will keep Seth away long enough for me to clean the bathroom without interruption.\u201d</p><p>I blush. I have no idea why I said that\u2014to Darryl especially. Darryl chuckles at my pink cheeks and I pick at my sandwich to avoid looking directly at him.</p><p>\u201cNot with that shirt. Seth loves himself too much.\u201d</p><p>Seth scoffs. \u201cYou two act like wanting to make a girl come is a bad thing. That\u2019s quality husband material right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Darryl and I gasp at the same time. If I was blushing a light shade of pink before, I\u2019m full on red now.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think before you speak?\u201d Darryl asks Seth, and he smiles, proudly.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he begins, ignoring Seth\u2019s response. \u201cI figured I\u2019d come around and discuss a few things about the upcoming fight next week. As you both know we\u2019re making some adjustments to avoid any incidences like last time.\u201d He eyes Seth nervously. \u201cOne suggestion is that we put Olivia ringside with Jackson and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. Walking through a rowdy crowd? No, forget about it. Olivia can stay in my room and watch from the T.V.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I chime in. \u201cI want to be there. I want to watch Don lose live, in the flesh, not through a damn box.\u201d</p><p>There was once a time the mere thought of watching a live fight turned my stomach, but I\u2019ve seen it all now, and although the thought of being so close to the cage\u2014where I can feel the floor vibrate under my hands\u2014makes me want to faint, I have to see it. No excuses.</p><p>\u201cI compromised, Olivia. It\u2019s that or you stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I state firmly. \u201cI\u2019m going to be sitting in the crowd or I\u2019m going to be ringside. Pick one.\u201d</p><p>In my front pocket my phone rings, vibrating my entire leg. Without thinking I answer it and put it to my ear. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>I cringe as my mother\u2019s voice rings through my ear. \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I greet her, forcing joy into my voice.</p><p>With that, Darryl squeezes my arm and whispers, \u201cI\u2019ll let you two sort out what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>He leaves. I hit loudspeaker on my phone and lower it to the counter. Seth leans forward, crossing his arms and resting them on the surface. In that position, the lines and ridges in his arms are prominent, making me take notice of the throbbing between my legs.</p><p>\u201cOlivia? Are you there?\u201d Mom calls through the phone.</p><p>Oh. Phone call. Mom. Right.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me. Are you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>I fight the urge to roll my eyes, even thought I know she can\u2019t see it. I don\u2019t want to talk about this. I have to convince Seth that I\u2019ll be fine ringside with him. \u201cMom, now\u2019s not a good time to talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014I had to find out through Selena. You should answer your phone every once in a while.\u201d I sag onto the counter. I\u2019ve been avoiding my Mom\u2019s calls for the past few weeks. I\u2019ve been so busy and she\u2019s getting all \u2018I miss my baby\u2019 again, like she did before Dad died. She\u2019s suffocating me all the way from Portland. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised she called Selena, though. It\u2019s a typical Mom move.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom.\u201d I sigh. \u201cSeth and I are having a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her when they were going to tell us?\u201d I hear Seth\u2019s mom, Vanessa, shout in the background.</p><p>I\u2019m happy those two have hit it off and they\u2019ve become really close since Dad died and Vivian got out of rehab, but man, they really know how to gang up on Seth and I.</p><p>\u201cNever, Mom,\u201d Seth says into the phone and they both gasp. I reach across and slap him on the arm, and he chuckles. He knows better than to torment them. When they\u2019re together, phone calls can last hours. Literally hours. Not tormenting them means less time on the phone. Thank God they don\u2019t know how to set up Skype themselves.</p><p>\u201cWhen we hit the safety mark,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>\u201cAt fifteen weeks,\u201d Seth adds, feeling superior knowing all of these pregnancy things.</p><p>\u201cHow far are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven weeks.\u201d</p><p>They gasp again. \u201cYou were going to wait four more weeks to tell us? Olivia James, that\u2019s outrageous.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s jaw ticks at Mom\u2019s use of my old last name. I tell him it\u2019s an old habit of hers, but he insists I correct her every. Single. Time. He gives me that look, the intense look from underneath his brow that I can\u2019t argue with.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s not Olivia James anymore and second of all, we don\u2019t want to get anyone\u2019s hopes up.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, quiet pause before the Moms erupt into a fit of squeals and claps. \u201cOh, Olly. We can turn Chase\u2019s bedroom into a nursery and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Seth laughs, cutting Mom off. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Mrs. James.\u201d</p><p>I hate it when Seth refers to my mother by her last name. She hates it too, but he won\u2019t use her first name. What can I say? He likes getting under my mother\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it all taken care of,\u201d he assures her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all taken care of?\u201d she asks, her voice laced with skepticism.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to save the surprise until after my last fight, but since you\u2019re so sure I haven\u2019t planned anything, I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d A proud smile takes over his features and he circles the kitchen counter, coming to a standstill beside me. I lock eyes with his, unable to look away. \u201cI bought another house in Portland. Olivia and I are going to live there with our new baby.\u201d</p><p>My heart swells in my chest and it presses against my lungs that now squish into my ribcage. \u201cYou did?\u201d Mom and I ask at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Mom is talking in the background, something about turning Chase\u2019s room into a nursery anyway, for when she babysits, but I don\u2019t really hear her. All I hear is the quick, uneven tempo of my swollen heart. I grab at Seth, pulling him into me and kissing him hard. I feel him smile against my mouth and I return it. I\u2019ll admit I was a little worried about how we were going to handle the whole house situation. With Jackson, Seth\u2019s mom, and Selena practically living in Seth\u2019s current house, I chose to continue living with Mom until the rest find permanent housing. He fixed that. He bought a whole new house just for us... for his small little family.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d Mom calls. \u201cOlivia, are you there?\u201d</p><p>I slap the screen of my phone over and over again without breaking away from Seth\u2019s lips, until it hangs up.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I say when I pull away.</p><p>My lips graze his as I trail the tips of my fingers down his torso, loving the way his lower abdominals tremble under my touch.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think I just proved that I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to deny that. \u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my face, pulling me hard against him. Our lips collide and electrical currents surge form his fingertips and into my body. We\u2019re exchanging energy, getting higher and higher as static energy flows through us. I\u2019m ready to go\u2014ready to do whatever he wants to do, but there\u2019s one thing I have to take care of first. With Seth, I\u2019m not above using sex to get what I want, so I dip my hand under the hem of his pants and grip his semi-hard length in the palm of my hand. He groans, biting down on my lower lip and making me gasp. I open my mouth and he jams his tongue inside, stealing all of the air from my lungs. I pull away from his mouth and he growls low in his chest, grips my ass, and tugs me forward. I have no choice but to wrap my legs low on his hips. My heart rate increases, sounding like ten horses beating quickly down a track.</p><p>\u201cYou want me, don\u2019t you?\u201d I tease, minutely moving my hand against him.</p><p>He smirks a dark kind of smirk\u2014one that dares me to tease him. \u201cIs it obvious?\u201d</p><p>Returning his devilish look, I suck my thumb into my mouth, wetting it with my saliva before lowering it to his pants and pressing it to the very tip of his erection. He expels a heavy exhale as I swirl my thumb around and around, mixing my spit with his precum. His fingers dig into my hips, threatening to bruise if I don\u2019t stop teasing him. There\u2019s only one question he has to answer in order for me to stop teasing. If he answers it correctly, he can have me anyway he wants. Judging by how urgently he\u2019s handling me, I assume fucking on the kitchen counter isn\u2019t a far cry away. The thought thrills me to no end, making me pool between my thighs instantly.</p><p>\u201cYou want me ringside, don\u2019t you?\u201d I ask, squeezing him tightly in my hand.</p><p>He grits his teeth, refusing to answer, so I circle his tip and bring my mouth closer to his. He goes to kiss me, but I barely let our lips graze.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Olivia,\u201d he mutters under his breath, his cock straining against its own flesh.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to be ringside with you, Seth?\u201d I try again, my voice sounding awfully husky.</p><p>He nods, his quick, needy breath clashing with mine. \u201cYes,\u201d he breathes. \u201cYes, I want you right there next to me.\u201d</p><p>Victory! I crush my lips to his and his fingers hook under my jeans. He lifts me off of the chair, pushes my sandwich away and lowers me onto the counter. He tugs at my jeans, pulling them down my legs. My bare ass touches the surface and I can hear Selena\u2019s voice in the back of my head, making me giggle. \u2018Ew. People fucking eat here!\u2019</p><p>When my jeans are free, Seth attacks me, draping his body over mine. Electricity flows again, and this time, not even an electromagnetic pulse can save us from ourselves.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Seth</p><p>My knees are weak. My arms... too heavy for my body to carry, and there\u2019s an emptiness in my stomach that I can\u2019t put a finger on. I can\u2019t do this. I have to stop, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t let Don win. Not this time.</p><p>Olivia, Darryl, and Jackson watch me from his corner... sneering at me like I\u2019m no good. The lot of them are wearing their \u2018DON\u2019 shirts, taunting me like we were never a team. I peer over my shoulder, to my corner. The only person in it is Selena, wearing a tight ass \u2018SETH\u2019 shirt. Out of everyone dear to me, the only person I have left is fucking Selena? Great. Just great. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She puckers her cherry red lips and blows a kiss to me, but I don\u2019t reciprocate. Why the hell would I? I shake my head at her, questioning why she\u2019s blowing kisses at me. Turning my attention back to the cage, I look to Don who\u2019s dancing around the ring, mocking me. He has the crowd chanting \u2018Don\u2019 and the sound turns my stomach. Don doesn\u2019t deserve their affection. He isn\u2019t a role model or someone you can look up to. Granted, neither am I, but I\u2019m a better choice, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>My entire body hums with newfound motivation and hate. I feel it consuming my body until it\u2019s seeping from my pores. I watch, building up my anger as he flaunts how happy he is. He stole the happiness from me, just like his spot on the MMAC. Nothing he earns has come from hard work. It\u2019s all been stolen.</p><p>Turning his back to me, Don beckons for Olivia to come closer to him. With a cute smile, she leaves her seat and flattens her sexy red gown with the palms of her hands. She looks good\u2014as usual, but this time it\u2019s not for me. She\u2019s a gorgeous woman practically wrapped up in a big, red bow and I\u2019m not the one who gets to unwrap her. She grips the cage and pulls herself up, leaning her frame against the wire. Don leans in, muttering something I can\u2019t hear. Whatever he says makes Olivia giggle and her glowing, green orbs flick to me. Her eyes stay trained on me as Don leans in. Closer and closer he draws to her perfect mouth, and I remain still, waiting to see if she lets him kiss her.</p> <p>She does.</p><p>His fucking lips touch hers and she closes her eyes, opening her mouth against his. From there, all I see is red\u2014a red redder than the dress that covers Olivia\u2019s body. I launch forward, moving faster and heavier than a freight train. I growl as I grip his neck, pull him back and punch him square in the face. He falls to the floor with a thud, shaking the whole cage. As he lies on the floor, gripping his face and groaning, I look at Olivia, who glares at me through thin slits and I don\u2019t like the way it makes my heart hurt. Why doesn\u2019t she love me anymore? Why him? I\u2019m screaming the words in my mind, but refuse to voice them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s who you want now?\u201d I demand. \u201cDon-fucking-Russell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She seethes. \u201cI don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d</p><p>I flinch. It\u2019s funny how those five little words can shatter an entire, physical human heart. It\u2019s funny how those five teeny tiny words can make a soft piece of muscle and tissue feel sharp, like razor blades.</p> <p>\u201c...and that\u2019s your fault, not mine,\u201d she adds dejectedly. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>Not on my fucking watch. I launch forward and grab her fingers, clenching the wire with them. She can\u2019t love anyone else\u2014I won\u2019t let her. \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she snaps, snatching her fingers away. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop it, Seth.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah? \u201cFucking watch me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia screams, begging for me to stop as I turn and dive onto Don. I squeeze his hips between my legs so he can\u2019t move and I send my fists raining down on him. I keep going, forcing my knuckles against his face until it\u2019s stained with blood. All I can hear is the sound of flesh on flesh and Olivia screaming in my ear. Below me, Don ceases to move. I pull back one last time, and as I let my fist fly, Don disappears and I connect with the floor. I stare at the empty space underneath me... it\u2019s not even speckled with a single drop of my revenge. I look up to my old team and they\u2019re gone. The entire arena is empty. The only sound I hear is the soft thud of heels on the mat. Panting, I slowly turn my head in the direction of the noise. My entire body tightens when I see Olivia, looking mad as hell, making her way over to me. Tears glisten in her eyes and reflect on her cheeks under the bright light. She stops two feet from me and I peer up at her. She sniffles, wiping away a tear, and my heart recoils into the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this to me, Seth?\u201d she demands, her voice loud and stressed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this. Stop ruining my life!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ruining your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my fault,\u201d she snaps. \u201cYou chose Selena.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, pleading on my knees. \u201cI\u2019d never choose anyone over you. O, I love you!\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, she slaps me hard across the face. It burns\u2014it fucking stings, but I don\u2019t dare drop my eyes from hers.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to say that to me anymore. I\u2019m not yours.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t care that she hit me. I just want her to love me again. I want her to look at me like she used to\u2014touch me like she used to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your fucking mind if you think I\u2019m going to let you be anything but mine,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be mine. You know it, I know it.\u201d</p><p>She raises her hand again, but this time I catch it before she connects and yank her down onto her knees. She slumps into herself, defeated. Tears fall freely down her cheeks as she lifts her hands to cradle my face. \u201cI fucking hate you.\u201d</p> <p>I slide my hands up her arm and onto the cool, petite hands that rest on my cheeks. \u201cYou fucking love me.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, she smashes her mouth to mine. She claws at my body, pulling me as close as physically possible. I miss her... mentally, I have no idea how long she\u2019s been gone and none of this makes sense, but I miss her regardless. I breathe her in. She smells exactly how I remember\u2014like the fruity body wash she uses that I love so damn much.</p><p>Her tongue collides with mine and she\u2019s the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever tasted\u2014like Skittles, the blackcurrant ones.</p><p>My hands fall from hers and I tug at her dress. It has no zippers, no buttons, and no Goddamn ties, so I rip the damn thing clean from her superb body. She gasps into my mouth, but doesn\u2019t dare peel her lips from mine. I don\u2019t care about her dress, all I know is I need her more than anything in the world, and I will have her.</p><p>I push her onto her back, lowering my body on top of her. The lights above us are bright and warming on the skin. It makes sweat bead between our naked torsos instantly. Olivia desperately pushes at my shorts until my hard cock springs free. Lining myself up, I impatiently thrust into her and the second I feel her soft, velvety tunnel confining me, squeezing me beyond belief, I pull my lips from hers and look into her eyes. A single tear rolls from the corner of her eye and she smiles at me. \u201cI love y\u2014\u201d</p><p>I gasp and my eyes fly open after a strong surge of arousal makes my entire body shiver. My breath is heavy and quick, filling an otherwise silent room. Another kick of pleasure licks my entire being as I try to get my bearings. I\u2019m spooning Olivia... we\u2019re naked and my erection is right between her legs, pressing against her lips. She\u2019s wet and leaking all over me.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d I whisper, rocking her shoulder slightly. No response. \u201cOlivia?\u201d I try again... still nothing.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d she moans, still drifting around sleep land.</p><p>I find myself grinning at the fact she wants me even when she\u2019s sleeping and then I catch myself and swallow it back. I don\u2019t want her to think that I purposely put myself there... that\u2019d be extremely awkward and I doubt I\u2019ll be able to smile my way out of that one. I grip her thigh and lift it slightly\u2014enough for me to pull myself away without catching any skin. As I lift her leg, she grips my arm and I freeze\u2014caught in an even more compromising position. Without a word, she pulls her leg free and plants my hand on her hip as she pushes back into me.</p><p>\u201cStay like this,\u201d she murmurs. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>She snuggles into me and instantly falls back asleep, leaving me to stare into the darkness. There are worse sleeping positions, I suppose. I close my eyes, trying not to focus on how hard I am, how warm she is, or my nightmare. The first two I manage to block out, but the last... I can\u2019t.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>My first guilty dream about what I did behind Olivia\u2019s back. It was a nightmare to rival any nightmare... because there\u2019s a possibility it\u2019ll come true. There\u2019s a possibility that she\u2019ll hate me... that she\u2019ll leave me. I pull her even closer. She can\u2019t leave me, I won\u2019t let her.</p><p>I\u2019m up bright and early. God knows why, I barely slept last night thanks to my horrific nightmare. Why can\u2019t I dream about being stabbed or shot? Hell, I\u2019ll even take falling from a seventy story building over Olivia being with Don. That shit is mentally scarring and I shudder at the recollection.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, Seth?\u201d Darryl asks over his shoulder from the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>Olivia squeezes my hand and rests her head on my shoulder. Every movement she makes eases the anxiety that constricts my chest. It eases the effects of last night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than ready,\u201d I reply, forcing more confidence than necessary in my voice.</p><p>\u201cToo bad we have to see Don\u2019s face so early in the morning,\u201d Jackson says, sticking a leg up on the dashboard and making Selena giggle. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been a perfect day, otherwise.\u201d</p><p>I smirk and Darryl slaps down Jackson\u2019s leg. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, boy? Your parents didn\u2019t teach you any manners?\u201d</p><p>Jackson looks back at us, grinning. He loves to mess with Darryl and he does it whenever he can. Like the photo he took of Darryl passed out in the cab after our not so awesome visit to the Spearmint Rhino a little while back. He sent it in a text to all of the contacts on his and Darryl\u2019s phones. Now, Darryl watches how many drinks he has around Jackson and I don\u2019t blame him. Once at a beach party in Newport, I passed out and Jackson dragged me right to the edge of the ocean. As the tide came in and the waves rolled up, I got soaked, losing both my cell phone and my wallet. Screw sleeping when Jackson\u2019s around.</p><p>We roll slowly through the parking lot of the official MMAC building. It looks all grey and cold. At the very front, underneath the massive red and black \u2018MMAC\u2019 sign is their slogan: \u2018Be strong. Be smart. Be great.\u2019 It makes me cringe. I hate that such a meaningful thing is being used by people who don\u2019t understand the meaning of it, and I hate that a company that I used to hold in such high esteem isn\u2019t the company I thought it was. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore, I suppose. Once I\u2019m done with Don, I\u2019m finished with the company and I\u2019m going to take their pretty little lie of a slogan and use it for myself. \u2018Be stronger. Be Smarter. Be Greater.\u2019 Yep. That\u2019ll look real nice on a billboard on top of my gym. I\u2019m not going to take the high road, either. I choose to take their slogan as a reminder that I am stronger, smarter and greater than them. I\u2019m better than them\u2014better than their entire company, and I can\u2019t believe I gave everything I had to train and learn how to make it into their world. Since being with the MMAC, not once have I been happy. They\u2019ve crushed my soul... taken away my passion to fight for them. We don\u2019t realize that the thought of something is often nicer than the reality. On T.V. and in interviews, Matt Somers looks like a nice guy who drops the \u2018f\u2019 bomb too often, but behind closed doors, he\u2019s a fucking shark at the head of a multi-million dollar franchise. Our passion as fighters fuels his career. Without us, he doesn\u2019t have a job, but without him, neither do we. I\u2019ve thought it through quite thoroughly. Instead of relying on each other and treating each other as mutual business partners, Matt Somers treats us like Goddamn show ponies\u2014like fucking dogs. He rubs money in our faces and lets us off our leash to find more and bring it back to him, submitting at his feet. No matter how I think it through\u2014positively or negatively\u2014I always come to the same conclusion.</p><p>Fuck the MMAC.</p><p>The room is silent. No one makes a sound. Instead, they watch Don\u2019s weigh in on a mute T.V. I don\u2019t look. I don\u2019t think I can stomach seeing his face this early in the morning\u2014especially after the dream I had. As ridiculous as it sounds, I want him to pay for my nightmare. I want to blame him for it, beat him until he apologizes...what the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>I lift my eyes from the floor and glance around the plain room. It\u2019s empty, filled only with a sink, a bench, a couple of chairs and a tiny speaker in the corner of the room. Matt Somers has put on a full show for everyone today. The conference room at the back of the building is packed to the rafters\u2014filled with eager reporters and fans. One after the other he wants us to go out and he wants us to put on a show.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right on weight,\u201d Darryl tells me and I nod, still avoiding the screen. \u201cDid you weigh yourself this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I tell him. Darryl worries about my weigh-ins, he always has, even though I usually follow his regime down to a \u2018T\u2019, excluding his sex rule, obviously.</p><p>\u201cSeth, you\u2019re up,\u201d a husky, female voice announces through the speaker box. Darryl jumps to his feet quicker than any of us and opens the door. I stand up, straighten my shirt, and grab Olivia\u2019s hand when she brushes past me. I squeeze it tightly, keeping her strapped to my side. Her fingers tighten around mine and she rests her other hand on my forearm. When I peer down at her and she smiles up at me, I\u2019m ready to leave the room.</p><p>The corridor is long and empty and there are no colors, only dull shades\u2014depressing dull shades. I hear shoes connect quickly with hard concrete and echo in my head. In the distance, I can just make out Matt\u2019s voice beaming through a microphone as he tells the crowd about the history behind Don and I. Over and over he repeats how much we hate each other, and I can almost feel the crackle of excitement penetrate the walls and crash into me. As I draw closer to the doors, adrenaline builds, making my veins fill thick and my head spin. It\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ll miss once I quit.</p><p>I stop as Darryl and Jackson step in front and push the doors open. The semi-large crowd cheers, the sound causing goosebumps to erupt over the back of my neck and spread over my cranium. My gaze settles onto the banner hanging behind the stage. It\u2019s of Don and I. My photo is an old one\u2014from when I first signed with the MMAC, and the memory makes me grimace. I move quickly, making my way to the stage in front of me. Olivia keeps up with me, taking longer strides to match mine. As I round the front of the stage, she gives me one last squeeze of reassurance and lets go of my hand. I let her finger slip from mine as she stops and I keep going, angling my head down to avoid camera flashes that go off from every direction. Jackson and Darryl are close behind me, and once I\u2019m up the stairs and on the stage, I waste no time. I yank my shirt off over my head and toss it at Jackson. One by one I kick off my shoes and pull off my socks. The air conditioning billowing out of the vent above me is cold on my skin and I quickly step out from underneath it as I pop the button to my jeans. I ignore the wolf whistles as I drag my jeans down my legs and kick them into a heap on the floor. I glance down at my tight, blue shorts. They make me feel more feminine than I like, but it\u2019s these or go naked, and today, I\u2019m not in the mood to show the whole world my junk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I make my way to the scale\u2014toward Matt and Don. I look at Matt first, who stands proudly in his expensive black suit, smiling at me like I\u2019m his favorite person on the planet. I give him a subtle nod before looking at Don who, to my surprise, has no cockiness in his face anymore. His brows are furrowed, his eyes dark and punishing. He\u2019s taking this seriously? For once in his life he means business? I smirk at him. Finally.</p><p>I step onto the scale and keep my eyes down as it teeters between okay and overweight. One kilo difference is all I have. When the commissioners stop tapping the bar, it sits square on one hundred and ninety pounds. That\u2019s an all right number for a light heavyweight fighter and I didn\u2019t even have to get naked. The crowd erupts again and more photos ensue. After I stand there for my allocated fifty extra seconds, I step off and stroll back to Darryl and Jackson, who hand me clothes. I manage to only slip on my jeans before Matt grabs my arm, making me drop my shirt on the floor. He leads me back over to the Don\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cPhotos, really?\u201d I complain under my breath, but Matt ignores me.</p> <p>The photo op... the one thing I wanted to avoid more than Don himself.</p><p>I stop directly in front of Don and bring my fists up. He follows my lead, bringing up his own gigantic hands. Our faces are only six inches apart and I grin at him as his big, brute face contorts into a sneer.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know, does she?\u201d he mutters and my whole body tenses, my grin falling from my face.</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know?\u201d Matt chimes in.</p><p>I flick my stare to him, smiling politely for the cameras. Realization lights up his face and he beams at me. \u201cOlivia doesn\u2019t know what you did? Fucking hell, you better pray she doesn\u2019t find out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhether she knows or not is none of your fucking business,\u201d I growl, inching closer to him. My fingers twitch with the urge to drive my fists into his stomach\u2014the both of them. But I don\u2019t. If I act out, it\u2019ll only draw more attention and more questions. I can\u2019t risk Olivia finding out before I tell her. I have to be the one to tell her. I have a better chance at redemption that way.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be a shame if someone were to tell her,\u201d Don says, and without thought... I react.</p><p>I shove his chest so hard I hear air being forced from his lungs. He stumbles backwards two steps before growling and launching forward. I plant my feet and brace for impact, but Matt Somers quickly throws himself in Don\u2019s path, pressing his hands flat against Don\u2019s stomach. Don stops immediately, having no balls to push through his employer. If it were me, I\u2019d have flattened Matt Somers where he stood. That\u2019s the difference between Don and I. I do what I want and he does what he\u2019s told. A firm slap on my back tells me Jackson is close by in case anything goes down. Not that I need his help to destroy either of the men before me.</p><p>\u201cTension is good, fighting is bad,\u201d Matt barks at me. He looks at Don. \u201cGrab the rest of your clothes and get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>I watch as Don\u2019s coach hands him his shirt and he slips it on over his head. He waves to the cheering crowd before disembarking from the stage. I keep my eyes on him as he strolls along the front, chatting to people as he passes. Matt is in my ear, chastising me for something, but I choose not to hear him. All of my attention is on Don, who draws closer and closer to Olivia. I relax a little as he steps past her without a glance in her direction until a reporter calls him out and pulls him back so he\u2019s standing right next to her. She folds her arms and inches away from him\u2014so does Selena. He doesn\u2019t notice Selena at first, until Selena takes Olivia by the arm and tries to get her to move. It\u2019s then I see the huge smile spread over Don\u2019s lips. I turn and push through Jackson and Darryl to make my way over to them.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d I hear Darryl call, but I keep moving.</p> <p>I watch and walk as Don casually fishes his phone from his pocket while he chats to the reporter. From her document bag, the female reporter \u2013with the long black hair and big eyes only for Don\u2014produces a newspaper.</p><p>\u201cDon!\u201d I shout, thundering down the stairs. His lips twitch, but he doesn\u2019t look at me. He hands the newspaper to Olivia and I already know what\u2019s on the front page. She reaches out for it, but Selena snatches it out of the way, screwing it up against her chest. Olivia frowns at her and then at me before rolling her eyes at Don. As she turns away, Don grabs her arm and pulls her back in, shoving his phone in her face. I glare at his flesh on hers and I feel sick to my stomach. She watches whatever is on the screen and all of her features draw together. I stop a few feet out from them and Selena slowly backs away, nervously twisting the newspaper in her hands. The entire minute she watches the video on the screen feels like an eternity. Every time she flinches or cringes, my heart squeezes in my chest... and then finally her green eyes flick to mine and I see her heart break.</p><p>Olivia</p><p>I take Don\u2019s phone in my hands and continue to watch the video. I can\u2019t let Don get one over me. I won\u2019t. I fake a smile that threatens to break my foundations. Seth didn\u2019t have sex with anyone else... but he kissed a random girl and shared a kiss\u2014two kisses\u2014with Selena? My chest tightens a little bit more. Seth looks at me, his face void of any emotion and for the first time in a very long time, I want to punch him in his beautiful, betraying mouth. I clear my throat and look at Don, who smiles cruelly down at me.</p><p>\u201cYou think I didn\u2019t know about this?\u201d I lie, feeling my soul being crushed deep inside me. \u201cOf course I know.\u201d</p><p>The faltering smile on Don\u2019s face is the only thing that keeps me level headed. I glance at Selena and Seth and the sight of them and their wide, scared eyes grip my heart. How could they? How could Selena not tell me?</p><p>\u201cI knew, right?\u201d</p><p>They both nod, never taking their eyes from mine.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Seth states, his sorrowful eyes finally dropping to the floor.</p><p>I let Don\u2019s phone slip from my fingers and it smashes against the concrete, covering my low pink heels in pieces of plastic and glass.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d I smile, turning and heading towards the corridor.</p><p>I need to get out of here. If I don\u2019t, I think I\u2019m going to cry in front of all these people\u2014in front of Don\u2014and look as stupid as I feel. As I march, I press my tongue to the roof of my mouth to stop the familiar feeling, the feeling of the impending burst of tears. I expected something like this from Seth, I knew the thing he was going to tell me had to be something like this... but I had no idea it would involve Selena. I think that\u2019s what hurts me the most. She\u2019s my best friend, the girl who used to tell me everything. The girl who accidentally told Blade I wasn\u2019t dating Seth when I told him I was, the girl who told my mother I was pregnant without my permission, and the girl who tells everybody about my private life, but can\u2019t confess to something as serious as making out with my husband. Have we really drifted that far apart? I feel like I don\u2019t even know her anymore, and after this, can I really call her my best friend? A best friend would have told me the second it happened\u2014and so would a husband\u2014but at least Seth promised to tell me.</p><p>I push open the door to Seth\u2019s room and slam it behind me. When I\u2019m alone inside, it all crashes down on me and I have no fucking idea what to do. I want my dad... I want my dad to hold me and tell me that it\u2019s going to be all right\u2014that it\u2019s all part of the MMAC and that it\u2019s nothing to get so worked up about. While I was throwing up all alone, Seth was at the Aria casino making out with Selena to get to Don. No wonder the two have been tense the past week, they\u2019ve been keeping a secret from me. I crouch low, covering my face with my hands... but I can\u2019t cry. I feel like crying, but the tears refuse to fall. I feel broken and betrayed, but my body refuses to cry. It\u2019s familiar with this feeling and I\u2019ve trained myself not to make a big deal out of these situations. Is that how fucked up I am? I\u2019ve been betrayed so many times I can\u2019t even cry about it? I jump as the door opens and Seth steps in, quickly shutting the door behind him and locking it. He gives me a pointed look. One that says; \u2018I\u2019m not going to let you leave me.\u2019 I see his intense brown eyes first and my heart stutters. Stupid girl. You\u2019ve forgiven him already. I ignore the reasonable words floating around my skull and stand up straight. Seth eyes me curiously, visibly wondering why I\u2019m not crying.</p><p>I laugh once, nervously, and he cringes. \u201cSo... Selena, huh? I can\u2019t say I saw that coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how it looks, but I had to do something on a large scale to get Matt to leave me alone. I did it for us so we could be together in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether in peace?\u201d I scoff. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve heard that excuse before.\u201d</p><p>He takes forceful steps forward, forcing me back until I\u2019m pressed hard against the wall. His strong arms lean against the concrete on either side of my head and his knee nudges between my legs. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse. I make no excuses for what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want forgiveness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ask for forgiveness for something I chose to do behind your back would be selfish of me. If I wanted you to be okay with it, I would have asked your permission before it went down. I don\u2019t want you to ever forgive me for what I did.\u201d</p><p>But I do already... \u201cForgiving you is easy, Seth. I forgave you the second I saw the clip.\u201d</p><p>He frowns and I continue.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know what the worst part of this is for me?\u201d</p><p>Seth nods. \u201cTell me so I can fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to cry, but I can\u2019t. I can feel it building and constricting my throat, but nothing is happening. My body is registering this as a normal occurrence. It\u2019s almost unfazed by this entire situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe your body knows what I did was business... maybe your heart knows you still have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe my heart is a fucking idiot.\u201d I exhale, closing my eyes for a long second. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve always wanted... just you.\u201d He kisses the corner of my mouth. \u201cI wanted you the second I saw you, I wanted you the night you threw yourself at me, I wanted you when I asked you to marry me and I\u2019ve wanted you every second since.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m hooked on his words, a mesmerized little girl hanging off every sweet, sugary word that falls from his pink lips.</p><p>\u201cEven when you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially then.\u201d He cuts me off, hearing my words before I speak them. \u201cI wanted you more than ever that day. I wanted to tell you\u2014and I was going to when I got home, but you told me you were pregnant and it all seemed to escalate so quickly. I flipped out. I shouldn\u2019t have, but I did.\u201d His hands slide from the concrete and grip my face. He leaves no room for me to move my head. \u201cIt felt mechanical, Olivia. I felt nothing when I kissed those girls.\u201d Seth pushes his hands up my face and into my hair. He pulls on it and my breath hitches in my throat. \u201cYou know I prefer brunettes and your rack is much better than both of theirs combined.\u201d</p><p>Despite his obnoxiousness, I giggle and press my hands against his tight stomach. Cutting the giggle short, I swallow it deep. This isn\u2019t about whether he\u2019s more attracted to me than anyone else. This isn\u2019t even about what I have and they don\u2019t. This is about respect and love... This is about trusting one another and always telling the truth\u2014no matter what. I need reassurance that Seth holds what we have above everything else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to quit all of this, O. For you. For us.\u201d He lowers his hands and presses them gingerly against my belly. \u201cI\u2019d never want to intentionally jeopardize this. You and the baby are my life now. I don\u2019t care about anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say we manage to move on from this... where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitch, warming my heart. \u201cAnywhere you want. I hear Paris is beautiful this time of year.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and he presses his forehead to mine. It occurs to me then that just like that, he wins the fight. And as my mom always says; if someone can bring light into a dark situation, never let them go.</p><p>\u201cTahiti?\u201d I ask. \u201cI prefer pineapples to snails.\u201d</p><p>Seth chuckles and nods as he presses his mouth to my cheek. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Finally, I lift my arms and wrap them around him. He doesn\u2019t feel different. My entire body relaxes into him at the realization. I was worried if I touched him, he wouldn\u2019t feel like mine anymore. I pull him harder against me. He feels the same. He still feels like mine.</p><p>He drops his head, tucking his face into my hair. His breath warms my ear and travels each strand of hair on my head, making me feel dizzy.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby. Only you, forever,\u201d he whispers, kissing my earlobe. \u201cForever, only you.\u201d</p><p>He holds me still and we don\u2019t talk. He doesn\u2019t squeeze me tighter or loosen his grip. We just exist, appreciating the fact that (quite quickly) we\u2019ve come out the other end of something that destroys relationships. There\u2019s no internal struggle between \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019. I forgive him\u2014and forgiving someone isn\u2019t about being stupid or weak. I learned that with Blade. To put things behind you and forgive someone for hurting you is strength in its rawest form. Forgiving someone is something not everyone can do and I know that for a fact. Not everyone has the strength to let themselves be happy\u2014to give something a second shot. A lot of people say they don\u2019t make the same mistakes twice, but if you fall off your bike you get back on it, don\u2019t you? You better yourself, you wear in the bike until you find your groove even though you know you\u2019re going to fall off again. It might not be today or next week, but eventually you will and you know in your heart that you\u2019re still going to ride it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The one thing I took from my relationship with Blade was the experience. Without that particular experience, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see that what Seth did wasn\u2019t so bad. Cheating is getting a reward for something by dishonest means or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation. Seth didn\u2019t choose an easy way out of his situation with Matt. Seth took the hard road, knowing very well that it could hurt me. In order to make Vegas better for me, he had to make it worse for himself\u2014and what\u2019s a kiss you can\u2019t put your heart into, anyway?</p><p>After a few small eternities, he releases me and takes my hand in his. He tugs me towards the door. \u201cLet me take you somewhere, just us.\u201d</p><p>I dig my feet in. \u201cOkay, but answer me one question first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Selena ever going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>The answer Seth provides will tell me everything I need to know about our friendship and what it has dwindled to. Seth drops my hand, running his own over his face and I hold my breath as his dark eyes flick over me. \u201cShe asked me not to tell you, but she was scared, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>His words crack through my block as my vision blurs. \u201cShe asked you...\u201d I inhale and chew my bottom lip to keep it from trembling. \u201cNot to tell me?\u201d</p><p>This time I know it... I can feel it clog my throat and force my jaw to clench irregularly. I\u2019m going to cry.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, O.\u201d Seth sighs, his voice filled with pain and compassion. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>He circles me with his strong arms as the dams break and I sob. He crushes me against his torso and pats my hair as I soak the chest of his shirt.</p><p>My own best friend...</p><p>I don\u2019t get it\u2014I don\u2019t get her anymore. Before I met Seth I couldn\u2019t get her to shut up and now talking to her is like trying to jam a crowbar in a chest welded shut. As friends, where do we go from here? What\u2019s the value in a best friend you can\u2019t talk freely with? What\u2019s that value of a best friend that listens and shares all of your secrets, but refuses to spill theirs? So many questions circle my head\u2014each pushing me closer to what I\u2019m certain is the end of the world. Am I over-exaggerating? Are my hormones out of control already? I\u2019m only eleven weeks. I drag in a shaky breath, hold it, and then expel it. I push off of Seth and swipe the back of my hands under my eyes, collecting the tears I\u2019m suddenly embarrassed for spilling.</p><p>\u201cCan we go?\u201d I sniffle, raking my fingers through my hair. I know I have to talk to Selena at some point, but not today.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll let Darryl know\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to see any of them right now. I just want to get out and go somewhere... anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He nods imperceptibly. \u201cAll right. I know a place.\u201d</p><p>He takes my hand in his again and pulls me towards the door. I don\u2019t want him to open it because I know exactly what\u2019s on the other side and at the moment, I don\u2019t want to see Jackson, Selena, or Darryl. The door opens with a creak and sure enough... there they all stand, looking sullen and regretful. It\u2019s hard to grasp the concept that they all look like that because they kept something from me.</p><p>Selena frees her hands from her skirt pockets and steps towards me. She opens her mouth, but Jackson snags her wrist, pulling her back. She looks at him and he shakes his head, silently telling her to let me leave. Her sad, green stare comes back to me and I quickly shift mine to the door at the end of the corridor. I ignore the silence and focus on Seth\u2019s thumb that soothingly strokes my wrist. It\u2019s the only thing keeping me from falling apart and demanding an explanation from her\u2014from all of them, really. I get that Jackson and Darryl are loyal to Seth, but what about me? What happened to doing what\u2019s right?</p><p>\u201cYou know you have to talk to them sometime,\u201d Seth mumbles as we walk down the narrow hall, towards the emergency exit.</p><p>I guess we\u2019re taking the emergency exit so the fans and reporters don\u2019t see us. I doubt my puffy eyes and runny nose will look good. I cringe at all of the stories that could spin from it and how happy they\u2019ll make Don.</p><p>\u201cAnd I will...\u201d I mutter. \u201cJust not here. Not today.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Seth hails a cab and when it pulls over, I climb inside.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bellagio,\u201d he tells the driver as he wraps his arms around me and holds me close. The Bellagio will do\u2014anywhere will do as long as it\u2019s not here or my hotel room. Seth\u2019s scent envelops me and I feel better, so I close my eyes.</p><p>We ride in the taxi for less than twenty minutes, and when I open my eyes, we\u2019re right in front of the Bellagio. My lips stretch across my face as I smile, unable to contain my excitement. This whole time we\u2019ve been in Vegas, Seth promised me we could go and see the fountain show. I\u2019d prefer to see it at night when it\u2019s all lit up, but this is better than nothing and it\u2019ll definitely do the trick and get my mind off things. Seth pays the driver, opens the door, and slides out of the taxi. He extends his hand to me and I take it, squeezing it too eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI know you wanted to see it, but we haven\u2019t been able to go out.\u201d</p><p>When my feet hit the ground, I start towards the fountain, moving as quickly as my feet will take me as I pull Seth along beside me. No jets of water shoot up into the sky, so I\u2019m certain the next show is going to start any minute now and I don\u2019t want to miss a single second of it. I\u2019m stopped short as Seth tugs me, veering off to the left. I pout as he pulls me in the opposite direction of the fountain.</p><p>\u201cEasy, water bug.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy the show with some ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Ice cream. The only thing that sounds better than the shooting water. We stop at a small soft serve machine manned by a teenage boy. I zero in on the massive holes in his ears, stretched open by a perfect circle of metal. If I close one eye, I can see a lady behind him fishing for something out of her handbag.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re called stretchers,\u201d Seth says, making me jump.</p><p>I glance between Seth and the boy. Both are looking at me like I\u2019m crazy.</p><p>\u201cWould you like one?\u201d</p><p>I slap Seth\u2019s arm. \u201cOh, God no. They\u2019re disgust\u2014\u201d The boys bushy, black eyebrows pull together. \u201c\u2014ingly unique.\u201d</p><p>Seth chuckles, nudging me with his shoulder. \u201cPick a flavor.\u201d</p><p>Their range isn\u2019t much and by not much, I mean strawberry or chocolate. Those are my options.</p><p>\u201cStraw\u2014\u201d</p><p>Seth touches my shoulder, cutting me off.</p><p>\u201cIs it pasteurized?\u201d he asks the ice cream boy in such a cute, concerned tone and it makes me smile stupidly at him.</p><p>The young kid at the ice cream stand shrugs and tosses his head, flicking his long, black fringe to the side. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work with ice cream...\u201d Seth towers over the counter, peering around in the boy\u2019s limited space. The boy, Tom, going off of his nametag, swallows hard. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to have an ingredients list?\u201d</p><p>Tom takes in Seth\u2019s tall, strong body and shakes his head. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your manager? Would he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I start, and he presses his fingers to my lips, stopping me. I swat him away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tom answers again.</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything?\u201d Seth growls. \u201cAnything at all?\u201d</p><p>I hook my elbow around his and try to pull him away. Of course, it\u2019d be much easier if he didn\u2019t weigh the same as a small to medium sized boulder. \u201cI\u2019ll take one strawberry and one chocolate, but if she gets sick, I\u2019m coming back for you.\u201d</p><p>With a scared nod, Tom fills two waffle cones, one with chocolate and one with strawberry. Seth hands me mine, but keeps his eyes on the boy. \u201cYou sell ice cream, know your product.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you relax?\u201d I tell him, unable to keep from laughing. I push Seth away from the terrified boy at the stand.</p><p>\u201cRelax? I\u2019m looking out for you. I don\u2019t want you to get Listerine.\u201d</p><p>Listerine? I snort loudly and cover my face as my cheeks turn warm.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demands, pulling my hand away from my mouth. I lean back, laughing as loud as I can. My stomach cramps, threatening to tear apart. \u201cListerine? Did you just say Listerine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he laughs. \u201cWhy\u2019s that so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you mean Listeria. I can get Listeria.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and I watch as he brings his chocolate ice cream to his mouth before closing his lips around it. Why can\u2019t I look as good as him when I eat ice cream? \u201cI\u2019m just looking out for you.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI know.\u201d And it feels good.</p><p>We walk back to the fountain and find a nice front row seat along the wall and wait for the fountain show. It\u2019s funny how half an hour ago I was crying my eyes out and now, I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve been in weeks. Seth and ice cream\u2014together, the two work like magic.</p><p>I get a quarter of the way through my ice cream when Seth asks me if I want to talk about Selena and my reaction to her keeping it from me. I shrug and lick my ice cream, trying my hardest to appear unbothered. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a fight before...\u201d I tell him, thinking back on my childhood. \u201cNot one that mattered, anyway. I always thought she\u2019d have my back\u2014like I do hers. I don\u2019t know... the fact we don\u2019t share what we used to made me cry today. I guess Mom was right when she said \u2018Your friends can attend your wedding, but you can\u2019t expect to bring them into your marriage.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelena is different now, Jackson has changed her. He\u2019s an intense guy... there\u2019s no way Selena would betray him by telling you all of his secrets. Jackson has taught her the importance of secrets\u2014the importance of having someone\u2019s trust.\u201d</p><p>I peer up at him, unimpressed. I\u2019m not sure if I should be offended or humbled that he\u2019s trying to defend her. \u201cShe told my mother I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said she was perfect, but she\u2019s beginning to understand it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know... changing for someone just doesn\u2019t sound right to me.</p><p>\u201cThe way I see it is, every person we meet we absorb, altering our personalities a little bit. You can\u2019t expect to remain the same. Can you imagine if I was the same guy I was back when we met? There\u2019s no way you would\u2019ve married me and I\u2019ll bet our entire savings on it,\u201d he says, like he read my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve married you no matter what,\u201d I tell him and he cocks an eyebrow. \u201cIt just would\u2019ve taken a lot longer for you to get a yes out of me.\u201d</p><p>Seth laughs his alluring laugh and the first lot of water sprays up into the air. Classical music begins to play\u2014nothing I\u2019ll ever be able to identify\u2014and I lean closer as white jets of water fill the sky, stretching from one end of the pool to the other. More high bursts shoot fast, followed by shorter streams and then even smaller streams that twist around each other. I\u2019ve never seen anything so beautiful... I can only imagine how amazing the illumined jets look against a licorice sky.</p><p>A few minutes in I become acutely aware of Seth\u2019s presence\u2014how close he is sitting. I can feel his eyes on my face as he ignores the show in front of us. Slowly, I peek sideways at him. The first thing I notice are his lips, they\u2019re curved ever so slightly\u2014a teasing almost smile. Under his stare, I feel my cheeks warm and I quickly turn my attention back to the show, eating more of my ice cream. It melts on my tongue\u2014tasting more like a frozen yogurt than ice cream.</p><p>More minutes pass, more jets of water are shot into the sky in time with the beautiful music, but eventually, it all stops. I stare at the now motionless water as people around me clap and cheer. I pinch the edge of my waffle cone and snap a small piece off. As I put it in my mouth, Seth taps my knee and minutely flicks his head towards something over my shoulder. Sure enough, Selena stands ten feet away with her hands stuffed into her pockets. Her usually prefect curls sag and hang lifelessly around her shoulder, faint, black rings of smudged makeup darkens her tired eyes and mascara stains the collar of her pretty, white blouse. I hate seeing her so upset, but what does she want me to do? I can talk, but can she?</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to her,\u201d Seth says. \u201cIf she means a lot to you, something so small wouldn\u2019t be worth throwing a lifetime of memories away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d I ask, my voice laced with hesitation. \u201cIf Jackson and I kissed?\u201d</p><p>His bright chocolate irises darken along with the subtle curve in his lips. \u201cYou and I are two very different people... if Jackson kissed you like I kissed Selena, I\u2019d kill him.\u201d</p><p>I slump into myself. Right, Seth logic. I forget it doesn\u2019t usually make sense.</p><p>\u201cGo talk to her, O. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>I hand him my ice cream and push off of the smooth stone I was sitting on. Selena uneasily shifts her weight onto her left leg, catching her lip between her teeth as I stalk towards her. I stop within three feet and fold my arms. I\u2019m not going to talk first. It\u2019s her time to talk.</p><p>\u201cI had Darryl follow your taxi,\u201d she murmurs, closing one eye and using her hand to shield herself from the sun.</p><p>\u201cStalking and lying. Who knew you had it in you?\u201d</p><p>She flinches and I hate that I sound so bitter. This is your best friend... not your enemy.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, please.\u201d She nudges closer. \u201cSeth said he was going to tell you so I let him handle it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t want him to tell me.\u201d My throat constricts and I swallow hard to clear it. \u201cIt\u2019s like I don\u2019t know you anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears spring to her eyes as her face pinches together. She averts her eyes to the fountain. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who I am anymore, O. I barely recognize myself and I\u2019m drowning here. I don\u2019t know how to stop it.\u201d She abruptly swipes angry tears from her cheeks. \u201cWhat I did was shitty, I know that, but please, O. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d That\u2019s all I want to know. If she can give me a decent explanation, I\u2019ll forgive her just like I did Seth.</p><p>She drags her watery stare to mine. \u201c...because of your relationship with Blade and your relationship with Seth. I thought for once in my life not saying anything was the right thing to do. I thought I was protecting you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny other day, I\u2019d be okay with that response.\u201d Nervously, I rub my fingers over my palm. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t spoken to me for months now.\u201d</p><p>Her brows furrow and she opens her mouth to protest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d I cut in before she gets a chance. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk to me, not like you used to. Sure we talk, we talk like distant friends do. We catch up and ask how each other is doing, but that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no intimacy to our conversations anymore. You tell everyone else my secrets and I\u2019ve never really cared because I know that\u2019s who you are. I know the risk when I tell you things, but the second you have a secret you drop the blinds and pretend no one is home. How do you think it makes me feel knowing that you don\u2019t trust me as much as I trust you?\u201d</p><p>Selena whips her hands from her pockets and clasps them together in front of her chest, pleading with me. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, O. Let me prove it, let me make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it up to me? This isn\u2019t about making it up to me.\u201d</p> <p>Her face falls, defeated by my words.</p><p>\u201cThis is about honesty, and now that I\u2019ve told you what I think, let\u2019s fix it together.\u201d</p><p>Selena\u2019s dark face brightens, her eyes widening that little bit more.</p><p>\u201cThere are things Jackson has told you that he doesn\u2019t want anyone else to know. I get it and I understand. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t really want to know about him, but I want to know about you. I want you to tell me first when you and Jackson fight\u2014not Maddi or Darryl\u2014me. I want you to call me whenever you want to\u2014even if it\u2019s to talk about the shitty weather, and I want you to never, ever keep a secret if it directly involves me.\u201d I step closer. \u201cSeth told me what you guys had to do to get Matt Somers off our backs and when I found out, the kiss didn\u2019t hurt me, but the lies did. If there\u2019s one thing I hate more in this world than Don Russell, it\u2019s lies. I\u2019ve had my fair share... don\u2019t feed me anymore of them.\u201d</p><p>She launches forward, unexpectedly crushing me in a hug. I circle my arm around her waist as she cries into my shoulder, undoubtedly wetting my hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a baby,\u201d I say, feeling my lips twitch with the beginnings of a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue over lies and truths. We\u2019re adults now... and I want you in the baby\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>She nods, crying harder into my shoulder. There\u2019s a nag in the pit of my stomach that tells me there\u2019s more to this little breakdown of Selena\u2019s than meets the eye, but I don\u2019t pry. If she wants to tell me, she will. Selena abruptly pulls back and fans her face with her hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m extra emotional today.\u201d Using her thumb, she carefully drags it under her eyes, removing some of her running makeup. \u201cJackson and I are officially finished.\u201d</p><p>My stomach shrinks. \u201cOh, Sel... I\u2019m sorry. Do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>She nods\u2014then shakes her head. \u201cI think I\u2019ve cried enough today. Maybe when it doesn\u2019t hurt I can tell you about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I nudge her shoulder. \u201cGet an ice cream and join us. There\u2019s another fountain show in fifteen minutes. It does wonders for your soul.\u201d</p><p>With a smile she turns around.</p><p>\u201cOh, and can you apologize to the boy for me?\u201d I call out. \u201cSeth can be a real dick sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She gives me the \u2018thumbs up\u2019 and I turn around and head back to Seth with an extra bounce in my step. All is right in the world... well, my world, anyway. As I sit down, Seth slips his phone back into his pocket and I pray it\u2019s not Matt Somers. Nothing good comes out of his phone calls.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>I rake my fingers through my hair and pull it over one shoulder. \u201cIt went well. We\u2019re okay. Who was on the phone?\u201d</p><p>He exhales. \u201cMom called Maddi and told her she\u2019s going to be an aunt.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows and take my melted ice cream back. \u201cWhat\u2019d she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at first she told me it\u2019s a cruel joke to pull on Mom and that I should stop it immediately and when she realized it wasn\u2019t a joke, she chastised me for doing something so messed up to \u2018poor Olivia,\u2019 but once I convinced her that it\u2019s what you want, she was happy for us. I think she\u2019s really excited about being an aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news,\u201d I say. \u201cI hope my brother takes it just as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He licks his ice cream in a way that makes me jealous. What horny idiot gets jealous over an ice cream? \u201cI\u2019ve never been shot and I hope it stays that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d never shoot you.\u201d</p><p>Seth quirks an eyebrow. I know. I\u2019m not fooling anybody. Chase can be very protective of me. \u201cFine, let me rephrase that. He\u2019d never shoot to kill you.\u201d</p><p>His lips spread across his face and he rakes his teeth over his bottom lip to hide his smile. \u201cI guess I should buy a bullet proof vest, just in case you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a bad investment. Better safe than sorry, right?\u201d</p><p>We laugh and the sound mixes together so sweetly, bringing me more joy than the fountain speakers ever could.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re done here, I\u2019m going to take you home and show you how much I appreciate you.\u201d</p><p>And he did.</p><p>He took me home and showed me exactly how much he appreciates me. Seth went slow, paying attention to every inch of my body. He took it old school, romancing me without a word. His hands caressed instead of gripped, his tongue tasted instead of fucked and his hips rolled against me instead of slamming into me. Over and over he told me how much he loved me...</p><p>...and I believed every word he said.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Seth</p><p>After the weigh in, the days passed quickly, all of them uneventful. Selena stayed with us and I barely saw Jackson. He spent most of his time out and about doing God knows what with God knows who. I spent most of mine talking strategies with Darryl while Olivia hung out with Selena. I listened to whatever Darryl had to say, but at the end of the day, this is my fight and Don will pay however I see fit...</p><p>...and now we\u2019re here. Fight night.</p><p>\u201cHe can take everything you\u2019ve worked so hard for, Seth.\u201d Darryl\u2019s voice chimes through my brain and my blood vibrates in my veins, like I\u2019m a strip of metal that\u2019s been zapped by lightning.</p><p>Fight. Fucking. Night. The night I\u2019ve been waiting for for months now. This is the last night I\u2019m going to prepare in a room like this. This is the last time my hands are going to be wrapped for a professional fight and this is the last time I\u2019m going to fight in front of tens of thousands of people. The room is quiet. The only sound filling my ears is the rapid beating of my heart. I pace back and forth, back and forth. The cool cement under my feet tickles the soles, but they\u2019re barely noticed. The tingles in my chest are more predominant tonight. For the last time, I\u2019m warmed up and ready to go. I clench and unclench my hands, testing my wraps and gloves. Unlike last time, there\u2019s still enough room for blood to flow to the tips of my fingers. I bounce on the balls of my feet and swing my arms\u2014moving them to my favorite pre-fight combo. I ignore everyone else in the room on purpose. My mind is on this fight and this fight alone. I\u2019m prepared\u2014more than prepared. No secrets hold me down and no worries linger at the back of my mind. Don could\u2019ve ruined my marriage with the stunt he played at the weigh in and now he\u2019s going to pay for it.</p><p>I pull at the neck of my hoodie, growing uncomfortable in it. I want to tear it off and do this thing now. I want to fight now, not in\u2014I glance at the clock\u2014twenty minutes. I don\u2019t want to wait twenty minutes to destroy Don\u2019s career and then kick mine to the curb.</p><p>It\u2019s kind of surreal actually, knowing this is it for me. After this, I never have to experience pre-fight jitters and I don\u2019t have to push my body to the brink of exhaustion every day. I can be normal... I can lead a normal life with my wife and my kid.</p><p>\u201cRope,\u201d Darryl says, handing me the jump rope.</p><p>Without a word I take it from his hands and get to it. I don\u2019t want my body to relax for a second. I need to be quick and strong... I will be quick and strong.</p><p>I see Olivia out of the corner of my eye sitting on a chair against the wall. She\u2019s wearing a tight \u2018Seth\u2019 shirt. Since she\u2019s sitting in my corner tonight and forgot her baggier one, the MMAC issued her this one. I\u2019m certain they gave her a size too small on purpose. It clings to her gorgeous curves and exposes the tiniest baby \u2018bump\u2019 I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s not much considering she\u2019s still very early in her pregnancy, but at least it\u2019s a start. If you didn\u2019t know she was pregnant, you wouldn\u2019t notice, but I see and touch her body every day.</p><p>I can feel her eyes on me, watching every move I make. I love it when she watches me. I love what it does to her. I turn my head and my eyes catch hers. Instantly, her cheeks darken and her lips curl bashfully. Whatever she\u2019s doing, it makes my body burn. I toss the rope to the side of the room and look at Darryl. I don\u2019t even have to say it. He knows what I want. With a nod, he opens the door. \u201cEveryone out.\u201d</p><p>They all leave without protest and the room falls silent as the door closes behind them. Olivia\u2019s chair scrapes against the concrete as she lifts herself from it. With a cautious inhale, she runs the palm of her hands over the thighs of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cI like your shirt,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI look good on you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles shyly, her cheeks warming as she recollects the line I used on her during that very first fight in Portland.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replies, inching closer. \u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>Olivia tucks a thick strand of long, chocolate hair behind her ear. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019s close enough, I wrap my arms around her waist and pull her closer. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I stare down at her face, our eyes locked together. She sure is pretty... Having her close reminds me of the first fight she came to. We were so different back then, in a completely different place all together. She wanted nothing to do with me and I was desperately trying to get in her pants... and then I\u2019d change my mind and try to get back out again. I was a dick, missing the commitment gene and she was the innocent girl unknowingly looking to find something redeemable about love. And she found it.</p><p>She nudges me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The corner of my lip twitches upwards. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u2019 She chuckles under her breath. \u201cI guess we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the last time we\u2019re going to be in a room like this together... how do you feel?\u201d</p><p>A small smile plays on her lips as she runs her hands up my arms, squeezing me through the fabric of my hoodie. \u201cAs long as I have you, I don\u2019t care what room we\u2019re in. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>Better now you\u2019re touching me. \u201cI feel... ready. I feel content.\u201d</p><p>Her hands slide up over my shoulders and hook around my neck. She pulls me closer, slowly. As her lips graze mine, the door opens. She snaps away from me as a douchebag holding a camera aims it right at us. The light on the side is flashing red and Olivia refuses to look at it. If this were any other day, I\u2019d take his camera and slam it against the concrete wall, but since it\u2019s my last fight, I guess his camera can live to see another day.</p><p>\u201cTime to go, Seth,\u201d Jackson calls from behind the cameraman.</p><p>Well, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to miss out on my pre-fight kiss because of the camera. I snap forward and grab Olivia. As I pull her in, I press my hand to the camera lens, blocking the view as I crush my lips against hers. The guy tries to pull his camera free, so I squeeze on the thin metal tube holding the lens. Sure enough, it cracks and Olivia pulls away from me with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Seth,\u201d she gasps, turning to the man. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I gasp, mimicking her and letting go of his camera. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>The cameraman\u2019s glare deepens at my sarcasm and with a smirk, I snag Olivia\u2019s wrist and push past him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that,\u201d she snaps under her breath.</p><p>I laugh, slinging my arm over her shoulder. \u201cNext time he\u2019ll remember to knock.\u201d</p><p>She huffs beside me, but I can\u2019t stop smiling. I thought it was funny. Out in the hallway, I hear my music playing loudly. It flows through me, working me up into a ball of aggressive energy. I stop before the two large double doors and turn around. I pass Olivia to Jackson and rip off my hoodie. Darryl and a member of the MMAC I\u2019ve never seen before start rubbing Vaseline over the sharp edges of my face. I hate the feel of the thick substance, but it\u2019s better than getting cut across the eyebrow, that\u2019s for sure. Darryl shoves my mouth guard in my mouth and the doors are pulled open. For the last time in my life a sea of people fill the arena before me and chant my name. Lights are flashing and posters with my name all over them are being held high. It\u2019s a bitter sweet moment for me, so I take my time and absorb it all in... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>...one last time.</p><p>Olivia</p><p>Darryl and Jackson nudge Seth, but he refuses to move. Instead, he watches the zealous crowd that screams his name. I peer past him and see Don waiting in the cage. On the distant T.V. they close in on his face, broadcasting his look of distaste all over the arena. He paces from side to side and bounces on his feet. I\u2019ve never seen Don look so serious\u2014he\u2019s out for blood. Seth looks over his shoulder at Jackson and pulls out his mouth guard.</p> <p>\u201cKeep her safe,\u201d he orders and Jackson wraps a strong arm around my waist, squeezing me to him.</p><p>Seth starts forward and the crowd goes insane. My eardrums, my stomach and my heart all threaten to combust. I\u2019ll never get used to this. Ever. I stumble as Jackson pulls me along beside him. He keeps his head down and pulls me even closer as hands whip out to touch us. Fingers brush over my shoulder and through my hair as we thunder down the walkway and right up to the cage. When we\u2019re there, the referee checks behind Seth\u2019s ears, inside his mouth, and his gloves, and I smile as he passes the brief examination. Not a second later, he bounds up the stairs and into the cage. Once inside, neither Seth nor Don take their eyes off each other. I run my hands along the extra bit of flooring. The scream from the crowd cause the cage to vibrate and I wonder if it tickles the base of Seth\u2019s feet like it does my fingers. The tingles set off by the floor of the cage course through my body\u2014from my fingertips to my heart. My heart races, with each cell vibrating at their own speed. Never in my life have I been so excited for a fight. Never have I been as excited or as terrified as I am at this very moment.</p><p>I sit back in the small metal chair provided as the announcer stands in the middle of the ring. A microphone slowly drops in from the roof and he grabs it.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, tonight\u2019s gut-wrenching fight is about to commence.\u201d A shiver rolls down my spine as he introduces both the contestants, making note of where they\u2019re from and how much they weigh. The announcer goes into their hate-filled background, hyping up the audience more and more until they\u2019re begging for blood.</p><p>With an introduction of the referee, the microphone is pulled back up to the roof, the announcer leaves, and the door is locked behind him. The crowd settles and I grip the edge of my seat. I wish I was in the crowd with Selena and I wish I had her shoulder to bury my face in. Seth and Don still their eager bodies... waiting for the bell to go. The wait turns into a small eternity and I\u2019m not sure if the loud pounding in my ears is solely from my heart, or the hearts of everyone in this room thumping in time with each other.</p> <p>Then the bell sounds and everyone jumps to their feet, including me. At the front, by the cage, is like being in the ocean. The currents control you\u2014every scream and clap sends me closer to the cage until I\u2019m standing by Jackson and Darryl. I\u2019ve never been so close...</p><p>Don and Seth circle each other silently, trying to gauge which game the other is playing. Don is first to move. He growls impatiently and launches forward, driving Seth backwards with his fists. Seth keeps his hands up, blocking all that fly for his face, only missing one or two that collide with his ribs.</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d I scream as Seth side steps and Darryl stumbles into the cage.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Darryl shouts and Seth takes advantage of Don\u2019s slip. He grabs his head and drives his knee right into the middle of Don\u2019s face. \u201cYes! Again!\u201d</p><p>Seth lines up for a second knee, but Don pushes forward, driving him back until they crash onto the canvas.</p><p>Under my hands the floor shakes, rattling my adrenaline-laced frame. I see it now... why my dad loved fighting so much. It\u2019s invigorating\u2014empowering... or at least it is until Don gets the upper hand on Seth and punches him in the mouth. My blood runs cold as Don smirks and pulls his arm back to hit him again.</p> <p>\u201cYour hips!\u201d Jackson shouts. \u201cMove your fucking hips!\u201d</p><p>Seth flicks his hips, tossing Don off him and quickly jumps to his feet. Don recovers quickly too, and charges at Seth, swinging his arm with brute force. By some miracle, Seth dodges them all and drops low. He slams his fists into Don\u2019s ribs and I hear the air being forced from his lungs every time Seth\u2019s fists connect.</p><p>My own ribs ache as I watch. I stuff my fingers into my mouth, biting nervously on the nails. Seth bounces on his toes, ducking and dodging all of Don\u2019s comeback hits. Catching a break, Don takes a step back to breathe and rethink his game. Seth has been training like crazy this time and he\u2019s studied Don. He wants revenge, and what Seth Marc wants, Seth Marc gets. Don launches forward, diving at Seth\u2019s legs. With a loud thud, Seth drops to his knees and sprawls, countering the take down. Don falls flat on his stomach. Seth jumps on his back and wraps his strong, thick arms around Don\u2019s neck and pulls. Immediately, Don\u2019s face darkens to a violent red, but he refuses to tap out. I lean even closer to the cage, until I can smell the baked vinyl the cage is dipped in. I can hear my own breath falling from my lips in heavy, quick pants. The referee gets in Don\u2019s face. He\u2019s talking to him and Don is shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cSqueeze!\u201d someone behind me screams. \u201cSqueeze the fuck out of that asshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon, c\u2019mon,\u201d Darryl shouts, slapping the canvas.</p><p>The bell sounds, lifting weight I didn\u2019t know I had off my chest. The referee pulls Seth off of Don and he saunters back over to us.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Jackson barks, slapping the wire. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>They grab a small blue stool and run for the cage door. I remain on this side of the cage as Seth drops onto his stool. He\u2019s close now. So close I can see perspiration coat his skin. Even over the cheers, I can hear his heavy breathing. As they rub more Vaseline on him and give him small amounts of water, he peers over his shoulder. I zero in on the cut that splits his bottom lip. It\u2019s bleeding and swollen. The sight fills my stomach with worry. I don\u2019t like seeing him hurt, especially on his perfect face.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Seth shouts, smiling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He flicks an eyebrow and grins confidently. \u201cI almost had him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d I repeat, fighting my own smile.</p><p>I have no doubt that Seth can beat Don... I just don\u2019t want him getting too confident too soon. Who knows what Don has planned. The break ends quickly and before I know it, Jackson and Darryl are by my side and Seth is back on his feet.</p><p>The bell rings and Seth goes in immediately, ducking and dodging Don\u2019s swings and punching him wherever he can. After taking an undoubtedly painful combo to the stomach, Don throws a punch, going for a quick right jab. My heart stops, stutters, and then starts up again as Seth dodges the punch, responding with a jab of his own, followed by a quick right uppercut to Don\u2019s jaw. Seth is on top of his game tonight. All of his movements are planned, precise, and devastating, and I can\u2019t wait to see Don crash to the canvas. Hit after hit they exchange, neither of them growing tired of beating the other. A minute into the round, Seth dives at Don and the two become a ball of limbs as they roll around, trying to get the drop on the other.</p><p>\u201cKeep your shoulders up and arms away!\u201d Jackson shouts.</p><p>As the round draws to a close, Seth gets the upper hand. He straddles Don, pushing down on his chest. Seth drops an elbow on his face and I gasp, feeling the blood drain from my own face as the sound of hard bone against bone echoes through my head. Seth drops another and another, splitting Don\u2019s brow wider, until blood is running off the sharp edges of his face. The crowd goes insane at the sight of blood\u2014desperate for more. Don raises his arm to push Seth off and his team screams for him to keep it down. Seeing the opportunity to end the fight, Seth grabs Don\u2019s arm and wraps his legs around it, he falls back against the canvas, straightening Don\u2019s arm out. Don\u2019s face contorts in pain and I see his fingers twitch toward the canvas. Do it. Do it. Do it. I beg him.</p><p>I drag my stare from Don\u2019s face to Seth\u2019s. His face is void of any emotion and his brow is furrowed, like he\u2019s trying to decide what to do. His eyes flick to mine and I inch closer to the cage, drawn to him like a magnet. Don groans in pain, the sound sending sympathy driving into the pit of my stomach. Then, Seth releases Don\u2019s arm and jumps to his feet. I gasp\u2014Jackson and Darryl gasp\u2014the entire crowd gasps. What the hell is he doing? He had that in the bag!</p><p>Seth waits, giving a dazed Don time to get to his feet and then he shouts at him\u2014words I can\u2019t hear over the roar of the crowd. The whole stadium shakes under stomping feet and I grip the edge of the canvas. Don shakes his arms and lifts them to his face before charging at Seth like a rhino. They collide and crash to the ground once again. Neither of them attempt a submission, instead, they hit each other over and over, punch for punch. There is no style to this fight anymore, it\u2019s just an old-fashioned street fight.</p><p>Jackson \u2018whoops\u2019 beside me and makes me jump. I look at Darryl, who squeezes his hair between his fingers, pulling hard.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ignoring the game plan,\u201d he tells me, his face displaying his concern.</p><p>I look back to the fight\u2014they\u2019re on their feet now, classic boxing style, neither of them using their legs. Don sways uneasily, his face bloodied and cut. It drips into his eyes and he swipes it away, but the ref doesn\u2019t call the fight. As Don throws a quick, heavy punch, Seth ducks and slams his fists into Don\u2019s stomach. Don hunches and I see it in Seth\u2019s face\u2014the smirk on his lips\u2014he\u2019s going to finish it off. He pulls his arm back and the bell sounds. The referee jumps in, filling the space between Seth and Don.</p><p>As Seth walks over to us, Don falls to his knees. Like before, Jackson and Darryl run into the cage with a little blue stool and Seth drops onto it. They try to tend to him\u2014try to cover him in more Vaseline and dab his cuts, but he isn\u2019t having any of it. He turns on his chair and removes his mouthguard.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you like that round?\u201d He pants, swiping wet hair from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou had it, why\u2019d you stop?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cBecause I wanted to hurt him more.\u201d</p><p>I grip the wire. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can take much more, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to finish it?\u201d</p><p>I nod and he smiles, turning back to his team. They put cloths on him, ice bags, Vaseline the lot and eventually, the referee calls for the team members to leave. I peer around Seth and over to Don. He looks like shit... one eyes is swollen shut. A huge chunk of Vaseline sits on his brow, preventing anymore blood from leaking into his eye.</p><p>The bell rings out one last time and Seth bounces forward. Both of the boys are tired\u2014their movements much slower than the beginning of the match. Their faces show their exhaustion and I feel sorry for them\u2014both of them. Seth lifts his hands to his face as Don throws his fists hard and fast, determined to get Seth in this final round. Don knows if this goes to the judges, he\u2019s lost. He\u2019s panicking\u2014he desperately needs to knock Seth out. Watching it, watching him hit Seth relentlessly makes my blood boil. Seth blocks as many as he can, but a couple slip through, weakening his defense.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Seth!\u201d Darryl shouts. \u201cGet out of the way!\u201d</p><p>Seth plants a heavy foot and dips low. Don is thrown off balance and falters in his movement. That\u2019s all Seth needs. I see his eyes narrow and his lips twitch right before he slams his fist into Don\u2019s stomach. Don flinches, hunching slightly. Putting all of his strength into his right hand, Seth pulls back and slams his fist into Don\u2019s face. Don\u2019s tossed to the side, spitting blood all over the canvas. Seth hits him again, from the opposite side. More spit. More blood. The crowd goes ballistic as Don crashes to the canvas and ceases to move. The referee dives on Don and waves Seth off. The bell dings excitedly, announcing Seth\u2019s victory. I clap my hands until they burn and then I clap even harder. Pride surges through my chest as Seth does an over-excited lap of the cage, shouting and cheering. The gate opens and floods with team members, doctors, and cameras. I finally let out the breath I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve been holding this entire time and relax against the cage.</p><p>Two and a half grueling rounds going punch for punch and finally, Seth came out on top by executing the perfect KO. Hearing the crowd scream for him sends a crackle of electricity through my body and I grind my teeth, fighting off a shudder that threatens my spine. Finally, he kicked Don\u2019s ass. Finally, he gave him exactly what he deserved. As sad as it sounds, watching Don lie on the ground, dazed, lifts weight off my shoulders. Seth will never have to fight him again, and once we leave Vegas, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll never have to see his face again. After this, I doubt he\u2019ll hang around Portland anymore, at least not while Seth\u2019s there, anyway.</p><p>I watch Seth be thrown backwards as Jackson and Darryl crash into him. He looks like he\u2019s still too hopped up on adrenaline to hurt, but I suspect when his body cools down his muscles are going to fucking ache.</p><p>\u201cYou did it!\u201d they shout, slapping him around.</p><p>Seth laughs and squeezes them to his body. He wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without them. Team Seth, that\u2019s what they are, and this final fight doesn\u2019t mean it has to end now.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d</p><p>His laugh fades and smile falters as Matt Somers beams at him from across the cage. He flicks his head and Darryl and Jackson let Seth go. Seth gives me a small, reassuring smile as he strolls over to Matt, the presenter, and six cameras that linger in front of him.</p><p>The presenter is handed a microphone to address the crowd. His shiny, gold ring stands out, glistening in the light provided by the rigging above as he pats down his messy, brown hair</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he simply says and everyone screams their agreement. \u201cThat was intense. How are you feeling, Seth?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI feel good,\u201d he replies with a smirk. \u201cI feel great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know there was a lot of tension building up to this fight. On a few occasions you and Don Russell were gonna throw down outside of the ring, did that fuel your temper tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt played a small part in my game tonight, but I\u2019m a fighter. It\u2019s my job to punch faces and knock people out and that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Somers and the presenter chuckle at Seth and ignore Don, who\u2019s sitting up now, getting checked over by at least three doctors. They don\u2019t care about him... only Seth, the fighter who won the fight. What if Don won? Would they leave Seth alone on the canvas? Regardless of Don, what he stands for, and who he is, my heart breaks for him... no one deserves to be tossed away like garbage.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next for Seth Marc? If you could pick, who would you fight next?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s gaze flicks over his shoulder and onto my face. There\u2019s a message there that I can\u2019t read.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d He ponders for a few seconds. \u201cMy wife is having a baby.\u201d</p><p>More cheers ring out.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going back home to Portland to run my gym. I don\u2019t want to fight anymore.\u201d</p><p>The spectators inhale sharply, almost unanimously before erupting into a fit of gossip. Matt Somers looks at Seth with a forced smile in place and the presenter tries to play it off.</p><p>\u201cDon hit you a little too hard, Seth?\u201d He laughs, stepping away from Matt and Seth. There\u2019s an uneasy look in his eye as he searches the cage for something to switch to. When he spots Don sitting on the floor, he cuts over to him. Seth follows the presenter with his eyes, avoiding Matt\u2019s awkward smile. Seth also spots Don, still on the floor, and he looks over at me. I nod my head, knowing he\u2019s asking me if he should. My lips curl into an adoring smile as I watch Seth pull Don to his feet and shake his hand. No words are exchanged, but thankfully, no more punches are, either. My hubby is a good sport\u2014a role model for other fighters. Don knows the winner has been decided. He knows there\u2019s nothing else to prove.</p><p>Seth saunters from the cage and down the stairs. I pluck his hoodie off of the floor and hand it to him. He drapes it over his shoulders and laces his fingers with mine. I can feel his muscles tremble as I press my body to his while we walk. People pat him as we walk. They tell him that he did well and that they love him. He nods his response. His fingers tighten around mine, like he\u2019s afraid someone is going to pull me from him, and they don\u2019t relax until we\u2019re alone in his room and the door is shut and locked.</p><p>I lean against the wall as he drops his hoodie to the floor and pulls down his shorts. My cheeks heat up at the sight of his naked backside. He reaches for a pair of scissors on the nearest chair and extends them to me, then pulls them back.</p><p>With a cheeky smile he asks, \u201cAre you blushing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou took your pants off,\u201d I reply, forcing my eyes to stay on his face. \u201cOf course I\u2019m blushing.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the scissors in his gloved hands. \u201cYou want me to cut them off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew rule.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cYou can\u2019t say sentences like that when I\u2019m naked. It makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d I laugh, taking the scissors from his hand. He extends his gloves to me and I cut them straight up the middle, freeing his hands.</p><p>He launches forward, his hot, bare hands cupping my face. My breath hitches as I press myself as hard as I can against the wall to avoid him rubbing Don\u2019s blood into my clothes.</p><p>\u201cI heard you, you know.\u201d</p><p>My breath, quick and nervous, clashes with his. \u201cYou heard me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouting\u2014encouraging me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMove!\u201d I scream as Seth side steps and Darryl stumbles into the cage. I feel my lips pull into a smile as I recall it. \u201cI guess I did.\u201d</p><p>He kisses the corner of my mouth really softly. It\u2019s the kind of soft, teasing kiss that makes me want to grip his face and force him to kiss me harder. He releases my face and turns away from me. I watch his glorious back until he disappears behind the shower door. He showers for at least twenty minutes and I expect someone to bang on the door or kick it down by now, but no one does and I wait patiently, listening to the soothing sound of water crashing against tiles. A minute later, Seth steps out with a towel wrapped loosely around his hips. The sight of his clean, tan skin dries my throat. He leans against the wall opposite me, and without a word from him, I walk closer to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sore all over...\u201d He smirks, his dark eyes flaring brightly. When I get within reach, he pinches my shirt and tugs me closer. \u201cI want you to fix me.\u201d</p><p>Heat sears down my spine and pools between my thighs as he presses me against his warm, wet body. If nobody knocks on the door in the next twenty seconds, shit is going to get real dirty, real quick. I crave him. I crave to show him how much I love him, to temporarily heal his body with my own.</p><p>\u201cHow do I fix you?\u201d I whisper, my throat dry and my voice husky.</p><p>\u201cA kiss is a good start.\u201d He dips his head and I\u2019m paralyzed, unable to move away or closer.</p><p>As his lips graze mine, the door is unlocked from the outside and opened. Seth lifts his head, his eyebrows pulling together.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me, Seth? How dare you pull that bullshit!\u201d Matt booms, throwing something around the room. It bounces off the wall and crashes onto a table, knocking over bottles of protein shakes. Seth shifts, tucking me behind his large frame. \u201cYou\u2019re under contract. You can\u2019t fucking leave!\u201d</p><p>I peer around Seth\u2019s body and Darryl throws him his jeans. Without a word Seth pulls them on and throws the towel to the side. My chest is tight as I anxiously wait it out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this asshole, Seth,\u201d Darryl tells him as Jackson slips into the room. \u201cYou go home and sleep off the fight.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Seth turns and scoops me up into his arms. I\u2019m quite impressed he\u2019s still able to move them after a fight like that.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Matt yells. \u201cYou can\u2019t fucking leave! I have your signature down on a Goddamn contract!\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, Seth starts for the door, but Matt charges forward, ready to block us. Before he makes the door, Jackson slams his body into him, leaving room for us to leave.</p><p>\u201cBye, Matt!\u201d I say, wrapping my arms around Seth\u2019s neck and giggling like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cLook after my boy, Olivia.\u201d Darryl calls out and I smile at him over Seth\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI always do.\u201d</p><p>Seth squeezes me against his body and kisses my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhere were we?\u201d he asks, grazing the tips of his lips across my cheek.</p><p>\u201cKissing,\u201d I say without hesitation. I turn my head and softly press my lips to his cut. \u201cI was going to fix you.\u201d</p><p>People stare at us as we walk and kiss, but it\u2019s nothing new. Before Seth, I avoided all forms of public affection. I realize now that it was because I was afraid that people would see through the charade that was my relationship with Blade. I was afraid that people would see that I didn\u2019t love him.</p><p>With Seth, it\u2019s different. I kiss him in public with everything I have because I\u2019m not afraid anymore, and over the course of our relationship, I learned one thing; you should endeavor to find the one person you\u2019re comfortable with. You should go out of your way to find someone who makes you smile at the same time they make you mad. You should find someone who doesn\u2019t give you ultimatums, but is willing to grow with you and not for you. The right person for you will grow because they want to, not because you want them to. You should find someone who knows exactly how to make it up to you when they make mistakes\u2014and remember, everyone makes mistakes.</p><p>No one should settle for less.</p><p>Everyone deserves their own Seth.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Seth</p><p>Months later</p><p>The barbeque sizzles under my spatula as I turn the steak onto its uncooked side. The sun is high, the air is warm, and no clouds litter the sky.</p><p>\u201cHow are those steaks looking?\u201d Darryl asks, looming over the barbeque. He sets his beer down on the side and stands next to Jackson.</p><p>\u201cThe same as they did five minutes ago,\u201d I tell him with a laugh.</p><p>At any barbeque, Darryl needs to be in control of cooking the meat. Normally, I let him do it, but since this is the first barbeque in our new house, I want to do it. I\u2019m going to be a dad any day now\u2014hell, Olivia\u2019s belly is so round I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to be a dad any minute now.</p><p>\u201cI think Olivia needs help bringing down the cooler. Considering it\u2019s filled with soft drinks, it\u2019s quite heavy.\u201d</p><p>I hand Darryl my tongs and spring towards the steps. I brush past Mom and Maddi and bound up the stairs quicker than I ever have and burst into the kitchen. Olivia\u2019s mom, Sandra, jumps, clutching her chest as I accidently kick over the bin and stumble into the counter.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Seth!\u201d her mom snaps. \u201cDo you have to make a scene before you enter every room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t carry the cooler by yourself,\u201d I tell Olivia. \u201cIt\u2019s too heavy. Let me do it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shifts her weight against the counter and places her hand on her hips. There\u2019s a smile on her lips, one of utter amusement. \u201cWho\u2019s manning the barbeque?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarryl.\u201d</p><p>Behind me, Sandra grumbles as she picks up the bin and the contents I spilled.</p><p>Olivia giggles. \u201cOh honey,\u201d she pouts, extending her arms to me.</p><p>With a frown, I slide closer to her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She circles me with her arms and I\u2019m not going to lie, cuddling is really hard now that she has a belly the size of a basketball\u2014it feels like one, too.</p><p>\u201cDarryl took the cooler down earlier. The whole time he bitched about you being on the barbeque.\u201d</p><p>That motherfuc\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut if you want to help, Mom and I have three extra dishes that need to be taken down. She points to the three large plates on the counter. By the looks of it, they\u2019re plates of pasta salad, potato salad, and a weird chicken salad that Olivia saw on the internet last night and demanded she make. Sandra washes her hands and grabs a dish. I grab one too, and so does Olivia, but I take it from her, balancing a plate on each hand.</p><p>\u201cEasy now, Momma.\u201d I laugh at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pop any day now and I\u2019d hate for you to slip and ruin such a delicious looking salad.</p><p>\u201cOh, ha, ha,\u201d she deadpans. \u201cVery funny.\u201d Olivia runs her hands over her belly. \u201cI don\u2019t think he or she is ever going to come out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe,\u201d I clarify, \u201cwill come out when he is ready. Just relax and enjoy lunch for now.\u201d</p><p>Olivia and I decided to keep the sex a secret... okay, that\u2019s a lie. She decided for us to keep the sex a secret. She thinks it\u2019s exciting, but I think it\u2019s fucking torture. Once I tried bribing the radiologist to tell me what it was when Olivia wasn\u2019t looking. I\u2019ve never seen a woman so offended. You\u2019d think I asked her to slip me her nipple while my wife wasn\u2019t watching. It\u2019s funny now, but at the time it was terrifying.</p><p>The nursery is right across the hall from our bedroom and it\u2019s filled to the roof with all of the stuff a baby needs, but Olivia claims ours doesn\u2019t. I bought a bottle cleaner even though Olivia plans on breastfeeding, but I told her once he chomps down on one of her nipples, she\u2019s going to change her mind real quick.</p><p>We march down the stairs and I look at Darryl, who smiles smugly at me while he sips his beer. Jackson chuckles away beside him. I lay the dishes down on the table and Selena claps her hands together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking hungry,\u201d she exclaims, excitement wrapped round her words.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you speak around a dinner table?\u201d Sandra chastises her.</p><p>Selena\u2019s shoulders slump and she pulls her blonde curls around her shoulders. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>When Sandra turns around and heads over to the barbeque, my mom flicks her hair out of her face and leans across to Selena. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to swear on occasion,\u201d she tells her. \u201cAnd I think being hungry and seeing a dish as good as that is a good fucking reason.\u201d</p><p>I choke. \u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>Olivia, Maddi, and Selena laugh, covering their mouths like little school girls.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She grabs her wine glass and draws it to her lips. To fit in, she\u2019s poured orange juice into a wine glass. She\u2019s been sober since she was released from rehab and doesn\u2019t miss alcohol at all. I\u2019m happy for her. I knew she\u2019d come back to us eventually... even if I had to force it.</p><p>\u201cYou do know Jackson has to sit at the table to eat,\u201d Maddi tells Selena.</p><p>Right. Jackson and Selena stopped talking after Vegas. From what Jackson tells me, they still have sex, but she kicks him out straight afterwards. A vicious cycle.</p><p>\u201cI know, that\u2019s why I\u2019m downing this vodka like it\u2019s water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie,\u201d Olivia chimes in. \u201cYou don\u2019t drink water.\u201d</p><p>Once again they all laugh and Mom joins in, too. It\u2019s been a wonderful day and I\u2019ve never been happier. We\u2019ve swum in the pool, drank good alcohol, enjoyed good company, and cooked good food. I can\u2019t wait to down it all and go to bed.</p><p>Since leaving the MMAC, I can\u2019t say my routine has changed much. I still wake up early and I go to the gym. I work out with Jackson and Darryl and then we open up the gym to customers. The gym is buzzing. We\u2019ve had so many sign ups we\u2019ve had to buy the cycle store next door and extend it just to fit our members. We run daily classes and have a total of twenty-six employees and one trainee. Rick would be proud of Olivia and I for all that we\u2019ve accomplished together. I just know he would. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pull out my chair and sit down, waiting for Darryl to bring over the steaks. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to stop my stomach from cramping its hunger cramp. I glance sideways at Olivia, who\u2019s still standing by her chair. She\u2019s staring at me, wide eyed.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d I tap her seat. \u201cTake a load off your feet.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo... I can\u2019t sit.\u201d</p> <p>I frown up at her and she glances down at her legs. Sure enough, her light blue shorts turn a darker blue right between the thighs. She starts to cry, a worried kind of cry, and I push up out of my seat and rush to her. She holds on to me tightly, like she\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll float away if I let go.</p><p>\u201cUh, Mom!\u201d I shout. \u201cSomething\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Dammit! I stayed up late reading pregnancy books for months, but now that it\u2019s actually happening, I have no idea what I\u2019m doing. Mom screeches, making both Olivia and I cringe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a baby!\u201d she shouts.</p><p>One minute it\u2019s just me holding Olivia and the next we\u2019re surrounded by everyone. Words, orders, and information is being forced into my skull and I can barely think straight.</p> <p>\u201cAre you feeling any pain?\u201d Sandra asks her and Olivia nods.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tightening,\u201d she winces. \u201cBut nothing too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to time the contractions,\u201d Darryl says.</p><p>From his back pocket he pulls out his stopwatch\u2014the stopwatch that he used my entire fighting career. I quirk an eyebrow. \u201cYou just carry that thing around?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cYou never know.\u201d</p><p>I lower Olivia into her seat and Darryl hands me his stopwatch. Once Olivia is sitting, I\u2019m timing her contractions and our moms are brushing Olivia\u2019s hair out of her face. Everyone else goes back to normal. They dish out their meals and fill their cups. They make toasts and stuff their faces all while we\u2019re trying to have a baby. They\u2019re all drunk anyway, it\u2019s not like they could come to the hospital, so I leave them be. They\u2019re happy with their lives and they\u2019re happy for us. A new Marc is about to enter the world. I was able to commit to one girl and create another life. Let\u2019s be honest, that in itself is a miracle.</p> <p>With one last painful groan and hard push, my baby slides into my world silently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl,\u201d the doctor tells me and tears well in my eyes. I\u2019ve never seen anything so beautiful. I\u2019m so in love and I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s not a boy. I rush to the head of the bed and plant kisses all over Olivia\u2019s face. She smiles tiredly up at me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d she murmurs, her eyes half closing.</p><p>I kiss her again and again. \u201cPerfect. She\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes widen and her smile widens as tears roll out of her eyes. \u201cShe?\u201d</p><p>I nod. It took Olivia and I months and months to decide on a name for a boy and a name for a girl. The arguments were endless, all ending the same way until we found the one that rolled off of our tongues.</p><p>\u201cChloe Marc,\u201d she whispers and I nod again.</p><p>The doctors place our baby on Olivia\u2019s chest. Quietly, the baby watches, her eyes not really focusing on anything. Her hands press against her cheeks as her face begins to screw up. Her eyes have no color yet, but her hair is jet black and sticks awkwardly to her scalp.</p> <p>\u201cI want more,\u201d I tell Olivia, tapping Chloe\u2019s little pink nose. I can feel Olivia\u2019s stare on the side of my face and then I look at her and take in her skin, as white as a ghost.</p><p>\u201cOne child is good, too. Selena and Jackson are both only childr\u2014\u201d She pauses and thinks about her words. \u201cOr two. Two\u2019s a good number.\u201d</p><p>Or three or four, I think silently. Instead of voicing it, I kiss Olivia on the forehead again, and finally baby Chloe begins to cry. I smile as Olivia lowers the baby to her breast, using all of her natural motherly instincts. As I watch them bond, I feel my heart tear in two\u2014two pieces that belong solely between my wife and my daughter. I know then that every decision I\u2019ve ever made in my life has lead me to this. This is why I\u2019m here. This is my purpose in life.</p><p>Chloe cries again, pulling me from my thoughts. I smile and touch her hand with my pinkie finger. She grips it and squeezes it with all her might</p><p>And just like that, Chloe, my sweet, innocent baby girl, becomes the second girl to ever render me speechless and completely steal my heart.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
