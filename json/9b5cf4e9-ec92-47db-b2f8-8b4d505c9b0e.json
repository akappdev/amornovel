The dank night air creeps in through my thin sweater. I shiver and wrap my arms around myself and try to keep up with his pace.</p> <p>I round the corner, staying across the street from him. I don't want him to get too far ahead of me. The street is crowded enough that if I wink people will notice. His outdated pleather jacket makes it easy to keep him in my sights. I roll my eyes and snort. No one but an immortal would be caught dead wearing pleather.</p><p>He turns down a dark alley. I grimace and wonder if perhaps he is looking for his next victim. He doesn't glance behind himself. He's overconfident. They always are. His kind always believes they are the strongest animals in the urban jungle. Most of them don\u2019t know about me. The ones that have actually met me are usually in the throws of their own death. Introductions seem like a waste at that point. As usual, his instincts lie to him and allow for a false sense of security. He just doesn't know it yet.</p><p>I finger the platinum ring on my right middle finger with my thumb. I have always loved the thin red line running through the middle of it to the red rose. The ring is my mark. It is my badge. It permits me to follow the man. It makes my brand of deadly force acceptable.</p><p>I wink my right eye, flashing in front of him. I smirk at the flash of confusion in his eyes and grab his arm. He struggles for a second but I lift him into the air, before he has a chance to change into a worthy adversary. I shudder and gasp when my hands make contact with the warm fleshy meat of his throat.</p><p>The sparks fill me and the air around us. The touch of his skin makes every moment magnify, as my senses heighten from the feast. He chokes and fights, but it's useless.</p> <p>His eyes catch the ring on my finger, recognition and fear spreads across his face.</p><p>\"You're a Rose.\" He croaks.</p><p>His last words.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d A man's voice echoes through the alley.</p><p>The fire of the spark dies, taking my meal with it.</p><p>I growl and drop the dead man to the cold ground.</p> <p>I hate ending my meal that way. I lick my lips, wondering if my eyes still glow like molten steel. I have to admit, I think it looks cool. The man in the alley probably won't.</p><p>I glance down the alley to where a policeman stands with his gun drawn. I laugh inside at the way his hands shake with the sizable gun in them.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are.\u201d His voice never wavers, but I can sense the fear coming off him. I realize suddenly his voice is familiar. Panic fills me.</p><p>I look around for an exit as his steps fill the silent alley. He squints, no doubt from the confusion over my still glowing eyes.</p><p>I smile, raising my hands, hoping to stop him in his tracks. \u201cRun his prints and you\u2019ll thank me.\u201d</p><p>He continues to walk toward me cautiously, assessing the alley and the danger. \u201cGet down on the ground.\u201d He waves the gun slowly. I grimace and bite my lip. I could steal his gun and knock him out.</p><p>I close my eyes and take a deep breath. \u201cReally, would you lie on this street? This alley is filthy with germs and God only knows what else.\u201d I try to be funny. He's going to recognize me any second.</p><p>A gust of wind blows past him, bringing with it a scent like laundry soap and deodorant. It's the subtle mix of windblown sea air that makes me feel sick. I blink forcing a tear to slip from my eye.</p> <p>I gulp and push down my feelings. I love Aleks, he is the right choice. There is no doubt about that.</p><p>He looks at me in disbelief. \u201cYou, you\u2019re the one? That's not possible.\u201d</p><p>I can see the raw emotion on his face. His lower lip trembles.</p><p>I take a step back, putting my hands out further. \u201cShane, just pretend you never saw me. The medics will say heart attack.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo, not you.\u201d His face twists in pain. \u201cAnyone but you. Why?\u201d</p><p>I blink as the memories of every second of our time together crams into my brain.</p><p>Every touch.</p><p>Every smile.</p><p>I look down and swallow. \u201cI have to eat, they make sense.\u201d</p><p>He looks disgusted. \u201cYou\u2019re eating them? How? They have no marks. None of the others had marks.\u201d</p><p>I let the moment of shame fill me. I make myself remember his face the times I'd broken up with him. Broken him. I force myself to feel it all. I deserve to suffer.</p><p>I know deep down if I let myself look I will find the girl that wants to sit on the back steps of his house, listening to his dreams.</p><p>Instead I turn and jump onto the handrail of the stairs next to me. I climb the fire escape as fast as I can. I can't wink. I'm feeling sick and I can't possibly scare him like that.</p><p>I can still smell his fear but it has switched, it's a different kind of fear. It's emotional. I would know that smell anywhere.</p><p>The damp night air fills with his screams. I feel tears rolling down my cheeks as I try to block his desperate screams that consist of one word, my name.</p><p>I sit on the roof and rock back and forth and all I hear is, \"AIMEE!\"</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>I put my hand up to the old door and take a breath.</p><p>\"Just come in, you pain in the arse.\"</p><p>I smile and open the door. His black eyes are mocking me. I can see it all over his face.</p><p>\"I need your help,\" I mutter and close the door to his house.</p><p>He smirks and crosses his arms. His sarcastic shit-eating grin pisses me off, but it doesn\u2019t change things. I need him.</p><p>Dorian strolls across the hardwood floor silently in his sock feet and leans against the marble counter. \"Tell me everything, love.\" His tight dark jeans and tucked in pale blue shirt make him look more European. The worn brown leather jacket slung over the back of the chair next to him is his attempt at badass American. I would roll my eyes at him but I can't. I need him.</p><p>He smiles and my sex drive kicks into gear. His affect on me is beyond annoying.</p><p>\"Do you need me to help in anything that would require me taking my shirt off? Or yours?\"</p><p>I shiver and fight my rage. \"I could kill you Dorian.\"</p><p>He holds his hands up. \"It's why I've maintained my efforts to get into your pants. I think it would be quite the ride.\"</p><p>I scowl.</p><p>He chuckles and his accent gets thicker, \"My pet, you really are in a jam this time aren\u2019t you? You've got some desperation, just, right there on your cheek.\" He brushes a finger against my face.</p><p>I flinch away from him. \"This was a mistake.\" I turn to leave but he grabs me and swings me into his embrace.</p><p>He forces his lips on mine.</p><p>My fingers tingle, but I push it back. I need him alive. I shove him, but his grip is intense. He drives his tongue into my mouth. The sweet and perverse taste of him makes my legs quiver. He lets me go and I swear I see stars for the smallest moment.</p><p>\"That is how you should be kissed,\" his words are a dark whisper, threatening me with more. My body wants to agree with him. I can't hate him, not the way I used to. I'm not even convinced I ever could.</p><p>I cover my face and breathe. \"If I ask you to do something and not tell Aleks will you?\"</p><p>He laughs. \"That's all you have to say after a kiss like that?\"</p><p>I maintain my composure.</p><p>He rolls his eyes and nods, \"Go on then, although for the record I did just do something I won't tell Aleks about. Now if you want a favor, I want one too.\"</p><p>I remove my hands and attempt a disgusted look. He flashes a grin and walks by me, nudging me. He grabs a bottle of wine from the huge rack and uncorks it slowly, as if he's debating.</p><p>I wish I could hate him, most of the time. The rest of the time I have an inner conflict over why it is I want to rip his clothes off and lick his naked body.</p><p>He smirks. \"Are you thinking naughty thoughts about me?\" I do love the way he says naughty.</p><p>I growl, hoping anger will make my red face convincing, \"Can you?\"</p><p>He nods and pours the whole bottle into a crystal carafe. He swirls it over and over. He's making me wait on purpose. He walks around to the cupboard and pulls out two large glasses. They're the size of crystal fish bowls. \"Well go on with it. What is it?\" His dark eyes sparkle. \"Before I agree and all.\"</p><p>\"I've messed up. I need you to wipe Shane's memory, again.\"</p><p>He laughs. It's bitter and sarcastic, like his soul. \"Oh Aimee, you really have the most intense feelings for that boy? Don\u2019t you?\"</p><p>I clench my jaw. My hands tingle.</p><p>He glances at my hands and growls. \"Keep it in your pants, love.\"</p><p>I rub my hands on my jeans and take deep breaths. \"It isn\u2019t whether I love him or not. It's who's right for me and who I won't kill.\"</p><p>He pours me a glass of wine and hands it to me. \"If he wasn't human, who would you pick?\"</p><p>I suck in my breath and shake my head. \"Not playing that game Dorian. I made my choice. I don\u2019t regret it. I love Aleks.\" My eyes are welling and my hands tremble when I tilt the glass back. I drink the room temperature spiced wine in gulps. I wipe my mouth and bite my lip to stop myself from saying anything else.</p><p>\"Do you ever wonder how much of your love for Aleks is his spell?\" His grin tells me he knows the answer to the question.</p><p>I sip the wine and watch him.</p><p>He drinks a large sip and nods. \"I want you, Aimee. There is no denying it. I wanted you from the minute I frightened you in the elevator. I had to make certain you were good and scared of me.\" His eyes flash to my hands. \"Didn\u2019t want you thinking you could do anything with what I had given you.\"</p><p>I sip, taking it all in. \"You hurt me and scared me on purpose?\"</p><p>He laughs. \"You\u2019re smarter than that. You know I did. Now, if I can't have you the way I want you.\" He adjusts himself and smirks at my disgusted face. \"Then I want to know the answer to the question of who? If the little bobby were immortal, would you choose him or Aleks? Or would you rather I start taking my pants off?\"</p><p>I laugh, \"I don't have an answer to that question, but keep your pants on in case one comes.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I'm going to ask for something else in a minute and I'm certain you won't want to give it to me.\" He leans in. The smell of him makes my mouth water.</p><p>\"I wouldn\u2019t take his humanity from him.\" I say it matter of fact.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \"Humanity shimanity.\"</p><p>\"I need you to take his memories again. He saw me eating today in an alley.\"</p> <p>His eyes widen. \"Tsk tsk tsk. Although, for all the things I had rolling around in my naughty mind, that really is sort of lame. I imagined you had been unfaithful or something delicious like that.\" He looks at his fat leather watch. \"There is still plenty of time you know. To be unfaithful.\"</p><p>My phone vibrates, just in the nick of time.</p><p>His phone is already in his hands. \"Oh dear.\"</p><p>I pull out my phone and see what he's talking about. \"Frig,\" I whisper.</p><p>\"My sentiments exactly.\" He puts a hand out. \"Shall we travel together?\"</p> <p>I'm gone before he has the chance to touch me again.</p><p>My heels click against the cold cement. The rainwater makes the sound echo between the narrow buildings. The cover of dark hides her from me, but really nothing can hide from me. Not her. Not anyone. Not even me.</p><p>The cold air helps me shake off the feeling of Dorian all over me. I need to kill him. I feel sick knowing I let him kiss me. I didn\u2019t fight him the way I could have. I never do.</p><p>I force my thoughts back to the task at hand. I don\u2019t know if it's another trap. I don\u2019t even care anymore. I don't watch my back, ever. I don\u2019t look around me. I've become the same as the cocky immortal I mocked only an hour before.</p><p>Death means so little to me. Some days it means freedom and others it means food and if I'm really lucky, sometimes it means revenge. Either way, I can't seem to care for the deaths that surround me. The only death I seem to care about is the one I can't have. My own.</p><p>I round a corner and the smell of it is the first thing that hits me in the face. It's sex and raw lust mixed with a little blood.</p> <p>She's here. She's in the alley with me. She's feeding.</p><p>I swallow and play with the platinum ring around my finger. I twirl it with my thumb. I don\u2019t want to kill her but I don\u2019t know what to do about her.</p><p>I don't change the way I walk. I let my heels click against the cold cement. I let the sound of me fill the alley. She won't hear me. I know this. We feed the same. In the beginning I saw nothing but the meal. In the beginning I was obsessed with the meal. I never think on that time. I can't let myself. It destroys the last few good things inside of me to let the bad ones take over.</p><p>Wind blows past me, warm wind. My skin shivers. \"Aleks,\" I whisper. The feeling of him in the alley is all I need. I forget about Dorian and Shane and remember where my heart is, and who it belongs to.</p><p>I know he is with the others, lining the rooftop above. I can only hope they will stay away and let me handle it.</p><p>She is mine. Mine in fault and responsibility.</p><p>My fingers spark flashes of light that reveal the things I wouldn\u2019t normally be able to see. A ladder against an old brick wall. The glint of a silver garbage can. A pair of men's leather dress shoes, twitching on the ground.</p><p>In the flashes of light I can see her face. It's more beautiful than anything in the world. She snarls at me like a wild animal. Her fingers pull at him. He is well dressed. He will be missed by someone. A family perhaps.</p> <p>She has done it again. Blood coats her beautiful lips.</p><p>\"Oliver.\" I barely finish whispering his name and he is beside me. His warm arm brushes against mine.</p><p>\"He is dying, Aimee. Just do it.\" His voice is broken. Like my heart. We all feel sick for what we have done to her.</p><p>He reaches a hand for her arm but she snarls and pulls away. She holds the dying man in her arms, like a child holding a doll. Her tragically beautiful face is much altered from the face I have grown to love.</p><p>Oliver takes no nonsense off of her. He reaches in and grabs her thin arm. He shakes her free of the dying man in the suit. She is gone before the man in the suit hits the ground. I bend down next to him. I wrap my fingers around his bare wrist and let go of the control I hold so tightly.</p><p>The cool air sparkles with life and light, his life and light. I gasp pulling him in. He fills the tiny void where my hunger sits. I haven\u2019t eaten this much since Lydia found me and locked me in that room to eat. His life is separated from him and I let him fall back onto the cold wet concrete. He will be a tragedy of the city. I slip his watch from his other wrist and take his wallet from the rumpled pants that feel suddenly loose. His soul took up more space than he would have ever realized.</p><p>I turn and look up into the night's sky. Atop the buildings I see their eyes, watching me. I can't stop my eyes from looking for his. His beautiful white blue eyes. He doesn\u2019t smile or even try to. He knows about Dorian. He knows me better than anyone. He glares and then he's is gone.</p><p>I watch as the other eyes vanish one at a time.</p><p>The last face I see is Dorian's. He stands where Aleks had been. \"It's done. Now you owe me and I will collect.\"</p><p>I flinch. \"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"He was a mess. Wandering the city in uniform. I took him home and told him to go have some fun, he needed it. I told him to take one of the girls he used to date and have a blast.\" He grins. \"See you later.\" His voice is filled with promise. I shiver and wink. I try to ignore the regret that has me more full than my meal.</p><p>Lydia's kitchen table feels small with the group that is there. Missing Sam and the kids has become a fulltime job.</p><p>Our silence is heavy and painful in the house. It almost always means someone has died or lost control of what they are.</p><p>\"Where is she?\" Lorri storms into the room. Her blood red boots slap the floor.</p><p>Lydia shakes her head. \"You have no right to do that here, Lorri. You may not take her from my home.\"</p><p>Lorri scowls. \"Don\u2019t tell me what I can and cannot do. This mess has to be cleaned up.\" Her harsh eyes land on mine. \"You know the rules.\"</p><p>I nod. I have no defense beyond my love of her.</p><p>I have no defense beyond my blame in it all.</p><p>Lorri's manicured finger is in my face suddenly. \"You fix this. You have two weeks. Tristan and Ophelia and Giselle are all running out of time.\"</p><p>She is gone.</p><p>Lydia's eyes are on me. I can feel them.</p><p>I glance back. \"I'll go talk to her.\"</p><p>Lydia shakes her head. \"No. Leave her be. She needs to calm down. Annabelle will take care of...\"</p><p>I wink out before she finishes the sentence. I choose home instead of him.</p><p>I wander town, looking in the windows of the houses. The lights inside show everything. The love and warmth they all have. The normalcy that exists in a place like this cuts me like a tiny knife. All I see is a place something like me won't ever be part of. I get lost in the clicking of my boots and when I look up I am in front of my house.</p><p>I instantly feel like I did the first week I was changing. I could feel the changes but had nowhere to go. Everything has changed and I still feel like I have nowhere to go.</p><p>I can see shadows moving around inside. My father and sister are there in the house.</p><p>I walk up to the front lawn just as the door opens.</p><p>I freeze.</p><p>\"Love you too, Daddy.\" Alise steps out of the door. A group of people follows her out of the house. The last person closes the door.</p><p>\"He seems better hey?\" A voice cuts into me. I can't flash. I can't breathe. I am a lawn ornament.</p><p>\"Aims?\" His voice still hurts me.</p><p>I look at them walking down the stairs. Blake and Alise are hand in hand. Behind them walk Shane and Jessica Morgan, holding hands. She was his girlfriend before Alise and him dated. Before he and I dated. Before. She must be the girl he remembers dating that Dorian told him to go find to have fun with.</p><p>I remember watching them together. I had always wished I were her. I wished I were popular Jessica Morgan, holding hands with Shane. Watching him play football. Before, when I thought he was the love of my life. Seeing him, I have to convince myself he isn\u2019t.</p><p>Now I am the only one who remembers we dated. I am the only one who remembers anything. Well, Blake and me. I smile awkwardly. \"Hey.\"</p><p>They're dating again.</p><p>Jessica is dating Shane again.</p><p>I have to keep repeating it to believe it.</p><p>Maybe she's the girl in O's vision.</p><p>The girl he's happy with.</p><p>Alise points to the house. \"Careful, he has a cold.\" She looks around. \"How did you get here?\"</p><p>I am frozen still. \"I walked.\" Blake laughs.</p><p>\"From college? Dude.\" She rolls her eyes.</p><p>\"You home for the weekend?\" Shane asks me, even though his eyes don\u2019t meet mine. It's like he doesn\u2019t want to look at me. I can't imagine what Dorian has said to him.</p><p>I nod and swallow my feelings. Pushing them down is hard. I want to join the group and go out and be normal. I've never been normal. Somehow I always miss the boat. Or got run over by the friggen thing.</p><p>Damned Dorian.</p><p>Shane nods and knits his brow, still looking at his feet. \"That's awesome. Try to catch up with us all. Jeeze Aimes, feels like it's been forever.\" His face blushes and I want so badly to read into it. I have to tell myself it is the right choice.</p><p>Blake laughs again. I want to throw something at him.</p><p>Alise gives me her fake smile. \"Having a nerd weekend with dad?\"</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>I wish.</p><p>\"Yeah. Something like that.\" I glance at Blake who crosses his arms.</p><p>\"Yeah, we'll be playing some serious video games at my place, hey Aimes? Pew pew pew.\" His eyes glisten. He knows there will be pew pew pew but it'll be real. He loves it.</p><p>I nod again. I feel lost but Blake is still my beacon.</p><p>Shane pulls on Jessica's hand. \"It was nice seeing you Aimes, but we gotta go. See ya 'round.\"</p><p>He drags her down the sidewalk and kisses her hand.</p><p>He used to kiss my hand. We used to do normal things, like watch TV or shop for food and kiss in the aisles. It was short lived but I remember every detail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blake flashes me a smile. He knows how much it all hurts. \"See ya Aimes. I will call you later k? A little pew pew pew will make you feel better.\"</p><p>I nod. \"It will if you stop saying that.\"</p><p>He laughs. I want to. They leave me, alone again.</p> <p>It's painful. No matter what happens or the people he dates, it's painful. The panic in my heart is real. The love I felt for him once is real. His memories of me are not. Dorian's mind tricks have worked. Shane doesn\u2019t even register me.</p><p>They all walk down the sidewalk and inside I cringe when he hugs Jessica and laughs. He is free from me. I know it's better and I know I asked Dorian to do it, but it still hurts.</p><p>The warm wind is there suddenly, lifting my hair into the air. My skin prickles. My heart remembers where it's meant to be.</p><p>My panic and fear and pain are gone instantly. He soothes the raw nerves and fills the gaps where I wish my life were normal.</p><p>His arms wrap around me and pull me in. I melt into him.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry. He kissed me.\"</p><p>He growls. \"I know.\"</p><p>\"Can't you beat him up or something?\"</p><p>\"No. He's an archangel. Impossible to actually beat up. But I can get him very drunk and humiliate him, again.\"</p><p>I laugh. \"Wanna meet my dad?\" I ask. I forget everything else.</p><p>He nods against my face and kisses my cheek.</p> <p>I turn and am lost when I see him. His blue eyes melt my heart. Nothing else matters. Giselle is a ravenous psycho. Shane doesn\u2019t recall the smallest of details. Lorri wants to eat Giselle. O and Trist have to kill their mom and I have to kill their dad. But none of it matters.</p><p>Aleks squints. \"Hurts still, huh?\"</p><p>I nod. I don\u2019t mean to still love Shane. I know it was never the way I love Aleks. It never was true love, but it was love all the same.</p><p>He kisses my forehead. \"It'll get better. Be grateful he's safe.\"</p><p>I nod again. I bite my lip watching his half smile. I stand on my tiptoes and kiss the uneven part of his lips. He watches me.</p><p>\"You look sad.\"</p><p>I look to where my sister and the crowd are walking on the sidewalk.</p><p>\"It's not him I want. It's never been him. It's what he represents. I want us to be like them. I want you to be my boyfriend and take me to a party and be my date and hang with my sister and her friends. I want us to be normal. I want to pay bills and have a house and shop for food and get a cat. It's not fair. I already have a name for the cat, Shakespeare.\" I know that's what I loved about Shane in the end. It was never that I loved him more than Aleks, that wasn't possible. Not then and definitely not now. But I loved that he was real. A real man in the real world. It made me a real girl. Even before I was part of the underworld, he was always part of the life I wanted. He was popular and his life was normal and easy.</p> <p>I look at Aleks again and smirk. The fire his crooked lips create in my belly is a feeling Shane has never been able to create. Once Aleks arrived the competition for my heart only ever had one real outcome.</p><p>He kisses my cheek. \"In twenty years when they are starting to age and their lives are stale, they will be the ones saying it isn\u2019t fair. Trust me. I've been here before.\"</p><p>I look at him and watch his eyes in the orange glow from the streetlights. \"It doesn\u2019t feel like enough right now. I want us to be normal.\"</p><p>He lifts my hand in his and kisses the back of it. \"It has to be enough. We can't ever be those things. You're different and I'm dead, for the second time.\"</p><p>I laugh. It still hurts, but he makes everything hurt less.</p><p>I step away from him and pull hard on his hand, to get him walking to the front door with me.</p><p>\"You still need to meet him.\"</p><p>\"Can't we just get the cat? I like the name Shakespeare.\"</p><p>I laugh and drag him in the front door, \"Dad, I'm home.\"</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Ophelia</p><p>His fingers trace their way up and down my arm. I want to be somewhere alone with him, ripping his clothes off. Instead we are on babysitting duty.</p><p>She looks feral.</p><p>It's weird. She is the most beautiful girl in the world and yet she is completely taken by her hunger. She could be seducing every guy in the world and living it large. Instead her dark eyes dart around the small room like a nervous crackhead.</p><p>She moans and curls into a ball.</p><p>I look at him but he shakes his head.</p><p>I look up and whisper, \"Why is it so bad for her? Are all succubus this brutal?\"</p><p>He shakes his head. \"No. She has the blood lust from being a vampire. She remembers what it was like to eat blood. She's been biting the people she's been sucking dry. So she is still getting blood from them and their essence. Being a succubus is intense enough on its own.\"</p><p>I raise an eyebrow, \"Do you share the feelings and talents with her the way Dorian and Aimee are the same sort of thing?\"</p><p>He nods, but doesn\u2019t remove his eyes from her. He is so beautiful, even in the dark. I can't help but think about the shower we had yesterday. The way the water would bead on his skin or the way he looked with just the towel wrapped around his waist. I'd never showered with anyone before.</p><p>He looks at me. \"I can sense you\u2019re thinking something not good right now.\"</p><p>I blush. I think of my mom. Not my real mom but my mom, mom. I push the thoughts of him away. I wonder where Abbey and my parents are.</p><p>His fingers start to knead my arm, instead of trace lines up and down. He sinks his fingers deeper into my flesh and massages.</p><p>Giselle is finally asleep. She looks peaceful.</p><p>Oliver takes my hand and suddenly we are in his room at Marcus's house.</p><p>He pushes me back lightly. My legs hit the bed and I fall back on it. He climbs onto the bed and on top of me. His weight presses me into the mattress. I moan as his lips trace along my throat.</p><p>\"Oliver, we have a situation.\"</p><p>We both lift our heads and glare at Marcus standing in the light of the open door. He's watching us, with his dark eyes glowing in the dim light. My stomach twists when I see his eyes. Sometimes when I look at him I can hear his thoughts. Thoughts of draining every drop of blood from my body, but in a naughty way. He makes me blush and cringe at the same time.</p><p>Oliver looks back at me and kisses my nose. He stands and offers me his hand. I sigh and let him drag me, unwillingly, off the bed.</p><p>I follow them down the hall of the huge creepy old castle. It's weird there is a castle in Portland that no one ever puts on the tourist stops. The hall is wide and filled with old pictures. Old paintings. I'm pretty sure I've seen a few that look like Marcus and Dorian and Aleks but in costumes.</p><p>I can't help but wonder if in two hundred years I'll be walking through my own castle with Oliver and the walls will be lined with paintings of me in jean jackets and skinny jeans.</p><p>\"Look, she called a meeting. That\u2019s all that matters.\"</p><p>Oliver glances back at me and winks. I melt.</p><p>Lost in the paintings and the smile, I almost don\u2019t hear the muffled noise off to the right when we pass one of the corridors. Marcus's back straightens as we pass it. The moan fills the hall again.</p><p>I turn right and start running. I know that sound.</p><p>\"Ophelia leave it.\" Marcus barks after me.</p><p>I run faster. \"It's Hanna.\"</p><p>I hear a struggle followed by a scream.</p><p>The door at the end of the corridor is black and thick. When I touch it my hand sparkles. I turn the knob but it doesn\u2019t budge. Down the hall Oliver and Marcus are fighting and suddenly they're gone. Oliver has flashed him away.</p><p>My stomach stops feeling like it's sunk into my bowels.</p><p>\"Hanna?\"</p><p>The moan is muffled.</p><p>I kick the door but nothing. I stand back and roll my shoulders. A wind starts to pick up in the hallway. I point my fingers and a blast of lightning hits the door. It ricochets off and shoots down the hall. It hits a painting of a house and starts a small fire.</p><p>I giggle nervously. He's going to kill me when he gets back.</p><p>I shoot a bolt of frost down the hall and freeze the flames.</p><p>The cold of the frost lingers on my fingertips. I brush them against the door and it freezes solid. White frost covers the door in an intricate frozen design.</p><p>I stand back and fire another bolt of lightning. The door shatters into a million black sparkly pieces. I cover my mouth and close my eyes and step through the black dust with my other hand out.</p><p>The room is padded and creepy. A single light shines down from above. Hanna is tied to the wall. She is wearing only a long shirt and the shackles holding her arms and legs to the wall.</p><p>\"What a pervert,\" I mutter and walk to her. She is moaning and having trouble keeping her eyes open.</p><p>I know she has turned him down everyday since he came back from the dead, but damn. Her bracelet is gone. I notice it because of the instant contempt I feel for her.</p><p>I plant my feet and take her hand in mine. Her skin is burning. I close my eyes and envision it the way Lydia taught me to. The field of flowers and the shore of shells meet in my mind and start weaving. The flowers are the base of the bracelet and the shells are the bling. My mind weaves and as I think it, I feel it form on her wrist. As the white shells hit her skin I can feel the energy blasting off them.</p><p>She sighs and I can feel the struggle inside of her ending.</p><p>My hate for her dissipates with her fever. I am exhausted. I still haven\u2019t learned to replace the energy I use.</p><p>Her eyes open and she smiles weakly, \"Thanks. You make them so fast now.\"</p><p>I nod and snap my fingers at the lock of each shackle.</p><p>She raises an eyebrow, \"You're getting better at this.\"</p><p>\"Yeah. I've been practicing a lot. I only have a few days until I'm supposed to kill her and him.\" I don\u2019t say their names. It burns inside of me. We need a solution and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.</p><p>\"Henry.\" Her lips tremble.</p><p>I look back at the man standing in the doorway. He is solid and wearing a bowler hat, which is weird. He nods and walks into the room. I know him. Somehow my body knows him. I put a hand out and he takes it. He squeezes my fingers and we speak without words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You're in danger. If you must take her then you should go now. Go and don\u2019t come back here. Dark things can come to this castle, Ophelia. Dark things that can corrupt your magic. Lydia's is the best place for you.\u2019 His soft words whisper through my mind.</p><p>I frown. \u2018Oliver told me Marcus's house was guarded.\u2019</p><p>He shakes his head. 'It can't keep them all out.' His words whisper into my mind and I shiver from the tickle of them.</p> <p>I nod and turn back to her. She collapses in my arms. I lift her arm over my shoulders and together we walk past him.</p><p>He grins at Hanna. I know he can't help himself. None of them can.</p><p>\"Don\u2019t tell anyone okay.\" She mutters.</p><p>I look at her and nod. I don't understand why she would keep the secret that Marcus has been holding her hostage and torturing her.</p><p>I take her to the front door and put her in the car parked out front.</p> <p>\"Where to?\"</p><p>She licks her lips and seems to be struggling with sitting down. \"Roland's.\"</p><p>I close the door and get in the driver seat.</p><p>I'm going to kill Marcus.</p><p>She starts to fall asleep as soon as I start the car. I should be driving the stupid car Oliver gave me. I blush when I think about him. I shake my head and drive to Roland's. The stolen car from Marcus's feels more my speed. I don\u2019t like the fact Oliver got me a car. It feels weird that he's so rich and old.</p><p>The huge Tudor mansion is the coolest house I've ever seen. It's beautiful.</p> <p>Roland is standing in the doorway when I arrive. He looks stoic, as far as I can tell he always looks like that.</p><p>He opens the car door. \"Miss Hanna, are you alright?\"</p><p>She nods and winces as he pulls her from the car. He holds her tight.</p><p>He looks at me and I shake my head. \"Rough night.\"</p><p>He looks at the flimsy t-shirt unconvincingly, but turns and carries her to the house.</p><p>I call after them. \"Hanna, Lorri called a meeting. Want me to wait for you?\"</p><p>She looks over his arm and smiles. \"No, I'll just clean up and head over right away. Where?\"</p><p>I grimace. \"The woods behind Marcus's.\"</p> <p>She rolls her eyes. \"K. Should have just showered there.\"</p><p>She must have Stockholm syndrome. I don\u2019t want to think about what he did to her. I already have a pretty good idea. I'm going to kill him. I turn the car around and head back to his place.</p><p>When I drive up Marcus and Oliver are standing outside the house arguing still.</p><p>I don\u2019t get out of the car. Marcus shoots me a death stare. I smile. It's not genuine, because I'm pretty much ready to pee my pants when he looks at me, but I can't back down.</p><p>Oliver looks at me and mouths 'go away'.</p><p>I shake my head and get out of his car.</p><p>Marcus snarls at me. \"You foolish little girl. Who do you think you are?\"</p><p>I shrug. \"The first witch's daughter, you know, magical royalty. Why?\"</p><p>He laughs. He always laughs the same broken and bitter laugh. He is broken.</p><p>He storms inside. Oliver walks to me and takes my hands. \"That was dumb.\"</p><p>I watch his eyes and wait for him to smile. He doesn\u2019t. He still looks pissed.</p><p>\"I had to help her.\"</p><p>He closes his eyes and sighs. \"No, Hanna was being held because the cure Marcus made for her isn\u2019t working. She is starting to black out. She woke in a puddle of blood and half eaten mountain lion yesterday. Marcus brought her here and she changed again and tore a hole in the wall of her room. He chained her for her own safety.\"</p><p>I feel sick. \"Oh my god, I left her with Roland.\"</p><p>He nods. \"I know. She's coming back. She can't live with Roland anymore. Not safe. She needs someone like Marcus who can keep her safe, well keep everyone else safe from her.\"</p><p>I love Hanna. \"We need to help her.\"</p><p>He sighs again. 'I'm pretty sure you have enough on your plate.\"</p><p>He takes my hand and walks into the house just as Marcus comes storming into the front room. \"GOD DAMMIT OPHELIA, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!\"</p><p>I cringe and feel the sparks starting in my fingers.</p><p>He is pacing and looking like he's going to pull his hair out.</p><p>\"Oliver, she destroyed the obsidian door and burned a fucking four hundred year old painting and half a fucking wall.\" His dark eyes settle on me and I feel naked.</p><p>Oliver looks at me. His mood hasn\u2019t improved. He looks at Marcus and sighs impatiently. \"I know where I can get another door.\"</p><p>Marcus points. \"I have the goddamned doors in the basement. I keep several on hand, Olly. That\u2019s not the point. The point is that she is a meddling little witch and I don\u2019t want her in my house anymore.\"</p><p>He charges at me but before he can get to me Oliver is in front of me. Suddenly a sharp wind rips through the room and Oliver and Marcus are both flung to the ceiling.</p><p>My hands are outstretched but I swear I never unleashed the magic. I look to see Henry standing in the entrance to the room. He looks annoyed.</p><p>Oliver flashes and is standing in front of me again. Henry looks at him fiercely and he grabs my hand. He nods at Henry and suddenly we are standing in the grove behind the house. His hand is almost ripping the skin off of me. The forest is silent and I don\u2019t know what to think of anything.</p><p>\"Did he call you Olly?\"</p><p>If looks could kill I would have exploded seconds before I even asked the question, which apparently never improved his mood.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Aimee</p><p>My dad loved him. Loved isn\u2019t even the right word. Adored. I look at myself in the mirror and feel a small measure of happiness, knowing he can rest easy that I'm in a relationship he can trust. As far as he is concerned, I'm in school and doing great and with a great guy.</p><p>My skin shivers as warm wind fills the room. I smile before I see anything. I smile because he is the answer to my heart's call. I smile because I can see his uneven lips and his amazingly white blue eyes when I close my own. I smile because when he touches me I still forget my name.</p><p>\"Aimee, we need to go.\" His voice has a hint of panic. That\u2019s about as panicked as he gets. I ignore it and walk to him.</p><p>\"My dad loved you.\" I kiss his cheek softly, teasingly.</p><p>His warmth seeps into me when I touch him. My fingers bite into his broad chest. I lift on my tiptoes again and try to get a real kiss in. Instead we are sucked up into his wind and then standing on a grassy field. I look up at him. The moon's brightness lightly touches objects surrounding us, showing us half of what is there.</p><p>He looks around. \"There.\" He walks away from me.</p><p>I look to where he is walking and sigh.</p><p>Dorian waves his usual nod. \"Hello brother, Aimee. Long time no see.\"</p><p>I want to sneer, but Aleks hates it when I start the pissing contest with Dorian. I smile sweetly and lace my voice with the disgust I have for him, sometimes. \"Dorian. Fancy meeting you here, in the dark woods where you have no doubt lured some young girls.\" I mutter the last part.</p><p>\"I can make it fancy if you like.\" His dark eyes burn.</p><p>\"Ewww.\" I smile, mostly because I can't stop myself. \"My life is fancy enough.\"</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \"Half an hour, Aimee. That\u2019s all I would need to change your world. You think that lug is skilled in being 'fancy' you are mistaken. His paltry few hundred years are nothing compared to my thousands.\" He takes my hand and kisses it.</p><p>I rip it away. \"Don\u2019t make me kill you.\" I love the fact I now know I can kill him. He made me to kill things just like him.</p><p>He steps into my face. \"Try it little girl. Again, I have moves you can't even imagine.\"</p><p>I look up into his dark eyes daringly. \"I bet I can imagine them. I bet they revolve entirely around you. You strike me as a selfish and self centered dark angel.\"</p><p>He runs a finger along my jaw line and pleasure shoots through my body. \"I do love a challenge. You don\u2019t belong with him. You need someone who won't put up with your naughty disrespect.\"</p><p>I gasp at the pleasure and step back, ashamed. My face is red. He's won. He always wins. My fingers spark. He laughs at them. He turns and walks into the forest.</p><p>I hate him. In that moment I am able. Mostly it's made up of dark lust.</p><p>Aleks is looking back at me like I'm holding him up. I grunt and stalk into the forest after Dorian. My high heels sink into the soft moss and dirt.</p><p>\"You need different boots for this sort of stuff, Aimee.\"</p><p>I look up at his white blue eyes and snarl. \"I didn\u2019t know we were going bushwhacking. I was trying to get a kiss and you flashed us here.\"</p><p>He looks disinterested, no preoccupied. He's looking around like Lucas does. \"We have stuff to do. Days of stuff to do. You kids need to grasp the severity of the situation.\"</p><p>Dorian looks at me smugly. \"Yeah. You kids are really not taking this seriously enough.\"</p><p>Kids. Did they seriously just call me a kid?</p><p>I stick my tongue out at Dorian and blow by Aleks, well as fast as my boots will allow. \"Where are we?\"</p><p>Dorian's dark eyes glisten in the moonlight. \"Behind Marcus's house.\"</p><p>I despise Marcus too. I wish they would all just go away. After we save the world of course.</p><p>I can't stand being around Dorian and I despise Marcus and I have to maintain constant effort to not hate Hanna. I sigh.</p><p>Hanna is because I can't deal with anything that makes me think about Sam. The night feels colder suddenly, as his smile floats in my mind. His face brings the memory of the children. I clear my throat and look around. I see strawberry blonde hair bouncing like a wavy cape. My anger growls in my stomach. I rein it in and smile at her. She looks exhausted.</p><p>\"Hey.\" Hanna pulls her hair back into a ponytail. She looks around. \"Why are we here?\"</p><p>I shrug. The feeling of contempt prickles inside of me. I shake it off and smile at her. Everything is forced. I do it for him. It's what he would have wanted me to do. Sam loved her and I have to try harder at not hating her.</p><p>Dorian stands beside her, grinning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rolls her eyes. \"Not now okay. I'm tired.\"</p><p>Her bracelet is fiery red. It would dull the brightest light.</p><p>Aleks is pacing. He isn\u2019t touching me or trying to talk to me. I start to get nervous. He glances at me. He gives me a fake smile. His lips are perfectly even. Something is wrong.</p> <p>Ari walks out of the forest looking wild with the huge wolves on either side of her. It always makes me smile seeing her like that.</p><p>\"You need a bow and arrow for that look.\"</p><p>She laughs. \"Why are we here?\" She looks exhausted and tortured. The same look she has had since the kids and Sam.</p><p>Aleks looks at Dorian. They do the thing where they speak without speaking. I hate that.</p><p>Ari gives Hanna her best pleasant smile. \"Hey Hanna. How's it going?\"</p> <p>Hanna shakes her head. \"You don\u2019t have to Ari. I get it.\"</p><p>\"Get what? We just never see you anymore. You're always at Roland's.\"</p><p>Hanna looks around impatiently. \"Yeah. Lydia's is a hard gig for me. Roland's isn\u2019t so easy either though.\"</p><p>I sigh. \"I hear that.\"</p><p>Dorian holds a hand up. \"Let\u2019s not do the maudlin Sam thing again please. We're here to see Marcus. He refuses to meet with us on our land, obviously. He'll be here any minute.\"</p><p>Hanna looks like she's been stabbed. She walks to an old log and sits. I feel sick when I imagine what she's going through. I glance at Aleks and know her pain.</p> <p>\"Marcus is here now.\" A deep voice rings through the forest. He walks over with the same asshole air he always has about him. Snooty and shitty to everyone.</p><p>I see something behind him. Oliver is dragging Ophelia through the forest to us. Yikes. He looks angry. Hot and angry. I can't help but smirk. The fallen have a strange effect on us. I glance at Dorian and hate how attracted to him I am. He grins at me. He knows what I'm thinking. He runs his tongue across his lips. I watch the whole thing frowning.</p><p>Tristan and Phillip walk up behind Ari. I can't help but smile at how cute they are. Holding hands, and oblivious to the world ending, they come strolling over as if this were a romp in the forest. Tristan looks at Oliver and scowls. Oliver unhands Ophelia. Something is up with them.</p><p>I glance back at the group to catch Marcus looking at Hanna and smiling softly. She is the only thing in the world that makes him human. I feel sad for her. It takes away some of the hate. Most of it.</p><p>\"Alright Marcus, get to it. I have a huge fuck up to deal with in Japan and don\u2019t have time for this right now. The other Roses aren\u2019t having a much better week than you lot.\" Lorri stalks out of the bushes in her bog boots. Her feet aren't sinking in like mine. She looks savage, as usual, but this time she suits the forest motif.</p><p>\"Okay look, we have an issue. Oliver, Aleks, and I have been pouring over the old ways and we think we have a way to make it so Ophelia dearest, who likes to burn my hallways and irreplaceable art, can take the magic without killing Tristan. However the mother has to die at her hands first. It's backwards and we don\u2019t know if she is going to be strong enough to do it.\"</p><p>Ophelia's face flushes. She lowers her gaze and looks at Hanna under her lashes. Hanna licks and chews her lip nervously.</p><p>What is going on?</p> <p>Lorri paces. \"Okay, so if we get the blue sisters to give O their magic and then she and Oliver kill their mother but she delivers the final blow and gets the magic then it should be a snap for Trist to give O his magic.\"</p><p>I think everyone is lost. The confused nodding is everywhere. I have no idea what she has just said.</p><p>Lorri looks around at us as if it's going to be simple.</p><p>\"Are we done? Did you call this meeting for this pathetic problem?\"</p><p>Marcus looks annoyed. He blinks at her and when he speaks his accent thickens considerably, \"Lorri, the blue sisters can't give the magic until the mother is dead. The situation isn\u2019t going to work the way we want it to. The laws of magic are the laws of magic.\"</p><p>I look around, wondering if I'm the only nerd thinking this is just like Highlander. I glance at Ben and know I'm not. We watched the movies together several times. I nudge his thick furry body and grin, \"There can be only one,\" I whisper. He makes his wolf chuckle and nods his huge face.</p><p>Lorri shoots a glare at us.</p><p>I press my lips together and fight my grin. Ben drops his head, ashamed.</p><p>\"Well fuck. Is the witch going to fight us on this? Is she going to fight for her life?\"</p><p>I look around. \"Henry can help.\" My eyes dart at Marcus and Aleks. They both look uneasy.</p><p>Marcus shakes his head. \"Shut it Aimee. I mean, no, let's leave poor dear Henry out of this.\"</p><p>My face burns. \"But we all know where the heart is. If you sacrifice yourself and let Aleks tell him he will owe us a favor.\"</p><p>Hanna's eyes shoot open and I can't help but feel disgust. She loves him.</p><p>The betrayal of Sam hurts me.</p><p>Marcus seers, \"Let's not. Just forget about Henry. His favors are never what you expect.\"</p><p>Lorri looks at me and shakes her head subtly. \"He's right. He'll find a way to help us without actually helping. He's Fae, tricky creatures. He'll never betray O's mom. They're his family.\"</p><p>Dorian looks at me like I'm stupid. \"Try to remember we took over their world Aims.\" His patronizing tone annoys me.</p><p>Hanna looks like she is breathing again.</p><p>Ari glances at the wolves and smiles. \"What about Aleks's dad? What if we give him to Henry? Would he help us then? The wolves can track him.\"</p><p>Lorri looks at Ari and scowls. \"Jon is not caught so easily.\"</p><p>Ophelia speaks up. \"He'll come for me. I know he will. He's inside my head still.\"</p><p>Oliver looks like he's about to say something but gets cut off by Lorri. \"This could work. We can't free Henry, we just can't. But if he could free the witch's spirits, wouldn\u2019t they move on and leave their magic behind? Then O can take the magic and her and Trist can go together and kill their mother. Then me and Aimee have a date with destiny. Henry wouldn\u2019t have to know what was going on. Speaking of which, O you stay away from Marcus's house. Henry can read your mind.\"</p><p>I gulp and Ophelia nods, looking angry.</p><p>Lorri's eyes are on fire when she looks at me and snap her fingers. \"Make it happen.\" She speaks and is gone. No doubt to Japan. She has Roses on every continent. Asia is a very intense section. It's where she spends the majority of her time.</p><p>I glance at Ophelia who looks nervous and annoyed. I harden my face like normal and nod at her. She swallows hard and nods back. She walks to Hanna and starts to speak in a hushed tone. Hanna and her walk away. Something is up with them.</p><p>I turn and smirk at Ari. \"So wanna go see some wolves about a madman?\"</p><p>I want nothing like I want the revenge I deserve for my mother's death. Aleks's father is number one on my list of people to suck dry.</p><p>Warmth surrounds me. He is trying to calm me. I don\u2019t turn around.</p><p>Ari's eyes sparkle. She puts a hand in as the wolves put paws in. Ari holds her cell phone up for me to see the picture of where we are going and instantly we are there. The lodge in front of us is grand and more than I ever imagined for a bunch of were's. Wolves and humans walk amongst each other in between huge log homes.</p><p>Heads turn, teeth are bared at first, but when they see Ben and Luke they're running and crying out. Wolves nuzzle and humans embrace. Ari and Aleks and I stand and watch.</p><p>Luke and Ben shift and stand naked amongst their people. I avert my eyes.</p><p>\"Yeah, they have zero issue with nudity.\" I can hear Aleks laughing. I glance at him and he gives me his crooked grin. I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\"Kids,\" I mutter, still annoyed with him.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \"Wanna go meet the alpha?\" He asks and takes my hand. I take Ari's and try to ignore the sparkle that happens whenever we touch palm to palm. I keep my eyes down and let Aleks lead me.</p><p>The noise of the crowd is incredible. I wonder if any of them remember Ben's death? I squeeze Ari's hand. She hasn\u2019t been the same since Aleks and Ben came back at the cost of all the children and Sam. None of us have. I know Aleks notices it. It breaks my heart that he knows we all wish Sam hadn\u2019t died. Not that anyone wishes he and Ben had. It's just a confusing pile of shit, as always. Nothing is simple for us. Not even walking through a wolf village.</p><p>A loud voice booms across the lawn. \"You bring this here Lucas? This angel of death?\"</p><p>My face flushes. I glance up at a huge man standing in front of me. He and Aleks are the same size, massive. Aleks stands in front of me.</p><p>The man is older, forties maybe. He has salt and pepper cresting his brow and sideburns. He looks pissed. No one is ever happy to see me.</p><p>Lucas and Ben come running over pulling on sweat pants. \"She's with us. Look at her hand.\"</p><p>The man's eyes dart to the ring on my finger. I finger it nervously. It's my thing.</p><p>His bright blue-green eyes watch me.</p><p>\"You're a Rose?\" He says it as if it should be impossible.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Aleks moves to be more in front of me. His rigidity is making me nervous. I get hungry when I get nervous.</p><p>He glances at Aleks with disgust. \"She is your mate?\"</p><p>Aleks laughs and looks back at me. \"Yeah.\"</p><p>I frown. \"What?\"</p><p>Lucas grins and looks at me. \"Let's just go inside.\"</p><p>I notice some of the women eyeballing me and then getting lost in Aleks. They start playing with their hair and batting eye lashes the minute he looks around. Apparently jealousy also makes me hungry. Sparks starts flashing at my fingertips as I snap my fingers, surveying the homes.</p><p>\"Aimes.\" I glance at Lucas who is wearing the shittiest grin ever. I follow them inside.</p><p>I have no idea what to expect or what's going on.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Ophelia</p><p>I drag my hand from his. Every step I take I feel the earth shift. I'm tired of him getting pissed at me. I can hear the earth attacking him and trying to separate us. He is sighing and flashing out of the way of the shifting dirt. Anger brings my earth and fire magic. I don\u2019t glance back. Hanna is staying at Marcus's and I am banished. Oliver won't come to Lydia's, well can't. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"O, stop being a pain in the ass. This is juvenile.\"</p><p>I look back and a wall of fire separates us and circles around him. He tries to flash and can't.</p><p>I smirk. \"Oh, look at who learned to make a hellfire wall.\"</p> <p>He crosses his thick arms. \"You're acting like a child.\"</p><p>I tilt my head. \"I am a child.\" I climb into the car and start it. When I back it up and put it in drive, I snap my fingers and the hellfire ring is gone. A black stain remains on the cement where it burned a hole into the earth. It has completely ruined the driveway. Marcus is going to shit when he sees it. I'm a bit upset I won't be there to see it. His fit will be epic. The driveway will have to be filled in. Not to mention the huge spikes of dirt and rock that has grown up in his yard. I don\u2019t even know how he will get rid of them. I don\u2019t really care. He's a snooty bastard.</p><p>I hope Lydia never felt me casting. She gets spicy about hellfire. I don\u2019t even know why she taught me how to do it. It seems pretty dangerous. It holds a fallen angel prisoner, that's pretty bad. Only me and Henry can do it. Blake had learned to make weapons from it but he took the information into the past with him. Thankfully.</p><p>In the rearview, I watch as he vanishes.</p><p>\"Asshole.\" I mutter.</p> <p>I look back, thinking a small 'thank you' for the fact he can't flash into a moving object. As long as I remain moving, he can't catch me. I grin, imagining what he'll do to me if he does catch me. He's turned me into a perve.</p><p>I run a light and freeze the cars in the other lanes of oncoming traffic. I slow everyone down and speed myself up.</p><p>When I pull on the oak lined street, I see him standing at the boundary of where he is able to go.</p><p>Dark swirls surround his feet. He looks menacing. I press the gas hard but when I get close he doesn\u2019t flash. I slam on the brakes and skid to a stop.</p><p>He looks angrier than before.</p><p>He storms to the side of the car and rips the door off completely.</p> <p>\"Ophelia, if you ever cast hellfire at me I won't be able to control my actions.\" I look at the car door in his hands and giggle nervously.</p><p>He throws it to the ground and drags me from the car. I push against him and shock him. Nothing hurts him. My hands work magic without me casting. Ice creeps along his tattoos and muscles. His freezing cold hands grip me tight. I'm sure he's leaving bruises.</p><p>\"Get control of it now.\"</p><p>His skin is blue and matches his shirt. My feet aren\u2019t touching the ground. He's holding me in the air and still growling.</p><p>I pull back the magic and let it dissolve inside of me.</p><p>He gives me one shake. \"Stop using magic like a little kid. Every time you get pissy you can't be shocking and lighting fires and destroying people's things.\"</p><p>The magic fizzles in my fingertips. He places me on the ground softly. I step back but am pinned by the frame of the car. He bends down and kisses my cheek. \"I think we need a break O.\"</p><p>I gasp but he is firm. He's been thinking about it. I can see it.</p> <p>A tear slithers down my cheek. He wipes it away.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t want to see you right now,\" he whispers.</p><p>I want to argue but he's right. I don\u2019t have a handle on the magic.</p><p>The darkness swirls around my feet.</p><p>He nods. \"It's for the best I think. You need to spend the time with Trist and Annabelle anyway. They can help you.\"</p><p>I am exhausted instantly. I look down at his hands on me and realize what's happened.</p><p>I shove him hard and walk around him.</p><p>\"Goodbye Oliver.\" My arms burn where he has taken my life force. I know it's renewable but he took magic.</p><p>When I cross the line of the border I instantly feel better. Cleaner.</p><p>Annabelle opens the door and smiles.</p><p>\"Ya been casting bad things Ophelia. Now honey what did Annabelle tell ya about things like that?\" She puts her hands on her apron and skirt.</p><p>I sigh and walk into the house.</p><p>\"I need a bath Annabelle.\"</p><p>\"Hmmmm hmmm.\" She makes noises and grunts disapprovingly.</p><p>When I get up the stairs I climb into the huge tub. The bubbles just climb over my chest as Tristan walks in.</p><p>\"O, you casting hellfire? Cause Oliver said you did, but I was like no. No way. Not my sister.\"</p><p>He sits on the toilet with the lid down and plays with his phone.</p><p>I sigh. \"Dude. I'm in the bath.\"</p><p>He smiles. \"Girl please. Anyway, I got the scoop on the witch who cast the spell on your family abode.\"</p><p>My ears perk up. \"What?\"</p><p>His eyes sparkle with the suspense. I roll mine. \"Spit it out.\"</p><p>He cackles. \"Okay, so there was a woman in the room with us when we were being born. She was apparently mom's sister. Not sure what that means, but like I think it means sister in witchy stuff. Not that it matters. So, this witch sister birthed us but apparently only I was supposed to come out. They didn\u2019t see you in any of the ultrasounds. You were using your wee baby magic to cloak yourself, so Jonathan couldn\u2019t see you and kill you. That woman got you out. She found your fake mom and dad and gave you to them and made them believe you were theirs.\" He almost gasps for air and then smirks. \"Seriously though, she has some bad ass skills for reals. Then she put a guard on the house, she died doing it.\"</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say. I look down at the water. The story makes me sick. I can't imagine ever loving something or someone enough to guard them. I look at my brother and smirk. \"So you think this whole plan is going to work?\"</p><p>His face grows grave. \"No. I think Jonathan is going to win. He always does. Him and Lorri used to be together. That\u2019s why she chose him to fall with her. She didn\u2019t realize that it was the fact she loved him that made her trust him. Love and trust sometimes need to be separate things.\"</p><p>\"Him and Lorri?\"</p><p>He nods once with a hopeless look on his face. \"He raped humans and made monsters and let them all hurt god's creations and when Lorri found out she couldn\u2019t kill him. Her heart was broken.\"</p><p>I frown. \"You sure it was Lorri?\"</p><p>He nods. \"She didn\u2019t want to fall O. God asked her to. He needed her to fall. The angels were making it hell on earth.\"</p><p>Again, I look down at the water unsure of what to say.</p><p>\"Me and Phillip just want a normal life. I know it's never going to be normal but we want whatever is closest.\"</p><p>My heart hurts. I nod. I would do anything to be back home and dating Jake and feeling like the world was so no bigger than the town I lived in. \"There was a boy, before. I liked him so much but he didn\u2019t really like me and then one day he did. He liked me and everyone liked me and they invited me to parties and they wanted to be my friend.\"</p><p>\"Magic.\"</p><p>I looked up at him hurt. \"Is that the only way you think that would happen for me?\"</p><p>He shakes his head and looks down. \"I know how it feels for things to work out when you wish it.\"</p><p>\"Phillip?\" My voice is small and shaky.</p><p>He shakes his head. \"There was another boy. I didn\u2019t love him. I hated him. He was a shifter. He was so mean to me so I just wished he loved me and wanted me and couldn\u2019t have me. I wished it out of spite. It was horrid. Phillip hated me. He was so angry but I didn\u2019t understand how I had cast it. The boy suffered and Phillip thought I loved someone else, until Oliver broke it. Well made Lillith break it. Oliver explained it to me. He said that when a witch's magic is coming into them they cast when they wish for things really hard and don\u2019t know it. Now my body can feel the difference between magic and just a daydream, but back then it couldn\u2019t. Oliver was really nice to me.\"</p><p>I nod. \"I did the same. I cast on a whole town of people. My whole high school. I just wish it was real and I was back there and none of the rest of this was happening.\"</p><p>Tristan puts his hand over mine and frowns. \"Kind of an assy thing to say to your only brother.\"</p><p>I snort. \"I still want you to be there for me but I wish everything else would just fix.\"</p><p>He leans in and kisses my cheek, which feels super weird since I'm naked in the tub. \"If I die you have to swear you'll wipe Phillip's mind and let him start fresh.\"</p><p>My eyes dart at him. He nods. I search his beautiful eyes for some kind of joke in it all. He smiles as if he is at peace with it.</p><p>I shake my head. \"No. Don\u2019t talk like that. Please don\u2019t talk like that.\"</p><p>My brother smiles. \"I have fallen in love with him so hard. It is enough for a lifetime. When he pursued me, oh it was amazing. It was such a feeling to be sought after by a man like that. His love has been more than anyone deserves. If I die you will save him O. You will make him whole again and let him have a normal life and you will swear it to me.\"</p><p>My eyes have filled with tears but I don\u2019t know why. It's all hypothetical. I nod. \"I swear.\" My voice breaks. He stands. \"Alright. I will go make you some pancakes and sausages.\"</p><p>I laugh. \"Tell Annabelle I want some scrambled eggs to go with it.\"</p><p>He turns and laughs. \"I will.\"</p><p>He closes the door and I don\u2019t know what to say or do but I miss Oliver and I want him. I feel the magic that could force him to me crawling around under my skin. I sigh and push it back.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Aimee</p><p>\"These guys hate me.\" I lean in and whisper to Ari.</p><p>She nods. \"Me too. When they found out me and Lucas were mated his uncle punched him in the face.\"</p><p>We aren\u2019t allowed to sit at the table where they discuss Aleks's father. Instead we sit back against the wall in the huge log home.</p><p>Aleks glances back at me, still smirking.</p><p>\"Why is everyone giving me that shitty grin?\"</p><p>Ari's face split. Her black eyes fill with humor, \"What grin?\"</p><p>I tilt my head. She grins at me, like everyone else has.</p><p>I point. \"That stupid grin.\"</p><p>\"Oh my god Aimes. They can all smell the sex on Aleks. He reeks of it. They can smell the demon on you. They know you are a succubus like demon. They can't help but smell the sex on you two and imagine the way you suck from him while you're doing it.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grimace. \"They can smell all that?\" My face is glowing red. I scowl at Aleks. He tries to look innocently at me.</p><p>Ari fights the giggle bubbling from her lips. She covers her face where the piercing in her mouth used to be and nods.</p><p>I glare and purse my lips. \"Great. Just great.\"</p> <p>\"We don\u2019t really want to get involved in this. It's Rose's trouble, not a pack problem. What do you really expect us to do?\"</p><p>I'm tapping my feet listening to them. I want to intercede and get this over with. But Lucas is diplomatic.</p><p>\"We need your help sir.\"</p><p>\"Lorri has asked this of us before. We told her what we are telling you. No.\"</p><p>\"Uncle, be reasonable.\"</p> <p>\"No Lucas, you be reasonable. You and Ben are the first of the Fae to choose to become Roses. We didn\u2019t support your decision then because we know what the Roses are, they meddle.\"</p><p>Ben slaps the table. \"Our kind has been killing and raping and committing crimes against the humans. It's up to us to monitor that. The Roses are the law. That is all. We are the justice for all. How can you disagree with that?\"</p><p>Their uncle looks savagely at them. \"I am alpha.\"</p><p>\"Uncle this is a pack problem. His father kills chaotically and indiscreetly. He leaves raped dead women and girls.\" Lucas's tone is strong but kind.</p><p>His uncle's face reddens. \"What does this have to do with us?\" His voice booms across the room. My jaw is clenched. Sparks are flying from my fingers like a sparkler.</p><p>Ben clears his throat, \"Uhm, well, he does his attacking as a wolf. Sometimes part wolf.\" I gag. I turn my face away. The image of my mother splayed across the hood of her car, is forcing its way into my mind.</p> <p>Ari puts her hand over mine and kills the sparks. I close my eyes and force in thoughts of happier times. Times that included Sam.</p><p>\"If it ever got out that shifters coexist with humans, well I'm certain you can imagine how that would be. Experiments and all.\"</p><p>His red-faced uncle looks like he might process the idea. He nods and looks at Aleks, \"We will help but we will need everything. Every offense, dates and locations.\"</p><p>Aleks nods and puts a hand out across the table. \"Done.\"</p><p>They all stand and I can't help but feel lost. I lean into Ari and whisper, \"That was weird.\"</p><p>She nudges into me. \"I know right. They make it look like they are the ones making the choices and that they could deny you, but they don\u2019t. Bravado.\"</p><p>I snort and stand to leave with Aleks, but Lucas and his uncle corner him. A silky haired blonde strolls up in short cutoffs and a tiny tank top. She smiles too much and stands too close to Aleks. My blood is boiling.</p><p>\"Come on champ.\" A huge hand grabs my arm and drags me from the room.</p> <p>Ben smirks and kisses the side of my head. \"Down girl.\"</p><p>I relax my muscles and let him drag me from the building.</p><p>\"Her name is Janine. She is always on the prowl. You know Aleks better than that.\"</p><p>I sigh and nod but the frown stays plastered to my face.</p><p>Ari is standing outside with the same haunted look on her face.</p><p>\"What's up with her?\" I whisper into Ben. \"She seemed good a minute ago?\"</p><p>\"Sam,\" he whispers back. \"Every time we go outside she starts to get that same haunted look.\"</p><p>I feel sick.</p><p>He pulls me the other way and continues, \"I can't imagine what it's all been like for her. She changes things and then has to run around like the movie Ground Hog Day and fix everything she has undone.\"</p><p>I kick a small pebble. \"I know. She doesn\u2019t talk about it, but if you ever share a bed with her you know it bugs her. She has bad dreams still.\"</p><p>He shivers. \"From the orphanage. She told me about them once. She tried to get Giselle to persuade the memories from her. She even got Dorian to try but they are imprinted to her soul we think.\"</p><p>I think. \"Maybe, it's because she is part angel.\"</p><p>He nods. \"Maybe. Anyway, I've been meaning to ask. How are you?\" His eyes kill me. He is sadder than anyone. He and Sam were like brothers. Same as Luke and Sam.</p><p>I shake my head, gripping to my control. \"Not so good.\" I don\u2019t like vocalizing my feelings.</p><p>He shakes his head. \"Me too. I just can't stop myself from missing them.\"</p><p>I glance back at Ari as we walk into the forest. \"She must beat herself up so much.\"</p><p>He sits on a huge mossy log and looks lost, just like Ari. \"She does. She constantly tries to think of a way to control the push. Her and O and Trist have been working on it.\"</p><p>I frown. \"Why? Who would they push?\"</p><p>He shrugs. \"Not sure.\" His eyes tell me otherwise.</p><p>\"You know.\"</p><p>He shakes his head. \"I don't know.\" His words are firm and even if he does, he isn\u2019t going to tell me.</p><p>He reaches over and grabs my hand and drags me to him. He pulls me down on the soggy log and wraps his huge arm around me. I lean into him and rest my head.</p><p>\"We need to get them back, Ben.\" My voice is hollow.</p><p>He rubs my arm. \"She's working on it.\"</p><p>I glance over to the huge house next to the patch of forest we are sitting in. Aleks is walking across the grounds looking for something. My heartbeat picks up, until I see the silky blonde greet him with a kiss on either side of his face. My insides clench.</p><p>Ben laughs. \"Wow, awkward.\"</p><p>I frown at him. \"Who is she?\"</p><p>He shrugs. \"Janine. She's one of the elders. She's really old.\"</p><p>I roll my eyes. \"You'd think she would have out grown those shorts by now.\"</p><p>I see Ari walk past them to where we are sitting. She looks back at them talking and rolls her eyes. It makes me smile. She huffs over to us and sits next to Ben. He wraps his arm around her as well.</p><p>We sit, staring at Aleks and the blonde of doom.</p><p>\"You'd think she would notice her vagina is longer than her shorts.\"</p><p>I burst into laughter. Ben chuckles but Ari just gives us a look. \"Really though. Look at those things. She could die of exposure if she were a human.\"</p><p>A jealous growl rumbles through my throat. \"I could help her with that.\"</p><p>Ari nods. \"Dude, if she keeps pawing your man, I would for sure be showing her how the hands work.\"</p><p>Ben squeezes us and shakes us. \"Down girls. Your petty is showing. Jeesh. Aleks is a smart guy. He won't fall for the sultry ways of Janine.\"</p><p>I sigh. \"Her hair is awfully shiny and glossy.\"</p><p>Lucas walks up to them smiling. He gives Janine the up-down, after she greets him with a hug and looks back at Aleks.</p><p>Ari's jaw tightens.</p><p>Ben is gripping her for dear life. \"That was a wolf move. We can't fight it. The up-down is a wolf move Ari.\" He lets go of me and holds her to him.</p><p>The blacks of her eyes have eaten up the whites. She shocks Ben with her skin. He twitches but holds on.</p><p>I jump up and grab her face. \"Hey.\"</p><p>The black floats back to just her irises. She shakes her head and looks at me. \"Sorry.\" She turns and hugs Ben. \"Sorry.\"</p><p>He shakes his head and twitches again. \"No. It's cool. I'll kick Luke's ass later.\"</p><p>She looks back at him staring at Janine's legs and slumps. \"Cool.\"</p><p>Janine paws Aleks and then turns and paws Luke. They stand there with dirty grins on their faces. I grab Ari's hand and lift her up. \"Let's walk.\" I glance back at Ben, \"Rio?\"</p><p>He puts a hand in but then pulls back. \"I better not. Be back soon. The wolves will be ready to leave once they're done going over his dad's priors.\"</p><p>I nod and wink us to Rio. The warmth in the air and the chaos in the streets is exactly what I need. Ari grips me tightly.</p><p>We slip into a dark alley and lift our faces to the wind, looking for a fight.</p><p>I catch a smell and pull her down the alley. My boots click, my long thick hair feels like my cape, and my heart is racing.</p><p>I point to a building. \"You ready?\"</p><p>Her eyes gloss over, the black inky looking color fills the whites up. Her powers have developed into something frightening.</p><p>We drop hands and sneak around the side of the old brick building.</p><p>The front of the business looks like every other seedy establishment. Rio is a haven for Vampires and Succubus's to hang out.</p><p>Greasy looking men stand out front when we get to the front steps.</p><p>\"Ol\u00e1, meninas bonitas.\" The other men in his small group nudge each other and laugh.</p><p>I lean in close enough to taste his sweat in the air and whisper, \"escapar.\"</p><p>He chuckles and grabs for me. Ari shoots her push at him, not the real push. The push she has learned to do to humans. It knocks him back on his ass on the filthy street.</p><p>His face is a mixture of shock and anger. He points and shouts, \"Essas meninas s\u00e3o putas do diabo.\"</p><p>Ari looks at me. \"Did he call us devil bitches?\"</p><p>I laugh and nod. \"Yeah no, more like devil whores.\"</p><p>\"Devil whores?\" She looks offended and then shrugs, \"Surprisingly accurate.\"</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>The small group of men backs up, like we are wild animals. I fake forward. They run.</p><p>I look at the man and point. \"I told you to run away.\"</p><p>He struggles to get up and runs after the others.</p><p>Ari nudges me, her eyes are still jet-black. \"Dude, your Portuguese is good.\"</p><p>I shrug. \"All apart of the life I was going to have. You know. Doctors without borders and shit.\"</p><p>She pats me on the back and steps up into the doorway. \"Let's do this.\"</p><p>I lift my leg and kick the door in. As we enter the sparks from my fingers fill the dark hallway with flashes of light.</p><p>A man jumps at me, stabbing his knife into my torso. I rip his soul from him. His black blood sprays me. Ari has pushed several of them against a wall. She holds them there.</p><p>\"You know that blood brothels are illegal,\" she speaks softly.</p><p>The eyes flash on our rings. I pull the knife out and shiver from the pain of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anger flashes inside of me. \"I hate being stabbed.\"</p><p>The first man against the wall spits at me. I smile and rub my hands together. Ari holds them against the wall.</p><p>\"You have been charged, convicted and tried,\" I whisper and lean in close to the man who spit at me. \"I find you guilty.\"</p> <p>His eyes widen as my hands spark his soul from him. I run my hands along the wall, pulling each of them. The pleasure and ecstasy makes me mouth breathe in a way I don\u2019t like doing in front of other people. Not that Ari is other people. She knows how I feel when I do crowds. The bodies drop to the floor, looking like nothing more than gutted dead humans.</p><p>I look around at the room.</p><p>\"Stairs over here.\" The room is a large foyer essentially. There is a desk with a ledger and couches. There are no doors leaving this room. Just a hallway with a set of carpeted stairs. I grab the ledger and run after Ari.</p><p>\"Why do Vamps always decorate with the same blood red carpeting? It's so clich\u00e9.\"</p><p>We climb the stairs cautiously. \"I know right. Marcus's house is nice, but dude. So retro whorehouse.\"</p> <p>Ari looks back. \"I still think it's weird he has a castle. You go left I go right.\"</p><p>I nod and we split up at the top of the stairs.</p><p>My boots dig into the carpet. I hate the feel of it. Too squishy. I don\u2019t even want to try to imagine the things in this carpet.</p><p>I kick open the first door. A dark haired girl, younger than me by far, sits on the bed looking spaced out. It takes a minute for her eyes to move and register I am even there.</p><p>\"You okay?\" I ask.</p><p>She shakes her head and speaks a language I don\u2019t know. Her dark silky skin is marred with bites and bruises. Her rail thin arms are filled with needle holes. My hands ball into fists.</p> <p>I look around the small room and smell the air. It's rich with blood and sex and drugs, but no immortals. I put a finger to my lips. She nods. I close the door and slip further down the hall. Every door has the same thing, blondes, redheads, brunettes, dark skin, light skin, every kind of skin. There is one in every flavor but no immortals. Each girl is the same, young, skinny and covered in marks and the same empty stare.</p><p>A blonde speaks English with a French accent to me in the last room. \"Can you help me?\" She whispers.</p><p>\"Yeah, but I need to find the vampires. Where are they?\"</p><p>She swallows and shakes her head. \"I don\u2019t know. They only come at night.\" She shivers, remembering no doubt.</p><p>\"How long have you been here?\"</p><p>She wipes her bright blue eyes. \"I don\u2019t know. Maybe a month.\"</p><p>\"Are you from France?\"</p><p>\"Canada. I'm from Montreal.\"</p> <p>\"Stay here and don\u2019t move. I'll keep you safe but I need to find them.\"</p><p>She shakes her head as silent tears stream down her filthy cheeks. \"They are not here. Please just take me with you.\"</p><p>I put a hand out for her. She leaps from the bed, staggering and swaying. Her ice-cold hand almost shocks me. She is nearly naked in old torn and dirty lingerie.</p><p>I pull her down the hall.</p><p>Ari meets me at the end of the hall. \"Just dying girls?\" She asks.</p><p>I nod. \"I'll flash them out in parties of six.\"</p><p>\"They must sleep near here. Those things downstairs can't be the only ones here.\"</p><p>I think for a minute. \"Is there a basement?\" The blonde shakes her head. \"I only ever saw the room. I was in my bed and then I was in that bed.\"</p><p>My eyes dart at Ari. \"Someone who can flash.\"</p><p>She bites her lip. \"Jonathan?\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"I don\u2019t know. Let's get the hell out of here.\" My stomach is rumbling. The idea of it being a trap is starting to form. I run down the hall getting the girls from the room. Every time I have six I flash them to Lydia's grass. The second trip Annabelle is shouting at me but I flash so fast I miss what she is saying.</p><p>I leave the last of them there and flash back to Ari.</p><p>\"I sent a text to O and Trist and told them what the naked blood bags were doing on the lawn.\" She looks around the room disgustedly and puts her phone away.</p><p>\"Lorri is gonna shit,\" I mumble.</p><p>\"I sent her a message too.\"</p><p>I glance at her. \"Great. She's gonna yell at us for taking this on alone.\"</p><p>\"YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I AM!\" Her blood red boots stomp across the hallway.</p><p>She looks angry but sexier than normal. I glance at her tan skirt and white blouse that's opened a little, revealing her ample chest and cross necklace she wears to spite the haters. Her red hair is spiky still but softer, more glamorous and she is wearing earth tones makeup.</p><p>I frown. \"Were you on a date?\"</p><p>She scowls and I can see her past the mask of prettiness. \"Yes,\" she seethes. \"Now explain this fast. She thinks I'm in the bathroom.\"</p><p>I gasp. \"She's human?\"</p><p>She blushes. \"Aimee?\"</p><p>Wide eyed, I glance at Ari. She has her badass teenager look pasted across her face, \"They flash them in and out. The girls haven\u2019t seen the rest of the house.\"</p><p>\"Daniel had houses like this but I couldn\u2019t ever figure out who did the flashing for him. It can't be just Jonathan. There has to be another who can flash. Who do we have?\"</p><p>\"Me, you, Dorian, Oliver, Aleks and Phillip. I guess Trist and O could probably learn it, if they had to. For the record my money is on Dorian.\"</p><p>Lorri snorts sarcastically. \"Yeah, maybe it's me or Aleks. Burn it to the ground. I'll arrange a mission. The nest of them must be around here somewhere.\" She glances at me. \"Not today though. Firstly, I am on the first date I have been on in a long time where I feel like this is the one. And ever if she wasn\u2019t the one, I need to get laid Aimee. Secondly, we need Aleks's dad. So stop dicking around and go back to Maine.\" She is gone, leaving only a waft of her expensive perfume behind her.</p><p>\"That was awkward.\"</p><p>Ari puts a hand out. \"I really hope she gets laid. Cause she is snippy.\" I take it and we are in the cold air of Maine. My boots crunch on the forest floor.</p><p>\"Do you really think it's one of us?\"</p><p>I shrug. \"Dorian is the only one that can make one of me. Phillip can flash but he's nephilim and you guys are friggen weird. Me and Aleks would never do a dark thing.\"</p><p>Ari shakes her head. \"No. Dorian would never. I know he wouldn\u2019t. I'm super curious about Oliver and Philip though.\"</p><p>\"Fucking angels.\"</p><p>\"Yup.\" We walk out of the woods and up to the house where Lucas lived as a child. Horrified faces watch our every move.</p><p>I stop and look at them and then back to Ari. I stifle a giggle when I see the amount of black and red blood sprayed across the front of her. I look down at myself and nod. \"We better get cleaned up.\"</p><p>\"Oh shit. Where were you two?\" I look up at Lucas storming across the grass to us.</p><p>I lick my lips and hurry up the stairs. Ari is hot on my heels. \"Busy,\" she says and we run inside of the large log house. The inside of it is gorgeous.</p><p>\"Philip and Trist would die and go to gay heaven in this place.\"</p><p>Ari laughs nervously and closes the door. She turns the lock. Lucas bangs on the door and looks through the glass.</p><p>\"Ari open the door.\"</p><p>She stands at the door and speaks through her teeth, \"Go see if Janine will let you in. Asshole.\"</p><p>We walk up the stairs but Aleks flashes into the house and stands on the stairs in our way.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" His ice blue eyes are worried, or angry. Probably angry.</p><p>He looks over the bloodstains and arches an eyebrow, \"Did Lorri call for a mission?\"</p><p>I swallow and glance back at Ari. Aleks fills the room with warm wind. The door opens and closes. He and Luke are standing inside looking at us.</p><p>I scowl at Aleks, \"It's cheating to flash inside and unlock the door.\" I smirk at Ari. \"Let's go.\"</p><p>Aleks sighs, \"It's annoying to lock us out when we don't know what we did.\"</p><p>Ari smiles and raises her hands fast. Both men are pinned against the wall. Luke sighs, \"Dude, I was cool with not knowing. She cools off quickly if you don't poke the bear.\"</p><p>Ari's eyes flash, \"I saw you. I saw you checking her out.\"</p><p>Luke looks confused. \"Who?\"</p><p>Ari spits out one word, \"Janine.\"</p><p>Luke rolls his eyes, \"Ari. She's like a hundred and eighty years old.\"</p><p>I point at Aleks. \"He's way older than that.\" Aleks frowns at me. Luke gives me a pleading look to stay out of it. I scowl, ignoring them both. \"We saw you, both of you. Flirting and smiling and letting her kiss your faces.\"</p><p>His cheeks flush with color. \"Aimes, it's not what you guys think.\"</p><p>I roll my eyes. \"She looks like she could be on the Duke's of Hazard. Don't tell me I don\u2019t know what it is.\"</p><p>Lucas laughs. \"She is the key to the elders council. They all listen to her. She is one of the few females in the pack who is an elder. Her husband was the alpha when he died.\"</p><p>I look at Ari. She laughs. \"I saw the look, Luke. She wasn't even looking at you and you were drooling on her legs.\"</p><p>He struggles with the invisible hold she has over him. \"Babe, it wasn\u2019t like that.\"</p><p>\"You got caught.\"</p><p>Aleks looks at me like he's disappointed in me. He can't flash when Ari holds him. Her power can cripple him completely.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t really want to talk about this.\" Ari drops them and walks past me. I follow her up the stairs.</p><p>She slams a door to a room. I don\u2019t know which one to go to, so I walk to the bathroom and pour a bath. I strip my blood soaked clothes off and climb in.</p><p>\"You can't possibly think I would find that woman attractive.\"</p><p>I smile at him. \"Why? I find her attractive.\"</p><p>He laughs and it's like my favorite song. I can't even be angry with him. He stands with his back to the door. I fight my smile. He points at me. \"You on the other hand, did something dangerous.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look down. \"It was a regular day, Aleks.\"</p><p>\"Lorri will tell me if it was or wasn't.\" His tone is edgy.</p><p>\"You're not my dad.\"</p> <p>\"No, I'm your partner.\"</p><p>\"I was pissed you were checking out that trashy blonde.\"</p><p>\"That's a pretty big tub. I need to get one of those installed at my place.\"</p><p>I smirk. \"Not big enough for you and me.</p><p>\"You can sit on my lap.\"</p> <p>I hear his clothes drop to the floor. My face flushes as his feet cross the huge bathroom to the large two-person tub.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Ophelia</p><p>\"There are hookers everywhere. I don\u2019t even know where else to put them.\" Trist shouts overtop of the shouting women all speaking different languages.</p><p>\"This one is from Monte Carlo. Her family has money. I'm going to flash her to the hospital there and wipe her mind,\" Phillip shouts.</p><p>I stand there and watch it all.</p> <p>\"O, honey you need to help out.\"</p><p>I glance at Lydia and shrug. \"I don\u2019t know what to do.\"</p><p>Trist shakes his head and shouts at a Japanese girl who is sobbing and hugging herself. \"Honey you can't sit there without underwear. That couch is an antique.\"</p><p>I laugh and want to cry at the same time.</p><p>\"Tristan, you ever feel like maybe we are too young for the shit we deal with?\"</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \"O, this is not the time to get melodramatic.\"</p><p>I laugh again and turn away from the chaos.</p><p>I walk out the front door and out onto the street.</p> <p>Instantly he is there. \"You shouldn\u2019t be out here.\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"I can't be in there. They found some house my father had in Rio. It was full of young teenage girls. I can't watch it.\" My hands tremble.</p><p>He grabs me and pulls me into him. His warmth and mass surround me.</p><p>It's silent.</p><p>I look up to see greenery everywhere.</p><p>\"Where are we?\"</p><p>\"Peru.\"</p><p>The air is warm and wet, rich almost. Breathing it in makes me feel high.</p><p>\"Where?\"</p><p>\"The Andes. There is a village down the hill where I once hid for five years.\"</p><p>I look up into his beautiful face and smile. His blue eyes almost kill me. \"Why?\"</p><p>He kisses my lips softly. \"To hide from your father.\" His words are a warm breath against my lips.</p><p>He takes my hand and pulls me through the bright green forest. \"He was crazed. His gifts were meant to pull the sickness from the blood. That\u2019s how he was to use them. We were each given something as a gift from our father as we fell. Mine was used to pull sadness and misery from the soul. Emotional pain. When I went dark with your father, I grew to love the taste of them dying in my arms.\" I pull back a bit, but his huge hand envelope mine and pull me along the hillside. I am afraid of him. I feel the natural magic inside of me brewing.</p><p>\"I couldn\u2019t stop myself anymore. I pulled and sucked until they died every time and I never gave it another thought. Your father is, well, charismatic. He had me believing that we were better than them. Dorian too. We had fun, a lot of fun. But then Dorian and I met a young man named Marcus. He was also a charismatic young man, sarcastic and funny though. Not snobbish like your father.\"</p><p>He pulls me to a huge tree. It's the most incredible thing I have ever seen. He covers my eyes with his hands and I feel the air move. When he takes them from my eyes we are high above the ground. My heart beats widely. I grip the rough bark of the tree. I can see for hundreds of miles. The mist is settled in amongst the mountains and hills.</p><p>\"Wow.\"</p><p>\"I know.\" He points to the village. \"Marcus was smarter than the other humans we had been around. He caught on to what we all were very quickly. He wanted the immortality and the power. He helped Jonathan convince Ethan, Henry's brother, that the dark magic was the only way to punish the man responsible for his daughter's death. Once Ethan turned dark he made many mistakes. One was teaching Marcus and Jonathan how to enslave his own brother. Marcus wanted the magic of the Fae, he wanted the immortality. Jonathan offered him his blood and swore he would make him the highest of the vampires. Marcus didn\u2019t want to be below Jonathan. Instead he went after Henry. Dorian was tired of the evil ways of Jonathan and went back with Lorri. Marcus used the guilt Dorian had over his dark deeds, to convince him going after Henry's magic was the only way to kill Jonathan. That was how we met Aleks. Well after he died, we met him. Marcus told Aleks that taking Henry's heart was the only way to get the power to kill Jon, Aleks's father. Henry, thinking he was much older and considerably smarter than them, caught them in the act and cursed Marcus. He didn\u2019t realize what he had given him, was the very thing he wanted. Realizing a mortal had tricked him, Henry was livid. He found his brother and murdered him, taking his magic.\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"That\u2019s sick. Marcus is a bigger shit than I imagined.\"</p><p>Oliver smirks. \"He is incredibly smart and wicked. His brain is ridiculous. He is a doctor, a chemist, a botanist, a pharmacist, a lawyer, my god I can't even imagine them all. I know he's written novels under assumed names. It's frightening really. Anyway, we all had more respect for Marcus then. Jonathan wanted him dead. Somehow he convinced Dorian and Aleks that Henry's loyalty was of great importance. Henry was on a rampage and ready to kill them all and Jonathan wanted them dead. So they used the things they had learned from Ethan and stole Henry's heart. His heart is inside of Marcus, as we all know. Henry doesn\u2019t know it, thanks to Ari.\"</p><p>\"We should free him.\"</p><p>\"No. He is volatile. He is dangerous. It's best if we let Marcus keep him under wraps. The children of your mother, the ones born of the Fae, they're not stable.\"</p><p>I sigh. \"I don\u2019t feel stable either.\"</p><p>He kisses my head. \"You aren\u2019t.\"</p><p>\"Why did you hide in the village?\"</p><p>\"Your father knew I helped them. I helped Marcus and Aleks and Dorian. I too had turned to Lorri. The saying 'Hell hath no fury' actually came into existence because of Lorri and your dad. She loved him, a long time ago. When we fell he went for Lillith, seeing opportunity and power.\"</p><p>\"He left her for my mom, even though my mom didn\u2019t want him?\"</p><p>He nods. \"Yup. Lorri loved him for a long time. She kept making excuses for him and expecting him to come back to her. He was her weakness. When he didn\u2019t she started the hunt for him. Unfortunately, by the time she had gotten around to him he had built a very large army for himself. Most of the archangels that have fallen and all the nephilim but a few, agree with him. This is our playground. Here we have freewill and the ability to choose. We are immortal. The gates of heaven will never open for us anyway. We have fallen.\"</p><p>\"We will kill him together.\" I squeeze his hand.</p><p>He squeezes back. \"I want you to do a spell for me though. Just in case. This is going to be our meeting place. You can make a port here. This tree is magical. It's spelled by the village shaman.\"</p><p>I frown. \"Why?\"</p><p>His eyes sparkle. \"In case you need to run.\"</p><p>I look out over the view and nod. \"What do I do?\"</p><p>\"Close your eyes and hold the tree tightly. Call the tree and mother earth and the power and light of the spirits. Mark the tree as yours. Visualize a door shaped in the air that you can walk through from anywhere. The rest will come to you.\"</p><p>I swallow hard and close my eyes. The earth magic fills me instantly. Like mother earth and I are connected. My body hums. The rough bark heats in my hands until it is the same temperature as my hands.</p><p>I focus on the doorway. Flashes of the shaman blessing the tree fill my mind. His skin is old and dark and wrinkled. He speaks something I don\u2019t understand. His eyes are completely white and his dark skin is sweaty. He rocks and chants and smoke is coming from somewhere.</p><p>His white eyes dart at me. He smiles and puts a hand out for me. I feel myself letting go of the bark and reaching for him.</p><p>My sisters stand in front of him, blocking my view of his face.</p><p>The blue sisters shake their heads. I push past them and find him again.</p><p>\"O, don't do this. This is dark magic.\" Their voices float in the air but I swat at them and sit beside the man. He crosses his skinny brown legs. I cross mine too. He closes his eyes and takes my hand. His skin burns mine. I scream out but I can't take my hand from his grip.</p><p>I can smell my skin burning. He pries open my hand and rubs it into the ground. My eyes fly open. My lips are parted but no sound escapes them. The sun has set. It\u2019s dark. I'm standing in the tree still. My hand is still gripping the branch. I pull it back but the burnt skin from my palm sticks to the branch. I cry out and stop pulling away. My hand shakes.</p><p>\"It's okay, O. Just pull it back slowly and then heal it.\" Oliver is still with me.</p><p>\"Did you leave?\"</p><p>He shakes his head. \"You did.\"</p><p>I peel my hand from the branch. Tears stream down my cheeks. When I finally have it off I turn my hand over. A circle with a line through it is burned into my palm. The skin is red and blistered. I place my other hand over it and pull the healing from the tree we are in. The hand heals instantly but the scar is the circle with the line through it. The pain is still mildly present.</p><p>\"It still hurts.\"</p><p>He nods. \"It will for a while. You've left a piece of yourself here. It's the only way to make a port. It's so that you can find this place again. Your piece of you will pull you here.\" He takes my hand and kisses the palm. The air moves and we are on the road out front of Lydia's.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to leave him but I know I must. Ari is standing on the front steps. She needs me.</p><p>\"See you later.\" He squeezes my hand again. He lets me go and steps back and then he's gone.</p><p>I miss him already. I feel bleak and weird about the things he's told me.</p><p>I glance at Ari and try to smile. Trist comes bursting through the door. \"O, it's like Pretty Woman meets a Miss Universe pageant in there. Phillip has taken ten of them home but there are still like twelve girls we don\u2019t know where to take. They come from poor countries. It's chaos. Giselle is up and about too. She already almost ate a nice girl from Africa.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look at the scar on my hand and almost wish I were back at the tree. Instead I walk through the door. Phillip flashes into the hallway beside me. \"O, not cool. Leaving us to deal with all this.\"</p><p>\"Guys, mellow out. She's going through some shit.\" Ari scowls and grabs my hand. She drags me through the house to the back door. The cool misty day makes me shiver. When we reach the bench at the dock in the backyard she lets go of my hand and sits. She stares at the water like she sees something I don\u2019t.</p><p>\"You okay?\" I ask.</p> <p>She shakes her head. \"It's a mess. It's all a mess. Aimee and Ben and Luke are miserable without Sam. Hanna is a disaster. Her heart is so broken, my dad said she is blacking out again. Marcus is hiding it from Lorri. Giselle is eating anything she can touch, literally eating. Shane is being brain washed every week because somehow he finds his way back to Aimee. Even Annabelle is dying inside without the little kids. Lydia barely looks at me. Somehow we all have to come together and fight your dad. It just isn\u2019t going to happen.\"</p><p>I sit beside her and can't fight it. \"I agree. We need to find the missing link. Where it all went wrong.\"</p><p>\"Sam. We need him. He is the key to killing your dad. Lydia and Annabelle agree. We need Sam back. Hanna is a mess because of it. Even if he and her weren\u2019t together, her guilt is eating her alive. If Aimee wasn\u2019t here, if she had a normal life, we wouldn\u2019t have the Giselle issue and Aleks would be hunting his dad fulltime. We would have gotten Sam and the kids long before. Lydia told me she wasted a lot of time on helping Aimee control herself. They knew about the kids but never went for them. They were all here helping Aimee. I love her more than I love Lucas, but she is it. She needs to go back. If I can control the push, I can ensure this isn\u2019t her future. Dorian can make a different soul sucker. It didn\u2019t have to be Aimee. She was just a victim.\"</p><p>I nod. \"I can do it. Let\u2019s just go do it.\"</p><p>Ari laughs. \"Guess we're driving.\"</p> <p>I frown. \"Dude, Phillip. Isn't that how you got here from Maine?\"</p><p>Ari shakes her head. \"Yeah, but no one can know. You need to put a spell on Aimee so she doesn\u2019t remember anything and Giselle. So when they go back everything is normal.\"</p><p>\"Blake too,\" I add.</p><p>She nods. \"Let's do this. I'll text Aimes to come to the house and see Giselle. You can do the mind thingy there and then when we go do the push we can hit Blake.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" I stand and walk to my room. I pull the book from under the bed, the book no one knows I have. I turn the old fragile pages slowly.</p><p>\"That\u2019s dark magic O.\"</p> <p>I look back at my sisters and shake my head. \"I'm not doing it. I'm looking for something. I need to fix things. You guys stay with Trist okay?\"</p><p>\"Ophelia, dark magic pulls the darkness into you. Every piece you take in kills off some of the light.\"</p><p>I frown. \"I need darkness to kill my own mother anyway.\"</p><p>\"Not the same way. Please be safe little sister. Our freedom lies with you.\"</p><p>I sigh. \"I will. Everyone's freedom and happiness and everything sits with me.\" I look over the page once more and close the book. I push it under the bed and spell the area again. Even Tristan couldn\u2019t find it.</p><p>I close my eyes and walk to the room, practicing using the air around me to guide me, like Annabelle and my sisters do. Their eyes technically don\u2019t work.</p><p>Opening the door to Giselle's room, confirms it all for me. I am certain that we are making the right decision. She is a hot mess.</p><p>Ari walks in behind me and stops when she sees Giselle.</p> <p>\"Yikes,\" she whispers.</p><p>I nod. \"We need to do this fast. Did you text Aimes?\"</p><p>She nods.</p><p>\"So we driving there after this?\"</p><p>Ari smirks.</p><p>Aimee interrupts us. \"Driving where?\"</p><p>I look back and smile sweetly. \"Ari doesn\u2019t know how to drive. I learned from my dad, like my dad, dad. I was gonna teach her. You wanna come?\"</p><p>Aimee shakes her head. Her eyes never leave the tossing and turning monster on the bed. \"I have to get back to Aleks. He's almost done going over the last few hundred years.\"</p><p>I touch the side of her face. She turns sharply. I lock her gaze with mine and hold her arm. Her grey eyes stare blankly at me.</p><p>\"The compulsion Giselle put on you to remember everything when Ari pushes is gone. You won't remember this moment either.\"</p><p>My magic burns from my fingers. It creeps into her arm. I can feel it leaving me like a vine growing out of my fingertips and flowing into her. Her eyes flutter for a moment. I don\u2019t know for certain if it will work on her. It worked on Oliver once. I drop my hand and wait. Ari eyes me up nervously.</p><p>Her eyes stop and she looks around the room. \"So you, uhm, what?\"</p><p>I smile. \"You need to get back to Maine you said.\"</p><p>She nods weakly. \"That was weird.\" Her eyes settle on Giselle. \"How is she?\"</p><p>Ari shakes her head. \"Bad. She tried to eat one of the girls we rescued. She just can't seem to quench the thirst.\"</p><p>Aimee's eyes lower. \"I better get back.\"</p><p>Ari looks like she is about to cry. \"See you in a bit. I'll get Phillip to bring me back in like an hour. I need to see if I can help Lydia with all the girls.\" Her voice breaks a couple times. Aimee looks at her. Their eyes meet, it's as if they both know it's the last time they will ever see each other.</p><p>Aimee is gone just as Ari's eyes fill with tears.</p><p>Ari doesn\u2019t cry. I've noticed it before. Her tears feel like razors cutting into my heart. I walk to Giselle and do the same thing I did to Aimee. Just as I finish, Phillip opens the door.</p><p>\"What are you two doing in here?\" I glance back at him.</p><p>\"Just making sure she is okay. Wanna give us a lift somewhere?\"</p><p>His eyes narrow skeptically. \"Sure. But why do you look like that?\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"I just can't take how this is all turning out.\"</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look convinced but Ari's tears seem to bother him enough. He puts a hand out. I grab it. Ari pulls her phone out of pocket and shows him the picture. The air moves and we are standing on a windy dock. The ocean is choppy and grey. It's freezing.</p><p>He shivers. \"You guys okay here?\"</p><p>Ari nods and pulls her hood up. \"Yeah. We just need to check on some shit. Thanks.\"</p><p>I take his hand. \"Don't say anything okay. I don\u2019t want Oliver to know I'm out and about.\"</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \"Dad's a bit intense lately. See ya bitches.\"</p><p>He's gone and we are standing on the cold wooden wharf.</p><p>Ari points. \"It's this way.\" We walk through the quaint town and I just can't see Aimee like one of these people. She is too classy and city to be a bumpkin like me.</p><p>Ari doesn\u2019t talk. I know she is devastated. She cries two more times on the walk. She dries her face when we reach the front door of a house with big windows in the front.</p><p>She takes a deep breath and rolls her shoulders. She climbs the stairs and closes her eyes as she knocks.</p><p>A sweet looking man, with a haunted look on his face, answers. He sounds stuffy, \"Hello?\"</p><p>She smiles through her glassy eyes. \"Hello Mr. James. My name is Ari.\"</p><p>His eyes light up. \"Aimee's Ari?\"</p><p>She nods. \"Yeah. I was in town and thought I would stop in and say hello.\"</p><p>He grabs her hand and pulls her inside. \"Come in. Both of you. Please. Blake just arrived. He said some of Aimee's friends were coming over.\"</p><p>I hate the frightened feeling in my guts as I climb the stairs. I can't help but look around the quiet neighborhood as I close the door and lock it.</p><p>Aimee</p><p>My head still feels funny. I kick a rock and circle the log house once more.</p><p>\"Aimee?\" I look up hearing Aleks's voice in a panicked tone I have never heard before.</p><p>He is running toward me panicked. He looks sick. My stomach is a tight ball. \"What?\"</p><p>He flashes and scoops me up. He grips me to his chest.</p><p>\"I'll find you again. I swear I will.\"</p><p>He presses his face into mine.</p><p>I pull back. \"What is your deal?\"</p><p>He swallows. \"Ari. She just sent me this.\" He pulls out his cell and shows me the message. My eyes widen. \"My dad.\"</p><p>I wink but the world stops. Aleks's arms become sparkles in the air, gripping me. Everything moves slowly. His lips move in slow motion and the sounds are lost.</p><p>I spin, trying desperately to grip onto him. His body passes through mine.</p><p>I spin faster.</p><p>O and Ari made me come to them so Ari could say goodbye. I thought the look in her eyes was sorrow for Sam. But I see now it was for me.</p><p>I close my eyes and let the spinning take me. I don\u2019t know where I will wake up when it stops. I don\u2019t know what the world will look like.</p><p>His voice breaks through the spinning world.</p><p>\"AIMEEEEEEEEE!\" He screams.</p><p>And then it's black and still and I am not sure if I'm gone. But I can't open my eyes. The darkness takes me.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Before</p><p>Port Mackenzie 2010</p><p>Aimee</p><p>My eyes fuzz out. I blink and try to focus on what I'm doing.</p><p>\"Aimes you going tonight? Hello?\"</p><p>I look at my mom and smile. \"Yeah. I think so. Blake wants to go.\" Everything feels weird for a minute. I inhale through my nose and notice it right away. I can smell my mom. The mix of old perfume and laundry soap and her clothes makes my heart tug. I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>I get up from the computer and wrap my arms around her. I take a deep breath. The air around her makes me hungry.</p><p>\"Honey, are you okay?\"</p><p>I nod into her neck.</p><p>\"I think I had a bad dream last night,\" I mutter. Starvation almost cripples me. I clutch my stomach. \"I need something to eat.\" I walk away from her embrace and stumble down the stairs to the kitchen. I pour a heaping glass of chocolate soymilk, but then finish the carton off.</p><p>I lower it and burp. The hunger is burning my belly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Gross.

She leaves to answer it and I open the fridge. I grab a block of cheese and pull off a hunk. I take a bite but it isn\u2019t what I want. I toss the hunk of cheese I broke off and put the rest back in the fridge.</p> <p>I can't seem to quench my hunger.</p><p>\"Aimes, we're leaving now.\" I look at my reflection in the glass on the wall mount stove and nod. \"Coming.\" Something is different.

You two dorks better not do anything dorky tonight.\"</p><p>\"We made a deal, Alise. You have to be nice to me and Blake and do my laundry according to washing instructions for a month.\"</p> <p>Watching our house as we drive away, I can't shake the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that's hitting me hard.</p><p>She drives like a maniac, picking up everyone. She pulls up to Giselle's last.</p><p>I shoot a look at Alise. \"Dude, this car is full. We're picking her up too?\"</p><p>Alise waves a hand dismissingly at me. \"She wasn\u2019t feeling well so she didn\u2019t go earlier. Stop annoying me.\"</p><p>\"She's sick and you're letting her come in the car with us all packed in here? We're all going to get sick.\"</p><p>Alise shoots me a glare. \"Shut it.\"</p><p>I groan as Giselle opens my door and raises her eyebrows, \"You're in my seat.\"</p><p>I roll my eyes and sigh.</p><p>\"Aimes, it's a proven fact the people in the backseat have better survival odds.\" I smirk at Blake and climb out of the beater. I squish into the back seat. My face is on fire when I realize I'm sitting on Blake's and Tommy's knees.</p><p>\"You look good for a nerd.\"</p><p>I look over at my sister's friend Tommy and glare. \"You look good considering you only just learned to walk upright.\"</p><p>His eyes narrow. \"Easy nerd girl. I was just trying to pay you a compliment. You clean up nice.\" I look down at the t-shirt I'm wearing and shake my head. \"Gee, thanks.\"</p><p>Blake laughs.</p><p>\"McGinnis, dude you're huge. Way too big for the backseat. What are you six-one?\"</p><p>Blake scowls. \"Six-three.\"</p><p>\"You should tryout for the basketball team when you go to college.\" Tommy grins at him.</p><p>Blake gives me a desperate look.</p><p>\"He isn\u2019t very coordinated.\"</p><p>Tommy shrugs. \"Too bad.\"</p><p>Blake rolls his eyes and I can't wait to get out of the car.</p><p>\"What are you wearing by the way?\" He whispers. I look down at the stupid shirt and jeans Alise attacked me with. I nod toward the front seat. \"Attacked me. Makeup and all.\"</p><p>He grimaced. \"Must have been savage.\"</p><p>I nod and smirk. \"Completely.\"</p><p>Alise pulls into the long driveway and my stomach dances at the thought of seeing Shane. He was finally single and possibly over the fact his dad had left with a twenty-five year old cashier.</p><p>\"God it's hot in here.\" Giselle fans herself.</p><p>I notice the sweat on her temple. She has never sweat before, I'm certain. I feel hot too.</p><p>\"I hope there is food here. I'm starving,\" I mutter at Blake as we all file out of the car. People start screaming and laughing. Tommy throws a girl on his shoulders. Blake and I stand back and watch the chaos. The house is booming. I didn\u2019t want to come, but Shane had asked me himself when I was tutoring him in English. The fact I had loved him forever, secretly, made the decision easy. I even let Alise dress me and do my makeup. Of course she thought I was going to ask Blake out. I glance at him and shiver at the idea of us kissing.</p><p>\"Wanna go in?\" I ask quietly.</p><p>He nods, nervously. I notice he isn\u2019t wearing his glasses. He looks massive without anything in his hands. He's almost always fidgeting with something.</p><p>The front door opens and Shane steps out. I smile, it's involuntary.</p><p>He grins at me and shakes his head. \"Didn\u2019t think you'd make it.\" My sister walks past him giving me the evil eye. He smiles at her too. \"Hey Alise, Giselle, Tommy. Refreshments are in the back. I made Lemonade.\"</p><p>Giselle doesn\u2019t go in with Alise. She stands outside alone. She doesn\u2019t look well. I can't help but notice the way she keeps glancing at me.</p><p>Shane walks in between her and I, taking my gaze with him. I beam up into his blue eyes.</p><p>\"I'm glad you came.\" He smiles at Blake who couldn\u2019t look more uncomfortable. \"Hey Blake.\"</p><p>Blake nods and looks back at me. \"Guess I'll go get some lemonade.\" He slouches a bit.</p><p>\"Straight.\" I say. His back straightens. He looks back and arches his eyebrow at me. He slouches in his computer too much. It drives me insane.</p><p>I look back at Shane and grin like the Chestshire cat. \"Looks rowdy in there.\"</p><p>He looks back and puts his hands in his back pockets. \"Yeah. Wanna come in?\" He asks. I furrow my brow and laugh. \"Yeah.\"</p><p>He shakes his head at himself and looks like he doesn\u2019t know what his next move is. He jerks and turns away from me. I walk up beside him and nudge him. \"You okay?\"</p><p>He nods, \"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"Can you say anything beyond yeah?\"</p><p>He looks down on me and grins, his face is flushed. \"Yeah.\" He opens the door that\u2019s been closed and holds it for me. \"I can say you look nice.\"</p><p>I bite my lip, trying desperately not to blush. \"Thanks. Alise. You know what she's like.\"</p><p>He laughs. \"I do. Any guy would do anything for that girl.\" His face turns crimson. \"Except me. Of course.\"</p><p>I swallow and can't help but wonder where the conversation is going. \"Of course.\"</p><p>\"She still dating that Luke guy from Handley?\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"No. They only ever last a couple months. She is, uhm, well, fickle.\"</p><p>He laughs. \"Fickle. That\u2019s not the word I would use.\"</p><p>I laugh and close the door. I notice Giselle in the yard still.</p><p>I look back. \"I'll be back in a minute.\" I open the door again and run out to where she is.</p><p>\"You okay?\" I ask.</p><p>She looks at me and shakes her head. \"I think I'm sick. Like the flu or something.\"</p><p>\"Want me to drive you home?\"</p><p>She laughs. \"Uh no. I just need a minute Aimes.\" She turns and walks away and I can't help but frown. She used my nickname. She has never called me Aimes in my life. She rounds the back of the house. I turn and walk back inside.</p><p>Shane is holding a drink for me. I take it and sniff. He rolls his eyes. \"I didn\u2019t put booze in it. I know you don\u2019t drink.\"</p><p>I frown. \"You do?\"</p><p>He laughs. \"I've known you for a long time Aimes.\" His voice turns throaty at the end of the sentence.</p><p>I sip my lemonade and try not to shake. I cringe at the taste.</p><p>\"You don\u2019t like lemonade?\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"I do but it just tastes funny.\" My belly rumbles. I glance out the backdoor to the deck. Giselle is standing there leaning against the railing with a guy. His back is turned to me. Something about it is bugging me.</p><p>\"You want to go sit?\" Shane asks. I look up and nod. He grabs my hand and electricity jolts up my arm.</p><p>\"Ouch.\" He pulls away.</p><p>\"Sorry. I think I shocked you.\"</p><p>He laughs. \"Quite the charge you have there.\" I rub my fingertips together and swear I can feel sparks.</p><p>I follow him to the quiet room at the back of the house, the sunroom. He sits on an old couch next to the woodstove. I sit beside him and try to ignore the sparks in my fingertips and rumbling in my belly.</p><p>\"You okay?\" He asks.</p><p>I nod. \"Where is Blake?\"</p><p>We both look around but he isn\u2019t in the kitchen or the sunroom or back deck.</p><p>\"Maybe he's in the living room.\"</p><p>\"Maybe.\"</p><p>He grins. \"So you excited about the year being over?\"</p><p>I smile. \"Yeah. I'm excited. I'm all ready to go.\"</p><p>His face drops. \"All the way to Harvard?\"</p><p>\"Yeah. Far but awesome. You planning on Seattle still?\"</p><p>He shrugs. \"Not sure. I don\u2019t have a right fit yet.\"</p><p>My stomach clenches. I almost double over. \"Oh my god,\" I whisper.</p><p>\"Aimes what is it?\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel so good. I think I got the flu.\" I stand and run for the back deck, \"Just need some air. Be right back.\" I shout back at him. I am terrified to shit my pants at his house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I run down the stairs and put my hands on my hips. They are burning me through my shirt and pants. Holding them out in the fading light, I can't see anything different. My stomach drops again. I buckle and drop to the grass. It hurts more than I can take. Sweat crosses my brow.</p><p>A screaming girl interrupts my plans of running through the woods to my house, where I can die in the privacy of my own bathroom. I struggle to my feet and stumble down the back lawn, to the woods.</p><p>\"Oh my god. Mr. Mac. Please Mr. Mac. Wake up.\" Giselle is pushing on the lifeless body of my favorite teacher, who is lying on his back in a bush.</p> <p>\"Giselle, what happened?\"</p><p>She shakes, her hands tremble. Blood coats them. \"He tried to kiss me and I said no and then he shoved me down on the grass.\" She sobs. I can see her torn shirt and skirt.</p><p>\"He kept saying he needed to teach me a lesson.\" She gasps and sobs.</p><p>I drop to my knees and struggle with the stabbing pain and fire in my belly. I reach for his pulse. Warm wetness coats my fingertips. \"What happened? He has no pulse.\"</p><p>I wipe my hands on his back.</p> <p>She shakes. \"I don\u2019t know? I don\u2019t know? He shoved my face in the dirt. Then everything got really hot and I reached back grabbed him. I just felt so strong and crazy. Aimes, I put my face up to his and sucked him out I think.\" She put her hands over her eyes. \"I don\u2019t know why. I just did.\"</p><p>I have no response. I nod and wrap my arms around her. \"It's self defense. You didn\u2019t mean to kill him.\" I feel sick. Mr. Mac tried to hurt her, my favorite teacher, tried to hurt her.</p><p>\"No, I sucked him out.\"</p><p>I pet her head. \"It's okay. You're just not feeling well. You didn\u2019t mean it.\"</p><p>She lifts her face and in the muted light, I can see the dark red blood coating her face where her hands have touched it, after touching his bloody dead body.</p><p>\"There's blood on your face and hands.\"</p> <p>She wipes at it like she has gone mad.</p><p>\"It's okay. I got it. Let me get it.\"</p><p>I wipe and she cries, \"I did this. I meant to. I wanted it. I wanted to kiss him and suck. Aimes, shit is wrong.\"</p><p>I grimace. \"Okay ewww. No. Stop. We need to call the police.\" My hands tremble.</p><p>She collapses into me. My guts stab me again. My fingers buzz and hum with the current running through them, but I hug her. Desperate to hang on.</p><p>She shivers into me. \"I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know Aimee. I don\u2019t know. They'll think I did it on purpose.\"</p><p>I hold her tight and shout, \"HELP! HELP US PLEASE!\"</p><p>Shane comes running down the darkening lawn. \"Aimee?\" He shouts. I can hear panic in his vice. Tears are streaming down my cheeks. I never noticed them before. \"Here,\" I cry.</p> <p>He is on me, touching me, holding me. He kisses the top of my head. \"Someone call nine one one,\" he yells back at the house.</p><p>I close my eyes and grip tightly to the sobbing mess Giselle is. Something about holding her feels right. Like my soul knows it's right.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Her hair is raven silk, I never noticed before how shiny it really is. I reach a hand forward and stroke it slightly.</p><p>Her silver eyes narrow. \"What are you doing loser?\"</p><p>My palms are burning. I shiver and tingle and imagine what it will feel like to just brush my fingers against her skin.</p><p>\"Ugh, god Aimee you are so weird sometimes.\" She climbs off the couch and walks into the kitchen. It makes me snap out of the daydream I'm having. I frown. Something is wrong with me. I get up and leave the house. I look around the small town as I walk. Something is missing.</p><p>I look into the windows as dusk hits and people start to turn on their lights. The insides of their homes look cozy. Something about it makes me sad. I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>My stomachache is killing me.</p><p>I hear a horn and turn to see Shane driving up. \"You okay?\" He leans out the window.</p><p>I nod. \"Yeah. Just weirded out. Not feeling well yet either. Did the police say anything?\"</p><p>He shakes his head. \"Not a lot. They gave me a flyer to become a cop though. Ha. They did say they found an ass ton of drugs in his house. I guess he gave Giselle some lemonade. She never drank it though. It had the drugs in it. She could have died. It was poorly made. He had some weird shit it in, date rape drugs. She is lucky that he fell and landed on those sticks. They said he died instantly.\"</p><p>I cross my arms and shiver. \"Friggen weird. Blake sent me a text a couple hours ago. He's crushed. Mr. Mac was his mentor.\"</p><p>He nods. \"Get in the truck. We can go for a drive.\" I don\u2019t think. I run across the street and hop in. I put my hands up to the heater. The spring is cold on the coast.</p><p>I glance at him as he turns onto the old beach road. \"I haven\u2019t been here in years.\"</p><p>\"I like it here.\" He drives past the old trail that leads to the secret beach. Only our small town knows about. He drives up to the viewpoint and I force my stomachache away.</p><p>\"So, I wonder who will replace him as the Chem teacher?\"</p><p>I almost smirk. Nerves rattle inside of me. \"Blake said he's been asked to do it.\"</p><p>\"Wow. Really?\"</p><p>I glance at him and try not to stare at his lips. Or lick mine.</p><p>He parks the truck at the cliffs and turns it off.</p><p>\"Wanna walk?\" His voice is low. It steals my breath. I nod weakly. He climbs out and walks to my door. He stands too close to me when he opens it. When I slide from the seat my chest presses against his. He lowers his face on mine. His soft lips brush mine, making heat trails cross my lips. It's the slightest brush, I barely feel the contact.</p><p>He grabs my arms and presses his face into mine. His tongue slides against mine, his hands grip my arms, and his body presses mine against the frame of the truck. My hands slide up into his hair, pulling him down on me harder. I want more. The air is sweet and heavy. I feel high. His grip tightens on my arms, but I can't stop myself. He's filling me up. He slaps me in the arms and pushes, but my back is against the truck. I'm stronger than he is. His muscles feel strong and hard in my hands but I can hold him to me. He pushes and hits but the air is too sweet.</p><p>Cold air rushes in between us. I open my eyes gasping. I want the air back. I want the taste of him to fill me up more. I lick my lips, I can taste him still.</p><p>\"Aimee.\" I look to the right. A strange looking girl with black eyes and long dark hair is standing next to a dark blond guy.</p><p>\"Who are you? Where's Shane?\"</p><p>I see a dark haired man kneeling over Shane's body on the grass by the cliffs.</p><p>Panic fills me. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?\" I run at the man.</p><p>He looks back at me and snarls two huge fangs, \"Christ Aleks, get her out of here.\"</p><p>I leap at the dark haired man with the fangs, but the blond is there too fast. The air swirls with warmth and I am on the beach, the secret beach. The dark blond shakes me. \"Get it under control.\"</p><p>My jaw trembles. My hands shake. The blond grips my arms. \"You okay?\"</p><p>I shake my head. \"No. No. No. What happened? Where is Shane?\"</p><p>I close my mouth and notice the way he smells. \"Is that you? You smell like that?\" I lean in. He chuckles. I smile at him. I'm not sure what else has happened, but I like him. He sounds and smells and looks like a dream. His strong face has a square jaw and perfect lips. When he smiles at me, my heart melts. One side of his lips is a little fatter than the other. It makes his smile crooked. I can't fight my eyes or thoughts. I imagine sucking his lip, right on the fat part. I moan a little when I breathe and lick my lips. \"I'm, uhm, Aimee.\"</p><p>He looks scared. He lets me go and steps back. \"Aleks. Aleksander.\" His words have a hint of an accent. Eastern European. It's sexy. I squeeze my thighs together. \"What are you?\" I reach for him. He is suddenly across the beach from me.</p><p>\"You need to get a handle on what you are.\"</p><p>I clench my hands. \"Why do I feel so good?\"</p><p>\"Your friend. You sucked his soul. You feed off souls.\"</p><p>I laugh. \"What?\"</p><p>He flashes closer to me. I jump back. \"What are you?\"</p><p>His face is hard, I like it. His white blue eyes trip me out, but his lips are killing me. He shrugs and grins bitterly. \"Angel of misfortune.\"</p><p>He points to the large logs up the beach from us. \"Want to sit on the drift wood and make a fire?\"</p><p>I shiver and nod. \"Where is Shane?\"</p><p>He walks up the beach past me. \"With Marcus and Ophelia. If anyone can help him it's them.\"</p><p>I furrow my brow. \"What's wrong with him?\"</p><p>He looks back at me. \"You. You sucked him dry almost.\"</p><p>My fingers spark. \"Something is wrong with my hands,\" I whisper.</p><p>\"It's a long story Aimee. Needless to say the girl with the black eyes messed up, bad.\"</p><p>\"Who is she? What did she do? Who are you? How did we get here? How did you do that thing you did?\" I spin in a circle and look around the beach.</p><p>He steps close to me and smiles softly. \"Stop being a pain in the ass and help me light the fire.\"</p><p>My smile fades, slowly. \"What?\" I lean forward and smell the air near him. \"You smell so amazing.\" He grimaces and walks away from me. My stomach clenches. I buckle gripping it. \"Oh, god it's back.\" I feel like the air has been sucked out of my lungs. I heave but it's all stuck in my stomach. He offers me his hand. I shake my head. \"No. I don\u2019t know you. Stranger danger.\" The words sound familiar. I've heard them before. My stomach is burning savagely.</p><p>He drops to his knees and lifts my face up to his. He presses his lips against mine. I'm taken aback but the air comes. My fingers slip into his thick hair. My hands are on fire when they make contact with his skin. I climb up onto his lap and wrap my legs around him. My tongue caresses his, my lips can\u2019t get enough. His hands cup my ass, pulling me into him. I can feel something hard against my groin. I don\u2019t even care. I could eat the face off of him, the way I'm kissing him. My hands are digging in, gripping and pulsing. My legs squeeze, my mouth caresses and sucks and my hand roam. I'm moaning and sucking and he's into it. He's pressing me into his erection, grinding me into him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something about the kiss is satiating me. He's filling me up. The need and the craving are gone. I grab his hair and pull his face away from mine. I breathe right in his face. \"Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I don\u2019t know what came over me. I haven\u2019t been feeling so well.\"</p><p>He grins the crooked smile at me and presses his face into mine again. I moan into him and then push him away from me. I shake my head and climb out of his lap. Something isn\u2019t right. Something is wrong with me.</p><p>I'm almost running away. He stands and laughs, \"Come back.\"</p> <p>I frown and shake my head. A piece of sand flies in my eye. I blink and try to get it out. I close my right eye and flutter my left eye. I need to find Shane. I wish I as home and then I am. I'm standing in my room. I gag from the horrid feeling in my belly. I grab my waste bin and heave the contents of my stomach into it. I drop to my knees gagging and coughing. I feel like death.</p><p>Taking deep breaths, I try to piece it all together. I look around the room at the sand and rocks on my carpet. How did I get home? Was any of it real?</p><p>A knock at my bedroom door startles me.</p><p>Gripping the bin, I prepare to explain to my mother that I don\u2019t have the flu. Regardless of what she sees in the bin.</p><p>Instead Giselle walks into my room. She looks awful, haunted.</p> <p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>She bites her lip, \"I did it again.\" A single tear drizzles slowly down her cheek.</p><p>\"What?\" I know what. I just want it to be something else.</p><p>\"I sucked someone else. He died.\"</p><p>My stomach drops, \"Who?\"</p><p>She shakes her head in a twitchy way, \"I don\u2019t know. He's not from here.\" She drops to her knees and looks at my carpet blankly. \"You believe me?\"</p> <p>\"I did it to.\" I whisper.</p><p>She looks at me, startled, \"What?\"</p><p>I nod, feeling sick again, \"I did it to Shane and some guy on the beach. The sucking thing. It filled me up. I wanted to do it.\" I whisper the words.</p><p>Her hand comes to her mouth, \"What happened? Is Shane...?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"No. I don\u2019t think so. He kissed me and my hands started to suck. I thought it was the kiss, like you, but it was my hands. They were on fire. Just dragging something from him. I wanted to touch and suck and then he was gone. There were others. A girl with black hair and eyes and a dark haired guy.\" I stop. My memory must be mixed. I frown and argue with myself.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"He had fangs. And then a blond guy touched me and we were at the secret beach.\"</p><p>\"Like, what kind of fangs?\" She looks lost. I know I am.</p> <p>My brain will not make a picture beyond the one it seems to remember. I close my eyes and shake my head, \"I don\u2019t know. Like Dracula.\"</p><p>\"You saw him and then walked to the beach? That's weird.\"</p><p>I glance up, \"No. No I never walked. I don\u2019t know. We just were there. Like how I'm here. I'm just here.\" I realize my right eye is aching from the sand in it. I look at the sand behind me, \"See.\"</p><p>She sits back on her knees and shakes her head, \"Aimes, we got a problem.\"</p><p>I feel like crying, \"I know. We gotta get out of here. Before we hurt someone else.\"</p><p>She sobs silently. I reach a hand for her. It feels natural even though we are not friends. I know we are not and yet I love her like a sister.</p><p>\"Can we just go now?\"</p><p>I squeeze and stand, leaving the puke bin and sand and walk out. \"We can go now. But I want to make sure Shane is okay. I think I hurt him. Bad.\"</p><p>\"What about the blond?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"He was fine.\"</p><p>She licks her lips, \"We should find him. I'm starving and not for a burger and fries.\"</p><p>We leave my house. I don\u2019t say goodbye to my mom or my dad. I just walk out the front door again. Giselle and I hold hands, as if to protect ourselves from everything.</p><p>\"Do you think we're vampires too?\" She asks after a while.</p><p>\"No. Maybe like a succubus. I've read about them. But how would we just become a mythical creature? What were we exposed to?\"</p><p>She shakes her head.</p><p>\"Let's go find Blake. He'll know.\"</p><p>I drag her down the road. When it forks I turn, walking carefully as we approach his driveway. We round the corner of the house and open the door to the garage with the lock code. We slip through the garage into the hallway. We don't make any noise until, we reach the stairs to the basement. Even then we creep down them very slowly.</p><p>I can see the faint glow of the computer screen flashing from the far corner, where I know he sits playing World Of Warcraft. We sneak along, not wanting to scare him or wake his parents, if they are even home. Blake\u2019s parents were lucky he was a calm kid. With the amount of free time he had, he could have been doing the unsavory without any hindrances.</p><p>I expect to find him hunched over his computer but it's at the main screen and he isn\u2019t there.</p><p>I hear a giggle and turn to look at Giselle. She scowls, \"Alise?\" She whispers.</p><p>I nod, \"Gross.\"</p><p>\"I know right. Why would she be with him? Like ewww.\"</p><p>I snort, \"I was thinking the exact opposite.\" A small flash of ownership over him trickles through me. He is my best friend and my rock. I hate that she has touched him with her grubby hands. Now I'll have to Lysol him just to have Halo night. Then it dawns on me. Halo night might not happen. Not if I eat people with my sucky thingy.</p><p>I grab the computer chair and sit down. My fingers fly over the keyboard.</p><p>\"Yeah, see. We both have succubus like traits. This is weird. It says here, bear in mind it's all mythology, they feed on souls and essence. Of course it also says they collect semen and impregnate girls.\"</p><p>\"Uhm, what? Dude. I don\u2019t collect it. I avoid it. Shit doesn\u2019t come out of clothes.\"</p><p>I put a hand up, \"Wow, okay, no. Please. Stop. This isn\u2019t the Monica Lewinski trial. Jesus. Look, this all just sounds like a great way to blame someone else for being pregnant. You know like back in the day when being pregnant and unmarried was something bad.\"</p><p>\"Unless you live in the south. I think they still, like, don\u2019t approve.\"</p><p>I nod, \"Right. Anyway. This has to be some kind of chemical reaction. Let me see if I can find reactions that cause you to suck the life out of someone.\"</p><p>\"Oh like how my mom does that to my dad.\"</p><p>I roll my eyes and let my fingers loose on the keyboard, \"Exactly.\"</p><p>\"Aimes?\"</p><p>I turn and smirk at Blake standing in the hallway with a shirt over his naked parts, \"Lovely.\"</p><p>He walks backwards back into the room, \"Why are you in my house?\"</p><p>I look back at the computer, \"Why are you having sex with my sister?\"</p><p>\"Aimee, you are such a nerd loser. Why are you even here? I know you're jealous.\"</p><p>I sigh and continue to scroll and read. \"Frig.\"</p><p>Blake comes out, pulling a space camp shirt on. \"Dude, why are you here?\"</p><p>\"We have a problem. I need your help.\"</p><p>\"So you brought Giselle with you?\"</p><p>\"She's part of the problem.\" I slump back in the chair, \"Let's say I had an issue with sucking the life out of other people, what would you say?\"</p><p>He grins, \"That would be sweet. Just like Rogue on X-Men. Is it live role play day?\" He looks panicked for a moment and glances at his calendar.</p><p>I shake my head, \"No. Giselle and me are having some issues. Her with the mouth and me with the hands. She killed Mr. Mac after he tried to attack her. She sucked his soul out of him. I almost killed Shane. I think.\" The words don't feel as crazy as they sound. Like I know they're true. Somehow.</p><p>Blake stops rifling the calendar and frowns, \"What?\"</p><p>Alise storms out of the bedroom at the back of the hall, \"Oh my god Aimes. You will stop at nothing to ruin our happiness. I get that he's more your type but he said he's liked me for years.\" She crosses her arms and glares at Giselle. \"Why are you here?\"</p><p>Giselle leaps at her and grabs her face. Alise screams but her scream fades as Giselle's sucking thing starts.</p><p>The air changes as Giselle sucks from her. I jump in and grab her. I drag her off and hold her to me. Alise coughs and chokes. Blake grabs her, scowling at us.</p><p>\"What the hell?\"</p><p>I sigh. Giselle turns back and growls. I sooth her, \"Shhhhhh. Don't do this. You'll regret it.\"</p><p>She shivers, \"She tastes nasty. Alise you taste sick.\"</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>Alise coughs again and shakes her head, \"What the hell was that for bitch?\"</p><p>I narrow my eyes, \"Stop now. Neither of us has a hold on this.\" I look at Blake, \"You know me. You know I wouldn\u2019t make this up.\"</p><p>He nods and crosses his arms over himself, hugging. \"Aimes, you need to tell me everything.\"</p><p>Alise gets up and staggers, \"She tried to kill me and that\u2019s all you have to say. You're pathetic. You two are freaking crazy.\" She storms down the hall.</p><p>Blake tries to go after her but I shake my head, \"She gets past things quickly. This is important.\"</p><p>He clears his throat, \"Okay. Start at the beginning.\"</p><p>I sigh and start where I think it started, with chocolate soymilk.</p><p>By the time I finish the story his face is cold, he looks confused and scared.</p><p>\"Do it one more time.\"</p><p>I blink my eyes a few times and then shut the right eye. I wink my left and think about the other side of the room and then I'm there.</p><p>He takes a deep breath and nods once, \"I believe you, but I'm having a hard time with it all. The science doesn\u2019t make sense. You two, why her? I can see you becoming like this but her? What does she do for society that she deserves a super power?\"</p><p>I laugh and look back at Giselle, who has fallen asleep on the couch.</p><p>\"She will look killer in the leather suit.\" My laugh is bitter. My heart is breaking. I don\u2019t know what to do and I know Shane is out there, with those others.</p><p>He nods, \"Duly noted. Skintight shiny leather is definitely going to be killer on her. So no oddly glowing space rocks or weird visits in the night by strange men and you haven\u2019t been to any test facilities?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"No.\"</p><p>He grins, \"Just checking.\"</p><p>The air warms. The sensation is familiar.</p> <p>\"There you are.\" The blond man smiles at me. Behind him is the dark haired girl. She's with a redhead I've never seen before.</p><p>\"Blake, stay back. They're weird like us.\" I speak in a warning tone.</p><p>The redhead cocks her head at me and grins, \"Aimee, we need you and Giselle to come with us.\"</p><p>\"How do you know me?\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"Long story.\" She looks past me and waves, \"Hey Blake.\"</p> <p>I look back at him. He shakes his head, \"This is awesome.\" He almost chuckles. \"It's like Doctor Who.\"</p><p>\"What are you?\"</p><p>The dark haired girl with the black eyes looks like she might cry, \"We're the Devil's Roses. We need you to come with us.\"</p><p>I know that name, although I've never heard it before. I take a step toward them and look back at Blake. \"Make something up. Tell them Giselle took me prom dress shopping so my parents don\u2019t worry.\"</p><p>The others laugh.</p><p>I look back confused, \"What?\"</p> <p>The redhead shakes her head, \"Prom dress shopping.\"</p><p>Blake points, \"They know you for sure.\"</p><p>I scowl.</p><p>He puts a hand up, \"Just saying.\"</p><p>\"Dorian has gone to speak to both your parents and told them stories. Giselle you're going to be filming a movie and getting paid a lot of money and Aimee you are part of a research grant.\"</p><p>Blake nods crossing his arms, \"That actually sounds good.\"</p><p>The redhead smiles at him, \"We've gotten good at this.\" She shoots a look at the dark haired girl.</p><p>A dark haired man, more beautiful than anything I have ever seen, is in the room suddenly. He grins at me like he might devour me, \"Aimee love, you look well.\" He has an English accent. It makes his dark hair and eyes even more attractive. He claps his hands together, \"Well, parents are all done.\"</p> <p>My face splits into a smile. I swallow and have a hard time focusing.</p><p>Blake crosses the room, \"Who are these people?\" He whispers into the side of my face.</p><p>I shake my head, \"I don\u2019t know. But I know them, somehow.\"</p><p>\"I know. Me too. I totally believe all this and I never believe anything.\"</p><p>The sad face of the dark haired girl is torturing me.</p><p>I know her, I know I love her. Like a sister.</p><p>The dark haired man saunters toward me. He bends his face and plants a soft warm kiss on my cheek, \"I've missed you.\" My stomach twists. The smell of him is amazing, like incense and lust.</p><p>My breath gets lost in my lungs. He walks past me to Giselle and scoops her up. He winks at me and he's gone. Panic fills me. I turn.</p><p>\"Where did he take her?\"</p><p>The redhead looks annoyed, \"Home.\" The blond grabs my hand. The air is warm as I see the redhead walking toward Blake.</p><p>\"NOOOO!\" I shout but it's too late.</p><p>Cool damp air and squishy grass are the first things I notice.</p><p>\"Aimes!\" A cute guy with green eyes and dark hair runs at me. He scoops me up and kisses my cheek.</p><p>I struggle, \"What are you doing? Who are you?\"</p><p>His face drops. He raises an eyebrow and looks past me to the blond guy, \"Damn. Both of you?\"</p><p>The blond guy shrugs and walks up to the house, \"I'm out. My father is nearby.\" He speaks to an old woman standing on the front porch of an old mansion.</p><p>My feet touch the ground again as green eyes puts a hand out, \"Ben.\"</p><p>I scowl, \"How do you know me?\"</p><p>He puts his hand that\u2019s lingering, waiting for me to shake it, up to my face. \"You are one of my best friends.\"</p><p>\"How?\"</p><p>\"Aimee, come inside. We need to debrief you. Giselle is already inside.\" The old lady on the porch speaks impatiently.</p><p>My feet move, even though my brain argues with them. I trust her. Her old face and white grey hair reminds me of someone I love.</p><p>My cell rings. I ignore it and walk up the creaky old steps. The old woman takes my hand in hers and pulls me inside.</p><p>The house smells familiar. \"I've been here before.\"</p><p>She looks back at me and nods, \"You have. Many times.\"</p><p>She pulls me to a huge room with many couches and fireplace.</p><p>She sits and begins speaking, \"Two years ago, in two thousand and ten, I met you. Dorian, the man who changed you into what you are, was given a task. He was asked by the leader of the Devil's Roses to create one like him. A soul sucker, death deity, angel of death, death dealer, whatever you want to call it. He needed one like himself to end the battle between good and evil on earth.\"</p><p>I frown, \"It's two thousand and ten now. You know that right?\"</p><p>She frowns and puts a hand up, \"Let me finish my story.\"</p><p>I nod and she continues, \"Dorian was also asked, at the same time, to save you. Aleksander had fallen in love with you and needed you to be spared. The only way to save you was to change you. Dorian was in need of one like himself so he agreed. He agreed on the condition that Aleksander gave up his lifetime of useless wandering and become a Rose. Aleksander agreed and you were changed. Fearing you would begin to understand your own power, Dorian used threats and cruelty to handle you. You ran from him. That is when I met you. I was walking past an alley and I sensed you. You were living on the streets, starving and cold and wet. You had forbidden yourself to kill anyone and thus you were starving. You had swam into the Portland harbor and hidden amongst the homeless. I brought you home here and cared for you. It took months to get you to stop being so crazed and ravenous. Things like you have to eat, often.\"</p><p>My head spins. I don\u2019t know how to argue with the words. They feel like truths. I can almost picture every moment she has described. I glance at the floor and close my eyes to listen to her voice.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\"Do you believe it all?\"</p><p>I look at her and nod, \"I don\u2019t know why but I do.\"</p><p>She bites her plump lip, \"Me too.\"</p><p>I lie back on the bed in our room. \"It makes more sense than rocks from space or science labs.\"</p><p>A knock at the door interrupts us. The handle turns and a guy close to my age walks in.</p><p>\"Damn.\" Giselle whispers. I nod in agreement.</p><p>\"Hi.\"</p><p>He beams, \"Aimee and Giselle. Back from the never lands I see. Did you miss me terribly?\"</p><p>I want to say yes. My heart twinges and I have the strangest feelings for him.</p><p>\"I'm Sam.\"</p><p>I frown and mouth the name. \"I know you.\"</p><p>He nods, \"Yup. You know us all obviously, but you and I were special to each other. Me and you and Ari.\"</p><p>\"The dark haired girl?\"</p><p>He climbs on my bed. His proximity to me is intense. I want to touch him. \"What are you?\" I ask. I feel like I've been saying it all day.</p><p>He grins, \"Nephilim and Siren. My dad was one of the fallen, like Lorri and Dorian.\"</p><p>I grimace, \"They can have babies?\"</p><p>He laughs. I glance at Giselle who is batting her eyelashes, \"So did you and I, like know each other?\"</p><p>He grins, \"Yes. Of course. We did Roses training together. You both are my dearest friends.\"</p><p>Giselle scowls, \"Just friends?\"</p><p>I laugh. I feel the same way.</p><p>Giselle leans forward and sniffs the air around him, \"You guys are all so hot and you all make me feel, well different.\"</p><p>I turn to her, \"Dude.\"</p><p>\"Naughty.\" Giselle blurts out, ignoring me.</p><p>\"Angels all make everyone feel like that. Automatic attraction. Plus I'm part Siren. So yeah, it's not going to help you out at all.\"</p><p>\"It's the strangest feeling. So intense.\"</p><p>He nods and purses his lips \"Aleks has it too. And Marcus.\"</p><p>I frown, \"Who?\"</p><p>\"The one with the fangs. Marcus. The OG.\"</p><p>I laugh, \"Right. Lydia mentioned him.\" I glance at Giselle, \"When you were a vampire for a short stint.\"</p><p>Giselle shakes her head, \"It feels like fog is in here.\" She rubs her head.</p><p>I laugh, \"I know. Like I can't get past a wall in my mind.\"</p><p>\"Maybe Marcus can get rid of it.\"</p><p>Sam shakes his head, \"No. We don\u2019t want him to. We still have some monsters to collect. Ophelia and her brother Tristan and Phillip and Oliver. We don\u2019t have time for the whole Shane versus Aleks fight.\" He rolls his eyes.</p><p>I feel a stab in my guts, \"What?\"</p><p>His face reddens, \"Oh nothing. You just dragged out the whole whoever will I pick for about two years.\"</p><p>I swallow hard, \"I dated them both? Shane and the big blond guy who does the flashy thing and makes me feel funny?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, and believe me it was brutal on everyone. I've died once, Aleks has died once and Ben has died once and Marcus I think once or twice and all of it could have been avoided if you weren\u2019t such a sucky baby.\"</p><p>His words cut into me.</p><p>\"Dude, what the hell?\" Giselle growls.</p><p>He puts his hands out, \"No. I didn\u2019t mean it like that. It's just better with you focusing on work and not boys.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"I've never even dated a boy. My first kiss was a near death experience for the boy I like and then some stranger on the beach.\" I feel sick thinking about it. My face pales, \"How is Shane?\" His face comes crashing back into my mind.</p><p>His eyes dart, \"What? Why? What happened to him?\"</p><p>I look at Giselle, \"Has anyone said anything to you about him?\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"No.\"</p><p>I climb off the bed and run down the hall and the flights of stairs.</p><p>When I get to the kitchen I see something more horrifying than anything I've ever seen. A dark skinned girl is standing in the kitchen cooking, but I can see through her. Her body is see-through.</p><p>I scream. I blink my eyes, panicking. I close my right eye and wink my left.</p><p>Instantly I'm on the beach. The secret beach. I shake.</p><p>\"You okay?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look at Sam and start to cry, \"No. No. I'm not okay. I'm never going to be okay.\"</p><p>He drops to his knees in front of me and hugs me. His warmth and smell are more than I can bear. My hands spark. He shoves me suddenly and I'm across the beach on my back. I groan.</p><p>\"You can't do that to me. I could die.\"</p> <p>I moan and sit up. The pain is fading fast. He walks to me and offers me a hand. \"This was why they locked you up in the room last time.\"</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"You couldn\u2019t control your powers. Let's go back.\"</p><p>I take his hand and instantly we are back at the old house. The dark haired guy is there. The one with the black eyes and dirty smile. He makes me think things I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\"Thanks for fetching her, Sam. I'll take over from here.\" He walks over like he owns the world and offers his arm. I take it. A spark hits my hands when he touches me and then we're in a dark room. I gag from the way we start and stop.</p> <p>He slides a hand up into my hair. \"You owe me something, Aimee.\"</p><p>I pull back, \"I don\u2019t know you.\"</p><p>He grabs me and crashes his lips on mine. My body erupts. My hands slide up into him. Sparks fly. He grabs my wrists, laughing in my mouth. \"Tsk, tsk, tsk, you naughty thing. If I didn\u2019t know any better I'd think you remembered more than you\u2019re letting on.\"</p><p>I jerk my hands out of his, \"Why? Did I hate you? Did I want you dead?\"</p><p>He steps into my face, \"You wanted me as much as I wanted you. You were just stubborn.\"</p><p>I cross my arms, \"I'm not stupid. I can feel your effect on me. You all have it.\" My stomach aches.</p> <p>He grins, \"You haven\u2019t been eating.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"I have. I've eaten a sandwich and some eggs and some cereal and a bowl of pasta. I've never eat so much in my life but I'm starved still.\" Sweat trickles down my face.</p><p>He sighs and grabs my hand. Warm thick air crashes into me like a brick wall. I pull my hands away, \"Okay enough. I'm done with the flashing here and there and everywhere. Jesus. Stop.\"</p><p>He puts a hand out, \"Pick.\"</p><p>I look around at the seedy alleyway and dirty concrete. I step closer to him. He chuckles and puts an arm around me.</p><p>\"I'll keep you safe.\"</p><p>The warmth of his body is comforting. My nose catches something. A smell. It makes my belly rumble. The dark seedy alley moves with something I never noticed before. I notice a figure staggering towards us. He trips. My nostrils flare. A guttural sound rolls through me. I step away from the dark haired guy and immediately notice the sparks in my hands. I snap my fingers making flashes of light flicker in the dark alley. As the staggering man gets near enough, my hand lashes out at his throat. I pull hard and fast. I cry out as the intense heat and seductive warmth fills me in a rush. I drop to my knees next to the dead man who has dropped to the ground in a heap.</p><p>\"Oh my god.\" I moan.</p> <p>Chuckles fill the alley behind me, \"You really are an animal, Aimee.\"</p><p>I glance back, \"What have you done to me?\" My heart is aching but the glorious feeling inside of me is too much. It wins out over my guilt and pain.</p><p>\"Made you something so strong, even time can't change you back apparently.\" He sounds like he is in awe of the horror show in front of him.</p><p>\"Where is Shane?\" I ask, terrified he has shared the fate of the man on the ground.</p><p>\"He's in Portland. He's safe. Stop worrying about him. You have work to do. Did Lydia tell you the entire story? About the things we need to accomplish in the next few months?\"</p><p>I nod and look at the ground, \"It can't be real. This can't be real. I must have some kind of tumor. I need an MRI and blood work done.\"</p><p>His fingers bite into my arm and we are standing on the porch of the old mansion. The redhead is standing on the porch, as if waiting for us. \"It might be easier to give her back her memories.\"</p><p>The redhead stands, \"Do you remember me?\"</p><p>I nod, \"Somehow. I know you but not in a memory.\"</p><p>She shrugs, \"Good enough for me. This way is better. No more mopey Aimee.\"</p><p>I frown, \"Hurtful.\"</p><p>She shrugs, \"It's the truth. You were god awful to be around. One minute it was Shane then it was Aleks and then it was Shane and then it was none of them and you were kissing Dorian here in secret and thinking no one knew.\" She rolls her eyes and storms into the house.</p><p>I glance back, \"Dorian. I know you. I know you all.\"</p><p>He grins, \"Not quite as well as I would have you know me.\"</p><p>I blush and turn to walk back into the house. He grabs my arm and spins me. His lips meet mine. The intensity is there but the hunger isn\u2019t. His kiss is passion and darkness. I know I shouldn\u2019t kiss him, but I want to.</p><p>\"Stop kissing her and go get Aleks. He won't leave until we kill Jon.\"</p><p>He lets me go and looks over me at the redhead, \"Lorri, it can wait one more day.\"</p><p>\"No. Do it now, and stop messing with the plan.\" Her tone is sharp.</p><p>He steps away from her and then is gone.</p><p>I look back at her, \"How do you know him?\"</p><p>Her eyes glass over, \"He's my best friend.\"</p><p>\"He's a good kisser. Weird and kinda creepy but, wow.\"</p><p>She rolls her eyes and takes my hand, \"Come on. I want to show you something.\"</p><p>She pulls me inside and down the dark hallway. Her hands are hot. Uncomfortably hot.</p><p>\"What are you?\"</p><p>\"Angel. Didn\u2019t Lydia explain?\"</p><p>I nod, \"She did. I just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t believe in God. I believe in science.\"</p><p>She stops and looks at me, \"He believes in you. Why do you think he asked me to fall?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"I can't see it. It doesn\u2019t feel real.\"</p><p>She snorts sarcastically, \"Well it is. It felt real on my end. Let me tell you.\"</p><p>\"Can you show me?\"</p><p>She looks uncomfortable and then puts her hand up, \"Lace you fingers through.\"</p><p>I do it and instantly I am somewhere else. Her voice narrates in my mind. It's soft and distant.</p><p>\"The mountaintop was a vantage point I didn\u2019t get to appreciate often. I sat on the stones of the ruins, where once a long time ago Adam met Eve and the world fell apart.</p><p>The darkness was chasing the sun across a plain in front of me. It felt like the battles going on in the cities below. Good was chased to every corner and snuffed out by the dark that somehow always felt stronger. I wanted to be indifferent to it all. I wanted to watch them kill each other and not get involved, but I knew my turn was coming. I could feel it in the electrically charged air all around me. Even there on the mountaintop, the sparks of the changing winds reached for me. He was calling me.</p><p>\"Daughter.\"</p><p>I glanced up into the shifting skies, where his voice beckoned me to the meeting place. I had ignored the call as long as I could. I closed my eyes and when I opened them I was there, at the meeting place.</p><p>I stood amongst the columns of the old world. The world where we could see his light and feel his presence. The old world where many of us were no longer welcome. None of the fallen could ever enter. It was the last haven for my kind.</p><p>I watched as light slithered silently along the cold stone columns and floor. It found me, even in the small corner where I stood in the shadows.</p><p>A voice, a soft whisper that blew through the drafty stone columns spoke to me. \"You must save them, you must save my creations. You will select four to go with you and you will fight for them. Only from the ground may you defend them. Only from the earth will you find success.\"</p><p>I couldn't breathe or gasp. The air sat stuck in my windpipe. I remained silent as I processed the request.</p><p>Finally, I was able to speak. \"You wish me to fall as others have?\"</p><p>A snake filled with doubt and fear slid through my insides, wriggling and twisting.</p><p>\"I wish for you to help them fight fire with fire.\"</p><p>I ignored the single teardrop that slipped down my cheek and filled the silent darkness with its splatter as it hit the cold stone floor.</p><p>\"As you wish.\" My voice was strong, as was my instant resolve to succeed in my mission. It was a problem with my kind. We couldn\u2019t turn away from him while we were loyal. We would follow his desires and commands, no matter what. I dreaded the fact that soon that wouldn't be an issue for me. Soon I would be free of him. For the good and the bad, I would be free.</p><p>\"Thank you Lucifer. I can trust no one but you, The Light Bearer, The Morning Star. You are my constant and you have my heart.\"</p><p>My lower lip trembled, but my eyes steeled against the pain desperately trying to spread across my face.</p><p>I gave a single nod. I spoke nothing to the light.</p><p>I watched as the light left the room silently. It left me in the shadow I had been hidden in before he came. I touched the column and knew I would never be back.</p><p>I thought of my best friend and instantly stood before him.</p><p>He smiled at me, \"You look like Michael has been taking a piss again.\" He could see there was a difference in my eyes and the way they saw the world.</p><p>I shook my head slowly, wondering what expression my face held. No matter what it was, it would never be close to the feelings that roamed my insides.</p><p>\"I have been asked to do something and I need your help.\"</p><p>His smile faded. He tilted his head to the side, \"Whatever it is I'm out.\"</p><p>I grinned bitterly, \"You're in.\"</p><p>\"What is it?\"</p><p>The grin that has claimed my face had taken hold of my heart, \"We fall tomorrow.\"</p><p>The reality of my words slipped across his face slowly. Watching it was like watching the clouds move across the sky.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, \"Dorian I need you.\"</p><p>He licked his lips, as if stealing one more precious second before answering me. \"Of course love. This place was just getting boring anyway.\"</p><p>\"We must get the others and prepare. We fall at dawn.\"</p><p>Her words fade out and the picture leaves my mind but her fingers still burn my skin. I pull back. I feel sick for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You have suffered so greatly.\"</p><p>She nods, \"I guess. But no different than anyone else who serves in a time such as this.\"</p><p>\"How long has it been a time such as this?\"</p> <p>She looks tired for half a second and then shrugs, \"A long damned time. Now, enough chitchat. I want you to come with me. We made a picture for you and Giselle. It's a chart of events and how they happened. Major events. After this I want you to start tagging along with Dorian.\" She turns sharply, \"Not to screw him either.\"</p><p>I flinch.</p><p>She pulls me into a room with a wall of pictures and timelines. I glance at Giselle. She looks confused.</p><p>Lorri lets go of my hand, \"Behave.\" She turns and leaves.</p><p>Giselle peeks her head out the doorway, \"She is super mean.\" She whispers.</p> <p>I nod, \"I think in the other time I was a major slut. She told me not to, well anyway, I think I did bad stuff.\"</p><p>Giselle's beams, \"Have you seen the hotties here? Damn girl. I hope I was a slut.\"</p><p>I laugh. She makes me feel better and I realize I like her.</p><p>\"I want that Aleks guy. Wow. He is a beast.\"</p><p>I nod, \"He is a big man.\" The memory of sitting on his erection happens to float through my mind as I say those words. I blush even more.</p><p>\"Just so no one shits where anyone else eats, who you calling dibs on?\"</p> <p>The sentence almost takes me a minute. I frown, \"Wow. That was super gross. Okay. Uhm, none. You can have them all. It's not real. Attraction from a distance is real but their lust and sexual hunger is forced on you. It's not real.\"</p><p>She shrugs, \"I'm a succubus. Some dude named Oliver made me this way. If I have to kill people to eat, I'm going to need a hobby. Sex with all these hotties seems like a pretty sweet gig.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"Gross.\" But I can't fight the smile.</p><p>\"We need some perks to this shit, Aimes. We didn\u2019t even do anything to have this happen. I've already killed three people.\"</p><p>My brow grows heavy, \"Three?\"</p><p>She looks sick, \"Yeah.\" But her mood lifts, \"At least I ganked Mr. Mac's ass before he got to rape Jaime. Did you happen to hear how bad he got us all? Jaime died in the other world.\"</p><p>\"I did hear about it all. I'm glad you got him too.\"</p><p>The dark haired girl with black eyes interrupts us.</p> <p>\"I know you know who I am but just for the record, I'm Ari.\"</p><p>I smile, \"Hey.\"</p><p>She rushes me, wrapping her arms around me. Confusion is all over my face but I hug back.</p><p>I can feel her sobs against my body but I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\"I-I-I'm so sorry Aimes. I-I just thought it-it was a g-g-g-good idea to free you. I never knew that once an Archangel changes you that my power can't take it back.\"</p><p>I hug her hard and shake my head, \"No. No, don\u2019t feel bad. Lydia told me how it was before. My mom was dead and my sister, you saved her. This is better. Jaime didn\u2019t die and Giselle and me never got sick. It's okay.\"</p><p>She sniffles and wipes her eyes, \"I never knew how much I would miss you. You don\u2019t remember how much we love each other. You're the only sister I've ever had.\"</p><p>Giselle jumps into the hug, \"What about me? Were we close?\"</p><p>Ari stiffens and snorts, \"Yeah.\" Her tone tells me otherwise but Giselle is clueless.</p><p>Ari pulls back and wipes her face, \"I'm sorry.\" She shakes her head, \"I didn\u2019t mean to lose it like that.\"</p><p>\"It's okay. I understand. I feel pretty close to losing it right now too.\"</p><p>She glances at me and nods, \"I know right. You must be freaking out.\"</p><p>\"D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It's been brutal. Like I can't react the way I want to because the imprint of everything is in my brain still, so all of this is normal for me.\"</p><p>Giselle nods, \"I keep getting d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu too.\"</p><p>Ari smirks, \"Yeah. It's part of my thing.\" She turns and looks at the wall, \"So this is the timeline. This is the series of events we have already concurred, even though you weren\u2019t with us this time.\"</p><p>There are two timelines. One is the old way and one is the new way. I can't believe how integral a part of the team I was in the old way. We go over it until I'm bored and Giselle is sleeping.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\"Miss Aimee, Mr. Marcus be in the yard, he be waiting on you to has a talk with him.\"</p><p>I smile at the ghost and get up from the couch, \"Thanks Annabelle.\"</p><p>I shiver when I walk past her, she makes the air cool.</p><p>The dark hallway feels foreboding. Marcus is one of the things I don\u2019t trust. Not entirely.</p><p>I open the porch door and try not to look like a ridiculous fan girl. He is handsome in a way that makes my knees turn to goo.</p><p>\"Aimee, my dear sweet Aimee. Now love. Have you gotten those fingers of yours under control?\"</p><p>I love his accent and his spooky seductive eyes. I nod, almost trancelike.</p><p>\"Well then, I have news. The boy you tried to kill, he's fine. Better than fine. He's one hundred and fifty percent.\"</p><p>I sigh, \"Oh, thank god. No one would tell me anything, except that he was here in the city.\"</p><p>He grins, \"Well he isn't here, here. He's in the city. You can flash me home if you like and see him for yourself.\"</p><p>He puts a hand out. I take it nervously. \"You should be cold. You\u2019re dead.\"</p><p>He laughs, \"Dead isn\u2019t what everyone thinks it is.\" He holds up his cell phone and nudges me, \"Think of the place in the picture and wink.</p><p>The house is a grand castle. It's crazy beautiful. I stare at it, lost in the massive size and beauty. I wink and we are standing outside the huge castle.</p><p>\"Where are we?\"</p><p>He looks confused, \"Well, this is my home.\" He says it like I should have known that. I supposed I should have.</p><p>\"A castle? What country are we in?\"</p><p>He looks at me the way I look at Alise, \"Did you bang your head this morning? The USA, we haven\u2019t even left the city or the state. I live in Portland too.\" He walks through a giant archway into the massive front door.</p><p>He's like a mean girl at school. He and Alise would be perfect for each other.</p><p>I follow him in. A large man in a bowler hat is at the front door as I walk through it. He grins at me. I grin back. His bowler hat is awesome.</p><p>\"You look like the bad guy on James Bond.\" I say.</p><p>His grin falls.</p><p>I walk faster.</p><p>I wink and catch up with Marcus. I topple from the uneasiness in my stomach. He grabs me in his arms. \"Careful Aimee, I tend to read into things. A lot.\" I pull myself together and try not to look his way. I know he's looking at me. I also know my face is on fire.</p><p>\"S-s-sorry. The uhm winking thing still makes me sick.\"</p><p>He nudges me, \"You are a lot less fun than you used to be. You were really sort of, well, badass. I supposed that\u2019s the way to say it.\" He says the word like he's never said it before.</p><p>I glance at him, \"Was I a slut?\" The words come out before I can filter.</p><p>He laughs, \"No. Lord no. God I wish. You were uppity and annoying in a lot of ways, but very dependable and sort of bitchy.\"</p><p>I smile, \"Thanks. I needed that.\"</p><p>Confusion crosses his brow. He has no idea how upset I have been getting.</p><p>\"You always wore high heeled boots and your hair was always long and down. You had a very bad tempter. Famous actually among the Roses for killing without conscious or mercy.\"</p><p>Horror creeps across my face slowly, \"What?\"</p><p>\"Hated Dorian more than anything in the world. Loved Aleks. Felt sorry for the bloke that's here. Shane. He was always losing wasn\u2019t he?\"</p><p>I look down at the carpet we are crossing and shake my head, \"I can't imagine any of it.\"</p><p>\"Well you best start. Lorri is spicy when it comes to failure.\" His tone still sounds like he couldn't care less.</p><p>The hallway is huge and wide and full of amazing paintings and fancy doors. He leads me down to a door that doesn\u2019t look like the others. It slides into the wall and I'm in awe. It\u2019s a lab. My face drops.</p><p>He looks proud, \"I knew you would like it.\"</p><p>I walk in doing circles as I try to take it all in. \"It's beautiful. Is that a hybridization oven? You have everything in here.\"</p><p>\"That\u2019s nothing check this out.\" He walks over to an electrophoresis system like I have never seen before when a voice interrupts us.</p><p>\"Aimes?\"</p><p>I look back and grin. \"Shane. You're okay.\"</p><p>He looks different. His face was always handsome but now it's perfect. Everything is perfect. He's irresistible. My face drops. I look at Marcus, \"What did you do?\"</p><p>He grins at Shane, \"Ahh, good to see you're back, son. How was the feed?\"</p><p>Shane looks down shyly, \"Good. Bit of a struggle but I got it.\"</p><p>I growl at Marcus, \"What did you do?\"</p><p>He tilts his head. \"Turn that judgmental face of yours around missy. You did that, not I. I saved him. There was only one way to do it.\"</p><p>I look back at him. My heart breaks. \"I'm so sorry Shane. I've killed you.\" I wink back to Lydia's. I run up the stairs and throw open the door, \"We need to reset the clock again.\"</p><p>Ari looks at me and laughs, \"Not a chance. Why?\"</p><p>I cover my face, \"Shane. I've cursed him. He's cursed like me now.\"</p><p>She pries my hands away from my face and hugs me, \"He isn\u2019t cursed. He's saved. The old you always wanted him to be unbreakable. Now he is.\"</p><p>I look at her in disbelief, \"I never could have wanted this. He just ate someone for lunch.\"</p><p>\"You never said you wanted it, but I know you would have chosen him if he wasn\u2019t mortal. You loved Aleks, there was no doubt. But the more you were away from him, the less you loved him. Your love weakened with distance and time. Now look at you two. He doesn\u2019t even know you and you barely register him and Giselle is stalking him like a bear.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sigh, \"This can't be the way it's meant to turn out.</p><p>She lifts my chin, \"Aimes, we don\u2019t get to choose the way it is and the way it isn\u2019t. We get to try to fix our mistakes. You have to know that my powers are not the answer. You must know that by now. After everything.\"</p><p>I rock back and forth, \"He's dead. He looks like one of them. One of us. He's so perfect now. I loved the little scar on his cheek and the way he always had messy hair. Now he's perfect. Everything is perfect. It's not him.\"</p> <p>\"Hey.\" She pulls me into her, \"It's him the way it's you or me. We are still who we were.\"</p><p>I pull back and wipe my flooded eyes, \"No. I'm not the same. I know I'm not. I can't even breathe without smelling people and wanting their souls. I can't walk down the road without noticing a distinct us and them feel to every human I see. I'm not human and I know it. In my heart of hearts I know I'm a monster.\" I back away and wink.</p><p>I drop to my knees in the sand and cry. I like to cry alone or with my mom, watching Austen.</p><p>The tears flow down my cheeks. Guilt and pain are everywhere. How could I have done this to him? How could I have let them turn him? I sucked his soul. I left him for dead and they changed him. It might have been to save him but it killed the sweet innocent awesome guy he was. I did this.</p><p>In my pain and suffering I don\u2019t hear the sounds behind me. I don\u2019t hear the warning sounds of uneasy feet on unstable rocks and sand. I miss the fact that a hand is reaching for my mouth. I miss it all until the excruciating pain is upon me. I wink but the pain follows.</p> <p>My face is shoved into the grass on Lydia's lawn. I can see the house in my peripheral. Sharp stabbing pain and warmth cover my throat and shoulders.</p><p>\"AIMEE!\" I hear the screams. \"WINK TO MARCUS'S!\"</p><p>In the pain I try to reach back at the thing holding me down but my shoulders are limp. Broken.</p><p>I wink, feeling the warm liquid running down my throat.</p><p>In a flash of color and screams I see the bowler hat and Marcus. His face distorts slightly, in rage.</p><p>Shouts and chaos are everywhere. Blue eyes and a sweet face fill my vision that seems to come and go. Warmth surrounds me. I smell laundry soap and deodorant and sea air. I close my eyes and smile. I know the warmth surrounding me is Shane. He's carrying me to safety.</p> <p>When I open my eyes I don\u2019t see him. I don\u2019t see anyone. I'm in a room with a fancy bed and enough space to make an apartment on the other side of the room, where the fireplace is.</p><p>I blink and look around the empty dark place. The smell in the air is ripe with the taint vampire's leave behind. I'm still at Marcus's. The memory of the stabbing pains in my shoulders flood my mind. I reach my hands around. The cloth of my shirt is ripped to pieces but the flesh of my shoulder is intact. It's as if it never happened. I climb off the bed and pad down the hallway. It's wide with paintings and art.</p><p>When I get to the large front sitting room, I hear voices coming from the far side of the massive room.</p><p>Shane is standing next to the tall blond Aleksander. They're laughing.</p><p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>They both turn their heads.</p><p>Shane's eyes sparkle in away they never used to. Like Aleksander's. Like the magic of the immortals has put a spell on them. He grins, \"Aimes, what's going on?\"</p><p>He sounds normal but I can see he's not. I can see he's different.</p> <p>\"What happened? What was that thing that attacked me?\" Flashes of fur and teeth and my own screams fill the back of my eyes.</p><p>Aleksander looks grim, which is almost impossible as he is so beautiful, \"My dad. He attacked you. He has a thing for witches, must have mistaken you.\"</p><p>I frown, \"For a witch?\"</p><p>He nods, \"You smell like Lydia's house.</p><p>\"Why would your father attack me?\"</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I see the dark haired girl with the black soulless eyes, Ari. She smiles and waves like a zombie Barbie. I lift my hand weakly and force a smile upon my lips.</p><p>\"So, Jon is in the cell?\" She asks.</p><p>Aleksander beams and nods, crossing his thick arms. \"Thanks to her.\"</p><p>Shane beams along with them, like he knows what they're talking about. I know Jon was the man who killed my mother in the previous way things were, but I have no actual idea how I did anything. \"I just winked.\"</p><p>Ari grins, \"To Henry. No one hates Jon like Henry does.\"</p><p>\"What will happen to him?\" I ask.</p><p>Boots click hard against the ground as Lorri enters the room, \"We're going to wait it out with him. When Ophelia turns eighteen Henry will be allowed to kill him and give the powers of her sisters to her. We can't have Jonathan knowing where she is now and we can't risk the blue sisters finding her now. It's all too soon.\"</p><p>My brain instantly dashes back to the timeline. I piece it together and cross my arms, \"Well what do we do for two years?\"</p><p>A spicy grin crosses the redhead's face, \"Train and fix all the things that we screwed up on along the way. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to send Daniel on a new task for work. You know, so the army of shitheads that he ends up building against us, is considerably smaller.\" She glances back at me, \"No matter what, do not let Marcus kill Hanna.\"</p><p>I open my mouth to speak, but she's gone. I close my lips and look around. Everyone is looking at me like I'm in charge. My stomach sinks. I don\u2019t have a clue what to do.</p><p>Ari smiles and puts a hand out, \"We need to make certain your body remembers the training and killing. Are you ready?\"</p><p>I glance at Shane. He laughs and shrugs, like I'm being offered my first drink at a party and he thinks I should take it. I grimace and take her hand. She flashes a picture of a place on her cell phone and I wink my eye.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Egypt 2012</p><p>\"What do you think?\"</p><p>I scan the desert and nod, \"I think if we can get him to come to us we'll have a better chance of saving some of the women.\" I pace back and forth in the sand. I look back at Ari and scowl, \"I hate sand. These boots are new.\"</p><p>She laughs and lifts her DC sneakers, \"Try these on for sand walking. I've got more in my shoe than is in the whole damned desert.\"</p><p>My phone beeps. I sigh and pull it out, 'get here now' it says with a picture of a dark alley.</p><p>\"Giselle.\"</p><p>Ari looks at me and nods, \"Great. Not again.\"</p><p>I look back at the house belonging to the piece of shit vampires, who are running a drug blood service, and growl. I put my hand out. Ari takes it and we're in the alley. My boots click against the cold cement. I still smile at how strong they make me feel. How I feel just like superwoman in them. We round the corner of the alley. Giselle is standing over the body of a man.</p><p>His leather shoe is twitching. I put my hands over my face and look at her. She shakes her head. Her face is devastatingly beautiful under the dim streetlights.</p><p>\"Did you come after?\"</p><p>She nods, \"I was hunting and I smelled him. When I got here he fled and the man was too far.\"</p><p>Ari looks closer, \"He's still alive.\"</p><p>\"Duh.\" Giselle pulls her thick black hair back and crosses her arms over her cute lime green pea coat. \"Dude. Of course he's still alive. I just ate. I figured Aimes could have this one.\"</p><p>Ari looks pissed, \"You let him live and suffer till we got here?\"</p><p>Giselle takes a step towards her \"Don\u2019t be such a whore. I was being, like, thoughtful and shit. God.\"</p><p>I laugh and shake my head. I walk to the dying man and crouch down. I grip his arm where his expensive watch sits and let my power loose. Giselle would have gotten nothing from him but I eat differently. I don\u2019t need there to be a lot of life force or emotion the way she does. I just need the soul to leave the body. I shiver and gasp as his soul slips from him.</p><p>I pull off his watch and take his wallet. \"Tragedy of the city.\" I whisper. I feel sick. Shane and I haven\u2019t gotten along since he was turned. His blood lust is too much for me. His friendship with Marcus is way too much for me. The dead man below me is his way of bending the Roses rules. The man broke one of the Ten Commandments no doubt, making him fair game for Marcus and Shane. I hate what Marcus has taught him. As long as they don\u2019t kill an innocent, we can't touch them.</p><p>\"So, we gonna tell Lorri?\" Ari flashes me a sarcastic look.</p><p>I glance at Giselle, who is twirling her hair. It makes me miss my sister for a moment, \"No.\" I sigh, \"Him and Marcus will have a reason for his death.\"</p><p>Giselle nods, \"They always do. They always find the bad humans. I never get that lucky. I thought I had one the other day. He was dragging some little kid down an alley but then I grabbed him and he had a priest robe on and the white collar thingy.\" She motions where her throat is. \"So I knew he wasn\u2019t bad. The damn probably was though.\"</p><p>\"You know priests aren\u2019t all good right?\" I ask, almost speechless. Ari's eye shift funny at the comment.</p><p>Giselle shrugs, \"I know. He just was kinda hot and so I knew he was a good one. Anyway, I don\u2019t get how Shane always finds the bad ones.\"</p><p>Ari rolls her eyes, \"Dude, they probably compelled them to do the bad shit and then ate them.\"</p><p>A flash of understanding whips across Giselle's face, \"Oh my god, do you think? Wow that\u2019s pretty smart actually.\"</p><p>Ari stares at her blankly, \"Don't even think about it.\"</p><p>Giselle smirks, \"Hey, I don\u2019t need to compel them. I've learned how to do it so I don\u2019t have to take it all. I haven't killed anyone in like six months. It's not the same but at least my record is clean. Lorri is such a nag about the humans dying.\"</p><p>Ari's head turns, \"You smell that?\"</p><p>I've already got the scent. \"Hands in.\" We flash just as hellhounds round the corner of the alleyway.</p><p>I stalk across Lydia's grass and open the front door, \"This is so messed up.\"</p><p>I glance back at Ari who scowls and pouts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I ask, \"What can we do about him?\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"I really thought that when he turned into one of us, he would be a Rose.\"</p><p>My insides ache, \"Yeah well, you're not responsible for the fact he and Marcus have a bromance of doom. No one saw that coming.\"</p><p>I smile the minute I enter the kitchen. Sam is sitting at the counter. He and Giselle and Ari and Ben are my saving grace in the world we live in.</p> <p>Sam grins, \"Hey.\"</p><p>I sit next to him and nudge him, \"What have you been up to?\"</p><p>He blushes and shakes his head, \"Not much. You know.\"</p><p>Ari grins, \"Spying on Hanna?\"</p><p>His eyes dart at her, \"What? No.\"</p> <p>We all laugh. Giselle sits across from him and grabs his hands. She closes her eyes and moans, \"God, I love you.\"</p><p>He pulls back and frowns, \"Stop doing that.\" She flashes him a gorgeous smile, \"Sammy, it's just a little sip of the Siren.\"</p><p>He wrinkles his nose, \"It feels violating and wrong.\"</p><p>We laugh at him.</p><p>Giselle rolls her eyes, \"Boys can't be violated.\"</p><p>He looks aghast. So does Ari.</p> <p>The air swirls warm and the icy blue eyes are the first thing I see. My stomach twinges whenever I see Aleks.</p><p>He smiles sweetly, but the haunted look in his eyes is still there. It never leaves.</p><p>With his father trapped in a dungeon under Marcus's massive castle, Aleksander gets no joy. He used to live on the emotions and healing from the families of his father's victims. Now he has nothing to sustain him.</p><p>Giselle beams at him, \"Hey sexy.\"</p><p>He blushes and shakes his head, \"You say that to everyone.\"</p><p>She winks, \"Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t mean it when I do.\"</p><p>Ari frowns at her, \"Keep it in your pants. God, you're the worst Succubus ever.\"</p><p>Giselle sticks her tongue out.</p> <p>Sam shakes his head, \"No, I met one who was worse. She tackled this Siren, I knew in Greece, to the ground and sucked her dry right in public. It was sick. Giselle at least only takes a little.\"</p><p>\"Gross.\" Ari winkles her nose.</p><p>I look back at Aleksander and tilt my head, \"What's going on?\"</p><p>He leans on the huge counter and shakes his head, \"We go for Ophelia today.\"</p><p>I lick my lips, \"Today?\"</p><p>We've been planning it for almost two years. Ophelia is the start. The catalyst of the beginning of the end.</p><p>I had noticed Lorri was feistier than normal and Lydia has been running around like a chicken with her head cut off.</p><p>\"She knows us all though right? She remembers the way it was before?\"</p><p>Ari looks down. She always does when we talk about before. She still regrets turning back the time. I look at Sam, who is like a brother to me and know she made the right choice. I couldn\u2019t imagine living in a world where he didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>Aleksander shakes his head, \"No. She doesn\u2019t remember us. She was wiped the day they realized Ari had changed the time. Dorian went and wiped her, Tristan and Phillip. Oliver was wiped by Marcus and Henry. Everyone had to play out the parts the same as last time. Jonathan couldn\u2019t be privy to the way things had worked out. Dorian and Marcus and Henry had a lot of mind wiping and clean up to do apparently.\"</p><p>Ari's cheeks are bright red.</p><p>Sam reaches across the table and grabs her hand, \"Thanks for not leaving me behind.\"</p><p>She smiles.</p><p>\"My sister, my dad, my mom, Sam, and the kids are all fine because of you.\" I smile.</p><p>Aleksander's eyes widen, \"Ari, I never meant to hurt your feelings. Sorry. I know you saved me once.\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"I just hate that somehow there is always a glitch. Something gets taken or screwed up because of the reset.\"</p><p>Giselle stands and walks toward Aleksander, \"Okay, so what's the deal with Ophelia? What are we doing?\"</p><p>His eyes creep over to me. I frown, \"What?\"</p><p>\"It's me and you and Sam going for her.\" He says.</p><p>I look at Sam and smile, \"You're the bait I guess huh?\"</p><p>Aleksander laughs. I know he's bait too. They smell too good to women. Sam is especially bad. In this world he hasn\u2019t fallen in love with Hanna yet. Not in the way that tones down his Siren side. He has moments where he's unbearable to be around.</p><p>High-heeled boots interrupt the momentary silence.</p><p>Lorri storms in with Dorian right behind her. He flashes a grin at me, making heat stir low in my belly. I know I'm blushing, but I keep my eyes down.</p><p>\"We leave in an hour for Ophelia. Today is the day. The sisters came to Annabelle earlier.\" She glances at Sam and cocks a dark eyebrow, \"I told you to stay away from Hanna. She's made it without turning into her father. Thank God in Heaven. Dorian brainwashed her aunt and uncle and I convinced Marcus to give the cure to her dad. We all know it's temporary, but it's better this way.\" Her lips curled into a twisted grin on the word convinced. I shuddered imagining it. I'd seen her fight. It was dreadfully frightening.</p><p>She looks at Aleksander, \"You leave in an hour. You know where.\"</p><p>He nods and she's gone.</p><p>\"You ladies look nice today.\" Dorian saunters over to the table grinning like a fool. A fool he is not though.</p><p>Giselle swoons, \"You do too.\"</p><p>He flashes her a smile and then looks at Aleksander. \"Brother, we need to have a little chat about a few things.\"</p><p>Aleksander nods and follows him out of the kitchen.</p><p>I look at Ari and whisper, \"I didn\u2019t think he was ever joining us.\"</p><p>She shrugs, \"I don't think he did. I think they're holding his dad's death for ransom. He helps and they kill him and end Aleks's misery.\"</p><p>I look back, \"Dorian and Lorri are kind of evil like that.\"</p><p>\"Yup.\"</p><p>Just as it gets quiet the kids come running into the kitchen. My heart lifts. I smile at Danny, \"Did you get Mist of Pandaria yet?\"</p><p>He beams, \"Yup. Made a monk last night.\"</p><p>\"Me too.\"</p><p>Giselle rolls her eyes, \"Nerds.\"</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Ophelia</p><p>I look once more at the mirror. Something feels different but can't explain it. I sigh and leave the room. Mom and dad smile at me when I walk into the kitchen.</p><p>\"Hey honey.\" Mom hands me toast.</p><p>\"You're dad and I are going to the movie tonight. Are you going with Abbey to the pool party tomorrow?\"</p><p>I shake my head and groan, \"Yikes mom. Pool party with the mean kids? I don\u2019t think so.\"</p><p>Dad laughs, \"You are so like me. I hated the mean kids too.\"</p><p>I grin at him and bite into my toast. I grimace, \"Is this natural peanut butter again?\"</p><p>Mom scowls, \"Yes, now eat. I'm not buying that peanut icing.\"</p><p>I glance at dad who shakes his head and makes a disgusted face.</p><p>I snort.</p><p>Abbey bounds into the room pulling her hair into a ponytail. \"You coming with me tomorrow?\"</p><p>I shake my head and shiver, \"Hell no.\"</p><p>She rolls her eyes, \"Dude, Jake asked me to ask you to come.\"</p><p>I narrow my gaze, \"No he didn\u2019t.\"</p><p>She nods, \"For real. I swear. He did.\"</p><p>\"Jake? Jake Mackay?\"</p><p>She nods, \"The one and only.\"</p><p>Mom shrugs, \"Pool party at Lance's house might not kill you, O. Hang with some seniors before grad.\"</p><p>I almost snarl at her but I maintain my cool, \"No. Ewww. Jake is hot but I know they got you to invite me so they can torture me when I get there.\"</p><p>Abbey looks hurt, \"I would never let anyone hurt you O.\"</p><p>I nod, \"I know. But they would. I'm cool hanging with the twins.\"</p><p>I want to go. I want to hang with Jake. I want him to want me, but it isn\u2019t going to happen. He wants to let them hurt the loser. The popular girls are evil.</p><p>Abbey glances at me and bats her eyelashes, \"You riding with me to school?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"No. I'm walking. You go ahead.\"</p><p>She rolls her eyes and sighs.</p><p>I don\u2019t like that she is so popular and I'm not, but I also don\u2019t like any of her friends.</p><p>I finish getting ready and walk out the door. I feel like I'm forgetting something major. I check my bag three times, but I have everything. I shake it off and walk out of the house.</p><p>Lost in thoughts and wishes I walk, without really paying much attention until I notice a smell. It's something I know, something I've smelled before. It's delicious and seductive. I close my eyes and inhale. Flashes fill my mind. I don\u2019t know what they are of but I know the smell. I open my eyes and smile instantly.</p><p>The sexiest guy I've ever seen is standing on the sidewalk looking at me. He's my age and gorgeous. His dark eyes pull me in completely. I melt looking at him.</p><p>He smiles, \"Hey O.\"</p><p>My jaw drops open. He knows my name.</p><p>\"I need you to come with me.\"</p><p>I nod, helplessly.</p><p>\"You need to come hold my hand.\"</p><p>I walk towards him. He is intoxicating and unnervingly sexy.</p><p>I place my hand in his and instantly I'm somewhere else. I lean forward and throw up everywhere.</p><p>I pull my hand back and cry out, \"Leave me alone.\"</p><p>\"That was an asshole move. You could have just waited for us.\" A beautiful girl with long blonde hair grabs my hand, \"It's okay O. You're not in any danger. I swear on my life. You're safe.\"</p><p>I shudder and throw up again.</p><p>The gorgeous guy shakes his head, \"Hey, I got her before the magic at school and all that humiliation.\"</p><p>I shake my head and close my eyes. I must be dreaming.</p><p>A man with an English accent speaks behind me. \"She'll remember it all in a minute anyway.\" I can hear his footsteps next to me.</p><p>I open my eyes and scream as his dark eyes fill my vision. Pain and bursts of light fill my head. I scream and pull back.</p><p>It comes in waves.</p><p>Aimee, Dorian, Aleks, and Sam. I look at Sam and jump into his arms, \"SAM!\" I shout.</p><p>I grip him and sob. I barely know why I'm sobbing but then it all hits. The change with Ari and then Dorian taking my memories. My heart is swollen and aching as tears stream down my cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You're alive.\" I whisper.</p><p>Sam strokes my back, \"It's okay O. I'm here.\"</p><p>I close my eyes and am terrified of opening them and seeing it\u2019s a dream.</p> <p>\"Ophelia, love. We need to get going. We have to go to Alaska.\"</p><p>I blink and look back at them all. \"My birthday? My real birthday?\"</p><p>Aleks laughs.</p><p>Dorian raises an eyebrow, \"Good to see you're bouncing back so fast. I really hope Trist and Phillip are the same. It'll be annoying if they're not.\"</p><p>Aimee smiles at me and pats my head, \"How was it the last two years?\"</p> <p>I look at her and knit my brow, \"Fine. You know why we did it right? Are they all alive?\"</p><p>She nods. \"Sam, my mom, my dad, Alise and Blake and all the kids. Thank you. Ari told me everything.\"</p><p>I frown harder, \"You don\u2019t remember anything?\"</p><p>She shakes her head. Dorian shakes his as well, \"It's better if miss thing over there doesn\u2019t remember. Her past was a shit storm of bad things. Retraining her was fine. We had two years. You don\u2019t have much time at all. You still remember everything right?\"</p><p>I glance at Aleks and then Aimee. They aren\u2019t together. Their body chemistry is comfortable and friendly, but not in a romantic way.</p><p>\"Shane?\" I'm scared to ask.</p> <p>Aimee looks down and my heart breaks a little for her.</p><p>Dorian rolls his eyes again, \"He's on team Marcus.\"</p><p>The name brings with it million memories. Mostly bad ones. \"Hanna?\" I whisper.</p><p>Sam pulls back from me and looks sickened, \"She's normal still.\"</p><p>I grimace, \"Normal?\"</p><p>He nods, \"Her Siren thing hasn\u2019t hit yet and her monster never took over. She's normal. No death and no drama.\"</p><p>I feel sad for Sam. I know he loved her.</p><p>\"You alright?\"</p> <p>He shakes his head, \"No. I miss her.\"</p><p>I know the price of everything Ari and I did but I can't be sorry. The lost love in his eyes reminds me of something.</p><p>\"Oliver? Where is he?\"</p><p>Dorian's eyes burn, \"He's with your dad still. Everything is where it was. Oliver's been wiped. He doesn\u2019t remember you. We needed it this way. He needs to see Jonathan for he what he is on his own. He needs to find his own way here.\"</p><p>I nod, \"Okay. Well won't we go get my brother?\" I look around, \"Where are my sisters?\"</p><p>The smell catches my nose and I smile. Lydia's. It's like the years of me not being here have caught up with me. I feel weepy. I wipe my tear filled eyes and glance at Aimee, \"How does she handle this?\"</p><p>Aimee shakes her head, \"I can't imagine.\"</p><p>\"Where is she?\"</p><p>\"With Lucas and Ben. We've been watching Jonathan's. Taking turns. It's Ari and the wolves this week.\"</p><p>I sigh, \"I just wish this was over. I wish things could be normal.\"</p><p>Dorian laughs and walks out of the room. Loud clicking heels come in from the hallway to the stairs. Lorri storms in. She gives me a once over, \"Where's Abbey?\"</p><p>I frown, \"What? Why?\"</p><p>Lorri raises an eyebrow and looks around the kitchen, \"Where's Dorian?\"</p><p>I feel lost, \"He just left.\"</p><p>Her face turns grim, \"I bet he did.\" She growls and then she's gone.</p><p>I look at Aleks and Aimee confusedly, \"What was that?\"</p><p>Aleks shakes his head, \"I don\u2019t know. It's the look she gets when she's about to eat someone.\"</p><p>I grimace, \"She doesn\u2019t like eat them eat them does she? That\u2019s freakin sick.\"</p><p>He nods blankly, \"She eats them. Chews pieces of meat off the bones.\"</p><p>I shiver in horror, \"Damn dude.\"</p><p>Aimee looks at me and purses her lips, \"Wanna get ready? I think we leave in a bit. We need to catch Shane. We're using him as bait so Jonathan will snatch you from the alley like he did last time.\"</p><p>I smirk, \"You remember that?\"</p><p>She shakes her blonde head, \"No. I don\u2019t remember anything.\" Her eyes are filled with dread. My fingers start to spark.</p><p>\"You wanna?\"</p><p>Her grey eyes flash a response but she doesn\u2019t give in to the desires. She shakes her head, \"It's better this way.\"</p><p>I gulp, I'm still afraid of her. I know I'm stronger but she is the death for us all. She can kill everything except Aleks. I don\u2019t believe her that it's better. I believe she is upset and confused. I can feel the difference between me before remembering and now. I felt so lost and confused. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu constantly and odd flashes of memory plagued me. I feel like I've been reborn and aged a million years right now. She has lost both the loves of her life to the Ari do-over. It makes me sad.</p><p>\"So what's up with Shane?\"</p><p>She looks distraught and shakes her head, \"He's different now.\" She leaves the kitchen.</p><p>I glance at Aleks who shrugs, \"She almost ate him and he was dying, so Marcus turned him to save him. He figured it would kill Aimee and we'd never stop Jonathan if she killed him. It seemed like a good choice but she's been pretty upset.\"</p><p>\"For two years?\"</p><p>Aleks clears his throat and glances down the hallway, \"He lives like Marcus does. Very comfortable with the whole drinking human blood thing. He purposely finds bad humans and drains them. It's pretty gross. At any rate, tonight Aimee is asking him to meet her in the alley. Everything is where it was last time when Jonathan snatched you.\"</p><p>\"Except Giselle isn\u2019t the lord of the vampires and Hanna isn\u2019t here and Aimee isn\u2019t quite as badass as she was last time.\"</p><p>He shrugs, \"You got me this time and Sam.\"</p><p>I smile, \"Yes we do.\" I can't help but smile like a goof. The both of them have an intense impact on me.</p><p>I turn, when suddenly I hear the boots again accompanied by my sister's cries. My heart leaps.</p><p>Lorri is dragging her through the kitchen, \"Where is he?\"</p><p>Abbey is bawling and fighting.</p><p>I jump at her but Lorri swats me like I'm nothing.</p><p>\"Lorri let her go. She didn\u2019t do anything.\"</p><p>Lorri growls savagely, \"She broke my heart.\"</p><p>I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>\"Lorri, maybe not the best way to do this.\" Aleks speaks soothingly with his hands out.</p><p>Abbey looks terrified as Lorri drags her through to the backyard.</p><p>I run after her, \"Please Lorri. Please let her go. Aimee, AIMEE!\" I scream.</p><p>Aimee appears in a tank top and jeans, no boots or socks, \"What?\" She's holding her toothbrush. Her eyes dart to Lorri.</p><p>\"Lorri, what are you doing? Who is that girl?\"</p><p>Lorri turns her savage looking face sharply, \"Stay out of this Aimee. Where's Dorian? I thought of him and winked here, but he isn\u2019t here.\"</p><p>Abbey screams, reaching for me, \"O, oh my god O. I was looking for you. Where did you go? Who are these people O?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"It's okay Abbey. You're safe. There isn\u2019t anyone who's going to hurt you.\" It wasn\u2019t true though. Lorri was already hurting her.</p><p>Dorian walks out of the woods looking smug and shitty, as usual. \"Lorri, what are you doing darling?\"</p><p>I glance past him at the forest and see Giselle walking out as well. Dorian and Giselle?</p><p>\"Fix her.\" She shoves my trembling and sobbing sister towards him. He scowls, \"Lorri. Be reasonable. She's human.\"</p><p>\"I don\u2019t give a flying fuck. You broke her. You made her forget me. You made her stop loving me. You fix her.\" Lorri's voice flexes and strains emotionally. I've never heard those sounds come from her. Not even when Sam and the kids died.</p><p>Dorian's jaw set. He looks like he's thinking about it. He looks her in the eyes, like he's speaking to her but he isn\u2019t. He closes his eyes and takes a step toward my sister.</p><p>\"Dorian please leave her out of this.\"</p><p>He ignores me and takes my sisters weeping face in his hands and lifts. \"Look at me and you'll feel better. I promise.\"</p><p>Abbey sobs and looks at him. He whispers something. Abbey stops and looks at him. Her face cracks, \"Dorian, you cheeky bastard.\"</p><p>Her head shoots around. She jumps up and runs at Lorri. They reach out at grab at each other. Abbey plants the biggest kiss I have ever seen on Lorri's bright red lips. They make out shamelessly in front of us. Just like everyone else in this house.</p><p>I look at everyone else and see I'm not alone in the surprise of a few things. I didn\u2019t even know my sister was a lesbian.</p><p>Dorian glances at me. I mouth, \"What?\"</p><p>He nods, \"Yeah.\" He walks up to the house, patting Abbey on the back, \"Welcome back Abbey.\"</p><p>She and Lorri ignore the rest of us. So many things are starting to make sense. I feel a thousand aha moments taking shape in my mind.</p><p>I sigh and turn away just Lorri cups my sister's ass. I walk back to the house with Aleks, and Aimee who is still holding her toothbrush.</p><p>\"Well that\u2019s weird for me. I'm not going to lie.\" I mutter.</p><p>Aimee scowls, \"You didn\u2019t know she was a lesbian?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"That\u2019s not the weird part. I mean I didn\u2019t know she was a lesbian, but I'm freaking out that her and Lorri have hooked up. Freaking out. She's too young for her.\"</p><p>Dorian laughs from the kitchen, \"Says the girl who is lusting after the oldest of the old.\"</p><p>I stick my tongue out. Oliver is extremely old. I blush when I remember him.</p><p>\"So Lorri is a lesbian?\" Aimee asks confused, obviously. I know I am.</p><p>Dorian shakes his head, \"She's flexible. She doesn\u2019t love easily. She loved Jonathan, which obviously didn\u2019t work out so hot, and now your sister. She's dated a bit but not loved. I tried to convince her it was a terrible, horrid idea.\" He points through to the window at them grinning at each other and talking, still out on the back grass. \"As you can tell that went well.\"</p><p>I walk past everyone and climb the stairs to my old room. I get a whiff of him and stop and smell. I tap at his door gently. I open the door, but he isn\u2019t in his room. He must have just left, the room still smells yummy. I close the door and go to my room. It looks like it did when I first moved in last time. It's plain and lonely. I feel a bit that way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My magic is fizzling in.</p><p>\"Sister.\"</p><p>I smile brightly, \"Ladies!\"</p> <p>The faces that match mine flit about the space.</p><p>\"How is Trist?\"</p><p>They look confused, \"How? How do you know us?\"</p><p>I smile, \"trust me. It's a long damned story. How's Trist?\"</p><p>They shake their heads and look down, \"Not good. Father is a cruel man.\"</p> <p>I forgot how sucky things were for him. How Oliver and Phillip were the only things that ever made him happy. Even our mother living in the tower was nothing to him.</p><p>\"Well a plan is in effect to help him. To end father.\"</p><p>\"Will you free us soon?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"I don\u2019t know. I hope so. I'm glad you guys are here. I missed you. Tell Trist the Roses have a plan.\"</p><p>\"We love you sister.\" The ghostly voices still creep me out a bit, but it it's awesome to have them with me again. They vanish.</p><p>I lie back on the bed and wait for everything to catch up. My cell phone starts going nuts in my pocket. I pull it out and glance at it.</p> <p>A message from the twin's stares back at me. I sigh and shove it back into my pocket.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to live in both worlds and I am dreading seeing my dad. The first time was easy. I thought he was my brother. This time I won't be fooled. I'll have to act like I don\u2019t know him. A knock interrupts my dread and self-pity.</p><p>\"Come in.\"</p><p>Ari walks in. She smiles with only her lips. Her eyes are filled with dread.</p><p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>She rushes at me, wrapping herself around me. \"Oh my god, I'm so glad you're back. It's been brutal.\"</p><p>I hug her, we never were crazy close. I'm stunned and bothered. She must be starting to lose it a bit with all the changes that keep happening.</p><p>\"Has it been bad?\" I ask.</p> <p>She shakes her head, \"No. It's refreshing having Aimee just focus on work and not Shane and Aleks and Aleks and Shane and so on. It's been awesome having Aleks and Sam back at the same time and all the kids. It's been kind of nice not having Hanna around to make such a mess but at the same time Sam is bummed and I'm pretty sure stalking her like a crazed man. It's just been stressful. Ben doesn\u2019t remember shit either. Thankfully the time resets back to where we were, in around the same week. So it's not like I had to relive the entire two years. I just was worried. I'm glad you're here.\"</p><p>I frown, \"Me too?\"</p><p>She laughs and pulls me back, \"It's just weird okay. Everything is different this time.\"</p><p>\"Why doesn\u2019t Aleks remember anything?\"</p><p>\"Aleks was dead when we got Giselle to make the memories stay. We reversed it and forgot to make his memories stick.\"</p><p>\"Yikes.\"</p><p>She nods, \"Yeah.\"</p><p>\"Ari, O, you in here?\" The door is swung open even more and Lucas comes in. He grins, \"How's our favorite witch?\"</p><p>I leap into his arms. I inhale the woodsy smell of him and snuggle in, \"I missed you guys. I mean I didn\u2019t know I did, but I did.\"</p><p>He grins and glances at Ari, \"Hey baby.\"</p><p>She blushes. I roll my eyes and point, \"Take it out of my room.\"</p><p>He grabs her hand and kisses the back of it.</p><p>\"So we storming the alley tonight?\"</p><p>I frown, \"Where is Ben?\"</p><p>Ari laughs, \"He doesn\u2019t remember you. He was dead with Aleks when we did the memory thing.\"</p><p>Lucas flinches at her laughing and the weird harshness, \"She's starting to lose it. She laughs at weird stuff now.\" He's kidding but his eyes don\u2019t look like they got the joke.</p><p>Ari rolls her eyes and walks toward the door, \"I'm just glad we're out of Alaska. I hate cold. I wanna go back to New Mexico and see my uncle and bask in the glorious sunshine.\" She walks out of the room, dragging Lucas with her, \"Ben is downstairs. If you want to go meet him. He knows who you are.\"</p><p>My stomach feels funny. Ari is emotional and lost. I sit back on the bed when Lucas comes running back in, \"I need to talk to you.\" He whispers.</p><p>I frown, \"Is she okay?\"</p><p>He swallows hard and shakes his head, \"No. She's pregnant. She isn\u2019t saying anything to anyone.\"</p><p>My eyes widen, \"What? Congrats.\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"It's not good. Her kind doesn't do well with kids. They don\u2019t even usually have babies, most can't. I'm scared. If something happens to her I need you there. I need her to live.\" His eyes look glassy.</p><p>I nod and press my lips together, \"Okay. I'll do what I can to help her.\"</p><p>He grabs my arms hard, \"No matter what. You save her.\"</p><p>I nod. I don\u2019t even know how I would come close to it, but I nod.</p><p>He looks lost, \"Thanks, O.\" He bends and kisses my cheeks and leaves the room. I stare at the floor and ponder it all.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Aimee</p><p>\"Do you think you'll ever be in love with me again?\" His lips look soft. I remember the feel of them.</p><p>I shake my head and look down at the concrete. I can sense the others. I know they line the rooftops of the alley I'm in. Just like last time.</p><p>He steps toward me, \"Are we strangers now? We were friends once Aimes.\" My nickname hurts now.</p><p>I hate that I've lured him here in an attempt to get Jonathan to snatch O.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to talk to him. I shake my head, \"We'll always be friends.\"</p><p>He reaches forward and grabs my hand, \"We live separate lives. We don\u2019t hang out anymore. You made me this way and then left me.\"</p><p>My eyes burn. I feel the sparks. He drops my hand and grins, \"Easy tiger.\"</p><p>I frown, \"I never left you. You chose Marcus's way. There have been blood bag vampires for as long as there have been blood bags. Not the slutty downtown kind either. I mean the plastic ones.\"</p><p>He wrinkles his nose, \"I don\u2019t like it. It's the rest of my life, the world's life. I'm immortal. I don\u2019t want to eat plastic food. Imagine an eternity of that?\"</p><p>I cock my head, \"Imagine an eternity together.\" I whisper it and hate they can all hear me.</p><p>He chuckles and melts the ice around my heart. His grin is killing me. \"Aimee, I'm not giving up on you. I know you'll come back around.\" He comes closer and grabs my face. He presses his lips against mine. I gag and push back wiping my face, \"I can taste the last person you killed.\"</p><p>He looks at me through his lashes, \"Ditto.\" My stomach twists, just like it used to.</p><p>Marcus strolls up the alley behind him. \"Aimee, how lovely to see you. We see so little of each other.\"</p><p>I feel my lips curl into a sneer, \"I see enough of you.\"</p><p>He chuckles and crosses his arms across his broad chest, \"So feisty. I liked you better when we first met. Of course it was the time before. Or was it the time before that? That Ari is a pain in my ass.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"She saved you.\"</p><p>Shane looks back at him, \"I'll be there in a minute.\"</p><p>Marcus cocks an eyebrow and scoffs, \"She isn\u2019t giving you a minute Shane. She's doing something else in this alley. Look around you. The Roses are lining the rooftops. Something is up.\"</p><p>I narrow my gaze, \"Go home Marcus.\"</p><p>He's in my face, his movements are fast. He slips a hand up into my hair and grips the back of my head. \"I don\u2019t take orders from girls.\"</p><p>I grin at him, \"That's not how I heard it.\"</p><p>He laughs and grips the back of my head harder. I wince. \"Tell Lorri the deal is off.\" His hot breath on my face smells exactly how it should, naughty.</p><p>\"Tell me yourself.\" I grin at the sound of the boots in the alley.</p><p>He releases me and steps back haughtily, \"The deal is off.\" He points to the roof where Henry stands, looking menacingly at us. \"Let's not test our fates shall we? I feel fairly confident that I would win this battle.\"</p><p>Lorri growls at him, \"The deal stands.\"</p><p>Marcus looks at her for a moment, \"No.\"</p><p>\"Stop being a child.\" She snaps.</p><p>\"I WILL HAVE HER!\" He screams and then he's gone.</p><p>Shane doesn\u2019t even flinch. I grab his hand again and squeeze, \"You don\u2019t have to stay with him. You can come with us.\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"I'm royalty. I can't even walk past the guards. I tried.\"</p><p>I slide my hand along his face, \"Don\u2019t do anything I will have to come for you over. Shane it all seems like shits and giggles but we are over busting in blood brothels in Egypt tonight. We are taking the baddies down there because the African Roses are busy. We are on every other continent. I will know if you are part of it. I don\u2019t want to have to kill you.\"</p><p>He bends and presses his lips against mine, \"Stop making it so finite and difficult. We both know you love me as much as I love you.\"</p><p>I look down. \"I don\u2019t feel that way anymore Shane. I was a girl and you were a boy and things were simple.\"</p><p>He grips my hand roughly, \"I heard that no matter what, you never chose me anyway.\"</p><p>I pull back but he's gripping my arm.</p><p>\"Don\u2019t make it so hard Aimes.\" He whispers and releases me. He's gone before I can reason with him.</p><p>\"Well that was a bust.\" Lorri says quietly. \"Fucking Marcus.\" She looks up at the rooftops, \"Sam, go to her. Make sure he doesn\u2019t find her. Do what you have to.\"</p><p>Sam beams and then he too is gone.</p><p>I see the icy blue eyes watching me for a second. Something about him still makes me question everything. How could I ever choose him over Shane?</p><p>I flash to the rooftops where Ari is standing next to O. \"He never came then?\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"Something else must be different.\"</p><p>Ari looks sick, \"No. It's got to work.\" She looks like she might lose it. Lucas growls and rubs against her. His green eyes are full of worry. I scratch his head. He snarls at me. I put my hands in the air defensively, \"What? God. You\u2019re all fluffy and soft. I can't help it.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ari crosses her arms, hugging herself. She looks like she's talking to herself. She grabs my hand and shows me a picture. It's the desert. I wink us there without consulting anyone. The vampire blood-drugging house is below us. The air is cool as the sun has set, but the desert isn\u2019t completely dark.</p><p>\"I'm pregnant Aimes.\" She whispers.</p><p>I look at her, \"What? Is that even possible?\"</p> <p>She nods, \"It's rare. Usually it's angels and Fae impregnating humans. Not Fae impregnating Nephilim.\" She looks at me with tears making her black eyes like pools of despair. \"I need your help.\"</p><p>I nod, \"Anything.

He's going to be the oldest grandpa in the world.\"</p><p>She looks at me and smiles, \"I can't imagine him as a grandpa.\"</p><p>I laugh, \"No. Certainly not.\"</p><p>Her smiles fades, \"If something happens to me, you make one of them make him forget me.\"</p><p>\"No. Ari. That\u2019s so wrong.\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"No. You make him raise the baby and be at peace with my death. He'll hurt himself if I d-die.\"</p> <p>I grab her shoulders, \"You're immortal. No baby can kill you.\"</p><p>Her eyes grow haunted, \"I'm not entirely certain of that. I'm loosing pieces of me everyday. My mind, my heart, my sanity, my soul.\" She whispered the last part.</p><p>\"It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\" I mutter.</p><p>She shakes her head and continues to look off in the distance, \"I know.

Something isn\u2019t right.\"</p><p>\"You should talk to Dorian and Lorri.\"</p><p>She shoots me a look and then looks down at the ground, \"No.\"</p><p>I know her mother died when she was being born. I know why she's worried. \"You're not human like she was Ari. You're special. You'll be fine.\"</p><p>She smiles and I can't help but see the fakeness of it.</p> <p>\"Let's kill shit.\"</p><p>I grin and nod, \"Alright.\" I take her hand and flash us to the opening of the door at the back of the large home.</p><p>\"Ready?\" I ask.</p><p>Her eyes fill solid black, eating up all the whites. She smiles a twisted grin, \"Yup.\"</p><p>I open the door and slide against the wall. I don\u2019t know how many there are. We did sloppy reconnaissance. We tend to get over confident.</p><p>The hall is silent. Ari's buzzing with the strange electricity she controls.</p><p>We creep along quietly. Watching for movement. It's all so familiar to me.</p><p>I glance back, \"Have we done this before?\"</p><p>She shakes hr head and laughs, \"No. But we did it in Rio a few times. You probably just remember that in the weird d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu way.\"</p><p>I nod, \"Great. Love that D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\"</p><p>Her laugh is almost silent. I open the door to the right of us in the long hallway. The room is empty and dark. It's a small sitting room with strange chairs and sofas. They look exotic, like a genie would live in there. I close the door just as Ari opens the one on the left. She closes it, \"This is weird.\"</p><p>We walk to the end of the hall where it forks.</p><p>Ari points right and walks left. We know each other like the backs of our hands and honestly, she knows me better than I know me. I creep along the hallway, until it opens in a fancy kitchen with marble and granite and stainless steel everywhere. It's stunning. I slip past it to another hallway. There are few windows but many lights so it feels like daylight inside. At the end of a hall with no other doors I feel a twinge of something. My powers are completely with me, so much so, that when I touch the handle of the door it burns it's so cold against my searing flesh.</p><p>I stop turning the handle midway. A panicked feeling inside cripples me. It's foreign and only because I was human so few years ago does my body register it. It's fear. Real fear. I look back to where we parted ways and break into a winking run.</p><p>\"Ari!\" I shout, trying to keep my voice down but I can't. I pull my cell and snap a photo of the lovely kitchen and send a mass text instantly, 'HELP!'</p><p>I called out, panicking and looking, \"Ari!\"</p><p>Kicking and tearing the doors down, I leave each one open. The house is empty. All of the floors are empty. She is gone.</p><p>I hear the others arriving behind me on the stairs. I look back. I know horror and terror have taken over my face. I'm gasping for air. I try to avoid the green eyes when I speak, \"She's gone. It was a trap. They took her.\"</p><p>Lorri growls, \"For Christ's sake, when will the two of you stop doing these rogue missions. I know it gets stale at times, but this wasn\u2019t one of those times. We have a ton of shit to do. Why would they take her?\"</p><p>I glance at Dorian and lower my gaze. Lucas leaps up the stairs at me. His fingers bite into my skin, \"Where is she Aimes?\"</p><p>I flinch, holding back my powers. \"I don\u2019t know. There was no one here. It should have been full of drugged blood bags.\"</p><p>Lorri paces on the stairs. I look at them all. The worried looks change depending on the faces I glance at.</p><p>Dorian looks savagely at me, \"How could you let them take her?\"</p><p>I fight tears, \"I didn\u2019t even see them. I didn\u2019t hear them. I-we separated. We always do. She has the holding thing.\" I clearly have no excuses.</p><p>Giselle steps forward and grabs my arms from Lucas who looks like he might eat me.</p><p>\"You guys suck.\" She takes my hands and smiles, \"Everyone knows Ari is badass and can kick anyone's ass.\"</p><p>Ben grabs his brother's arms, \"I agree. This isn\u2019t Aimee's fault. We need to stop blaming and start looking.\"</p><p>Aleks shakes his head, \"We don\u2019t need to. We know where they took her. Ophelia's at Lydia's safe and sound. They took what they could. She's in Alaska.\"</p><p>My heart sinks. I remember the details of the last time.</p><p>Lorri is already gone. Dorian points at me, \"Lydia's now. We need to talk.\" He flashes him and Ben away but Lucas breaks free before he's also taken home. He grabs my hands, \"I didn\u2019t mean it. It's just, she's not been herself lately.\"</p><p>His face is breaking my heart.</p><p>\"I know. She told me.\" The tears win over. I lose control. \"I'm so sorry. I should have made us go home when she told me.\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"She wouldn\u2019t have let you.\"</p><p>I snort through the tears and put my hands out. Giselle and Lucas take them and we are in Lydia's kitchen.</p><p>Sam glances at me, \"Leaving now then I guess huh?\" He knows already.</p><p>\"Yup.\" I wipe my face and sit down.</p><p>\"Miss Aimee, you's been a bad girl. Lord suffering Jesus, you and that Miss Ari always been so naughty.\" Annabelle hands me a cup of cocoa. I sip it and smile. I can't help it. She makes me feel loved.</p><p>\"I know Annabelle.\"</p><p>Lydia storms into the kitchen, \"This isn\u2019t so bad. They have Ari, now we have a reason to go there and attack and get the ball rolling the way it was before.\"</p><p>Sam shakes his head, \"No. Ari is in a situation.\"</p><p>\"Sam.\" I say before I can stop myself.</p><p>He shakes his head, \"Everyone needs to know Aimes.\"</p><p>\"How do you know?\"</p><p>He ignores me, \"Ari is pregnant.\"</p><p>Lydia gasps. Dorian chokes his cocoa down, spraying a bit of it across the room. He flashes and grabs Lucas by the throat. I see the spark. I leap across the room, knocking my cocoa across the kitchen too. When I grip Dorian's hand, I wink. I'm lying on top of him in the forest close to home. I don\u2019t know why I flashed there but I did.</p><p>He screams in rage.</p><p>I hold him. I wrap my legs and arms around him and hold him tightly.</p><p>When he's done, he closes his eyes and sighs, \"You knew? You knew and you took her there?\"</p><p>I shake my head against him, \"I never knew. I never knew until we were in the desert. Too late to turn back.\"</p><p>He sighs, \"Fuck me. Fuck. FUCKKKKKK!\"</p><p>His slow heart is beating harder than I could imagine it would go.</p><p>I whisper, \"She'll be fine.\"</p><p>He grabs my arms and throws me off of him. He throws me with such force I don\u2019t have time to wink. I slam into a tree with a thud. I gurgle from the broken ribs I'm sure I have and searing pain in my spine. His black eyes burn and his nostrils flare with every breath. He looks savage but I can't get my breath to talk him down.</p><p>I lie limp in the soft moss and ferns.</p><p>He looks at me and covers his face. He winks and leaves me alone in the woods. I wink to Lydia's, broken and bleeding. I land on the back grass and whisper, \"Aleks.\"</p><p>He's there within seconds. He somehow always knows when I need him.</p><p>\"Hey, what happened?\"</p><p>I cough as the rib pulls away from my lungs and starts to heal, \"Dorian. Pissed.\" I whisper.</p><p>He picks me up and flashes us to my bed. He lays me down and lies beside me.</p><p>Ophelia walks into the room. \"You okay?\"</p><p>I shake my head. Aleks stands up and shrugs, \"She'll be fine. Her kind heals fast.\"</p><p>\"What happened?\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"Dorian did something to her.\"</p><p>I'm struggling to get my breath, still winded. \"Slammed me into a tree.\" I say breathlessly.</p><p>Ophelia looks disgusted, \"You don\u2019t want to defend her?\"</p><p>He frowns, \"I don\u2019t like getting involved in Roses business.\"</p><p>She growls, \"I've had just about enough of this. She snaps her fingers and grabs his face before he can move away. She holds his head. His eyes roll back inside his head. He drops to his knees. I'm gasping in horror, she's killing him. She drops her hands after a second. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He scrunches his face up. He looks up at the ceiling and screams. When he lowers his head his white eyes are on fire. He grabs my hand, \"I'll go talk to him.\" He winks before I can talk him out of it.</p><p>\"What did you do?\"</p><p>She grins, \"I fixed him. He was broken.\" She walks out of the room.</p><p>In the silence I hear a scream and slamming. My bones are lining back up with loud snaps and grinding going on in my body.</p> <p>I cry out taking shallow breaths.</p><p>The commotion downstairs is too much. I climb off the bed and wink into the kitchen. I look out the back window to the grass where Aleks and Sam have Dorian on the ground. Ben is in wolf form hovering over Dorian's face.</p><p>I wink out on the lawn, \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>Sam looks back at me and grins, \"Defending you milady.\" Ben saunters to me and rubs against my hip. I rub my fingers deep onto the wolf down and notice the burning look in Aleks' eyes. He looks different and yet somehow the same.</p><p>Dorian's pleading black eyes meet mine, \"You alright?\"</p> <p>I nod once.</p><p>I know he's sorry. I can see it blanketing his face.</p><p>\"I'm sorry too.\" I whisper.</p><p>Aleks climbs off of him and grabs my hand. Something is different. \"You really alright?\"</p><p>\"Yeah?\" I furrow my brow.</p><p>He bends and presses his warm soft lips against my cheek. My entire body shivers. I pull back, \"What was that for?\" My words are a breathy whisper.</p> <p>\"I just remembered so many things and I'm pretty sure it's been a long time since I did that.\"</p><p>His hands are warm around mine. He steps away and walks across the lawn. Dorian looks after him, \"Wanker. I could have taken you if the lads hadn\u2019t helped.\"</p><p>Aleks chuckles and flashes in front of Dorian again. He bends down and punches him in the face once more, \"That\u2019s for touching my girl.\"</p><p>Dorian's face breaks into a bloody grin, \"You hit like a girl.\"</p><p>Aleks laughs and offers him a hand. Dorian looks at his huge hand and then takes it.</p><p>\"Apologize.\"</p><p>I'm lost. I shake my head, \"Let's focus on getting Ari back.\" I walk away, \"I'm not your girl.\" At least I don\u2019t think I am.</p><p>Lorri walks out the back door, \"Okay, planning time. We've worked it out. We know many of the things that happened last time are going to happen again. The place should look the same. Let's do this.\" She frowns when she sees them all, \"What are you idiots doing?\"</p> <p>Sam beams, \"Wrestling.\"</p><p>Lorri looks less than impressed.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Ophelia</p><p>The cold of the vampire fortress feels the same as it did last time. We have killed more than we did the last time though. I gag watching Aimee take the soul of the man she's holding. She does it rough, like she used to. His black blood sprays across the pale beige wall of the hallway. She hasn\u2019t done that since she was the old Aimee.</p><p>Aleks is clinging to her side, like he used to.</p><p>\"Why didn\u2019t Marcus come? I thought he wanted this too.\" I ask.</p><p>Sam shakes his head, \"He's holding Jon ransom and won't help us. Not until we make Hanna like she was. He wants her dead and reborn. He's been having a tough time locating her though.\" His grin is cheeky and accusing.</p><p>I chuckle, \"Ha. Well good luck Marcus. The blue sisters have been watching the house for me. They've been keeping her guarded and cloaked. He doesn\u2019t stand a chance. I just can't believe he's being such a baby. He isn\u2019t helping or anything?\"</p><p>Sam shakes his head looking around as we follow the group. \"He's pissed and won't let Henry have Jon until we change her.\"</p><p>\"Bastard. I promised my sisters I would free them.\"</p><p>He presses his lips together. I know he wishes Hanna was changed too.</p><p>\"You don\u2019t want to even see if your mom is okay?\" I ask.</p><p>He draws his brows in, \"No. I know she's fine. I know what she is.\" He means traitor and I hate her for it.</p><p>We walk in silence and my stomach flips when we near the main courtyard. I remember the pain and suffering Aimee endured when we got there last time. I'm terrified but also anxious. Oliver should be waiting for us. His face flashes in my mind.</p><p>Aimee looks back at me severely. Her beautiful pale face is covered in the splatter of the black blood she has filled the air with.</p><p>I nod. I know she's checking to make sure I'm ready. Dorian and Lorri have gone off separately. This time I didn\u2019t go with them though. This time I'm meeting my father in the courtyard. Lorri and Dorian have gone to kill Daniel. Daniel who has no idea they know about him. Not this time.</p><p>Aimee opens the door we all know leads to the courtyard.</p><p>The cold wind hits us. I catch a glimpse of him. My insides flutter. His lips, his hard cold face, his steely eyes and thick body. I remember too clearly how it felt to be with him. The ground thaws beneath me. His eyes meet mine but the love and burning isn\u2019t there like it was before. Something is wrong. He doesn't see me. He sees Jonathan's daughter. I can see it on his face. Cold recognition.</p><p>My father stands in the middle of the courtyard looking handsome and youthful. The way they all look. His cruel sneer on his face is all I see though. I hate him. My memories of him burn when they crawl around inside me.</p><p>He lifts his lips into a grin. Two men drag the limp body of a bleeding Ari out into the snow. Lucas and Ben growl. Aimee grabs them by the fur.</p><p>\"So, we meet finally.\" He speaks and I feel sick. I forgot how much I hate his voice.</p><p>He points one finger at Aimee, \"You must be Dorian's little puppet. The cure.\"</p><p>Aimee stands ready to be shot. I'm not sure if she will be or not but I know we all made a pact no one would be near her and she would wink as he fired the gun. He doesn\u2019t have one though.</p><p>He reaches over and grabs Ari's limp arm and drags her tiny body to him.</p><p>\"This is the one that has surprised us the most. The push is fascinating is it not?\" His voice is silk and evil.</p><p>Aimee steps forward, \"She is harmless.\"</p><p>He smiles wickedly, \"She's not though is she? She can change the time. Daniel mentioned it and I realized that of course I knew about this talent. We had one once. She was amazing. Had to kill her.\" He shakes his head, \"She just couldn\u2019t be trusted to let us have things the way we wanted them. Had a conscience. Very annoying.\" Oliver laughs as if remembering. He is my father's puppet. My heart is breaking. I look around for Lorri and Dorian but they're not with us.</p><p>\"Hello Ophelia, love. These nice men are going to take you for a little stroll. We can't let you run off with these Roses you see.\" The two lugs that brought in Ari walk toward me. Aimee nods once but doesn\u2019t turn her head to see me. I know Trist and Philip will rescue me. I let them take me even though I have to fight my urges to electrocute them both. The snow melts where I walk. Flowers spring from the cracks of the bricks and cobblestone under the deep snow.</p><p>I steal a glance at Oliver. He doesn\u2019t budge. I feel sick. The flowers die on the spot. Like my heart.</p><p>I'm taken to a doorway. I glance back at my father. He is without mercy. I don\u2019t like the way he holds Ari. I have a sick feeling. I'm dragged into a stone hallway just as I watch him reach behind Oliver, who doesn\u2019t budge. Who doesn\u2019t stop him? He pulls out a blade and holds it to Ari's throat. The wolves whine and moan but the door closes as the screams fill the courtyard, and I'm left with the horror of my imagination.</p><p>I'm dragged to the cell. It's all the same. Nothing is different. It smells and feels exactly as it did the other times.</p><p>I'm tied and bound and left.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear the footsteps or the chatting of my brother and his boyfriend. I hear nothing but my own thoughts and the sound of the wind whistling in the cell.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Aimee</p><p>The blade comes from Oliver's back somewhere. The glint of it in the air above her head stops everything. The wolves whine and I scream, \"Stop please.\" I put a hand out trying to be calm. \"Stop. Please. Whatever you want, I will do it. Kill me, not her. Please don\u2019t hurt her.\"</p><p>Aleks takes a step for me but I shake my head, \"Take me, kill me instead.\" I step forward. Lucas is beside me, ready.</p><p>Jonathan's fangs glint the same as the blade does. \"Why do you think I want you dead? I have something I need you to do.\" He holds the short blade at Ari's throat, \"Go peacefully with Oliver here and when he is back here and you are in the cell safe and sound I will release her. Otherwise I kill her now.\" He digs the blade in, drawing her dark blood and making it drip in a slow stream onto the white snow.</p><p>I nod anxiously, \"YES! Please. I'll go.\" I put my hands forward.</p><p>Oliver steps forwards, \"Hands behind your back death dealer. I know how it works.\" His voice is harsh. I don\u2019t have any memories of him but I know him, in my soul.</p><p>I put my hands behind my back. The others argue and bicker but I ignore them. I look Jonathan in the eyes, \"He will be right back.\"</p><p>He nods, \"Take her.\"</p><p>Oliver grabs my arms and drags me roughly to the same door Ophelia went through.</p><p>I'm trembling. I can't stop looking back at her. \"Sam, don\u2019t let them move.\"</p><p>\"I won't.\" He is gripping the wolves.</p><p>Giselle gives me a last look, \"Aimes.\" Her voice is small and weak.</p><p>\"It's okay. I'll be right back.\" My voice cracks. She looks ready to break.</p><p>Oliver drags me through the doorway. When it closes I look at him, \"Are you on our side?\"</p><p>He shoves me hard down the stairs. I almost stumble but I wink and am standing at the bottom of the stairs looking up at him when I catch myself.</p><p>He points, \"Don\u2019t do that again or I won't go back to the courtyard.\" His blue eyes sparkle.</p><p>I turn and walk town the stairs. He unlocks a door and pushes me inside. O is already tied up. She smiles and speaks through the gag, \"Oliver. Oliver, untie me quickly.\"</p><p>He pushes me against the wall and rubs his body against mine perversely, \"Why would I untie you princess? Not when I have this in front of me for the taking.\" He nuzzles into my neck and kisses, \"I've heard you dealers can be quiet extreme. You suck and pull while you suck and pull.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gag. \"I'm a virgin, please don\u2019t do this.\" I whisper into the cold rough stonewall.</p><p>He chuckles his warm breath into my neck and presses what I assume is his erection into the back of my pants, \"I can help you change that.\" My hands are burning against the bricks.</p><p>A scream rips from my throat. It's frustration and pain, from not expelling the rising pressure of my powers. Tears leave my closed eyes.</p> <p>I whisper, \"O, don\u2019t do anything to him. They're going to kill Ari if he doesn\u2019t go back up.\" He rips my shirt from my defenseless body. I'm trembling naked from the waist up in the freezing cold cell. I can't imagine what Ophelia is going through. She is watching the man, she thinks she will be with for all eternity, rape someone else. His hands reach around. He cups my breasts roughly. I cry out again, \"Please stop. Please.\"</p><p>I'm not weak. I'm not feeble or helpless. I'm strong. I could kill him in a hearts beat but it would be a death sentence for my best friend and her unborn baby.</p><p>Ophelia is screaming behind the gag. She's crying and struggling. I can hear her.</p><p>He turns back, \"You'll get your turn baby. Don\u2019t you worry about that.\"</p><p>\"Oliver, stop, please baby. Stop. He's done something to you. This isn\u2019t you.\" She must have worked the gag from her lips. She's sobbing and her voice is cracking.</p> <p>\"Untie me first. Do me first.\" She pleads.</p><p>He grabs a fist full of my hair and slams my face into the bricks. My nose breaks on contact. He ties me up and gags me. Then he is across the room to her. \"You want it first?\"</p><p>I'm in a haze of blood and pain and tears and hating the fact I'm naked and hanging by my hands. The black blood is dripping down my face onto my bare chest.</p><p>\"Untie my hands so I can touch you too. I'll make you happy I promise.\" Her words are shaky. I can hear it. She's crushed and I feel sick. He's taking too long. Ari is dead. I know she is. My heart is burning and aching. I spin on my ropes and watch, as her eyes become dead and unfeeling. She smiles weakly, \"I can make you happy.\" Her words are as dead as her eyes.</p><p>\"You haven\u2019t had any magic training have you?\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"N-n-not yet.\"</p> <p>I can hear the smile in his voice, \"And you won't tell your daddy, if I touch you?\"</p><p>\"I'm not a virgin.\" Her words are a whisper.</p><p>He gropes her, \"Good.\"</p><p>I sob, watching it. \"Please, just go stop him from killing Ari and then come back.\" My voice is broken. I can't speak without making sounds I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>He looks back at me, \"He was never going to let her live. I was never planning on going back up there. Now shut up and wait for me to get back to you.\" His grin is cold and sick. \"They need her before they need you. So she goes first. Hope that's alright.\"</p><p>Ophelia's eyes bug out of her head when she looks at me. He unties her hands and pulls her shirt off. She stands still and sobs as he grabs at her. She looks defeated. She looks up at me. I can see resolve in her eyes. I just don\u2019t understand the decision she has made.</p><p>\"You better make me happy bitch.\" He undoes his pants.</p><p>Her trembling hands lift, slowly, for his arms. She rubs them for the slightest second and then closes her eyes. Her fingers bite into his skin. Where her hands touch him black veins crawl up her arms to her bare breasts. They make a black pool around her heart. He's frozen when she touches him. She pulls the black veins from him until she can't stand anymore and falls to the cold stone, unconscious. He blinks and looks at me.</p> <p>\"Aimee?\" He whispers, stunned.</p><p>I cry harder, \"Ari. Get Ari.\"</p><p>He looks lost. His blue eyes are clearer than I've ever seen them. He's looks at me again and then is gone.</p><p>\"Ophelia. Please wake up O.\" I look up into the stone ceiling and sob, \"Please. Please help us. We fight for you, please help us.\"</p><p>Not that I expected anything, but when nothing happens I can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointed. If there is a God, he cares for us the same as every other being. Even though we give everything of ourselves, he treats us no differently.</p><p>Her body moves with shallow breaths. She twitches and trembles.</p><p>\"O. O, please don\u2019t leave me here alone.\"</p><p>She moves a pale hand that is still covered in the black veins. Her fingers grip like she's having a seizure.</p><p>I close my eyes and lower my head but the air moves around me. I lift my eyes and jump. She stands directly in front of me. Her eyes are completely black. The veins are reaching her face. Her lip trembles.</p><p>Her voice is a whisper that doesn\u2019t come from her. It's as if something speaks through her cold stiff body that is pressed against mine. We are bare chest to bare chest.</p><p>\"She took it all Aimee. She took his evil and his dark. She took it all inside of her. She's dark now. Her soul is as dark as our father's.\"</p><p>I look at her black lips moving faintly with the whispered words.</p><p>\"What can I do?\" I ask.</p><p>\"Kill her now before he finds her. Before it's too late.\"</p><p>I look around shaking my head, \"I can't. Don't ask this of me.\"</p><p>Her eyes start to flutter.</p><p>\"Do it before she gains consciousness.\"</p><p>I try to move my trembling hand to her arm. The black veins move with the flow of her blood. The poison is filtering everywhere. Tears blind me to everything but the blackness of her fluttering eyes. If I close my eyes I can smell the ocean and see the harbor of my small town. I can hear my mother laughing and my sister criticizing me and even that makes me smile. I can see my father rocking in his chair with a book and a tea. He smiles at me over his books. I can ask the voices inside of her to untie me and wink home. I can refuse it all and let the cards fall where they may. I sniffle as her hand is lifted and pressed into mine. They know what I am. The fire is waiting for her skin. It's waiting for me to do it. It is still there from the wall in the face. Her cold bare chest pressed against mine feels weird. I keep my eyes closed, until as I release it. I pull it hard and fast and let it take the control.</p><p>Her body slams hard against me again and again as she struggles. The real her must be there. She feels herself dying and is fighting me.</p><p>But I've let it go. I've let it have her. It sucks and pulls. Even though my eyes are closed the tears find their way out. They soak my face and chest.</p><p>\"Aimee.\" She speaks softly once.</p><p>Her body heats up just as I feel the suck stop. She's dry. I open my eyes in time to see the horrified look on her face, frozen there. Her dead body slides down mine. The tears have soaked us both. I go limp in the ropes.</p><p>I hear voices. I'm shaking and trembling.</p><p>\"I'm not talking to you.\"</p><p>\"You're talking right now.\"</p><p>\"I hate you.\"</p><p>It's two men bickering. I ignore them both and hang swinging against the ropes. Ophelia's corpse is against my feet, which barely touch the ground.</p><p>The wind moves and he's there. He's holding me. His body forms around mine, cocoons around me. He's warm and soft and real against the cold and pain that I'm stuck in. He unties me and holds me. I feel my winking powers coming back once the weird cloth is off of my wrists.</p><p>\"Oh my god. What did you do? Who is that?\" The men start shrieking.</p><p>\"Ophelia? Ophelia? Is that Ophelia? Will one of you talk? One of you bitches better start talking.\"</p><p>I look past the huge arm that\u2019s holding me in the air, to a handsome man covering his panicked face and shaking his head. The other man is also shaking his head but in tiny twitches. They look at me accusingly.</p><p>\"What have you done to her?\"</p><p>Tears are pouring from my face. I try to talk but the words aren\u2019t there. I don\u2019t have any. I'm empty and broken. I've killed my friend.</p><p>The voices whisper in the wind above us, \"She had to brother. She had to do it. Ophelia pulled the darkness from Oliver.\"</p><p>The one I'm assuming is Tristan lifts his face and screams. He howls almost. The other man grips him and pulls at him, but he struggles hard to get to his sister's corpse. He claws and struggles but the other man pulls at him. \"No. Trist she's gone my love.\" He says soothingly. Tristan is a ball of emotions and fury. His eyes meet mine, breaking my heart again. \"I never met her. You bitch, I never met my own twin sister.\"</p><p>I sob silently. I won't steal his moment of grief from him by being sad.</p><p>Dorian winks into the room. He grabs me from Aleks's huge arms and pulls me to him, \"I need you. Now.\" He winks us to the cold snowy courtyard.</p><p>No one is there. Nothing is there. No blood, but the small amount that was forced from Ari's throat.</p><p>\"Where is she?\" I ask.</p><p>\"He took her. He took her. Sam has gone to track him. I need you to go with me to Marcus's. I need him on our side. I need Jon dead and the dead girl's magic transferred to Tristan.\" His voice is frenzied.</p><p>I nod. I will do anything. I know that. I've just proven it. I killed my friend. My heart is broken and numb and lifeless. I'm far deader than I imagined.</p><p>\"It won't work.\" I look back at the man speaking. It's Oliver. He is dead looking and broken like me. He stands, leaning against the door to the stairs that leads to the cell I was just in. \"We are doomed. He will win like he always does.\" He looks at me with regret blanketing his face. \"I'm so sorry.\" His words are nothing. They're nothing but air and emptiness.</p><p>I shake my head, \"You owe me nothing. You didn't know me anymore than I knew you.\"</p><p>He swallows, \"Is she....down there still?\"</p><p>I lose control again and sob. My face nods with the heaves and sobs. He's devastated and I'm bare-chested and frozen and dying inside from the pain and the sorrow of my own betrayal. I betrayed her. I've lost the war for us all. I killed the one in the prophecy.</p><p>Dorian wraps his coat around me and holds me to him in a way that feels familiar. Like we've done this before. \"Why won't it work?\" He asks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"The witch has to be a girl. Lillith cannot die by the hand of a man. It must be a woman who wields the power of the seven sisters. It's why Jonathan hasn\u2019t ever made Tristan take the power for himself. Daniel discovered it only about a year ago, going through the old prophecies and scriptures. We have a lot of reasons to believe it must be a female.\" Oliver's voice is lifeless. His eyes are full of tears.</p><p>\"We are defeated.\" I whisper.</p><p>Oliver nods but Dorian winks us away. We are standing outside Hanna's father's house.</p> <p>\"Kill him.\" Dorian's words are a whisper.</p><p>I walk up the gravel to the front door. My legs are shaky. I zip up the coat he has given me to cover my breasts. I lift my hand, wincing at the black blood I see on my knuckles. I knock and wait.</p><p>Roland answers the door after a moment. His jaw clenches. \"Madame dealer. I was certain we were not expecting you. The potions are making Doctor Jekyll better every day.\"</p><p>I look into his eyes, \"It's time for her.\"</p><p>His face tightens more, \"I dare say it is not. We agreed.\"</p> <p>I shake my head, \"No, the deal is off. We need her.\"</p><p>He looks disgustedly at me and then past me, \"You will trade her for the shifter? Trade a human life?\"</p><p>Dorian shouts at him, \"Yes! Yes I will. I will trade whatever I have to, to end this. Call for her, now.\"</p><p>Roland looks sickened but opens the door wide for us.</p><p>\"I'm sorry.\" I say in a small voice.</p><p>\"It is not your choice. Like me, you are but one of the masses the Rose's use for their schemes.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, don\u2019t be so dramatic Roland. The good doctor is on borrowed time. You and I both know it. Before the potions worked, he and Aimee here had a deal. A deal he is going to honor tonight.\" Dorian points at the floor.</p><p>Roland puffs out his chest, \"She is not a danger to herself. She is not a danger to anyone. The deal was that he would let you take him to spare her. She doesn\u2019t need sparing.\"</p><p>I feel badly for him.</p><p>Dorian sits on the beautiful sofa and shrugs, \"She does now.\"</p><p>Roland points down a massive hallway, \"This way my dear.\" His voice is defeated. I've met them all before. I made the deal when Marcus was certain he could contain the doctor. I walk to the room at the end of the hallway where the door is closed. Roland taps lightly, \"Miss Aimee to see you sir.\"</p><p>The office door opens after a moment. I flinch when I see the robust health across his face. He looks confused.</p><p>\"Miss James. We meet again, prematurely I believe.\"</p><p>I tremble, \"Hello doctor.\"</p> <p>He opens the door further to let me in. I walk past him.</p><p>Roland asks, \"Some tea, miss James?\"</p><p>I look back and shake my head, \"No thank you Roland.\"</p><p>\"I'll have some Roland.\"</p><p>\"Very good sir.\"</p><p>The doctor closes the door and looks at me, \"Tell me what's going on.\"</p><p>I sit in the huge chair across from him. Tears slip from my eyes as the story slips from my tongue. I get it all out before Roland is back with the tea. Doctor Jekyll gives me a long stare and then shakes his head. \"Necromancer. You need a Necromancer.\"</p><p>I frown, \"What?\" My brain is translating the word but it seems crazy.</p><p>He folds his hands and nods, \"Yes. Necromancer. I know of one in the south. Bad business that is.\"</p><p>He is an old gentleman who reminds me of my father, only English.</p><p>\"Raise her from the dead and as she takes her sister's magic she will be cleansed. The magic of seven good witches over one bad witch. You see what I mean?\"</p><p>I clear my throat, \"Hanna is the only way to get the sister's magic.\"</p><p>He frowns, \"I think I can help. Tell Oliver to take you to Momma Holt. They all know her.\"</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Hanna</p><p>My phone rings again. I sigh and pull it out. The asshole behind me groans. I look back and glare. The three calls are from my dad's house. I press my lips together and lean into Rebecca, \"I gotta go. Dad is calling over and over.\"</p><p>She shoves popcorn in her mouth and nods, \"Text me later.\"</p><p>\"Yup. See ya.\" I climb out of the seat and run from the theatre. I try not to see too much of him but he's insistent that I sleep over every now and then. He's been sick and as much as we aren\u2019t close, I get scared when he's sick. I run out to the car and drive over as fast as I can. I park and run up to the door. Roland has it opened already, \"My dear. What brings you here?\" He asks all jolly and sweet. I hug him and notice how quickly he pulls away from me. He's always so cold. \"Lighten up Roland. It's a hug. You won't die from it.\" I've been coming over for the forced sleepovers for a few months and he's still so odd with me. Cold and British.</p><p>\"He's in his office my dear.\" He closes the door and I run down the hall.</p><p>I knock on the closed door.</p><p>\"Come in.\"</p><p>I open it and look at my father who seems robust and healthy, expectantly.</p><p>He smiles and points a hand at a filthy girl with blonde hair and black crusty stains all over her.</p><p>Before I can enter the office a man's voice speaks my name, \"Hanna.\" I look down the hall to see a sexy guy with dark hair and eyes and a smile that kills.</p><p>I grin, \"Hi.\"</p><p>He walks down the hallway to me, undressing me with his eyes.</p><p>\"I'm Dorian.\"</p><p>\"Hanna.\" I say it, realizing he knows that.</p><p>He smiles and looks down. I tremble inside.</p><p>My father calls out, \"Hanna, come in here for god's sake.\"</p><p>I look back at my dad and the dirty blonde and shake my head, \"Sorry.\" I step in. The Dorian guy comes in the room. He stands close and then looks at my dad, \"It's strong. Very strong.\" He says.</p><p>I look at him quizzically, \"What is?\"</p><p>The guy's face lightens back into a cheeky grin, \"You are.\"</p><p>I tear myself from his gaze and look at my dad, \"What did you want?\"</p><p>He looks stern and annoyed, \"I need you to do something for me.\"</p><p>I raise my brows, \"What?\"</p><p>The blonde stands up, \"Go and live with a friend of ours, to keep you safe.\" I realize how pretty she is, behind the filth and the old tear stains.</p><p>\"Dad? What is she talking about?\" I feel weird about them all, like I know them. I don\u2019t fear them.</p><p>Dad stands up and crosses his arms, \"These are friends of mine Hanna. They will be keeping you safe, while I'm away sorting out a business deal. I've made some shady deals in the past that are catching up with me.\"</p><p>I roll my eyes, \"I don\u2019t need to be babysat. I'm almost twenty.\" I'm not surprised about the shady deals though. He's never worked and always had money. Like a gentleman in an Austen movie.</p><p>He taps the desk, \"The decision is made. You will go with them. Now.\"</p><p>I feel anger burning inside of me, \"I don\u2019t want to. You're barely my dad. You can't tell me what to do.\"</p><p>He slaps the desk hard, \"YOU WILL GO AND YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME TO TELL YOU IT'S SAFE TO COME HOME!\"</p><p>The blonde flinches with me at his shouting.</p><p>\"I hate you.\" I burst.</p><p>He crosses his arms, \"Better to hate me alive, than love me and be dead.\"</p><p>I point, \"Who the hell are they?\"</p><p>The blonde reaches for me and instantly we are standing in front of a huge mansion.</p><p>I bend and throw up my meal from the movie.</p><p>\"Sorry.\" She says quietly.</p><p>\"Hanna, my love. My dearest precious.\" I glance up at the sexiest man I've ever seen, walking from the mansion. Looking up, I see it's more of a castle.</p><p>His arms are out. His smile melts my anger.</p><p>The blonde steps in front of me, \"I want him done now.\"</p><p>He sighs and nod, \"You really are a pain in the ass, Aimee.\" She is rigid and firm in her stance.</p><p>The sexy guy sighs again and turns back toward the house, \"Bring her in.\"</p><p>The filthy blonde girl, Aimee, grabs my arms and helps me up. Panic starts to build in me. I turn and make a run for it across the lawn. Instantly, the dark haired man is there. He grabs my arm roughly and pulls me into him. He inhales the air around me, like he's smelling a flower. I push him away, but he's strong. He winks his eye and we're inside of a huge room. I lean forward and gag and heave again. I lose the rest of my slurpy and fries.</p><p>\"Oh dear god. Get Suzette to clean that up.\" The new dark haired man claps his hands. I wipe my face, \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just want to go home. Please, just take me home. I won't tell my dad you never made me stay. I'll pay you whatever you want.\"</p><p>They all look at me, like they feel sorry for me.</p><p>\"Just let me go home.\" I cry and throw up again.</p><p>\"Oh for the love of god, this isn\u2019t The Exorcist. Stop the vomiting.\" I start crying. I can\u2019t stop. I'm humiliated. The rug looks expensive and I'm a hostage. The dark haired man looks annoyed and mutters something about irreplaceable.</p><p>Aimee looks at me kindly, \"You okay?\"</p><p>I feel my lip quiver, \"No. I want to go home. Please. Just get away from me.\" I shake my head and look around, \"Where are we? How did we even get here? I want to go home.\"</p><p>The dark haired man, who I suspect owns the castle steps towards me and smiles. \"All of this is normal for you. You love traveling by wink. You know all about it all.\" His eyes hold me hostage. I feel myself get lost in the sea of words. His soothing voice floats me across the room and my eyes close. I'm completely relaxed.</p><p>I hear the talking but barely register it.</p><p>\"Bring him here. And Henry.\" One English guy says.</p><p>\"Aren't you demanding? Maybe I want to be sure the merchandise isn\u2019t default. God knows what Ari's done this time.\" The snooty guy with the eyes talks with a snooty accent.</p><p>\"You will not speak of my daughter like that again.\"</p><p>\"Guys, stop.\" I glance up and notice the girl is between the two dark haired men. She is pushing on them both. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They look angry.</p><p>I feel relaxed, even though I know it's the wrong feeling.</p><p>\"Marcus, bring him out. I'll text Aleks.\" The blonde Aimee says.</p> <p>The men sort of shove each other one last time and then the one I can't stop staring at is gone. My mind tells me it's normal, but I can't fight the feeling that I should be panicking.</p><p>I swallow hard, \"Why has my father sent me here?\" I ask softly.</p><p>Aimee looks at Dorian, as if ignoring me and tilts her head, \"Fix that. Now.\"</p><p>He sneers, \"I don't take orders from you.\"</p><p>\"Please.\"</p> <p>He smiles the most charming smile I think I've ever seen. \"Is there a chance you'll be grateful for this?\"</p><p>Aimee crosses her arms, \"Yes. I'll be so very grateful.\"</p><p>He nods once and then turns to me. He saunters over and kneels next to me. I'm panicking inside, but my brain and my body aren\u2019t communicating.</p><p>He brushes a hand against my forehead and whispers something. He turns back around and shakes his head, \"I can't. She hates him. If I do it she won't stay. I can't do it.\"</p><p>\"She's terrified.\"</p><p>He stands and walks back to her, \"Not my problem. I need my daughter back.\"</p> <p>Aimee looks upset but then nods. She plays with her phone.</p><p>\"Are you monsters?\" I ask. I feel like I'm caught in the spider's web and watching it, waiting for it to devour me. In the meantime I'm frozen from the poison.</p><p>Aimee nods, \"We are. We are monsters. Your father is a monster. Your best bet for safety is here in this castle. There is a man named Henry here. He will protect you at all costs.\"</p><p>I close my eyes and wait for things to make sense. I'm scared I will never open them and see anything I recognize from my life.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Aimee</p><p>I hate her again. I can smell the siren and it makes me feel awful. I'm not allowed to tell Sam that she's here with Marcus, but I want to. I want to give him his chance. The air swirls with warmth. Aleks stands beside me looking confused, \"Hanna?\"</p><p>I nod, \"Hanna.\"</p> <p>\"Is her father de...?\"</p><p>\"No.\" I cut him off. \"His idea actually.\"</p><p>Aleks looks disgusted, \"To bring her here?\"</p><p>I shrug, \"With what's going on she is safest here.\"</p><p>His face is anxious, \"I guess. Where is he?\"</p><p>I know he's waited years for this moment. Dorian smirks at him, \"He's coming brother. You get your rest today. Your vengeance and then rest.\"</p><p>Aleks looks at me funny. He looks confused about something. He stands so close to me the backs of our hands brush against each other.</p><p>\"Marcus never told me you were coming over Aimes.\" I glance up to see Shane strolling out from the back hallway.</p><p>I clear my throat, \"It wasn\u2019t a scheduled visit. I'm here for Roses business.\"</p><p>He looks so handsome, so perfect. He glares at Aleks and then turns his face to mine and smiles again. I would hardly know him he is so different. So prefect and calculated. He is like Marcus. I cringe imagining the things he has done since I killed him. I can't imagine the amount of guilt I have spilled all over my face.</p><p>\"I've missed you.\" He says.</p><p>Dorian snorts.</p><p>\"Well, you knew where I was.\" I say curtly. I don\u2019t want to have the conversation with Aleks and Dorian and sleeping Hanna in the room.</p><p>He takes a step toward me and puts his hand out, \"Come, take a walk with me. I need to talk to you.\"</p><p>I hesitate and then put my hand in his. I let him pull me away. It's not for the reason he wants it to be. It's guilt. I have a hard time denying him because of the guilt.</p><p>His hand is warm and firm. It feels the way I remember, the way it felt years ago.</p><p>I try not to see the boy I loved. I try to make myself see the animal I have made him into.</p><p>He smiles and nudges me, \"What's on your mind?\"</p><p>I frown, \"You asked me to come.\"</p><p>He shrugs, \"I don\u2019t like how that lug Aleks looks at you.\"</p><p>I shake my head and look down, \"He doesn't look at me.\" The lie feels weird crossing my lips. I know he looks at me. He does it all the time. Ophelia did something to him.</p><p>\"He does and you know it.\" He grabs both my hands and spins me around to face him. He plants his lips on mine. The kiss is forced and rough. I try to push him away, but he forces it. I pull slightly with my hands, zapping him almost. He snaps out of it and steps back, looking hurt. \"What was that for?\"</p><p>I wipe my lips, \"You didn\u2019t have my permission.\"</p><p>His eyes darken, \"Will I ever?\"</p><p>I don\u2019t hurt the way I used to when I'm around him. The guilt and anger at myself are there, but I see it. The truth. I didn\u2019t mean to do it. I'm a victim of the circumstances as much as he is. \"No. You won't.\" I say with a great deal of tension I my voice.</p><p>He grabs my arms, \"Why?\" He shakes me and growls.</p><p>I pull back, \"Screw you.\" I shove him against the wall. He cracks a painting when he hits it. The frame breaks and the painting drops to the floor. The lit wall sconce flickers from the vibration. It flickers light across his face and fangs. He looks sexy and devastating all at once.</p><p>\"Tell me what I can do to fix things?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"Shane, I liked the school boy you were. I liked you for years. Years. But in the last couple we have become people that don\u2019t match anymore. You kill things for food and so do I, but I maintain a strict diet. You feed off humans like they're cattle. I am against the things you do. We can never make a relationship out of that.\"</p><p>His brow stitches together, \"I love you still.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"You don\u2019t. You don\u2019t even know me anymore. I'm not the same girl. You and me were always doomed. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times Ari messes with the time, you and I don\u2019t work. We never have and it's time we grow up and move on.\"</p><p>He snarls, \"I don\u2019t want to move on.\"</p><p>I grimace, \"You have already. I can smell her on you.\"</p><p>His face drops. He smiles sweetly, \"I have to eat Aimes.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"Not like Marcus you don\u2019t. You chose that.\" I turn my back on him to leave. He grabs my arm and drags me back. He pulls me to a room and slams the door. I struggle to get away from him. Memories of Oliver attacking me flood my brain. I shove him hard. He staggers back. I point at him, \"If you touch me again I end you. Childhood together or no.\"</p><p>He smiles at me sadistically. I don\u2019t know him anymore. Just as he doesn\u2019t know me.</p><p>I wink to the main hall. Tears have flooded my eyes. Aleks looks at me concerned. I shake my head, \"I'm fine. Just finishing something.\"</p><p>He takes my hand in his and squeezes. Marcus walks into the room behind Henry. He walks holding a man that looks remarkably like Aleks, only older</p><p>Henry shoves him into the middle of me, Aleks, Dorian and Marcus.</p><p>I look for it. The monster. He is apparently out of control. I always try to see the monster when I take their lives.</p><p>He looks normal, smug but normal.</p><p>He smirks at Aleks, \"Aleksander, my son. It's been too long. You never visit.\"</p><p>Aleks stands tall, \"I need to say something to you.\"</p><p>His father grins stupidly.</p><p>Aleks steps into his face. \"I forgive you for ruining my life. For making it so I was cursed alongside you. For destroying everything I held dear. For shaming me and making everyone think I hurt that woman. I forgive you for being weak and pathetic. May the gods take a small measure of pity on you. The small measure you never gave anyone else. Any of those girls.\" He grabs his arms and plants a kiss on his father's cheek.</p><p>The man's face turns bright red. \"You always were a weak pathetic little shit.\" He growls and twitches. He makes a movement toward Aleks, but Dorian is there in a flash. He grins, \"I would like to say fuck you, you asshole wanker. You never were the father you should have been to my brother there and you have never deserved a son as remarkable as he is.\" He pulls back and punches him in the face. The man's head snaps back. He comes back with ferocity, but Dorian has already winked away. The man snarls and twitches as the monster tries to get out. He looks the way they all do, when I kill them.</p><p>My palms are burning with the need.</p><p>Aleks grabs my hand and an amazing thing happens. I suck from him. I remember the way it was on the beach. The way he fed me back then. He bends down while I suck from him and kisses my cheek. His father's face breaks into a grin that\u2019s full of contempt. \"I don\u2019t believe you introduced me to your lady friend Aleks.\"</p><p>\"I never will father.\"</p><p>Marcus grumbles, \"On with it then Henry. Get your revenge.\"</p><p>Aleks squeezes harder, \"If I disappear with him, I need you to know I have loved you with all of my heart for a very long time. I have loved you everyway possible. As a girl, as a Rose, as a lover and friend.\"</p><p>My heart stops beating, I'm sure it has. I never realized that with the death of his father he could go too.</p><p>I turn to face him, squeezing his hands, \"I don\u2019t remember loving you but I know I do. I know I have.\"</p><p>He nods. We ignore the huge hands reaching for his father and the bright white light of the magic neither of us has ever seen before. We stare at each other. I hold my breath. His father screams, painfully. The room swirls suddenly, with the electrically charged air and voices, girl's voices. Tears stream down Aleks's cheeks. He grips me harder. He closes his eyes. The voices become whispers. Gratitude and kind words.</p><p>They swirl above us in a storm like a tornado. The paintings, drapes and lamps tremble with the movement. My hair is sucked up inside of it, but my eyes never leave his face. I'm terrified he will be gone and I will never have the chance to fall in love with him again.</p><p>The air becomes completely still. It stops so suddenly, I almost feel an impact from it.</p><p>Aleks's hands grip mine. He opens his eyes one at a time. The intense light, that never seemed real, is gone but the icy blue color remains. I squeeze his fingers. He smiles a crooked grin making my heart beat start again. I sigh and let him envelope me. Dorian rips him from my arms and hugs him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcus rolls his eyes, \"The women are free.\"</p><p>I glance over at Henry. He stands perfectly still. A transparent woman is before him. She kneels and offers her hand. He takes the ghostly white hand in his, \"Stand niece.\" Henry whispers.</p><p>Marcus looks confused.</p> <p>Aleks looks sick.</p><p>The girl's head lifts. She looks toward Aleks and smiles, \"I forgive you.\" She whispers.</p><p>He bows his head, \"I'm so sorry.\" His deep voice is a whisper as well.</p><p>The girl turns back to Henry, \"Let them all rest uncle.\"</p><p>Henry nods once and she is gone, but the blue ghosts that look just like Ophelia are there. They look the way she did.</p> <p>Dorian nods, \"Ophelia's body will be brought to the Necromancer when it's all worked out. Aimee is about to go there. Oliver is there already. It's being done. Be ready. You can't go near the dark witches but when the necromancer raises her, you will need to release your power upon her before she uses her dark magic.\"</p><p>They nod their heads and are gone again.</p><p>I lean in and look at Hanna. She has her eyes closed still.</p><p>Aleks sighs and looks around, \"This is what it feels like to live. The forlorn feelings that weighed me down are gone.\"</p><p>Marcus crosses his arms, \"Time to go. I'm certain you can have this conversation elsewhere.\"</p><p>Aleks laughs, \"You're such an arse Marcus.\"</p> <p>Dorian looks at me, \"Go where the doctor showed you. Oliver is there already. This lug and me are going to go guard O's body. Lorri is with Sam chasing down Jonathan and Giselle is with the wolves and Phillip and Tristan at Lydia's. We are meeting back there.\"</p><p>Aleks cups my face and turns it to his, \"Be safe.\" He looks like he's going to kiss me but he doesn\u2019t. He steps away with Dorian and then they're gone. Marcus watches me for a moment. \"You know he's only attractive because of the curse. The curse makes you love him.\"</p><p>Henry shakes his bowler hat covered head, \"Curse broken.\"</p><p>I furrow my brow, \"Broken? No more magic smell and weird aphrodisiac on his skin? No more angel irresistible weirdness?\"</p><p>The bowler hat shakes again, \"Curse broken.\"</p><p>I'm stunned, \"But I smelled. I smelled it just there. He was going to kiss me and I felt that same feeling.\" I touch my lips with my finger and wink before Marcus can mock me.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Hanna</p> <p>I watch her leave through my eyelashes and continue to pretend to be asleep. The whole thing is freaking me out. My body won't react but my brain is.</p><p>The dark haired man I am left with turns to face me. His face softens when he sees me. He walks over and scoops me up. Instantly I smell it. I smell the thing Aimee was talking about.</p><p>The man carries me down the hallway. He stops and turns at a door. He closes the door when we're inside of a room. I can't see it through my lashes but I feel the bed when he lays me down in it. It's soft with thick blankets and pillows.</p><p>His breath is over my face, driving me crazy, \"Pretending to sleep won't stop what I'm about to do to you.\"</p><p>My eyes are open and I'm scooting away from him instantly.</p><p>He chuckles, \"Oh Hanna. I've missed you.\"</p><p>I frown, \"Who are you?\"</p><p>He shrugs, \"Friend of your father's.\" His smile turns wicked, \"And I guess your mother's as well.\"</p><p>My heart skips a beat. \"You knew her?\" he looks too young to have known them well. He's not much older than I am.</p><p>He lays on his side and smiles, \"I did. How are you feeling? Still scared?\"</p><p>I nod slowly, \"I just don\u2019t understand any of this.\"</p><p>He pats the pillow beside him, \"I won't bite you. I swear.\" His eyes sparkle with delight and promises. And not the one's he is saying out loud.</p><p>I lie on the bed too, facing him but not close. Luckily the bed is massive.</p><p>\"Are you afraid of me?\"</p><p>I almost shake my head, but I nod.</p><p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"I don\u2019t know you at all. The ghosts in the other room and the people who are there one minute and gone the next. The man bowler hat killed is still dead on the carpet. The list is pretty long.\" I can't fight the smile at the end of it.</p><p>He looks disinterested in my fears, \"But me, are you afraid of me?\"</p><p>I almost nod but something in his eyes is so familiar I can't. I shake my head, \"No. I know you from somewhere.\"</p><p>He grins, \"Excellent.\" He leans toward me, \"Are you hungry?\"</p><p>I think for a second, \"Yes. I guess I am.\" I don\u2019t know what to think or say. I feel lost inside of myself.</p><p>He climbs off the bed, \"Be right back.\"</p><p>He leaves the room, which gives me a chance to look around at it all. It's huge. Dark blue walls and huge fabric curtains made the room eerie. The limited light coming in seems odd. Like Marcus is hiding in the dark. I noticed it about the front room. It's the size of a basketball court but the light is limited.</p><p>I climb off the bed and walk to the window. The glass is old, the home must be hundreds of years old.</p><p>\"I brought you some root beer and cook is making you waffles.\"</p><p>I look back and laugh, \"So do you run this as an inn or house hundreds of orphans?\"</p><p>He sighs, \"Look, we've had this conversation many a time. I know you think I'm ostentatious and live beyond my means.\"</p><p>I'm lost, \"What?\" I have to admit I think that but I never said it.</p><p>He sits on the bed after he puts the root beer on the table, \"We have met before. It was a different world maybe or just a different time and I don\u2019t want to explain it.\"</p><p>I cross my arms, \"Are you supposed to be taking some kind of meds? I have this friend who is supposed to be on some kind of antipsychotic medicine and when she feels really good on the meds, she stops taking them.\"</p><p>He laughs bitterly, \"You make me psychotic, trust me.\"</p><p>I frown.</p><p>He lies back on the bed again and the look in his eyes pulls me across the room. I sit on the bed, I can't break the stare. He has me trapped in it. I see it suddenly and whisper, \"What are you?\"</p><p>He grabs my hand and pulls me to him, \"The man who loves you very much.\"</p><p>I believe him. I don\u2019t know why. His eyes have me bewitched. He lowers his face and brushes his lips against mine. It's soft and sweet but I can sense the kiss is about to explode into something else. His lips brush mine so softly, I shiver from the gentle touches. He drags a hand up into my long hair. He reaches around the back and grabs a fist full of it. He jerks my face. I moan, loudly. I pull away from him, mouth breathing and all. My face is on fire.</p><p>I shake my head, \"That hurt.\" I don\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>His eyes flash at me seductively. He bites his lip and shakes his head slowly, \"No it didn\u2019t. I know for fact you liked it.\"</p><p>I climb of the other side of the bed slowly, as if backing away from an animal, \"This is too weird. Too weird.\" He crawls across the bed and then he's against me. My back slams into the wall across the room, I moan again. I can't stop myself. I'm moan-laughing. A sound I've never made before. He licks my neck, pressing his body against mine.</p><p>\"My sweet Hanna. I've missed you so.\" He spins me hard and fast, pressing my face into the dark wall. He lifts my hair and kisses softly along the back of my neck. My skin is shivering and going crazy. My brain is trying desperately to argue giving in to the seduction, but the pleasure is more than I ever imagined. I spin myself around and feel a growl creep out of my throat. An excited grin crosses his face. I shove him hard. He stumbles back towards the bed. I shove him again, knocking him onto the bed. He scrambles up the bedding. I crawl up after him.</p><p>My body is on auto-slut.</p><p>I couldn't stop if I wanted to.</p><p>I pull my shirt off and crawl up to his face. He sits up and I wrap my legs around him. We are grabbing and pulling at each other's clothing. I shove him back and pull his shirt up over his face. He is blinded by it, with only his mouth sticking out. I bend and press my bare chest against his and suck his bottom lip hard, biting into it. I sit up and drag my nails down his body, marking him. He inhales sharply. My body is convulsing and pulsating and I can't get control of my breathing or get enough of him. I rip the pants from him. He throws me on my back and kisses my stomach. He pulls my pants off.</p><p>There isn\u2019t any foreplay. Neither of us have the patience. I want him inside of me. He grabs his erection and kneels between my thighs. I'm panting, waiting. The terror that should be there isn't. He rubs himself against my opening and then in a giant thrust, he's inside of me. I scream, expecting pain but there isn\u2019t any. That doesn\u2019t change the fact it isn\u2019t the romantic moment I had planned for my virginity. He screams out after about a minute. He's pumping hard and crying out.</p><p>\"Hanna, you're a virgin.\" His voice is weak. I have no idea what he's talking about, but I'm lost in the heavy weight of the disappointment. My body doesn\u2019t release the way I need it to. He's just gone completely rigid and collapsed onto my stomach.</p><p>He looks up at me, obviously embarrassed.</p><p>I frown, \"What was that?\" I ask. I don\u2019t know a lot about sex but I know it should be better than that. \"All that build up, for that?\"</p><p>He swallows and breathes hard, \"You forgot to mention you were a virgin. That wasn\u2019t how I planned for things to go either.\"</p><p>I tilt my head, \"I think I need a shower and then I think you owe me something.\"</p><p>He laughs and climbs off of me, \"Yes. Right. Well, of course I do. I dare say I might die from the horrors you put me through just now. I wasn\u2019t prepared for that.\"</p><p>I laugh and he laughs and I can't help but feel completely comfortable, considering the circumstances. His blushed cheeks and horrified look, are making it much better than an orgasm would have done.</p><p>I wrap myself in a sheet from the bed and drag it down the hall.</p><p>\"So what happened with that Jimmy Stratton fellow?\" He asks leading me down the hall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gasp, \"How do you know that name?\"</p><p>He arches an eyebrow, \"Last time we did that for the first time you weren\u2019t a virgin. It was intense enough without it being the blooming first time.\"</p><p>\"What time? We've never done that before obviously.\"</p> <p>\"Well, it was the same time as this. It was now, but only in a different version of now. Like an alternate world where we did it and you weren\u2019t a virgin.\"</p><p>My brain hurts. I put a hand up and shuffle along the cold floor, \"Dude. It's cool. You sucked. We don\u2019t need to make excuses for it.\"</p><p>He sniffs, \"Well I was stupendous the other time in the other world.\" I roll my eyes and grip the sheet. The effects of him and the weird hunger I had are wearing off. Sanity makes an attempt at creeping back into my mind. My fingers are numb from the clenching of the sheet. He opens the door to a massive bathroom. It's marble and stunning. He closes the door behind himself. Closing us in there together.</p><p>My face, that\u2019s already bright crimson, heats up more. \"What are you doing?\"</p><p>He grins, \"I enjoy washing you.\" A devious smile crosses his lips, \"You enjoy it also.\"</p> <p>I shake my head and grip the towel. \"What? No. Out.\" I point at the door. He chuckles and walks, still completely naked and slightly hard, to the shower and turns it on. The shower is a huge walk-in. He holds his hand under the stream of water, checking the temperature. I can't help but let my eyes wander down him. His ass is incredible. I have the strangest urge to bite it.</p><p>Something is horribly wrong with me.</p><p>He reaches back and grabs my hand, dragging me into the shower. He rips the sheets from my hands and pulls me into him. He grins, \"No need to get shy now Hanna.\"</p><p>I cover my breasts and lower my face from his. \"I'm not shy. I'm just not, whatever happened in that room, that\u2019s not me. I'm eighteen years old and still a virgin. I don\u2019t do that. You did something to me. Those eyes and the blonde, Aimee and the ghost people. Bowler hat.\" My voice fades with the last few words.</p><p>\"You aren\u2019t making sense.\"</p><p>I shake my head against his chest. \"It's the frightening experiences and my father making me come here and the overwhelming ness of it all. It\u2019s made me act crazy. And slutty.\"</p> <p>\"That's not a word. Actually, I don't believe slutty is either.\"</p><p>I laugh, \"This was a mistake. A fun one but a mistake nonetheless.\"</p><p>He grabs my shoulders and pulls me back, \"Hanna, I love you. I have for years, several times, whatever the bloody hell Ari does. I honestly am not going to try to explain that again. I have loved you through it all. You make me the man I want to be.\"</p><p>I frown and push on his chest, \"Whoa. Isn't the virgin supposed to get all needy and clingy? Stage four virgin clinger?\"</p><p>He looks exasperated, \"What?\"</p><p>I pull out of his grip, \"You know Wedding Crashers? Dude, I get that you had a wicked orgasm and that\u2019s cool for you. You got the V-card. Congrats. But I sort of saw this as one of those 'it was nice to meet you' encounters. You don\u2019t have to like call or anything. I'm cool with it. I can just leave when I shower up. I have friends. They'll come and get me. It's cool.\" I'm still clutching my hands to my chest. My face is on fire.</p><p>His face drops, \"Was any of that English? You did graduate high school this time? Ari made you stupid. Dear god.\"</p><p>\"Who? What? I gradded. Why are you being mean to me? You're the one who finished back there.\"</p> <p>His face is stoic. \"Right. Excellent. I'll just wait outside of the bathroom for you to finish.\" He runs his hands through his dark thick hair and over his body, then steps out of the shower. He seems annoyed. I turn my back to him.</p><p>My face is flushed and my stomach feels weird. I swear I can still smell him when he leaves the bathroom.</p><p>Something is wrong with me.</p><p>Who is Ari?</p><p>A grin crosses my lips. I lost my virginity to the sexiest man I have ever seen.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Aimee</p><p>The air is hot and sticky. It feels like it weighs a ton.</p><p>\"Ready?\"</p><p>I glance at Oliver and nod.</p><p>He takes my hand in his and pulls me through the bayou forest.</p><p>\"Where are we?\"</p><p>\"Blackwater Bayou. It's in Louisiana. Just outside of Baton Rouge.\" He is calm and quiet. I don\u2019t think he will be the same as he was until he finds the necromancer. Even then I'm worried.</p><p>His warm hand wrapped around mine is the only comfort I have. The bayou stinks with blood and magic and stale air.</p><p>He pulls me to a cabin. It's a shack with a yard littered with old jawbones and old logs in weird shapes and the skinned hides of dead animals. The grass isn't grass but weeds and sticks with what looks like mini mounds of dirt. I grip his hand tighter.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what a necromancer does, beyond the obvious translation.</p><p>\"You know I had no choice right?\" I ask.</p><p>He looks back, \"It's all my fault Aimee. Not yours. She pulled the darkness from me. She pulled Henry and Marcus's memory wipe. She pulled it all. I'm free and clear again. Clean slate. Like a newborn and she is dead because of it.\"</p><p>The guilt on his face hurts my heart. Mostly because he is fallen and they make me feel funny.</p><p>\"She died saving you.\"</p><p>He winces, \"If it ever happens to you, let me know if it makes you feel any better to be the one who's still alive.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry.\"</p><p>He squeezes, \"I know. I know you wouldn\u2019t have hurt her if you didn\u2019t have to.\" He looks at me but puts a hand up to the old wooden door and knocks.</p><p>The door creaks open. I nervous giggle. \"Holy snap, it's the Blair Witch Project.\"</p><p>He pulls me inside the old cabin. The smells hit instantly. I almost gag, but hold my nose.</p><p>A pair of white eyes greets us from the darkest far corner. I jump when I see them. Her face is dark like the wood on the walls and the shadow she sits in, but her eyes are bright and white. Like Aleks's did, they glow like a light shines out of them.</p><p>\"You know you no welcome. You know he no want me to help.\" Her accent is thick and Cajun. Her white eyes look as if they don\u2019t see just us, like they see the things I can't. Which is saying a lot since I can see the dead. Sometimes.</p><p>He drops to his knees, \"I need you momma Holt. I need your aid.\"</p><p>She is peeling something, a vegetable or a root of sorts. Maybe. Maybe it's the arm of the last person who was here. I cringe. She points her knife, \"Momma Holt don\u2019t eat no people. Don\u2019t need skins from no people.\"</p><p>Oliver looks back at me and mutters, \"Try not to think. Her kind are always readers. Among other things.\"</p><p>I blank my mind and think about science and Blake and how much I miss him.</p><p>\"Momma Holt don\u2019t help, no you. No demons in my house.\" She mutters it.</p><p>He puts a hand forward, \"I am pure. No demon.\"</p><p>She stabs the blade into his hand, making him wince in pain. She pulls it out and tastes the blood and spits it in the pot next to her, \"That be good, pure and good. Drip some in the pot demon.\"</p><p>He stands and holds his closed fist over her big black cooking pot I can't help but think is a cauldron.</p><p>\"Momma Holt ain't no bad juju conjurer, demon.\"</p><p>Oliver gives me a look.</p><p>\"I meant no offense Momma Holt.\" I whisper. She terrifies me. I don\u2019t think I can kill her. I blank my mind quickly as she chuckles and peels the thing in her hands.</p><p>\"You need da witch back?\"</p><p>Oliver nods once.</p><p>\"You trade Momma Holt.\"</p><p>Oliver shivers, \"What would you like?\"</p><p>She glances at me, \"Dem souls. Dem souls she gone and ate.\"</p><p>Oliver looks back at me. He closes his eyes. \"Done.\"</p><p>I panic inside, quietly. I don\u2019t know what that means but I can guess it's bad. Oliver looks desperate and his hands are clenched together. Momma Holt even looks surprised at his agreeing.</p><p>When he opens his eyes he looks at me long and hard and then whispers, \"I'm sorry Aimee.\"</p><p>I'm about to die. I understand. She's going to take everything from me. She is the thing that can kill me.</p><p>Fear and terror fill me.</p><p>Oliver looks back at Momma Holt, \"You raise the witch first.\"</p><p>She spits on her hand and puts it out to him. Oliver spits on his hand and presses it into hers. They steam and sizzling.</p><p>She nods, \"We raise dat witch den.\"</p><p>Oliver pulls his cell and sends a text. A second later a grin crosses the old woman's face. She sniffs the air and mumbles to herself. My insides are churning and twisting. I want to run and wink and free myself but I can't. We need O. I thought we needed me too, but I realize Dorian can just make another me. I'm replaceable.</p><p>A knock at the door startles me.</p><p>I jump and look back at the old wooden door as it opens. Dorian walks in with Aleks behind him holding Ophelia's limp body.</p><p>Dorian stops mid step and looks at Oliver. \"What have you done?\"</p><p>Oliver shakes his head, \"It was her demand. Lorri said whatever it took to get her back.\"</p><p>Dorian steps into his face and shouts, \"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?\"</p><p>Momma Holt grabs her walking stick and slams it to the hard wooden floorboards. Her white eyes are gone. Replacing them are dark crimson eyes.</p><p>Dorian bows his head, \"Forgive me Momma Holt.\" He says it through a clenched jaw.</p><p>Momma Holt walks to the table, \"You put da witch on da tableau.\"</p><p>Aleks lays her down on the wooden table amongst the jars and herbs.</p><p>Momma Holt starts mixing and chanting.</p><p>I look away. I should want to watch. I should want to see it, the greatest thing I will ever see, a necromancer raising the dead. A real act of god. But I don\u2019t. I'm frozen.</p><p>I let silent tears stream down my cheeks and stare at the wall, away from everyone else. Knowing I'm about to die, horribly, is much worse than just dying. I'm like a pig. The memory of my father and I watching the show about how pigs can smell the day they're going to die, is rolling through my mind like a dense fog. It eats up all the self-pity and sadness. My father and mother and sister are there with me. Inside of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aleks grabs my hand and pulls me into him, \"What's going on?\" He whispers.</p><p>I shake my head. I know he'll take me away. I can't let him. \"Nothing. She just is asking a lot for payment.\"</p><p>\"What is the payment, Aimee?\" His voice is rough. I wonder if he's scared like I am, even though he doesn\u2019t know the things I do. He doesn\u2019t know what the payment is.</p> <p>I look back at Momma Holt. Where her eyes are pressed shut, there a white light is fighting to break through her sealed lids. She shakes and chants softly.</p><p>She throws her arms into the air and screams and then slams them down on Ophelia's limp body. Ophelia shoots up screaming. Oliver grabs her instantly and is gone.</p><p>\"Where is he going?\" I ask panicked.</p><p>Dorian refuses to look at me. I can see it. He knows. \"She's being taken to a cell she can't escape from. A place where the sisters will find her and release their magic to her.\" His words are dead and they break my heart. He won't look. He can't. I glance at Aleks. He kisses my head.</p><p>\"Brother, go help him. He will need the help. I'll stay here and help cover the bill.\"</p> <p>Aleks grabs me and looks at me intensely, \"Hurry home. We need to talk.\"</p><p>I swallow hard and nod. I'm fighting the tears threatening me and taking my voice.</p><p>Aleks is gone, making the air in the cabin swirl with his warmth and her stink.</p><p>\"Momma Holt, I have a better deal for you.\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"No. You no trick Momma Holt demon.\" She holds out her hand that shows where she spit into her old leathered brown palm. Where the burns are still.</p><p>He offers his hand to her, \"I have taken more than her. I have more to give. She is new. Few souls.\"</p> <p>Momma Holt grabs his hand and licks it. She tastes and spit on the floor nodding and muttering, \"You go home demon.\"</p><p>My eyes widen. \"No. Dorian, don\u2019t do this.\" I don\u2019t know why but the idea of him dying is worse than anything I can imagine. \"No.\" The tears win over. My heart is breaking.</p><p>He looks back at me, \"I'm glad you don\u2019t remember the way I acted towards you. I'm glad this is the way you remember me. I just wish it could have been different. If I ever get the chance I will show you how much Aimee. How much this cost me.\"</p><p>\"Why were you such an ass? Everyone tells me I hated you. I feel my disgust for you. It's old. Please tell me why?\" I ask through the tears and sobs.</p><p>He shakes his head, \"Because I couldn\u2019t have you. I couldn\u2019t do that to him. He is the only real brother I've ever had. He saw you first.\" His voice breaks and I heave slightly.</p><p>He grabs my face and presses his lips against mine. The salt from the tears makes its way into my mouth.</p><p>Our kiss tightens as I hear the stabs of the knife into his hand. I open one eye to see her put his black bloody hand up to her mouth. She sucks and pulls.</p><p>\"I love you forever.\" He whispers into my mouth and then he jerks away from me and looks up at the ceiling. His jaw tightens, as his eyes turn white like hers had been. He drops to the floor and slowly becomes nothing more than a pile of black feathers. There is one white feather sitting at the top of the pile.</p> <p>\"His love for you. You take dat one. He leave it for you.\" She points at the white feather. I drop to my knees. My heart is broken. \"I never knew.\" I whisper. With trembling hands I pick the single white feather from the pile. I hold it to my chest and rock back and forth.</p><p>Momma Holt shuffles towards me. She places her hands on my head and slowly, images of me fill my own mind. My smile, my eyes glowing molten steel, my laugh, me running and fighting, me sitting reading a book in the sunlight. There are more than I can count and I remember almost none of them. The final image is me, lying in the forest, sleeping on a bed of moss. His hand comes into sight and brushes my hair from my face. I recognize the ring and his leather jacket. His hand lingers as he brushes his thumb across my lips.</p><p>\"How he see you.\" She pulls back her hands but the memories stay rolling around in my mind. I have no words.</p><p>I want to reach in and grab every feather. I want to hold them to me tightly. \"I never knew.\" I cry out, shaking.</p><p>I wink and I'm in the yard at Lydia's, on my knees in a sobbing ball.</p><p>I'm grabbed and held.</p><p>\"What happened? Where is he? WHERE IS HE AIMEE?\" Lorri rips me from the arms encircling me. She shakes me. Her face changes slightly.</p><p>I shake. I have no answers. I hold up the single white feather. She drops me to the ground. Tears fly from her eyes.</p><p>She screams, looking up at the sky and then shakes with each sob and heave. She shakes her head, \"No. No. Why would he do it?\"</p><p>Oliver is there, beside her, holding her. His eyes meet mine and I know how he felt. I don\u2019t feel better with Dorian saving me. I would trade places in a heartbeat. I am unworthy of the sacrifice that was made. Only he knows the pain I'm in.</p><p>I clutch the feather.</p><p>Lorri spins looking at me with hatred, \"You never even loved him back. You never even cared for him.\"</p><p>Sam stands in front of me, \"You know as well as I do, he did it the way he wanted to. He never would have seen her dead. How was she to know how he felt?\"</p><p>Aleks walks out of the house. I feel sick when I see his face. He looks around, \"Where's Dorian?\"</p><p>Lorri cries harder, angrier. She's gone.</p><p>Sam looks at Aleks and shakes his head, \"He didn\u2019t make it.\"</p><p>Aleks stops, \"He's fallen, he can't die. Not unless Aimee...\" He looks at me accusingly.</p><p>Sam steps towards him, \"No. She didn\u2019t.\"</p><p>Oliver grabs his arm, \"This is my fault. I made the deal trading her life for O's. Dorian saved Aimee and took her place.\"</p><p>Aleks looks confused, \"Why? Oliver, why would you make that deal? Why would trade my girl for yours?\"</p><p>\"Aleks, it wasn\u2019t my girl for yours. It was the one witch we need for the death dealer who could be replaced.\"</p><p>Aleks grabs his shirt and lifts him off the ground. His face and arms are trembling. \"HE LOVED HER. HE WOULD SAVE HER!\"</p><p>Oliver looks savage, \"YOU LOVE HER TOO! YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR HER!\"</p><p>Aleks drops him and looks back at me. Tears line his cheeks but his look doesn\u2019t soften. I don\u2019t blame him. They have been together for hundreds of years. He looks like he doesn\u2019t know how to react.</p><p>I shake my head, \"I never knew.\"</p><p>He nods, disconsolately, \"I know.\"</p><p>Sam smiles softly, \"No one knew, Aimes. He never told anyone. We all just guessed.\"</p><p>Aleks's face reveals the truth of it. He knew. He knew all along. He puts a hand up, \"I can't do this right now.\" And he's gone too.</p><p>Oliver looks at me, \"I'm sorry. It wasn\u2019t personal.\"</p><p>Sam wraps himself around me again, \"Fuck off Oliver.\" He mutters.</p><p>\"Did you get Ari back?\" I ask softly.</p><p>\"No. Lost the trail.\" He leans into my hair and sniffs it, \"What's that smell?\"</p><p>\"Old lady. We went to a cabin.\" I can't say anything else. Not without dying inside. I never want to remember the cabin again.</p><p>\"No, it smells like something else.\"</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Hanna</p><p>I sit at the table and eat and can't help but feel like beauty and the beast. He hasn\u2019t touched me again but he's holding me hostage. I am not allowed outside or any phone calls.</p><p>\"I'm bored.\" I mutter.</p><p>He looks angry. He's looked angry all day. Something has happened and he's been a complete savage. He smashed some things and screamed his face off into the phone.</p><p>\"Try painting something or try to learn to play on the instruments in the music room.\"</p><p>I frown, \"Marcus, you do know it's not the renaissance right?\"</p><p>He laughs bitterly. He always laughs bitterly.</p><p>He walks to my side of the table and grabs my hand. He drags me down the hall. The smell of him in the air and the way he makes my heart flutter, is extreme. He drags me to the room I sleep in and closes the door. He undoes the button on his dress shirt, leaving it open to his white undershirt.</p><p>I step back and try to ignore the heat being stirred up in my body. \"What are you doing?\" I ask nervously.</p><p>\"I owe you, you're bored and I need to feel something. I need you.\" His voice cracks slightly.</p><p>I back up, not towards the bed. \"I don\u2019t want to do this again. I don\u2019t even know you. Jimmy and I never really broke up. So, this is wrong.\"</p><p>He rolls his eyes and the air around me is stirred up. I feel his warmth against the back of me. I close my eyes and sigh when his warm lips press against my spine. He rubs himself into the back of me. He nudges me toward the bed with kisses and small shoves. I let him.</p><p>I let him slowly take my clothes off, with precision and intimacy that makes my skin lift and my body tremble. I stand there, nervously waiting for him to touch me. Instead his tongue drags up the back of my thigh. He plants a kiss on my butt cheek and continues up my back with licks and kisses. He turns me around and takes my nipple into his mouth. I cry out. My body is buzzing with the torture he's putting me through.</p><p>He pushes me back onto the bed. I fall into the thick down blankets. His mouth is instantly between my thighs, kissing high up. He licks once between my lips. I moan into the blankets. Pleasure is everywhere as his finger enters me. His tongue flicks and licks as his finger's lazily thrust in and out. I'm being driven out of my mind. I'm clutching the blankets. He speeds up, both his finger and tongue simultaneously. I can't sit still. I'm writhing in pleasure.</p><p>\"That\u2019s my girl. Let it go Hanna.\" He kisses the side of my thigh and slides a second finger inside of me. He moves expertly, like he's done it before. I lose the control I didn\u2019t know I was holding onto. My whole body explodes in a series of climaxes.</p><p>My screams of ecstasy are loud. I finish and open my eyes slowly. Everything in the world has more color. I wet my lips and look up at him standing proudly over my parted thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"What. Was. That?\" My entire body is blushing.</p><p>He grins and crawls between my legs smugly. \"It's just the start.\"</p><p>Aimee</p> <p>His face is killing me, \"You never told me she was with us again.\" His eyes are watching me accusingly.</p><p>I don\u2019t have an excuse. I look down and mumble, \"I didn\u2019t realize. I mean, she's not really. She's not with us.\"</p><p>\"YOU TRADED HER TO MARCUS?\" His furious spittle lands on my arms.</p><p>I look up at him as he leaves. He's gone. I'm alone in the kitchen holding my mug of apple cider Annabelle made me. \"It wasn\u2019t my idea.\" I mutter and softly stroke my white feather.</p><p>Lorri comes into the kitchen with Lydia, \"We need you. Just in case.\"</p> <p>I tuck the feather in my bra again. Over my heart.</p><p>I stand and touch Lorri's hand. Instantly we are in a dark cold place. The dank air is ripe with something bad. Something dark and sinister.</p><p>\"Stay beside me.\" Lorri whispers harshly.</p><p>\"I'm sorry about Dorian.\" I whisper back.</p><p>She looks back at me like I am nothing more than an insect, \"You should be.\" Her words are cold and cut right through me.</p><p>We walk through the dark until we come to a dimly lit room. My whole body buzzes when we enter. I tremble and twitch.</p> <p>Ophelia is tied to the wall. Her eyes are swirls of gold and black. Her hair moves as if there is a breeze but the air is still. She smiles at me, \"Your sorrow is exquisite.\"</p><p>I frown, \"What?\"</p><p>\"Your broken heart. I can taste it in the air.\" Her voice is freaky.</p><p>\"Dude we need an old priest and a young priest.\" I lean into Lydia, who scowls at me, \"Focus.\"</p><p>Ophelia's smile is creepy and weird. She looks disturbed.</p><p>Lorri looks at her watch. She always looks at it.</p><p>Phillip and Trist flash into the room. Phillip smiles politely, but Trist rushes his sister.</p><p>\"O, oh my god. You look haggard.\" He looks worried.</p> <p>She laughs, \"Give me a kiss brother.\"</p><p>He almost steps into her but then steps back and points, \"What is that?\"</p><p>\"That is your sister on drugs.\" I mutter.</p><p>He looks at me harshly, \"You did this!\"</p><p>Lorri grabs his arm and pulls him back, \"No, she didn\u2019t. O did this to herself. She saved Oliver's soul.\"</p><p>Tristan looks horrified, \"She sucked the darkness from him?\"</p><p>Lydia nods, \"Yes. Now we have almost no time left to get your father before time is up. Now let's do this. Call the sisters.\"</p><p>Phillip looks at Tristan and nods.</p><p>Tristan closes his eyes and whispers. The blue balls of light flit into the rooms as one and then separate slowly, hovering in the air.</p><p>'Death dealer, you must suck from her as we fill her up. Take her poison.\"</p><p>I frown, \"Me?\"</p><p>Lorri sighs, \"Of course you.\"</p><p>\"Won't she die if I suck from her?\"</p><p>Lorri turns her face sharply, \"No, you idiot. They're replacing her soul. You take the damaged old one and they give her the new one that\u2019s combined with their goodness.\"</p><p>\"So Ophelia will no longer be O, she'll be the combined effort of these other girls?\"</p><p>Lorri snarls at me. I put my hands up defensively, \"I'm just checking. I don\u2019t think this is very fair.\"</p><p>\"It's not, but since she became evil it's our only chance. It's suck and blow time.\" She grabs my arm and shoves me at Ophelia. I look into her golden fiery eyes and try desperately to see something of the girl who was my friend.</p><p>Oliver flashes into the room with Giselle. His eyes are puffy. I'm certain we look the same. I'm terrified he knows what's about to happen.</p><p>\"There might be another way.\"</p><p>Lorri shakes her head, \"We can't chance it. Not once she has the power.\" She shoves me again. I stumble forward and look back growling. Lorri's growl is scarier, so I look back at O.</p><p>Giselle steps forward, \"Don't do it Aimes.\"</p><p>\"I don\u2019t have any choice.\"</p><p>Oliver's voice lowers, \"Don't touch her. We might find another way.\"</p><p>I reach my hand out and take a deep breath. The blue balls of light hover above Ophelia, who starts laughing. It sounds panicked and sharp. She looks at Oliver and smirks, \"I loved you baby.\"</p><p>He lunges forward, but Lorri grabs him midair and then they're both gone.</p><p>I grab her arm and release the hold I have over myself. As the first blue light jumps into her mouth, she screams toward the ceiling. A burst of darkness, sweet incense tasting darkness, fills me up. The second light floats in and I grab on with my other hand. It's too much. I'm filling up and screaming in sync with her. Giselle grabs my face and plants her lips on mine and pulls from me. We scream inside each other's mouths in unison for second and then it stops. I drop to the hard stone floor. Pools of black blood gather under my hands. I'm panting and twitching still. Giselle is next to me. She's a funny color, ashen. I glance over, \"Thanks.\"</p><p>She gags a little, \"You taste bad.\" She wipes my black blood from her lips.</p><p>I nod, \"Thanks.\"</p><p>She laughs weakly and glances up at O. I'm too scared to look.</p><p>Oliver and Lorri flash in and out of the room for a minute. Both punching and wrestling with each other.</p><p>Lydia grabs my arm and helps me up. Her touch soothes me instantly. \"Are you alright my dear?\"</p><p>I nod and look at O. She blinks a few times and speaks with the voices of all of them, \"It worked.\"</p><p>My stomach tightens, \"Is she in there too?\"</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer for a moment and then frowns, \"She isn\u2019t.\"</p><p>Tristan screams. Phillip cries but holds back his man. The room is in tears. Oliver flashes in free of Lorri. He grabs both of Ophelia's hand. He looks deeply into her eyes and looks back at me. My gaze drops. He looks at Lydia and Giselle but none of us can hold his accusing gaze.</p><p>Lydia's voice breaks, \"Tristan it's your turn.\"</p><p>Giselle snaps, \"Give him a minute for god's sake.\"</p><p>Tristan is being help up completely by Phillip. Lydia touches his face. A smile crosses his lips. He looks up and laughs, \"Thank you.\"</p><p>I know she has given him back all of his memories. Ophelia puts a hand out. Tristan takes it. He grips and shakes his head, \"I don\u2019t think I can do this.\"</p><p>It's too late. The sisters use their magic to pull. His body instantly vibrates. His feet lift off the ground. They pull back and he drops. Phillip helps him stand on shaky legs.</p><p>Ophelia rubs her hands together. \"We are ready.\"</p><p>\"Where is she?\" Oliver asks.</p><p>\"Heaven.\" Lydia's voice is almost a whisper.</p><p>Oliver looks at me. I know what he's about to ask but I can't. We might need him. Lorri flashes into the room, \"Done?\"</p><p>Ophelia nods. Her mannerisms are creepy and mechanical. Lorri takes her hand and flashes back out. \"I hate how she is so heartless sometimes.\" The words leave my mouth before I can check them.</p><p>Oliver dives at me and winks. We are in a room with a bed and a bucket. It looks like a prison cell.</p><p>I'm not afraid of him but I can't shake the memory of him ripping my clothes off.</p><p>\"Do it.\"</p><p>\"Where are we?\" I ask.</p><p>He puts a hand out, \"Do it. Do it now while I'm pure and clean and I can go to her again. I'll feed Aimee. I'll kill again. Then I can never get back to where she is. The fallen were never allowed back but she saved me.\" His eyes are filled with desperation.</p><p>I take his hand in mine. The idea of eating again makes me gag almost. I close my eyes and let it loose.</p><p>\"I'm sorry Oliver.\" I whisper.</p><p>I suck until there is nothing left. He drops to the floor becoming nothing but a pile of black feathers. There is no white one. I know he took it with him.</p><p>My heart can't break anymore than it has. I'm numb and frozen. Sam thinks I've betrayed him. O and Oliver are gone. Dorian is gone. Aleks hates me. Lorri hates me, which really isn\u2019t any different than any other day of the week. Tristan is non magical now.</p><p>\"There you are.\"</p><p>I spin in the cell to see Phillip. I frown, \"Hi.\" The timeline flashes into my mind. Oliver was his father. I open my mouth but he shakes his head, \"He told me already. He warned me well in advance. He was a great father until about six months ago. Then he was washed and became a total douche.\"</p><p>I frown, \"Washed?\"</p><p>He sighs and nods, \"Yeah. He was madly in love with O and ready to go and get her and blah blah blah. He was always there for Trist and I and then six months ago, boom. Arse.\"</p><p>I look down at the floor. \"What happened six months ago?\"</p><p>\"Well, I just told you that part. Aimes, you're super bad at listening.\"</p><p>I look up, \"What? No. I'm talking to myself. Thinking aloud.\" I start to pace. Nothing sticks out in my mind. I pause and look at him, \"You called me Aimes.\"</p><p>He nods, \"Yeah. We used to be friends, you and I. Lydia just gave me back my memories too. I had forgotten how much I liked you.\"</p><p>\"Thanks.\"</p><p>\"So, I followed you here because I need a favor.\"</p><p>I look at him and frown, \"What?\"</p><p>He looks conflicted. I honestly have a moment where I'm terrified that he's going to reveal his bad guy status. It would make sense. Someone has clearly betrayed us. Someone other that Daniel, who we have kept in check. Or so we thought.</p><p>\"I was hoping to get a place in the South of France, where he and I could live out the rest of our lives and I want to surprise him. When I text you, could you wink him there?\"</p><p>I grin. I love the anxious tone in his voice.</p><p>\"I know you're super busy and obviously this is bad timing, but he's got no magic and he's all alone. If I were to fight with you all, he would be defenseless.\"</p><p>\"Of course. I'd be happy to do something fun for a change. Drastic change.\"</p><p>His face relaxes, \"Thanks so much.\" He frowns, \"I'm sorry about Dorian and Shane. I know you liked them both a lot.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Shane?\"</p><p>\"He's evil. Him and Marcus are bad now. Very bad. You must have known. They\u2019ve been helping my dad and Jonathan with their blood bag places.\"</p><p>My stomach sinks, \"What? No. You must be mistaken.\"</p> <p>He shakes his head, \"No. I saw it. I'm pretty positive Marcus is the one who wiped my dad and made him sinister like them. More winking angels to transport blood whores. Anyway. I'm sorry.\"</p><p>My mouth is dry. The past six months make sense. So much makes sense. Marcus has barely tried to get Hanna. I gasp, \"Hanna.\" I grab Phillip's hand and wink us to the castle. We're outside one of the rooms.</p><p>I hear a noise and look back at Phillip, \"They having sex?\" I whisper.</p><p>He nods, \"I think that\u2019s exactly what's going on in there.\" He smiles. I don\u2019t think he realizes any of what is about to happen.</p><p>I am about to shake my head and explain how we have to rescue Hanna and fight Marcus, but I catch a smell. It flashes a memory of tutoring Shane and snuggling into him. It's the smell of laundry soap and fresh ocean air mixed with deodorant. I kick the door down. It's the room Hanna always sleeps in. She's on the floor. He's straddled her. He looks up and hisses at me.</p> <p>\"Go get Giselle. Meet at Lydia's.\" I shout and dive at Shane. I wink when I'm touching them both. We land on the street outside the house. Outside the guards. I kick him in the chest and wink Hanna to the front lawn, within the guards. I leave her in a heap and run at Shane. He squares off.</p><p>I point, \"You've been smuggling girls.\"</p><p>He scoffs, \"Sheep. Sluts and sheep.\"</p><p>My face contorts. I leap at him. I don\u2019t cheat. I don\u2019t suck or wink. I punch good and hard. He rolls us and somehow ends up on my back. He spreads my legs and rubs himself against me, \"You have something I've always wanted, Aimes.\"</p><p>I wink and am on top of him. I grip his throat in my arms. He pushes up hard and we leap high into the air. He grabs my arm and pulls me under him. I wink as we land and thump him into the ground.</p><p>Giselle is running on my direction, \"SUCK HIM!\" I shout.</p> <p>She leaps and plants a kiss on his lips, weakening him. Her kind of poison is instant.</p><p>\"Don\u2019t kill him.\" I say breathlessly.</p><p>I wink back to Hanna when Giselle has Shane unconscious. She is bleeding out. Her eyes widen when she sees me.</p><p>Lydia comes running out the door.</p><p>I point at Hanna, \"Give her back her memories.\"</p><p>Lydia doesn\u2019t even get onto the ground when the grip, I never even noticed on my shirt, is gone. Hanna's eyes are blank.</p><p>\"Fuck.\" Lydia whispers. I have never actually heard her swear.</p><p>Sam comes running through the door. His face instantly drops, \"Hanna.\" He whispers.</p> <p>Lydia jumps up and grabs him, \"She's going to come back any second. We need someone with incredible strength. Get Lorri.\"</p><p>Sam is panting and convulsing.</p><p>Giselle is crying and dragging Shane's semi conscious body, to the edge of the guards. \"Where should I put him?\" He was her friend. \"Why did I do this to him Aimes? It's Shane. Aimee?\" her voice is panicked.</p><p>Lorri flashes to us just as I press send on my text. She looks at Hanna and sighs. \"Worst day in a thousand years. I swear to god.\" She turns to see Giselle, holding Shane, sobbing. Lorri looks at me, like I am to blame. \"Excellent job Aimee. This really is the shit icing on the fuck up cake.\"</p><p>I point back at Shane, \"He's a traitor. Him and Mar...\"</p><p>A man's scream cut's me off, \"LORRI\" I don\u2019t get to finish saying his name and he's there. Marcus is right outside the guards. Giselle drops Shane and runs across the guards. I wink to her and put myself between them and her.</p><p>Shane lies still on the ground, but Marcus is fuming mad and pacing the line of the guards.</p><p>\"You give her back. We made a deal.\" He speaks through his teeth.</p><p>I whisper, \"Traitors. They're traitors.\"</p><p>Lorri ignores me and stomps across the grass in her big boots, \"Fuck you and your deal.\" She looks at me expectantly.</p><p>I jump and blurt out as much as I can, \"He and Shane have been helping Jonathan with the blood bags and blood drugging. He's the one who double-crossed us on the brothel with Ari. Shane knew we were going there. I told him in the alley when we thought they would take O. He was pretending to try to win me back again. Marcus is the one who wiped Oliver and made him evil.\"</p><p>Lorri's face trembles with anger, \"You killed Dorian with your actions. Dorian.\" Her words are short and sharp. He winces but still forces a smile across his lips in the end.</p><p>\"Lorri, it was a bit of fun. You know better than anyone how I feel about the sheep. You know how Dorian felt.\"</p><p>\"I DON\u2019T GIVE A GOOD GOD DAMNED ABOUT THAT! YOU KILLED DORIAN WITH YOUR ACTIONS!\" Her spit flies from her mouth. She is frothing.</p><p>Something ripples under her skin. Something scary. I look back at Lydia. She nods her head towards the house. I take a step back from Lorri and Marcus.</p><p>Marcus points, \"Give her to me.\"</p><p>\"NO.\"</p><p>\"Give her over or I will go home and get Henry and he will BLOW YOUR MAGIC HOUSE DOWN!\"</p><p>I take a step back.</p><p>Marcus's eyes land on me, \"You little bitch. I saved Shane for you. This is how you repay me? You steal the one thing that soothes my heart and heals me and makes me almost human again?\"</p><p>I lower my gaze.</p><p>Lorri shakes her head, \"She didn\u2019t make you double cross us and work me and Jonathan against each other. You always were just out for yourself. All along you've been the same selfish little prick you were when Ethan went bat shit crazy.\"</p><p>A loud rumbling fills the moment of silence between the bickering.</p><p>Marcus's eye gleam as a wicked smile crosses his lips.</p><p>Lorri's head drops as a sigh leaves her lips. I close my eyes. The rumble turns into a groan and then a moan and then a gasp. I turn my head and look back. Hanna looks like she is having a seizure on the ground. She is trembling and twitching and vibrating.</p><p>I bite my lip and glance at Lydia again. Terror crosses her face.</p><p>\"Ophelia.\" I say quietly.</p><p>Sam vanishes from where he was standing.</p><p>\"She'll cross the guards, there is nothing you can do about it Lorri. She'll cross and destroy shit and none of us is strong enough to stop her when she does.\" His voice is filled with humor and joy. He knows Hanna will need him now.</p><p>A grin crosses my lips, \"I know something you don\u2019t.\" I smirk and wink home. Well, to my hometown.</p><p>I wink into his bedroom by mistake.</p><p>\"Aimee, what the fu..? How did you do that?\"</p><p>Alise screams.</p><p>I grab him off my sister with one hand and grab his bathrobe off the floor with the other. I wink us both to where I am praying to god Aleks is. The place he talks about.</p><p>He is. The muted sunlight and the fresh mountain air are majestic. I take a deep breath and smile. I look over at Blake, who is heaving spaghetti all over the rocks. I grimace and walk away. Quickly.</p><p>\"Hey.\" I say it softly. I want to shout it and tell him to hurry the frig up, but I can't. He's broken and it's my fault. His red-rimmed eyes look brutal.</p><p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>I look down and nudge a small stone with my boot, \"I'm sorry. You know that right? I never meant for him to die and for me to live. I didn\u2019t even know what was going on. I didn't know he loved me. I don\u2019t think I've ever known it.\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"He was such an asshole to you. He was so good at it. You never would have guessed it was all an act. A despicable act. A way to spare himself the pain of you not choosing him and sparing you the choice.\"</p><p>\"I feel like Harry Potter I swear. The whole Severus thing blew my mind equally.\"</p><p>He looks confused.</p><p>Blake coughs and shouts, \"Aimes, what the hell is going on? Where are we? Why did we come to a mountaintop to talk about Harry Potter? How the hell did we get here? Are we really here?\"</p><p>Aleks looks past me and waves, \"Hey Blake.\"</p><p>Blake's face gets red like when he rants, \"Hey strange guy, I don\u2019t know sitting on the mountain.\" He looks at me and holds his hands out, \"What is going on?\"</p><p>I sigh, \"I don\u2019t have time for this. I'll get the girls to give you back your memories when we get back. Just stop being a tard. Think Dr. Who.\"</p><p>His lips lift, \"For real? Awesome.\" He tightens his burgundy robe and doesn\u2019t even think about the fact he's barefoot and it's freezing.</p><p>Aleks laughs and stands up, \"I need you.\" His words are soft.</p><p>I don\u2019t have an answer but I know what my heart is telling me. The place around us is familiar. When I look past him at the graves, I feel like throwing up. I feel weakened and sick. I feel like jumping into his huge arms and letting him crush me into him.</p><p>So I do it.</p><p>I step into his huge embrace and let him wrap it all around me. His warmth and smells crash against me. His lips meet mine and it's heaven. His kiss is hungry and crazed. My body responds. I jump up and wrap myself around him. I could die smelling him. He pulls back and looks at me. My lips almost keep kissing the air. \"Why did you come?\" He asks.</p><p>\"Uhm. I don\u2019t....oh yeah. Oh my god, we have to go. Hanna is back.\" I jump out of his arms and drag him to Blake and wink us all to Marcus's house. We are standing in the hallway.</p><p>\"Why are we here?\" He asks.</p><p>I put a finger to my lips, \"Henry, remember. You stay out here and keep watch for him.\" I wink myself and Blake inside. \"Blake, if we steal these notes can you make a cure from them. It's for a friend who is a rage monster Hanna? Uhm like the Hulk.\"</p><p>Blake scowls, \"What? Am I in a coma? Are we dead?\"</p><p>I drag him to the notes I noticed the last time I was here. I flip open the book and show him the formula.</p><p>He reads fast. He shakes his head, \"What is this? This is craziness. Aimes, this is to make the monster worse. See here. Notes on adding rage.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I growl. I wink us to the hall and grab Aleks and wink us to Dr. Jekyll's office.</p><p>He's at his desk. He smiles at me and then looks at Blake and frowns, \"Odd, but welcome nonetheless. How may I help Miss James?\"</p><p>I take a deep breath and try to say it all so he and Blake get some details. \"We know about your daughter's raging monster condition, obviously. Anyway, you had notes. Last time you had notes. It was on the timeline they made. You gave me notes and Marcus made a cure from them. Well this time Marcus just has the notes. He knows how to make the cure. It's the cure he has made for you.\"</p> <p>\"Aimee I was there for it all.\" He says impatiently.</p><p>I point to Blake, \"He wasn't. Anyway, you know how it's short term? Well, I was wondering if you could make it long term and make some fast? Like now?\"</p><p>His eyes brighten, \"Do you have any of the notes Marcus worked on? Without them I can't get past where I am. He won't give them to me.\"</p><p>I slap down Marcus's papers and push the still robed and completely confused Blake at the doctor, \"Totally ahead of you doc. Make Blake here understand what's going on. I don\u2019t have time to help you or explain further. Hanna died today. It's just like last time. She's raging around Lydia's house as we speak and Marcus is trying to take her.\"</p><p>The doctor's face drops.</p> <p>\"Sensitivity never has been a big thing for you.\" Aleks steps forward. \"We can get her back. Aimee can wink her. And I have something that will solve the Marcus issue.\"</p><p>I look back at him, \"You're going to Henry?\"</p><p>He nods. I feel sick.</p><p>The doctor grabs something from inside of his desk and passes it to me, \"It's a single round. You can't miss. It'll drop her like a dead deer. You'll need to bring her home after that. Roland and I can keep her safe, until the potion is ready.\"</p><p>I look at Blake and smirk, \"This is the thing you've always dreamt about. It's real. All of it. The science fiction isn\u2019t fiction in my world. It's just science and fantasy meeting. You want in?\"</p><p>He grins from ear to ear, \"Hell yes. This is probably a dream, but I'm so excited I don\u2019t care.\" He chuckles, \"So this is the science grant you're working on?\"</p> <p>I grin, \"Something like that. This is my boyfriend Aleks.\"</p><p>He puts a hand out, \"It's nice to meet you.\" Aleks shakes his hand and looks weird. I can't imagine how messed up it is, remembering everything from so many different times. Especially with Blake and I remembering nothing.</p><p>I grin at the doc, \"So I can leave him here?\"</p><p>The doctor shrugs, \"I don\u2019t really see how much use another person will be, but I might be able to use him.\"</p><p>I laugh out loud. \"He goes to MIT. He was at home visiting my sister. He's a genius.\"</p><p>Blake's face turns red like he's going to argue but he doesn\u2019t. He laughs and nods.</p><p>The doctor beams at him, \"A lad after my own heart. Fabulous. Yes, go and save my girl and bring her home. We have this. How ever did you get the notes?\"</p><p>\"I've been in the lab before. I knew how to wink in there. He never thought about letting me in there. I know he doesn\u2019t let anyone else in.\"</p> <p>Aleks shakes his head, \"No one. I think he assumes with your memory loss you won't think about the lab, beyond it being a geek thing.\"</p><p>I grin, \"It worked.\" I grab the gun and Aleks's hand. Before I can wink us, he flashes. I don\u2019t know the place.</p><p>He lifts my chin, \"If things work out the way they did last time, I just want you to know it's real. It always was. For me.\"</p><p>I smile, \"It's real for me. Henry said the curse is broken. You don\u2019t smell delicious and tempting to other women. But you smell that way for me.\"</p><p>His face lightens up, \"Really? He truly said that?\"</p><p>I nod, \"He did.\" His eyes sparkle and he presses his lips into mine. He holds me to him.</p><p>He pulls back and laughs, \"Finally. You just see me. Of course this has to be the moment Henry will kill me.\"</p><p>I kiss him once more and then let go of him. \"I love you Aleks. I know I do. So, don't you even think about letting Henry kill you.\" I wink before he can say anything else.</p><p>I hear the screams before I see the mess and chaos. Hanna.</p><p>I wink and run to where she is ripping the boathouse to pieces. Ophelia is shooting things at her and shaking her head. They cut Hanna, but the beast doesn\u2019t stop. She is disgusting looking. I hold up the gun and shoot. She turns and screams a high pitch shriek at me. She starts to run towards me, but she only gets half way before she drops with a ground-rumbling landing. Her body shrinks back to her normal form. Her clothes are tattered and destroyed.</p><p>Lorri looks at me \"Don\u2019t go off like that again.\"</p><p>I nod. Everyone is out of breath and bleeding from somewhere. Marcus is pacing the line like a cat in a cage.</p><p>I wave back at him, \"Screw you Marcus.\" I shout.</p><p>\"Don't taunt him.\" Lydia puts her bleeding hands on her old round hips. \"He can still summon Henry.\"</p><p>My eyes must have given something away, because her face drops when she sees my look. \"What have you done child?\" She asks in a hushed whisper.</p><p>I shake my head, \"Not me.\" I look uneasily at Lorri. Her ears perk up. She turns and gives me a glare worthy of a death sentence.</p><p>\"Where is he?\" She asks though her teeth.</p><p>\"It's done Lorri.\" She scares me more than most things on the planet, so my voice cracks and lacks confidence.</p><p>She is gone. She doesn't wait to see if it works or if anything else happens. She just leaves. I know that\u2019s for my benefit. She wanted me dead. I saw it. I've seen the look before.</p><p>I glance back at Hanna and see Sam scooping her up. He gives me a look. I know he blames me. I frown, \"Take her home. To her dad. He and Blake are working on some shit. I'm going to go and find Ari with Luke and Ben. And I guess O, that isn\u2019t really O.\"</p><p>\"Okay.\" He's curt.</p><p>\"This is a frigging shit storm of doom. Anyone seen Giselle?\" I turn around. I don\u2019t get an answer. I get a scream. I think it's Hanna but she's gone with Sam. I spin to see Henry holding Marcus in the air.</p><p>I wink closer.</p><p>Lydia runs over waving her arms, \"Henry wait. Don't do it. It'll taint you. I suspect this was Jonathan's plan all along.\"</p><p>Henry's hand twitches. He thinks about what she's saying. He puts Marcus down, but holds him with his power. He looks at her and back at Marcus, who is clutching his chest. I don't see Aleks. I know he told Henry, but where did he go?</p><p>\"Make him a new one, Henry.\" Her voice is desperate. \"Don't taint your soul. You'll be playing right into Jonathan's hands. I suspect he always wanted you to kill Marcus from the beginning. That\u2019s why he told him about the heart. That\u2019s why he told him if he took it he could control you.\"</p><p>Marcus is coughing and dropped to one knee, but still squeaks out a word. \"Truth.\"</p><p>Henry's eyes flare bright red.</p><p>Lydia is gasping for air when she makes it to the street from the backyard. \"Make him a new one. You can do it. You have to. I know you must take back the heart but don\u2019t murder him. Make him suffer for all eternity.\"</p><p>Henry looks sad. He nods once.</p><p>Lydia looks at me, \"You take care of them child. Don\u2019t let them kill each other. Take care of each other and love each other. I'll be watching.\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>She pulls open her blouse, flashing her old lady bra at Henry. I wince, \"What are you doing old woman. Put that back on, do those buttons up. Jesus.\" I grab at her. She swats at me. It's then I see the tears streaming down her cheeks and Henry's. He's about to do something he doesn\u2019t want to.</p><p>My mouth drops, but even as I try to wink and move forward, I'm throw into one of the huge old oak trees. \"NOOOOOOOOO!\" I scream. Lydia shakes her head and looks at me, \"He has to stay pure. He has to. If the evil gets into him Jonathan can corrupt his magic. He's been counting on this moment from the beginning.\"</p><p>I'm sobbing and struggling but my back doesn't budge from the old oak.</p><p>\"Ophelia, Ophelia help me. \" I scream.</p><p>O walks over. Her body is shifty and weird. Her eyes are magical all the time now. She tilts a head and asks with the voices of the sisters, \"Why do you need help? What is happening?\"</p><p>I point, \"Stop them.\" I'm panicked and breathless. \"Stop him.\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"The witch is right. The Fae king cannot kill or his soul will be tainted.\" She turns and walks away.</p><p>\"He killed Aleks's dad. Lydia his soul is already dark.\"</p><p>Lydia shakes her head, \"He removed the curse that gave Jon his long life. He never murdered him.\"</p><p>I slump, \"Aleks, ALEKSSSSS!\" I can't flash. I can't move. Henry pulls back. Lydia looks at me and smiles, \"Look away my love.\"</p><p>I can't see her clearly. My eyes are so full of tears. \"SAM. BEN. LUKE. ANNABELLE. SOMEONE!\" Annabelle comes through the door as Henry's hand breaks flesh, but it's too late. Lydia drops to the ground in a heap. Her heart glows like a red ball of flames in Henry's hand. Henry lifts it to the sky and shouts something I don\u2019t understand. Annabelle screams. Her ghostly body is pinned by the guards. She cannot get out of them. She screams and pounds. I shake and sob, but can't move either.</p><p>Henry grabs Marcus and lifts him off the ground. He shoves the fist into the vampire and comes out with another heart. I see the light of it but it's too bright. I turn away. He does something I can't see and then the light is gone. Henry smiles at me.</p><p>\"She wanted you to know she lived an amazing life.\" He walks towards me and puts his hand on my face, \"She wanted you to have these.\"</p><p>The pictures come flooding in. They stretch everything in my mind. I sob and scream and laugh like a madwoman, as everything finds its way back to its proper place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His magic lets me go and I drop to my knees. I bend forward and lose my stomach on the cement.</p><p>Somehow her words roll through my mind. Words she spoke to me in the very beginning of it all. \"One day we will all see the big picture and where we fit inside of it. For now, we just try to do the best we can to make the world the place we would want to live, if we were human.\"</p><p>I remember it all. The switches with Ari. The death's we've lived through.</p><p>Dorian.</p> <p>His smiles and sneers. The way he kissed me when we were alone. The way he watched me all the time. The heartbreak is bigger than anything I've ever lived through. Bigger than my mother. It's over as fast as it hits. I pull the feather from my bra and hold it to my face. Other memories filter in.</p><p>My heart panics. Aleks. I need him. I scan the street for Shane. He is gone. I'm dying inside about changing him into a monster.</p><p>Marcus looks at me and laughs, even though I can tell he is in terrible pain. He howls and screams some more.</p><p>\"What did you do to him?\"</p><p>\"Gave him a heart again. Feelings. You just suffered through a couple years worth. He is suffering through hundreds of years worth.\"</p> <p>\"You must free her too.\" I point to where Annabelle is lying on the grass reaching.</p><p>\"I know.\" He looks back, \"There will be no safe place when I do.\" He grins, \"Except Marcus's.\"</p><p>He flashes to where Annabelle is and reaches through the guards. He touches her hand and pulls her to him. He touches her chest, which is still heaving and sobbing. Annabelle is in such a fit, she doesn\u2019t look at me. She doesn\u2019t even try to say goodbye. She clutches to him as he puts the light out. It hurts me she leaves and doesn\u2019t say goodbye, but I get it. Lydia was her Ari.</p><p>Sam flashes back without Hanna. He looks at Lydia's dead body and breaks into a run. His face is drawn and pale. He skids on the ground to her. He shakes and hugs her. His screams are louder than Marcus's.</p><p>I'm numb again. It's too much death. Too much for one heart and one day.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p> <p>\"I give them back to you spirit. I give their souls to you and offer you their love. Please accept them father and mother.\" Sam whispers to me. His face looks like mine. He is broken and can't cry anymore. He continues to translate the words spoken by Henry. \"Heal them and take away the pain they\u2019ve suffered for the cause. Replace the pain and suffering with joy and love and let them always have each other.\"</p><p>Henry tosses ash into the wind. It makes a tornado and shoots up into the sky. Suddenly flowers start to fall slowly. They fall overtop of where we sit in the grass and plant roots. I watch as a daisy lands in front of me. Green vines crawl from the bottom of the stem and dig into the grass. The smell of the flowers is everywhere. It blows in the soft early summer breeze. The flowers become an instant meadow.</p><p>Giselle is heaving and sobbing. Lydia and Annabelle were the only parents she ever really had. She is a mess. She shakes me violently just by touching me. Ben wraps himself around her and pulls her in. Ben and Luke are in rough shape. Ari's still missing and the deaths we have suffered.</p><p>\"What is Henry exactly?\" I whisper to Sam.</p><p>He leans in and speaks so softy, I almost don\u2019t hear the words, \"One of his parents was one of the first three children of Lillith. The other parent was of the Stag's people. The man Lillith was waiting for when Adam raped her. He is one of her witch children's children. He is a shaman. It's part animal part witch. Very strong. The magic combines and makes something almost unbeatable. Henry could take us all on. He can control nearly anything. If he murdered Marcus, even to get back his own heart, it would have made him a port for the darkness. The evil would have gotten to him. He would have become like his brother. Then Jonathan could have made him work for him.\"</p><p>\"Did you know all this already?\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"No. I never knew Jonathan had a plan for Henry. I thought he was mad because Marcus tricked Henry. I guess it was act. Pretty convincing.\"</p><p>\"What happens now?\" I ask.</p> <p>He laughs, \"We go live at Marcus's.\"</p><p>I look around the meadow at the children. \"They can't stay there. He is horrid.\"</p><p>Sam grins, \"Not anymore.\"</p><p>\"We have to deal with Shane, kill Jonathan and Lillith and Ophelia is a nightmare now. Plus we have to get back Ari.\" My stomach sinks. It's been so long since she was taken. I fear the worst. I try not to, but I can't help it.</p><p>\"I feel it too Aimes.\"</p><p>I lean into him and glance up at Aleks, who is standing next to Henry.</p><p>\"He isn\u2019t going to let us kill her.\"</p><p>Sam shakes his head, \"He isn't. We have to kill Jonathan. That is the main thing.\"</p><p>\"And get back Ari.\" I look at him.</p><p>His eyes are hardened and scared. He gives a single nod. He does feel it too. The lonely pain that is freezing us all over. Making us numb.</p><p>\"I'm glad you remember me again.\" He whispers and squeezes my leg.</p><p>\"Me too.\" I'm not glad I remember everything else. Seeing it the other way was simpler. More confusing but simpler. Now every bad thing I've done or experienced, crawls around inside of me, threatening me with a nothingness that will eat my heart and soul.</p><p>Aleks looks distraught. He doesn\u2019t do worked up or emotional, but he looks like he might today. His fingers tremble. He clenches them to stop it but I see it. I see him fighting the emotions. His father is dead. Dorian is dead. Lydia and Annabelle. O and Oliver. There are so few of us left. I slip my hand into the top of my shirt and feel for the feather. The softness of it between my fingers saves my sanity some days.</p><p>Giselle shakes and cries. Her and the little kids. Danny's little chubby face sobs. Memories of Lydia and Annabelle are attached to the kids. When I see them I remember so many things. Things I cling to desperately. I understand Marcus a little. He clung to Hanna for the little bit he could suck from her. I might do the same thing. I might cling to them and pray that I am able to feel. Even if it sucks and feels like I die a little bit everyday.</p><p>I pick a flower and eat it. I don\u2019t know why. I just need something. It's bitter and silky and I know it\u2019s a piece of Lydia that\u2019s going to stay inside of my forever.</p><p>\"I'm ready to go Aimee.\" Danny whispers.</p><p>I stand up and take his chubby hand in mine. The service is over. I wink him to Dr. Jekyll's house.</p><p>\"This is a good place for you. You'll be safe and you're nerdy enough that Blake and the doc can use your help.\"</p><p>We walk into the house. Roland was at the funeral. I know he isn't home yet.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. He clings to me, frightened of Hanna no doubt.</p><p>She walks up. She isn't smiling but I can feel the instant dislike for her. \"Hi Aimee.\" Her words are mechanical.</p><p>\"Hey. Do you know Danny?\"</p><p>She shakes her head. She doesn\u2019t really know any of us.</p><p>Her face lights up when she looks past me. I turn to see the grinning face of Sam, he can't even fight it. He has Roland with him. Roland looks less than impressed to see me. He blames me still.</p><p>\"Roland.\" I say.</p><p>\"Miss James.\" His words are curt and short.</p><p>Sam stumbles through his words, \"H-hi. Uhm I-I'm Sam.\"</p><p>Hanna grins and I can smell her polluting the air worse than before. It's like being in a field of flowers you're allergic to. I drag Danny through it. He's grinning at Hanna too. I tug, \"No.\" I mutter.</p><p>He smiles, \"She still smells pretty.\"</p><p>I roll my eyes and knock on the door to the office.</p><p>\"Come in Aimee.\"</p><p>I open the closed door with a quizzical look on my face.</p><p>Blake grins, \"We knew it was you. Those boots you wear.\" He looks back at the doctor, \"She really was a normal nerd once. But like the saying goes, 'Be yourself. Unless you can be Wonder Woman.' And there she is. In the flesh and blood only with black boots.\"</p><p>I scowl. Blake doesn\u2019t understand the last couple days. The doctor barely does.</p><p>\"This is Danny. He can help.\"</p><p>I look down at Danny, \"Just like Lydia's. No going outside, no leaving the house period. Blake plays WOW too. I'll be back to check on you.\" He rolls his eyes.</p><p>\"K mom.\"</p><p>Blake laughs. The doctor lifts an eyebrow and smirks.</p><p>\"Take care of him. He's Nephilim.\" I wink out of the house with my own grin. I didn\u2019t need to see the horrified look on the Jekyll's face to know it was there.</p><p>I stand outside the house and look up. I bite my lip and walk through the front door.</p><p>\"GET OUT!\" He screams as I cross the threshold.</p><p>\"No. Stop being a bitch and get me something to drink.\"</p><p>He turns away from me and storms down the hallway. I wink to his lab.</p><p>He opens the door and bursts into a fit of laughter. He leans against the frame, \"I should have known-oh-that's-funny.\"</p><p>I smile back, \"You let me in. I can wink.\"</p><p>He laughs and turns away from the room. \"You are such a bitch Aimee.\"</p><p>I walk after him, \"You let me in there. You turned Shane into a crazy psycho. You forced yourself on Hanna, using her weird Siren juju. You Killed Dorian.\"</p><p>He turns sharply and puts a dirty finger in my face. I notice suddenly how disheveled and desperate he looks, \"You did that. You killed him. He never loved a single person, until you.\" His smile is sick and satisfied.</p><p>I lean into his face, \"You betrayed us. You got O murdered and let them take Ari. I want to know where she is. NOW!\"</p><p>He laughs in my face and lowers his hand. \"You think I know where she is? You think Jonathan trusts me? I betrayed Lorri. Jonathan isn\u2019t so dumb as to trust me.\"</p><p>I grab his collar. He snarls his fangs at me. I laugh, \"Go ahead. Take a long drink.\"</p><p>He trembles with anger and hatred, \"I can't. Even if you didn\u2019t kill me with one drink, I can't.\"</p><p>Tears fill his eyes. He pulls away and is gone.</p><p>\"That was weird.\" I mutter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Not so weird.\"</p><p>I spin to find Aleks behind me.</p><p>I can't help but smile at the nice surprise, \"How are you here? How did you know I was here?\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"I didn\u2019t. I came to check on him.\"</p> <p>\"Why?\"</p><p>\"Because he was my friend for a long time and he is heartbroken and destroyed. And even though he is evil and rotten, I can't change the fact he helped me kill my father and make things right in my world.\"</p><p>\"You're a very honorable person.\"</p><p>He laughs, \"No, I'm not. I just believe in an eye for an eye. Marcus has been punished. You cannot know how bad it is for him now.\"</p><p>I put my hands on my hips, \"So, he lost Hanna. Big whoop. Now he has a heart and can feel. He doesn\u2019t need her.\"</p> <p>Aleks crosses his arms, \"That\u2019s not the whole story Aimes. Henry cursed the heart he put in Marcus's chest.\"</p><p>\"Lydia's heart.\"</p><p>He nods, \"Yes. He put a curse on it that is similar to one I had. He feels everything that his victims feel or have felt. His pain over the past couple days has been brutal. He has felt the terror and pain and everything.\"</p><p>I scowl, \"But why was he a good vampire last time, only taking what he needed and bad this time? He wasn't a good person but he was a good vampire.\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"It's the cost of what Ari does. Things change. Things she can't control. Think how easily Blake adjusted to you being what you are.\"</p><p>I nodded, \"Yeah. He was so good with it. But the first time he tried to commit me.\"</p> <p>\"Exactly. He has dealt with it subconsciously so many times, that when it came time to tell him this time, he was cool with it.\"</p><p>I look down. The sexual tension between us is mesmerizing. I remember so many things. We're talking about depressing things and all I can think about is brushing my fingers up and down his back. I shake my head and take a deep breath.</p><p>\"Thinking about something?\"</p><p>I look up. I know my face is on fire. I shake my head.</p><p>He grins his uneven smirk and I stare, like a psycho, at the fat part of his lip. I can taste it if I remember hard enough. The feel of me feeding off of him as he thrusts inside of me, is fresh somehow in my mind. Part of me wants to shy away from the thought. The other part of me wants to rip him limb from limb, devouring him. I realize I'm glaring and making a low growl.</p><p>His grin widens.</p><p>He grabs my hand and we flash. He shoves me hard into something as we stop moving. It hits me behind the knees and nocks me back. I land on a soft bed. He's on me, pressing me into the mattress before we both take a breath and realize it's a bad idea.</p><p>It's hungry and desperate. We have never made love like it. His teeth scrape at my neck. My hands drag up and down him. I rip his shirt from him. My t-shirt is torn open. His lips against my breasts are soft. They're too thick and plump to be anything but gentle against the swell of my breasts. His teeth nip lightly. I cry out. He's massaging and caressing. The trail of his touch is like rubbing a burnt match head against me. My skin sizzles. We pull apart and struggle from our clothes. I lift a foot. He grabs my boot, cussing in Norwegian as he tugs it off. It makes me hotter. He tosses them aside and pushes me back down.</p> <p>I don\u2019t even know where we are. I don\u2019t care. His tongue is in my mouth. He owns me. He knows all the right buttons to press. He flicks one nipple with his tongue and lightly tweaks the other one with his fingers. I'm moaning loudly. He muffles my ecstasy with his mouth. My hands reach around the back of him. I'm scared to suck him, but I need it. He climbs between my thighs and thrusts inside of me hard and fast. I cry out from the pressure. My hands are sliding up and down his back. I'm mid orgasm when it starts. I don\u2019t know if he will die or not from the suck but I can't stop it. He's pounding me still when I finish screaming into the huge round shoulder I'm biting. My orgasm prolongs as he finishes. He collapses onto me, panting.</p><p>\"That stings a bit Aimes.\" He says breathlessly.</p><p>I laugh. The sex felt dirty. Desperate. Amazing. There was no appreciation for one another. It was hard and fast and I loved it.</p><p>I feel like I can't get my breath. I push him off. He grins beside me, \"I think I used you a wee bit there.\"</p><p>\"Use me anytime you feel the least bit needy.\" My mouth clamps shut. I can't believe I've said it. He bursts into a fit of laughter and rubs my belly. His huge hands against my skin make me weak. I want more.</p><p>\"Hungry for something beyond my empty soul well?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"I need to find her.\"</p><p>He smiles, \"I think I may have the answer to that. Downstairs.\" He lifts me up off the bed. I look back at my torn clothing and press my lips together. I wink to my bedroom and jump in the shower. I rinse and jump out clean. I wink back to his bedroom with my clothes in my hand.</p><p>\"I hate it when you do that.\" He says leaving the room fully dressed. I grin and pull my clothes on fast. I wink down the stairs after him. We are in his old house in England. I love the place. I have since the moment I saw it.</p><p>\"I can imagine us living there. My parents visiting. We have two Irish Wolfhounds and maybe bunnies and of course a cat. I'm wearing a sweater and my dad and you talk by the fire, wearing those sweaters that Dorian always calls a jumper and mocks.\" My chest tightens when he turns back to look at me. I realize what I've said.</p><p>\"Dorian doesn't talk anymore.\" He regrets his words as much as I regret mine. We both wince and look away.</p><p>\"If I could have died instead I would have.\" I say but it, doesn\u2019t improve things. He walks down the stairs to the basement.</p><p>\"You can\u2019t leave me. Ever.\" I follow him down. I smell something when I'm part way down. My insides tighten and panic.</p><p>\"What have you done?\"</p><p>Giselle walks across the basement looking grim. \"Hey.\" Her eyes are still red from the funeral.</p><p>\"What's going on?\" I almost don\u2019t trust either of them. I smell Shane. I know I do. I almost worry about him and question them. Something is up.</p><p>\"I have him calm.\" She says.</p><p>\"Giselle remembers the blood lust. She doesn\u2019t remember anything else but she remembers that. She thinks she can save him.\"</p><p>Giselle smiles weakly at me, \"Maybe I can find out where Ari is too.\" She hugs herself.</p><p>I wrap my arms around her and breathe her in. It's the first time being with her after all of it. Her body doesn\u2019t melt into me the way it used to. She is tense where I am soft. I'm hugging with my heart and she is unable to understand why.</p><p>\"I will make them give it back Giselle. Give back all your memories.\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"I don\u2019t want them. I don\u2019t want to fight it again.\"</p><p>I nod, \"The happy memories though. The memories of Lydia and O and Dorian.\"</p><p>She swallows hard against my shoulder, \"It sounds weird but my heart remembers them. I know them all inside of me.\"</p><p>My eyes water, \"No, it sounds like love.\"</p><p>\"We did all love each other. I can feel it.\"</p><p>Aleks wraps his arms around us both and holds us to him.</p><p>\"You guys just humped didn\u2019t you?\"</p><p>I snort, \"What?\"</p><p>\"He smells like sex. Like ew. Get off me caveman.\" She shoves us both.</p><p>I sigh, \"I missed you.\"</p><p>She laughs and walks to the door to the cellar. \"Did you straighten out the Alise thing?\"</p><p>I laugh harder, \"Blake has her convinced it was a bad dream. I guess she came there to see him after drinking a ton with Michelle.\"</p><p>She looks confused, \"Do you ever miss it? The normal shit? I just want to get trashed and let some boy take advantage of me.\"</p><p>I tilt my head, \"I do miss it. I miss the regular stuff but this is so big. It's everything to me now. I guess seeing it both ways was all I needed.\"</p><p>\"Not me. I miss it. I miss getting trashed and having sex and not feeling like eating the person. I even miss just not coming. Just being used for a one-time thing. Sweaty sexy boy and me and the smell of booze. Jesus. Every guy now wants to be my husband.\" Her voice becomes mocking, \"I smell so good and look so good and taste so good. Blah blah blah. Like shut up and do it. Jesus.\"</p><p>Aleks looks like he might cry. She is oblivious to the fact we have not said a word and continues. \"I just want someone who can't see my beauty. Who can't smell my shit. Well you know, not my shit but like the succubus thing. I just want a guy who wants to just do it a lot and maybe buy me purses and stuff.\"</p><p>I distract her, \"We should go to Cuba some time. You love Cuba.\"</p><p>She points at me and opens the door, \"I know right. I love Cuba. This place is depressing. I officially don\u2019t like England. Boring. No wonder no one comes here for spring break. No girls gone wild in Hertfordshire.\"</p><p>There is a blur and a snarl and she clotheslines Shane and jumps on top of him. She presses her face to his. He is frozen once she does it.</p><p>\"Giselle! I told you to chain him.\"</p><p>She pulls away and grins, \"It's more fun like this.\"</p><p>Aleks sighs, \"You're going to be the death of me. I swear it.\" He eyes me up, \"You both will be.\" He grabs Shane and drags him back into the cell. Giselle sits on the ground and smirks, \"He tastes funny. It's weird.\"</p><p>\"Can you kill him?\"</p><p>She shrugs, \"No clue. I mean maybe. I never tried. I killed other vamps but they weren't Marcus's vamps. That could change things.\"</p><p>She stands and walks into the cellar. I follow. He looks different. So different I feel like he too has died. Like he is missing from my life.</p><p>He lifts his face slowly and grins, as his strength filters in slowly. \"You got some kiss Giselle. Always did I guess.\"</p><p>She laughs, \"And you got some pain in the ass nerve. Now tell me where Ari is or next time I suck until you die.\"</p><p>He laughs. It's so bitter and hard, I don\u2019t know it. Or him. \"Kill me. Do it. Free me. She cursed me. Kill me and let go.\" His laugh almost sounds like it could turn to a sob. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I'm sorry Shane. I'm sorry for what happened. I didn\u2019t know.\" I say.</p><p>His blue eyes are hard and cold, like his laugh. \"You know now don\u2019t you? You have it all back. Those memories of us, loving each other. You loved me. You chose me once. You remember that?\"</p><p>I nod slowly, \"I do. But we were different people then.\"</p> <p>Giselle slaps him hard across the face, drawing dark blood from his mouth, \"Answer the question.\"</p><p>\"France. The south of France.\"</p><p>I instantly recall Phillip's request.</p><p>\"Is Phillip in on this?\"</p><p>He laughs and looks away.</p> <p>Aleks looks confused, \"Why?\"</p><p>\"No reason. I need to get out of here.\" I turn and leave. Being around him is harder than I imagined it would be.</p><p>\"We need to go to the docs and talk to Sam and Hanna and Lorri.\"</p><p>Aleks follows me out, \"Giselle you got this?\"</p><p>She nods, \"I do. Hurry up though cause for reals it's boring. And Dank. I finally understand what dank is. This shit ass cellar is dank.\" She kisses Shane on the lips, knocking him out. I wince. She chains him to the wall and leaves the cellar. She is so strong. So much stronger than before.</p><p>\"Love you Giselle.\" I say softly</p> <p>She grins, \"Me too Aimes. Hurry up. I wanna go to Cuba.\"</p><p>Aleks puts a hand out, \"Yeah. Me too.\" I touch him and we're at the front door of the Tudor.</p><p>Aleks lifts a hand to knock but the door opens. Lorri grins at us, \"About time.\"</p><p>\"Hey.\"</p><p>She opens the door wide. We walk in and look around, \"Where is everyone?\"</p><p>\"Office. They got it. Blake and the doc got it. Hanna is super Hanna minus the freak show changes and the weird blackouts.\"</p><p>\"No way.\"</p><p>She looks at me all excited, \"Way.\"</p> <p>I frown, \"You are such a bitch sometimes.\"</p><p>She laughs, \"It's all the time. Now, I left Abbey with Marcus so let's make this snappy.\"</p><p>I click down the hall and smile.</p><p>Hanna walks toward me. Sam is behind her. I can smell the Siren in her so strongly now. The shell bracelet she wears is bright red.</p><p>\"Where did you get that?\"</p><p>She looks at it and shakes her head, \"The Ophelia girl who is really weird gave it to me. She made me like five and said they were for when she was gone. Bizarre chick.\"</p><p>Sam snorts, \"You have no idea.\"</p><p>Lorri cuts past us and stomps into the doctors office, \"I need you to hurry up.\" She says as she enters it.</p><p>We all turn and walk in. She is the last of the fallen. Her and Jonathan.</p><p>She lays out a map, \"I think they're in the south of France.\" I say.</p><p>She turns, \"Shane?\"</p><p>I nod once. I don\u2019t want to but I say it anyway, \"Phillip came to me as I killed his father. He didn\u2019t even seem to care about it all. He told me he was looking at condos in the south of France and he wanted me to bring Tristan there when the condo was ready, as a surprise for him. Just me and Trist.\"</p><p>She wriggles her lips, \"Odd. I will say it's odd. It's possible Marcus wiped him too.\"</p><p>\"Or Shane. Shane is almost as strong as Marcus.\"</p><p>She scratches her face, \"Okay, where is Tristan?\"</p><p>Sam gulps, \"He's at Marcus's. He's been watching TV since it all went down. Not really eating or anything.\"</p><p>\"The wolves?\"</p><p>Sam's voice lowers, \"Non stop tracking. They made me bring them to Alaska again, every hide out we've been to yet, and Italy twice. They phase and text and then change back. Ben is even texting with his wolf toes I think. Swear to god.\"</p><p>I chuckle and glance at Hanna. I can't help but notice her sliding a hand into Sam's. She squeezes it.</p><p>\"We need to go to France. We need to see. I know where they'll be.\" She glances back at the doc who nods, \"Most likely. Lillith will be able to get great strength there.\"</p><p>\"Lillith?\"</p><p>He nods, \"He will use her if he can.\"</p><p>\"We bring the kids then?\" Sam asks.</p><p>Lorri shakes her head, \"Just the one who makes herself disappear. The rest stay with Marcus.\"</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Hanna</p><p>I glance at him and wonder if he can sense it. I can't stop touching his fingers. Gripping them. My tears are sitting in the back of my throat. I couldn\u2019t talk if I wanted to.</p><p>The change brought them all back.</p><p>My beast knew the truth. Nothing Ari did could change the way my beast remembered it all. I see it differently, almost extreme versions of everything.</p><p>But I remember everything.</p><p>I glance at him sideways and remember how I broke his heart.</p><p>Every emotion is extreme. My beast is savage and hateful about her feelings. Now that she is fused with me and our minds are one, I can feel the basic survival skills she thinks with. She loves him. She always has. She saw things clearly. She saw Marcus as fun but she loves Sam.</p><p>His lips move. I can't hear the words. I'm lost in the memories.</p><p>He glances at me and I try to look like a spaced out head case. He frowns but continues talking to Lorri and Aimee. Ugh Aimee. She hates me so much and my memory of her killing my father isn\u2019t a fan fav.</p><p>My father.</p><p>The journals.</p><p>All of it.</p><p>It's too much. The tears start to leak out. I don't move or twitch or budge. I look down and hope the minor spillage will be enough to ease up the pressure.</p><p>It isn\u2019t. A heave slips from my lips. I can't stop thinking about them all. The deaths of the children who are back and the world without Sam. My fingers tighten around his. There is no world without Sam.</p><p>Now the world is new again and O is gone. Dorian is gone. I won't ever just be with them all again in one place. I can remember it all before O. Everything was perfect. I want to blame her but her death hurts.</p><p>\"Hanna?\"</p><p>I don\u2019t look up at him. He lifts my face. My ugly cry snot covered face.</p><p>He grabs a tissue from my dad's desk. Everyone is looking at me. He wipes my face.</p><p>\"She remembers everything. Look at that face.\" Lorri says harshly.</p><p>I cover my face.</p><p>Sam pulls me into him.</p><p>\"How?\"</p><p>\"B-b-beast memories.\" I stutter.</p><p>\"Oh like how Luke could always sense who Ari was to him, even when she fudged with the time.\" Aimee says softly.</p><p>I turn and run from the office. Anger and pain are everywhere. I betrayed him. I betrayed him so badly.</p><p>I feel like my chest is going to explode. I run up the stairs to my room and slam the door. It's not my room. He hasn't died and left me the Tudor. The room looks like it did when he died but it has nothing of me in it. Just the bed and furnishings.</p><p>I collapse on the bed.</p><p>I hear footsteps in the room. I expect Sam.</p><p>\"Hanna.\" It's Lorri. I don\u2019t know what to say. I hate being weak in front of her.</p><p>She crawls onto the bed and lies beside me. She strokes my head. I wait for her to break my neck or bite me, the way Shane did. The way Marcus let him kill me and bring out the beast.</p><p>\"Hanna, I know how you feel right now. If I stop and think for even a second, I'll burst into a thousand different emotions and tear this house apart. The hold I have over myself is so tense, I don\u2019t think I can hold it much longer.\"</p><p>I'm scared. I'm really scared. She doesn't do nice. She is still stroking my head.</p><p>\"But mourning is selfish my child. We don\u2019t have the leisure of being selfish. The dead are gone and the world is still messed.\" She slaps me on the ass and gets off the bed, \"So, let's, do this.\"</p><p>She is gone. I start to laugh. I wipe my face and shake my head.</p><p>A man's voice interrupts my moment of insanity, \"That was weird for me too. I flashed in and then out. Yikes.\" I smile when I hear his voice. I roll over and smile.</p><p>\"I'm so sorry Sam.\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"Hanna, it never happened. This is the first time we've ever met. This is a clean slate.\"</p><p>He walks toward me and crawls onto the bed. He snugs up close, so his angel breath is in my face. I love the smell of him. I close my eyes, but his lips don\u2019t meet mine.</p><p>I open an eye. He is looking at a text on his phone. I frown. He grabs my hand and flashes us back to the office. I stumble where we are standing suddenly, but he wraps an arm around my waist and catches me.</p><p>\"Luke found them. Not France. Florida.\"</p><p>Lorri's face drops, \"He wouldn\u2019t.\" Her voice is a growl and I'm scared again.</p><p>Sam nods, \"I don\u2019t know what that means, but they're in Florida.\"</p><p>Lorri bites her lip nervously. I'm really scared. She never looks that way.</p><p>Aimee frowns, \"What is it Lorri?\"</p><p>\"The dark witches. The dark witches there. Shit.\" She sighs.</p><p>\"I'm lost. The ones I gave my blood to?\" Sam says slowly.</p><p>Lorri turns and scowls, \"Oliver saved you that day. Those women are dark and evil. That's his plan.\" Her words are a whisper and her eyes are haunted and distant. She snaps her redhead around and shakes her head, \"He plans to turn Lillith dark. To let them fill her up. But why?\"</p><p>Dad's eyes dart to Roland who clears his throat, \"We Fae have long believed Lillith has almost no powers. There is legend that she split the power amongst her children. Every time she gave birth another piece of the magic was given to the baby. She has many children now. Not much magic.\"</p><p>\"Is that true?\" Aimee asks and pulls out her phone and sends a message. She sighs and vanishes.</p><p>We all look around.</p><p>No one has an answer or a clue.</p><p>Aimee</p><p>The sound of my boots on the hallowed halls lifts the eyes from the sofa. The little kids smile, Marcus growls and slithers away, Abbey gives me a nod but doesn\u2019t take her eyes away from the video game she is playing. Tristan sits perfectly still watching.</p><p>I grab his arm and wink us both. He is unshaven and smells funny.</p><p>\"Dude.\"</p><p>He glances at me and looks around the hallway we are in, \"Where are we?\" His voice is missing the feisty passion and sarcasm it had before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Hanna's. You okay? You look like shit.\"</p><p>He nods, \"I know. I just feel so empty without it. The magic was more than I knew it would be.\"</p><p>I spin him and plant a huge kiss on his lips. He shoves, \"What the heck Aimes. I didn\u2019t switch teams. Gross. You got lip-gloss on my teeth. Gah.\" He coughs and wrinkles his face.</p> <p>I grin, \"Okay. Now that you're awake, let's do this.\" I drag him into the office. Everyone gives him a slanted look. He doesn\u2019t look right.</p><p>\"Didn\u2019t realize I was missing a team meeting.\"</p><p>Lorri rolls her eyes, \"You're missing lots of things these days.\"</p><p>\"Is it possible Philip has switched to the bad guys?\" I ask the question I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>He looks at me and then crumples to the floor in a sobbing heap. I look at Lorri. She mouths several swear words.</p> <p>Hanna drops to her knees and holds him to her.</p><p>\"It's okay Trist. It's okay.\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"No it's not. Shane and Marcus wiped him. He's a nasty fucker now. Hateful bitch. He doesn\u2019t love me anymore.\" His words are wet squeals. I feel sick for him.</p><p>\"He made me give him my blood. He took it and left. He hasn\u2019t come back. He's gone to them. He's one of team Darth Vader and I am Princess Leia.\" He laughs at his own joke. I laugh too.</p><p>\"Honey, you need to help us end this. Your eighteenth birthday is in like two days. We are out of time and out of allies.\" Lorri pats the top of his head.</p><p>He sighs and slumps.</p> <p>\"Hanna, go shower and clean him and get him pretty. He looks like shit. The rest of us need to come up with some sort of a plan.\"</p><p>Hanna lifts him off the ground and carries him princess style from the office.</p><p>Blake crosses his arms and sighs, \"What if he killed the O monster and took back his magic. It's just like Highlander right? He kills and takes the magic?\"</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>Lorri nods, \"We could do that. But the prophecy states that Lillith cannot be killed by a man.\"</p><p>I point, \"He's her son. He isn\u2019t just a man. He's a witch.\"</p><p>\"What if the prophecy is made up or wrong? What if Jonathan wrote it? How do we know any of it is true? Lillith could be just as strong today as she was a thousand years ago.\"</p><p>I cross my arms, \"I say we try. We can't control O monster and besides, she won't do anything to help us. We get her here and let Trist cut her head off.\"</p> <p>Lorri rolls her eyes, \"He doesn\u2019t cut her head off. It isn\u2019t actually Highlander. Jesus save me from this. No. He just needs to reason with them. Make them believe it is the greater good.\" Blake snaps his fingers, \"Chaotic good. Of course, they are the chaotic good. If they think it's for the best they'll do it. We tell them he is still in with the baddies. He has an in. He has been invited to go meet up with the bad ones. They give him the magic and we go as a group and kick ass.\"</p><p>Lorri nods, \"All that but you stay here. You're delicate.\"</p><p>Blake looks annoyed.</p><p>Dr. Jekyll looks at Roland, \"We can help.\"</p><p>Roland looks grave but nods, \"As you wish sir.\"</p><p>Lorri claps, \"Excellent. Let's get Tristan back to being Tristan and get the magic back.\"</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Aimee</p><p>Tristan smiles and nods politely. He isn\u2019t lying. He just isn\u2019t telling the whole truth. Only Lorri and I are allowed to be apart of it all. No one else can hold their thoughts.</p><p>\"You will kill our mother, brother?\" The voice still freaks me out.</p><p>He nods, \"Of course. You ladies know how I feel about it all. I want Jonathan dead. I want him to pay for what he's done to us all.\"</p><p>The sparkly dead glow in her eyes make my skin crawl. She looks at Lorri and I and then nods. \"Take my hand.\"</p><p>Tristan takes a breath and puts his hand into hers. She looks up into the sky. The clouds hovering above us clear, except for one dark cloud. A bolt of lightning strikes their hands. They both lift off the ground, shaking and convulsing. Tristan drops to the ground on his knees, as O drops in a heap.</p><p>\"They're gone.\" He whispers. He moves his hands making the magic sparkle through them. He grins, \"Guess I'm ready then.\"</p><p>His eyes are sinister.</p><p>I have a bad feeling.</p><p>We flash back to the mansion and gather the forces. We wink in groups to the forest in Florida, where the wolves wait. I drop to my knees and let them maul me when I see them.</p><p>\"I missed you guys.\" I whisper. Luke whines and stomps his wolf feet.</p><p>\"I know. We're going now.\"</p><p>Lorri leads us through the woods.</p><p>\"This is where you came last time?\" I look at Sam and ask.</p><p>He nods.</p><p>Roland leaps into the air and phases mid air. He is a huge black wolf. Hanna gasps. None of us have ever seen it.</p><p>I look back at Aleks. \"I love you.\" I mouth.</p><p>\"Me too.\" He says softly.</p><p>\"Do it now Sarah.\" Lorri says softly. We can see each other but nothing can see us. Sarah has worked hard at developing the talent and is finally able to make us all invisible.</p><p>I can feel the line when we cross it. The darkness hovers in the air like a black cloud. I instantly feel uncomfortable. The wolves growl softly. Hanna and the doc look savage. He won't change into the beast either. He and her both will be the beast but in control.</p><p>My insides hurt. I just want Ari. I want her so badly. I know Lucas feels the same. He is skin and bone almost and his fur is not glistening like it does. He looks exhausted and lackluster.</p><p>We cross a dirt path. Ben is out front. He walks, sniffing and searching it out.</p><p>We stop when he stops. Lorri looks at little Sarah, \"Still good?\"</p><p>Sarah nods. She looks like she is concentrating very hard. She is the only one who can control her talents completely. The other kids are still a little nutty when they get scared..</p><p>Her tiny face makes me distracted. I'm scared one of us is going to die protecting her.</p><p>Sam stays close to her.</p><p>I hear them before we can see anything. A man laugh and talking. It's Jonathan. My skin shivers.</p><p>I wink into a tree just above us. There is a small village in the forest. Just some shanty huts with dirt paths between them. The houses are old and decrepit looking. Jonathan is standing outside next to a girl with dark hair. She is tied to a pole in the middle of the path. She has whip marks that look like they're healing. I feel instantly angry and sickened. It's Ari. She is filthy. Her clothing is torn and gross. After everything she has been through, this is too much. Phillip isn\u2019t there. No one else is. It's Jonathan and Ari. He rubs something down her cheeks and then stops. The wind changes. He lifts his face into the air like a dog smelling.</p><p>\"Shit.\" I whisper and wink back to the ground. \"He can smell us I think.\"</p><p>Lorri nods, \"Guaranteed. What are you getting Trist?\"</p><p>\"Bad juju. These witches are bad. They're almost as strong as I am. Phillip is here. I can feel him. The earth might not fight with me here. It's tainted.\" He puts his hands out, \"Ari is sick. We need to hurry.\" He makes a face.</p><p>\"She's tied to a pole in the middle of the road there. It's a dirty little village of sorts. Gross. I saw Jonathan but no one else.\"</p><p>Lorri flexes her fingers, \"Chances are he knows we're here and is ready. Are we ready?\"</p><p>We all nod. We have no real plan. Ari always wrecks our plans anyway.</p><p>We creep from the damp forest and into the village. The electricity in the air is too much. I gag from the stench of the humidity and dead animals. To the right carcasses and skins make a pile. In the distance I can see Ari.</p><p>Lorri looks at me and nods, \"Aimee you get Ari and Tristan and I will get Jonathan. Sam, you come with me in case he winks. We track him.\" Her whisper is so silent I almost miss it.</p><p>She holds a hand up with three fingers. She lowers one. My heart races. She lowers two. My palms sweat. She lowers the third and I wink. I touch Ari and am blasted across the dirt yard. Lorri has Jonathan in her hands but he just stands and laughs.</p><p>Tristan blows the pole where Ari is tied up, sending her flailing. I wink and catch her. Lucas is instantly with me, nuzzling her.</p><p>Suddenly they come out of the house. We must be visible because they raise their finger, chanting. They look like regular women but their eyes are black.</p><p>They all point at Tristan.</p><p>His fingers and hands shake.</p><p>\"Lorri!\" He cries out. Lorri winks to him but is blown across the dirt road. Ben is attacking one of the witches. He kills her on the road. Her body becomes a black blood puddle.</p><p>I look around at the pandemonium.</p><p>Lorri is being held to the ground. Jonathan is still standing laughing. He seems to not be real. Ben leaps at him but he doesn't wound. He doesn\u2019t budge. He laughs. The witches chant. Aleks is flashing and killing but the witches don\u2019t stop. The ones still standing don\u2019t defend themselves. They chant. There are at least twenty of them still standing.</p><p>\"He's glamour. Jonathan's not really there.\" Lorri shouts.</p><p>Hanna and her father are ripping and tearing. Both are covered in blood. It looks savage and disgusting, watching them kill unarmed women who don't fight back. They chant even as they are ripped limb from limb.</p><p>Tristan screams again. His fingers twitch, \"LORRI!\" He screams. His hand whips from his own neck and shoots a bolt at the ground in front of me.</p><p>\"MOVE.\" He screams.</p><p>I grab Ari and Luke and wink. I leave them in the living room at Marcus's and wink back. I grab the first witch and suck. She tastes like the best thing I ever ate. Dirty filthy death.</p><p>We murder every one of them to the sound of Jonathan laughing his head off. As the last witch drops dead, Tristan vanishes.</p><p>Jonathan stops laughing and grins, \"Thanks for finishing it for me. I didn\u2019t know how I would get him to get the magic from his sisters.\" And then he too is gone.</p><p>Lorri screams and her and Sam are gone.</p><p>Sarah is crying in the middle of the dirty road. I can hear her but not see her. She isn\u2019t making anyone but herself invisible. She must have panicked and dropped the guard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Sarah. Come to me.\" I whisper. I feel her next to me when I can see her again. I pick her up and wink her to Marcus's. I hold her tightly.</p><p>Aleks is there instantly with Ben, Hanna, Roland and the doc.</p><p>We stand in the middle of the living room, covered head to toe in black blood and disappointment.</p> <p>We have failed. In every way possible. Well, except for getting back Ari. She is nearly unconscious on the ground and looks like she might die any second. So the success feels less than that.</p><p>Ben and Roland leave the room with the black blood coating their muzzles. Lucas sits and cries sad wolf sounds that break my heart. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to fix her. I don\u2019t know anything, except that if she dies I will never heal. None of us will. She is the bane of our existence but she is the heart as well.</p><p>His soft wolf sobs are killing me.</p><p>\"Go change.\" I say.</p><p>He looks at me. His green eyes are filled with tears. \"Go change. I won't leave her side.\"</p> <p>He stands and leaves.</p><p>The children are crying. Even Anne.</p><p>Lucas and Ben come running back in. Lucas is pulling is shirt on.</p><p>\"Aimes.\" He says.</p><p>I shake my head, \"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to do. I, we need Lorri and Sam and Dorian.\" I'm shaking.</p><p>\"She needs to be examined.\" The doc looks at Marcus, who is sitting on the couch in a bathrobe and greasy hair. \"Want to help me, old friend?\"</p> <p>Marcus looks at him and then back at the TV.</p><p>\"MARCUS!\" Doctor Jekyll shouts.</p><p>Marcus climbs off the couch looking hideous. \"Fine. Jesus. Stop the shouting.\" He walks toward the lab. Dr. Jekyll lifts Ari up off the floor and carries her towards the lab. Lucas and Ben follow. I stand, frozen in the middle of the room. I don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Sarah sobs in my arms. She never should have seen any of that. Any of the death and horror. The witches never even fought back. We slaughtered them and they let us.</p><p>Abbey gets up from the couch and picks Sarah out of my arms. She winks at me and carries the sobbing child down the hall to a bedroom.</p><p>\"Everyone get cleaned up, so when Lorri gets back we're ready. Her and Sam will know where they went.\" Aleks says to everyone and walks over to me. He takes my hands in his. That's when I notice the blood for the first time. I pull my greasy hands away from his and wipe them on my pants. I can't get it off. I'm scrubbing to the point of it being raw. He grabs me and flashes us to his house in England. We are in the old bathroom. I stand there frozen as he undoes my pants, \"She's going to be okay.\"</p><p>I tremble, \"I can't lose her. I just can't.\"</p><p>He looks down at me and stops my breath, \"Hey. You won't.\"</p> <p>He pulls my shirt off and starts the old shower. The water smells funny. He says it is how the water smells in the country. I just know it's hard to wash my hair with it.</p><p>He lifts me into the shower when he has us both naked. He takes a facecloth and rubs a bar of smelly soap against it. He starts at my arms and slowly scrubs. He is gentle but thorough.</p><p>He lifts my arms and does my armpits and under my breasts. It would feel like an invasion of privacy with anyone else, but somehow with him it's intimate. I don\u2019t scrub myself with him, ever. He isn\u2019t forcing me. He's charming me.</p><p>I need him to. I need to feel something.</p><p>He rinses and soaps up again and makes his way south. I feel my body tense up. He leans into me and kisses my lips slowly, but doesn\u2019t stop his hands from taking the cloth between my legs. The roughness of it makes me moan into his kiss. His tongue in my mouth is slow and lazy. Distracting.</p><p>He turns me around and rinses the cloth. He scrubs my legs and butt cheeks while kissing my neck and back.</p><p>He stands and tilts my head back. His huge hands run the shampoo through my hair. He massages and scrubs. I moan again. His erection is against my back but I don\u2019t get the feeling that this is a happy ending shower. He rinses my hair and conditions. He dumps tons on the top of my head. I wince but don\u2019t say anything. He scrubs it in and rinses too. That should be interesting later.</p><p>When he's done he turns me back around.</p><p>\"My turn.\"</p><p>I smile and look up at him. He hands me the cloth and the soap. I scrub it on there, \"You'll smell like pretty roses too.\"</p><p>He grins. I start with his face and scrub the soap in. He laughs as I push his face into the water. He sputters. I never realized being so tall and close to the showerhead would be a pain. He sputters again. I pull him out of the water, \"Sorry.\"</p><p>He swallows and makes a face. I stifle a laugh and scrub his neck and shoulders. They're muscled and thick. My fingers dig in. He raises an eyebrow at me. I drag it down his meaty pecs and chiseled abs. I don\u2019t remember to soap up. I just rub the cloth and eventually my other hand, dropping the soap.</p><p>\"Aimes.\"</p><p>I look up, \"Sorry. Right.\" I bend down and get the soap. I stand, red faced and continue. I lather the soap in my hand and start scrubbing his belly.</p><p>\"Don't use the wash cloth on that.\" He nods at his erect cock.</p><p>I let my fingers drag down the shaft and slide my soapy hand up and down. He moans and I grin. His moans are like a food of sorts. They satisfy something inside of me. I stroke his thick cock, until I notice he is pushing against my hand. I stop and rinse him off. He bites the fat part of his lip. I shudder and turn him around. I stand on my tiptoes and pour a huge amount of shampoo into my hand. I realized I used the same amount I would use. I look at his short hair and grimace. I put it on and lather. He laughs. I know he can feel me bathing his head in shampoo. It takes forever to rinse it out.</p><p>\"Do you need conditioner?\" I ask.</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>I lather his back and rinse it off. He spins sharply and pins me to the cold tiled wall of the shower. He lifts me into the air but I shake my head, \"We have to go. I need to see her.\"</p><p>He growls, \"Aimes.\"</p><p>\"I need to.\"</p><p>He puts me down. I'm aching with hunger and needing him, but it's not right. I rinse once more and climb out. I hear the water change in power. I grin.</p><p>\"Making it cold?\" I ask.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer. He makes a grunting noise. I pull back the curtain as he turns it off and pass him a towel.</p><p>\"You're trying to kill me.\" His light blue eyes flash anger. I laugh at him and walk to his room to throw on his clothes.</p><p>I'm pulling on my ass kicking boots when Giselle comes in, \"Aimes, we have a development.\" Her face looks funny. Shane is behind her.</p><p>I jump up off the bed and grab his arm. He looks at me like I'm crazy.</p><p>Giselle shakes her head, \"Chill Aimes. He's fine.\"</p><p>I'm lost, \"What?\"</p><p>Shane takes my hand off of him and looks at Giselle adoringly.</p><p>\"What did you do?\" My tone is skeptical.</p><p>\"I charmed him. Watch this.\" She looks into his eyes and speaks slowly, \"Shane, dance on your toes and spin like a ballerina.\"</p><p>He goes on his toes and spins like he has known how his whole life.</p><p>\"What did you do?\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"Not a clue. I had him against the wall and told him to stop being so naughty and then he did. So I told him to kiss my hand and call me your highness and he did.\" She looks excited. I laugh. It's nervous and frightened.</p><p>\"Can you do it to anyone?\"</p><p>She shrugs, \"I don\u2019t know.\"</p><p>Aleks walks into the room in a towel. Giselle grins at him, \"You kiss me as hard as you can.\" Aleks frowns at her, \"No, thank you?\"</p><p>I laugh, \"Okay it doesn\u2019t work on him.\"</p><p>She looks bummed by that.</p><p>\"Shane stop spinning.\" She says it and he does. \"Now tell Aimes what you told me.\"</p><p>He looks confused, \"Which part your highness?\"</p><p>I laugh, \"This is sick. You need to make him stop being a servant. It's creepy.\"</p><p>\"The part about the south of France thing.\"</p><p>He turns like a robot and speaks, \"When I was with Jonathan, he said he bought a chalet in the south of France, for Lillith to live in until Tristan killed her. His plans had to keep changing cause you guys were changing things. He wanted Ari dead, so no one could change the time again. She has a poison spell inside of her that is going to kill her, slowly. They wanted to try to take her power before she died. Also he needed Tristan back. He made me wipe Phillip's mind and tell him that everything he knew was a lie. He believes Ari is the problem. That Lorri is the devil, for real. Jonathan wants the power to be in Tristan so he can kill his mother and take her powers. She is weak. Really weak. When she dies Jonathan is going to make Tristan do spells on him to make him more powerful than anything. More powerful than you or Lorri or God. Marcus made me eat Hanna to change her into the beast. Jonathan made Marcus brainwash me to be an all-consuming monster. Giselle's kisses taste like honey...\"</p><p>I put my hands up, \"Okay. Got it.\"</p><p>I looked at Aleks who stands with his arms crossed over his broad chest and shake my head, \"I knew he wouldn\u2019t be evil for no reason.\"</p><p>Aleks sighs, \"Can you take away all the brainwashing?\"</p><p>Giselle shrugs and grabs Shane's arm. She looks into his eyes and speaks, \"You forget everything Marcus made you do and everything he made you be. Just be the Shane we always knew before and don\u2019t remember the bad stuff you did to the humans.\"</p><p>She steps back. His eyes fuzz over. He looks at me and then at Giselle and Aleks.</p><p>He points at me with a limp hand and frowns, \"Aimes. What's going on?\" He looks down at Giselle, \"Did we kiss?\"</p><p>She laughs, \"I guess. Sort of. No.\" She looks at me, \"What should I say.\"</p><p>I smile. \"The truth. She kissed you and you are cursed. Those are two things you're going to need to work out.\"</p><p>He steps towards me, \"I kinda got the impression you and I were trying to work something out.\"</p><p>I step back and shake my head, \"No. Not doing this again. Shane, you and I are good friends. Very good friends. This is actually my boyfriend, Aleks.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He squints at Aleks confusedly, \"Hey man. Did we meet before? Where the hell are we?\"</p><p>Aleks starts to laugh. I join him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p> <p>Hanna</p><p>I wipe the sweat from her forehead and watch Lucas. He's desperate.</p><p>\"My dad is really smart. I promise he can help her.\"</p><p>Lucas doesn\u2019t take his eyes away from her. The memories of her being snarky and shitty to me try to sneak their way into my mind. I shut them down. I know her and Sam are close. I know what I did.</p><p>The memories of the women from my mother's family still haunt me. They were so convincing. Almost like my effect on other people. I wanted to be with them and make them happy. I wanted to be part of what they were. They convinced me I wanted it more than I wanted him.</p> <p>That was never a truth. Never.</p><p>\"They'll be okay. He'll be back.\" Lucas speaks softly but doesn\u2019t move from his vigilant watch.</p><p>\"I just screwed up so many times. I don't think he's ever going to forgive. Not for real.\"</p><p>\"He loves you Hanna. Trust me, if anyone gets it it's me. You've been a complete shit to him but you're the one.\"</p><p>Ben sighs, \"I hope I never fall in love.\"</p><p>Lucas's words hurt but I glance back at Ben and smirk, \"You mean like how you love Giselle and never tell anyone because of the succubus thing and Vampire thing and her being completely moronic thing?\"</p> <p>Lucas laughs. It isn\u2019t hearty and strong like before. But it's a laugh. Ben scowls at me and then smirks, \"Screw you Hanna.\"</p><p>Lucas laughs harder, \"She got you there.\"</p><p>\"Damn succubus. How did you know?\"</p><p>\"The midnight watch at the hospital when she was sick. I caught you sneaking and staying with her for hours at a time.\"</p><p>He nods and stares, \"It's the magic of the mythical beast. It isn\u2019t love.\"</p><p>I tilt my head, \"You sat and rotated icy cloths on her forehead for hours. I watched you once. I sat there waiting for Marcus to come and help her. He didn\u2019t. I just wanted to believe he would. He would be the man I needed him to be. Prove me wrong about him.\"</p><p>Ben scoffs, \"Yeah, that worked out eh.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"He deserves what has happened to him.\" I catch a glimpse of the tight jaw Lucas is sporting. I know he, like the rest of us, blames Marcus completely.</p> <p>\"You going to kill him?\" I ask softly.</p><p>Lucas shakes his head, \"No. The thing that\u2019s been done to him is much worse than simple death.\"</p><p>Ben knocks me in the back, \"Wanna go get a drink?\"</p><p>I nod and stand up. \"I'm sorry if my bracelet isn\u2019t keeping it all at bay.\"</p><p>Lucas shakes his head, \"It's fine. You love Sam. We know.\"</p><p>Ben grabs my hand and pulls me out. He drags me down the hall. Sam walks up as we round the corner. He sees Ben holding my hand. His eyes narrow, \"Hey.\"</p><p>I pull my hand away and walk over to him, \"We were just talking about how he loves Giselle.\"</p><p>Ben groans, \"Dude.\"</p><p>Sam laughs and shakes his head, \"Please. Like everyone didn\u2019t notice that one already. You think too loud.\"</p><p>Ben crosses his arms, \"She's bad news dude. Always attracting bullshit. I just think she's hot.\"</p><p>Sam nods, \"Okay.\"</p><p>Ben looks at us both and walks past us, \"See ya's.\"</p><p>I look up into Sam's eyes and smirk, \"I love you.\"</p><p>He grins, \"I know. That's never really been our problem has it?\"</p><p>\"Can you forgive me?\"</p><p>\"I already told you, nothing to forgive.\" He pulls me into him.</p><p>\"You aren\u2019t kissing me or touching me.\"</p><p>\"I want to. I just want to make sure this is what you want.\"</p><p>I pull back, \"So what you're really saying is that you're still hurt and don\u2019t trust me.\"</p><p>Ben pops his head back into the conversation, \"No. Don\u2019t do that. Why do girls do the 'what you're really saying thing?' What he's really saying is bitches be choosy. Now I'm starving. I've been eating nothing but raw meat with Luke. Let's go.\"</p><p>He touches me and Sam flashes us to the kitchen.</p><p>I shove Ben, \"Bitches be choosey. You're a dork.\"</p><p>He shrugs, \"Maybe. Whatever.\" He opens the fridge. There are shelves of blood bags. I grimace and point to the fridge on the other side, \"Wrong fridge.\"</p><p>Ben looks back, \"Wow. Marcus is blood bagging it?\"</p><p>Sam smiles, \"He has to. He can feel and sense everything his victims are feeling. Not as fun when it hurts to eat.\"</p><p>Suddenly an onslaught of memories of Marcus and I alone in my room attack me. I gasp and feel the heat and fever crash into me. Sam smirks and looks at my bracelet. \"Yikes. What was that?\"</p><p>I am trembling and shaking, \"Nothing. I need to go.\" I run out of the kitchen and down to my room. I close the door and drink in gulps of cold stale air.</p><p>A glowing sweat breaks out across my face. I wipe it away.</p><p>I turn to see Lorri and Abbey on my bed.</p><p>\"What are you doing in here?\"</p><p>Lorri points to the door, \"Saying my goodbyes. I suggest you do the same. We leave here in half an hour. You really smell like sex. Siren sex? Why is it so strong?\"</p><p>\"I don\u2019t know.\"</p><p>\"That\u2019s not good.\" She paused, \"Wait. Go get really turned on. We can trap Jonathan with it. He can't resist Sirens and you stink of it my friend.\"</p><p>I grimace and leave the room. My face is redder than before. I feel disgusting, like a cat in heat.</p><p>Marcus is walking down the hall. When he walks past me he steps in and smells me. I push him off. He grins like a fool, \"You just went into heat my pet. Someone not scratching that itch for you?\"</p><p>I shove him and walk away, quickly.</p><p>Sam flashes to me and grabs my arm, \"Hey. What's going on? Why did that just happen?\"</p><p>I pull away, \"I don\u2019t know. I think it's because you don\u2019t love me like you did before. Like we aren\u2019t mated.\"</p><p>\"Yes, we are.\"</p><p>\"No, we aren\u2019t. You don\u2019t love me like before.\" I undo the bracelet. He slams me into the walls, grabbing at me and gripping my skin roughly. His mouth crashes into my neck. I do the bracelet back up. My intense sexuality is sucked back into the shells.</p><p>He steps back and nods, \"You might be right. That was intense.\"</p><p>I feel like I'm dying inside, \"My Siren sex rage shouldn't work on you.\"</p><p>\"It shouldn\u2019t.\" He says in agreement.</p><p>\"But it is.\"</p><p>\"It would appear it is.\"</p><p>I unsnap it once more. He goes nuts. His hands touching me, light me on fire. I'm moaning and loving being slammed into the wall. He lifts me up and flashes. We're in a room I've never seen before. He throws me on the bed. He climbs between my legs and grabs at my clothes. He's tearing and ripping. His mouth drags up and down my chest. I cry out. His fingers were made for me. He slides his body against mine until I can feel every hair on my body. Every nerve. I'm close to an orgasm and he hasn\u2019t even taking my pants off yet. I shove him hard and snap the bracelet on again. He flashes mid leap.</p><p>I am alone. I can't fight the tears.</p><p>He flashes back in screaming at me, \"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"Lorri told me to.\"</p><p>He grabs my arms and rips the bracelet by accident. My eyes widen. My extras are downstairs at my dad's. Not here.</p><p>\"Flash me home fast.\" I whisper.</p><p>He does. He throws me on my bed at home and charges at me.</p><p>My beast snarls at him. I jump up and run but he flash-runs. He grabs me again, but I throw him through the wall and continue down the stairs. He flashes in front of me and tackles me to the stairs. He rips my pants. My beast laughs. She is a bit crazed with the Siren sex rage.</p><p>I kick him into the air. He flashes and lands on me and flashes us to my bedroom again. The beast grabs him and carries him down the stairs but he flashes us back to the bed. I stand and thump the floor several times. The wood starts to crack and snap. We fall through into my father's office.</p><p>\"HELP!\" I shout in my weird beast voice. He tackles Sam, who flashes them both on top of me. I groan under the weight of them. My father grabs him firmly again. His beast is turning on. I scramble to the bracelets in the drawer and snap one on. Sam stops. My father looks up through the dust and debris into the hole in the ceiling, heaving for breath. \"You two are going to need a rubber house one day.\"</p><p>I cry immediately, \"He doesn't love me anymore. I wrecked it. We aren\u2019t mated.\"</p><p>My dad frowns, \"Hanna, fall in love like regular people. Jeeze.\"</p><p>I look at Sam, who is laughing about as hard as he can.</p><p>\"Fall in love like regular people?\" I ask.</p><p>He nods and looks at both like he's astonished.</p><p>\"Regular people? Like date?\" I ask again and look at Sam who points at me, \"Do that to me again with the bracelet and you won't like the results.\"</p><p>I grin a sloppy wet smirk, \"So you say.\"</p><p>My dad groans, \"Okay. Look children, I need to call a contractor.\"</p><p>Roland walks in with a stiff drink for my father. Sam looks embarrassed. He grabs my hand \"I'm sorry sir. I will of course pay for this all.\"</p><p>My father shakes his head, \"No. No, it's fine. Just go do the thing you have to. Guess I will be showering for a second time in half an hour.\"</p><p>Sam flashes us to Marcus's. He kisses my lips softly when we are standing in the same bedroom again, \"I love You Hanna. I love you so much it hurts. I didn\u2019t realize I'm so angry with you that it's making me not in love with you right now. I'm hurt. I want to forgive you for everything, but I can't. I guess it's going to take some time.\"</p><p>I kiss him back, \"We got time. I don\u2019t want anyone but you.\"</p><p>His hands pull me into him and I remember Lorri's request. I push him back, \"Sorry. I gotta stay like this. Lorri needs me as a distraction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam sighs, \"Oh my god. That is going to kill me.\"</p><p>I grin, \"Nothing can kill you baby. We gotta go though. Lorri said we were leaving now.\"</p><p>He flashes us to the front door. I grin at him adjusting himself.</p> <p>\"Something wrong?\" I ask. I can't help myself.</p><p>He shakes his head and laughs, \"You're gonna wreck that power of yours if you keep it up.\" He leans in and whispers, \"I'll make sure you don\u2019t have a need for weeks.\"</p><p>I inhale sharply and bite my lip to stop myself from tempting him.</p><p>He nods, \"That's what I thought.\" He turns away from me, to where Aleks walks up dragging a fierce looking Aimee. Giselle and Shane are right behind them. My skin crawls seeing him. I feel panic and terror creep into me. Sam grabs my hand. My skin sparks when he touches me.</p><p>Lucas growls at Shane, but Giselle puts her hands in the air. \"No. He didn\u2019t do it. Marcus, tell them.\"</p> <p>\"Blow it out your ass.\" He shouts from his spot on the couch, in his too short robe that's flashing his dark hairy legs.</p><p>It's silent for a moment and then Giselle shouts at him, \"Stop acting like you're the only one WHO'S life is SCREWED. You selfish, self centered piece of shit. You are not the only person in the world who didn\u2019t get what he wanted in life. You think THIS is what I wanted? Do you? answer me god dammit.\"</p><p>We all take a step back. No one has seen Giselle lose it since the reign of the dark queen days. She looks fierce like Aimee. She storms into the living room and grabs him by the ear. She hauls his nasty ass off the couch. He cries out. She turns and screams again, \"Stop acting like this is celebrity rehab and get dressed. You smell funny. King of the vamps, ha. You're more like the dirty cousin to the king that shits himself and no one admits to being related to.\" She drags his filthy ass to where we are.</p><p>Aimee is outright laughing. I'm still eyeballing Shane nervously. I could kill Marcus though.</p><p>He winces and pulls out of her grip, \"I wiped his mind. I changed him and wiped his weak little mind. Bloody hell. Are you happy now? Now can I go back to sulking?\"</p><p>She slaps him in the face, \"No. You owe Hanna an apology too.\"</p> <p>He tenses his jaw and looks at me. My eyes narrow. I'm not in the mood for his shit.</p><p>\"Hanna, I am sorry that you died and became an amazing immortal and sex goddess. Yes, your life is horrid just like mine.\" He bows and vanishes.</p><p>Giselle is almost breathing fire out of her nose.</p><p>Lorri storms up the front door. She looks more savage than normal.</p><p>She looks at me harshly, \"You ready?\"</p><p>\"Yup.\"</p><p>A smile plays with the corner of her lips, \"You smell ready.\"</p><p>\"That's the understatement of the century. What is that?\" Aleks grins at Sam, \"Dude. Really? Can't take care of business.\"</p> <p>Sam glares and shakes his head slowly, \"Nope.\"</p><p>Aimee is smiling like a fool suddenly. She smirks at Sam and bats her eyelashes a couple times. He frowns but not nearly as severely as Aleks does.</p><p>Sam looks at Lorri and points at me, \"This was a good idea?\"</p><p>Lorri laughs and puts her hand in, \"Probably not. Group up with me and Sam. We know the way.\"</p><p>Me, Aimee and Giselle slap our hands on Sam. He smells delicious. The guys frown at him. He winks and we're there. The sun beats down. It's warm and lovely compared to the dank air on the west coast of America.</p><p>\"Ari would love it here.\" Aimee whispers.</p><p>Sam nods, \"She would die and go to heaven. Man it's hot.\"</p><p>He tugs at his shirt and doesn\u2019t notice the looks Giselle and Aimee shoot him.</p><p>\"Bad timing.\" I whisper.</p><p>His jaw drops, \"Oh. That was the wrong thing to say. Sorry.\"</p><p>Lorri, Aleks, Ben, Luke and Shane show up seconds later. \"Thanks for letting me ride with the sausage party.\" Lorri snorts.</p><p>\"You fit right in.\" Giselle smirks.</p><p>Lorri shoots her a glare and the rest of us stifle giggles.</p><p>\"You're all awfully cheerful for people about to die.\"</p><p>Aimee puts her hands on her hips, \"What's the worst that can happen? We die? Big deal. Everyone else is dead. We are the worst kind of enemy right now. We've got nothing to lose.\"</p><p>Lorri's grim face splits, \"Have I ever told you I love you, Aimee? I love the ass kicking bitch you've become.\" Aimee beams. Lorri turns around looking at us all, \"She is right. We got fuck all to lose. So Jonathan wins. If we're dead we aren\u2019t here for the Armageddon. Fuck em. Let's just do the best we can and see what happens. What have we got to lose?\"</p><p>Sam grins, \"You coach a lot of basketball Lorri?\"</p><p>She looks at him for a moment and then breaks into a gut-blasting laugh. I'm scared. I've never seen her like this.</p><p>Giselle whispers, \"Home girl got herself a piece of ass.\"</p><p>I snicker, \"Fo sho.\"</p><p>\"We run it the way we practiced. This is going to be typical. Stay together. Don\u2019t attack until we know for sure.\" She stalks off. I wait for Sam to lead us the other way. Aimee, Ben, Aleks and Giselle go with Lorri.</p><p>I look at Sam, Lucas and Shane and sigh. \"Only girl. I hate my team. I miss Ari.\" I pout. Lucas rolls his eyes but Sam and Shane both watch me. Like predators.</p><p>Sam snaps out of it and turns and walks the other direction. I stay close to him and Lucas phases and stalks behind me. He stays close. Close so Shane can't.</p><p>\"I think putting me with you was a bad idea. You smell sweet.\"</p><p>I look back at him but don\u2019t have to say anything. I see it in his face. He's the Shane from before. The sweet one who loved Aimee more than anything. Sam looks back, \"It isn\u2019t real dude. She's hardly even nice let alone sweet. Trust me on this brother.\"</p><p>I shove Sam.</p><p>Shane laughs and Lucas nudges me.</p><p>\"So is Giselle single still, even though now she's all badass and crazy?\"</p><p>\"She is, but Luke's brother has dibs on her. We respect dibs.\"</p><p>Shane laughs, \"Gotcha.\"</p><p>I like him. I can't fight it. We walk though a field behind an estate. Sam looks at me. I nod.</p><p>I look at Shane and whisper, \"Dude, this is about to get horribly painful. You'll want to attack me and be very vigorous in the loving. I need you to stay here. I need you to fight it. Like Sam said, it's fake. I'm going to pull the bracelet off and see if you can take it, okay?\"</p><p>He takes a breath and nods, like I'm going to punch him in the face. He rolls his shoulders, \"Do it.\"</p><p>I take a breath and unsnap the bracelet. Sam jerks at me. He stops himself. Shane does the same and then his fangs pop out. He puts a hand up to his mouth. Lucas stands in front of me and growls at them. Both men stand there, wrestling their inner demons. I snap it back on and they relax instantly. Sam sighs loudly and leaves to scout ahead, like he always does.</p><p>\"Wow, that'th potent.\" Shane breathes hard. His fangs hang in his mouth. \"Thorry. I can't thtop them.\"</p><p>I laugh and remember Giselle.</p><p>\"Okay, I'm going to do it when we get inside and it's going to be bad but you have to focus on the baddies okay?\"</p><p>\"I got thith. I'm tho thorry I killed you before too. It wath an acthident. I promithe. I don\u2019t even remember it.\"</p><p>He is so cute I could eat him alive. I blush and shake my head, \"It's cool. We got way worse drama than that 'round here. Not to mention the fangy apology is adorable.\"</p><p>He moans and shakes his head. Lucas rubs against him and makes the wolf chuckle.</p><p>Shane rubs his eyes, \"I feel thleepy.\"</p><p>I grin, \"It's the sun. Duh.\"</p><p>He frowns, \"I go out in the thun all the time back home.\"</p><p>Sam is back, \"Sun here is stronger. Marcus settled in Portland for a reason. The sun makes him feel a bit weak. You being his royalty can go out in the sun like him. But it does weaken you when it's direct and hot. Weakest time of the day. This is why you guys stay on the west coast.\"</p><p>Shane nods, looking disinterested.</p><p>Sam sighs again, \"They got a lot of baddies. Mostly human. So, Hanna you got that right?\"</p><p>I grin, \"Oh I got that.\" I can feel the beast hanging in the background. She is looking for a fight.</p><p>We walk through the gate at the back of the property where the bushy garden is. The lilacs smell amazing. I shake my hair and roll my shoulders as we cross behind a garden shed of sorts. The estate is stunning. Flowers and gardens and stone pathways. The house is huge. It reminds me of the Tudor but it's made from white washed bricks that are huge. The roof has the terrace garden balcony railings. I wonder what's up there. I turn to the front of the house and see something amazing. I gasp and gush, \"Oh my god. It's like the lake out front of Mr. Darcy's house in the newer Pride and Prejudice.\" The words leave my lips before I realize who I'm with. They look at me like I'm insane. Even Luke.</p><p>I roll my eyes and snap a picture of it and send it to Aimee's cell. She hates me but she has to agree it looks exactly the same.</p><p>\"Put the phone away. Sweet friggen god, you're going to get us killed.\"</p><p>It's my turn to roll my eyes. I storm past them, stalking up the side of the house. There are huge garage looking things in the bottom of the house on the side where the land slopes. They look old and creepy. Of course Sam walks right for them. We sneak into the dark and wait. I see a man walk past the garage opening with a gun. I look back at Sam. He nods. I unclasp the bracelet. The man turns, smiling. I walk to the entrance of the dark. He grins and licks his lips, \"Hey Sexy!\" He has a thick French accent. He grabs at me. I spin him and snap his neck. My beast rages. I drag him into the darkness. I clasp the bracelet and grin, \"One down.\"</p><p>Shane is gripping Sam and panting. His fangs seem bigger than before. A small trickle of blood leaves his lip and drizzles down his chin.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Aimee</p><p>\"Do you think Shane is safe with her?\" I can't help but worry. He's still my friend.</p><p>Lorri puts a finger to her lip and drags a man into the bushes. His semiautomatic weapon is tossed aside, we don't need it. She bites into his throat, ripping and tearing. She wipes the blood off her face and licks her hands clean. He didn\u2019t even get a scream out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We scout the far side of the garden, where we can see Sam and the others creep into a garage of sorts under the mansion. Men are flocking to the side of the house. In the distance we can see Hanna's strawberry blonde hair glistening in the sunlight. She is ripping off heads. I grimace and glance back at Giselle. She is wearing the same expression as I am.</p><p>\"That's nasty. Why do the baddies always have to be in a house somewhere? Why can't it ever be a bridge shoot out, or a high speed chase?\" Giselle asks.</p><p>I snicker.</p> <p>Lorri looks at her incredulously, \"Because we wink and flash and move faster than the human eye...\"</p><p>Giselle nods, \"Right. Still kinda boring sometimes. Sneak into the house. Kick down the doors. Kill the people. You know?\"</p><p>I pat her on the back, \"The faster we are done this, the faster we are done. Right Lorri. Roses will be done?\"</p><p>Lorri looks at me and nods once, \"In some ways.\"</p><p>Ben nudges Giselle, \"You know you don't want it to end.\"</p> <p>Giselle grins at him and laughs a throaty sound. \"I am going to eat you up if you keep giving me that look.\"</p><p>His smile grows, \"Promise?\"</p><p>\"Stop fucking around.\" Lorri stalks into the lilacs and rose bushes. She points to the roof of the house, \"We wink there now.\" She grabs Giselle and goes.</p><p>Ben looks back at me, \"I am going to get killed staring at her.\"</p><p>I raise an eyebrow, \"Phase.\" He leaps in to the air and shifts into his wolf. He puts a paw on my hand and we wink to the rooftop. There is a full garden up here.</p><p>\"Wow. I wanna be rich one day.\"</p> <p>Lorri sighs and walks to the door. She holds up her hands. Three. Two. One. She opens the door. I wink ahead and scan the bedroom at the bottom of the long narrow stairs. A man is in there sleeping with a rifle next to him. I suck him hard and fast. His red blood sprays the wall behind him.</p><p>I turn to see Aleks snapping the neck of the man who was shaving at the sink in the next room. Ben creeps ahead of us. I'm ready to wink and grab him and take him back to the rooftop. I can't do his death again.</p><p>He leaps into a doorway and snarls. A muffled scream breaks out. He comes back with black blood spread across his muzzle. He nods his wolf head at me. I roll my eyes.</p><p>Lorri and Giselle are ahead of us. A woman jumps at Lorri. Light flashes from her hands. Lorri is shot back but winks back behind the girl. She rips her head right off. I gag a bit. Giselle covers her mouth.</p><p>The body slumps to the floor. Lorri tosses the head into the room and winks in after it. She comes out licking her fingers, \"This floor is nothing but a barrack?\" She whispers. \"I don\u2019t think they're here.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"I know. Remember the house where Ben and Aleks died. I'm scared it\u2019s the same idea. Let me wink through and see what it all is.\"</p><p>Lorri nods, \"Back in two.\"</p><p>\"Two.\"</p> <p>I wink down the stairs to the stair I can see. I peek my head out and glance down the hall. I wink to the far end of one hallway. I rapidly wink to each door. My winking eye starts to tire, but I see nothing. On the other side of the stairs there's a huge living room and a fancy office. I wink so fast the people sitting or talking don\u2019t see me. I wink back to the stairs. A man is coming up them. He opens his mouth. I grab him and wink to Port Mackenzie. I snap his neck and leave him on dead on the ground at the secret beach. I wink back to France. I end up at the bottom of the stairs to the basement. I smell it there. Something familiar.</p><p>Angels.</p><p>I look past the creamy white wall to see Jonathan speaking to a group of men, \"They're contained on the third floor. Detonate in two minutes.\" He turns to a lady and nods, \"You need to stay here and make certain it goes off. Shield yourself and these guys. I'm going to get the other guys out.\"</p><p>He is gone. I wink to the woman and wink away. It's done in a flash. I'm at Marcus's house holding the savagely fighting witch by the throat. \"MARCUS!\" I scream.</p><p>The woman blasts me with lightning. It stings and burns. Marcus is there, tackling her to the ground. His fangs drop.</p><p>\"NO!\" I scream again. She grins at him. He stops himself but she flings him to the wall.</p><p>I wink her to his lab. I toss her and wink back out again.</p><p>He points at me down the hall, \"Did you just put a bad witch in my lab?\" His accent is thick. Cockney almost.</p><p>I take a deep breath. He snarls, \"Aimee, I'm going to kill you.\" I wink to the third floor of the house in France and send a text to Sam at the same time as I shout, \"LILACS! WINK TO THE LILACS!\"</p><p>Lorri grabs Ben and Giselle. Aleks and I are flashed as I press send. The smell of the lilacs is everywhere. I sigh, when I see everyone else just behind us, until I hear a scream blast across the extensive grounds of the mansion.</p><p>\"AIMEE, YOU MEDDLING LITTLE BITCH! WHERE ARE YOU? I KNOW YOU'RE HERE!\" Jonathan storms across the garden. He screams and grabs a man next to him. He sinks his fangs into the man's neck and bites savagely.</p><p>He points in our direction, \"You are dead.\" The house blows behind him. We all flinch and duck, as pieces of the mansion are scattered everywhere.</p><p>\"I know it was you. You little bitch.\" He is snarling and snorting. He stomps closer. Lorri stalks out, almost sauntering. She is laughing.</p><p>He puts a hand out to her, \"Just join me. Just join me and end this. Can't you see he doesn\u2019t give a shit? He never did. HE DOESN\u2019T CARE ABOUT YOU OR ME OR ANY OF THEM!\" Red spit flies from his mouth with every word.</p><p>She just crosses her arms and watches him spazz like a drama queen.</p><p>\"Lorri don't do this. Don't force my hand.\"</p><p>I walk out of the lilacs and grin at him, \"How did you know it was me?\"</p><p>His blood stained lip lifts, \"I could smell you everywhere. You little bitch. Where did she go?\"</p><p>I laugh, \"Somewhere only I've been. No one else knows what it looks like inside and it's so protected you can't get out without some kind of CIA assistance. Even then I'm not convinced she'll get out.\"</p><p>He laughs, \"I wish you had just joined me from the start.\"</p><p>I glance at my phone and see the picture Hanna sent me. I send my response. Hatred fills me as she comes walking out of the woods alone. I can hear the wrestling behind me. Giselle is no doubt holding them all back. I like to hope she doesn\u2019t have to hold back Aleks.</p><p>Jonathan's face turns sharply. A grin crosses his lips, \"Why hello.\" He sounds so charming. He looks it, even with all the blood splattered across him.</p><p>Hanna waves coyly, \"Hi.\" She bites her lip. He flashes and they're both gone.</p><p>\"SAM!\" I shout. He grabs my hand and Lorri's and we're off. It's a horrid feeling. I gag as we bounce in the flashes. We stop and I swallow my stomach's contents. It's much worse when someone else is driving the boat.</p><p>I shiver and follow them down the dark hallway.</p><p>Lorri's nails glisten. I've only ever seen her fight with them a few times. They're hard as a diamond and sharp as a razor.</p><p>We follow the trail. The smell of Hanna. The tension is pouring off Sam. He looks back at me, scaring me with the look on his face. His eyes are completely black, like Ari's always are when she's crazy.</p><p>We are under something. It's dank and gross. The hallway is dark and made from stone or old brick that\u2019s worn and smooth. It smells like the water at Aleks's house. Old and musty. A scream rings out in the air. We run, winking ahead.</p><p>A dim light flickers in the hall when we round a corner. Shadows move. I am nervous for Sam. I know Hanna is basically indestructible, but that means nothing in our world. Everything changes.</p><p>Lorri looks into the doorway and then back at us, \"Tristan and another woman.\"</p><p>Sam smells the air, \"Lillith.\" He whispers.</p><p>Lorri looks confused, \"I've never seen her. I don't know. She was always with the Fae. They never liked me.\"</p><p>Hanna screams out again. Sam almost walks in, but I grab his arm and shake my head. Lorri winks us back to the lilacs. The group has waited for us.</p><p>\"I think he's got her with Lillith and Tristan.</p><p>Sam's eyes light up. \"Oh my god.\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>Sam swallows, \"Remember how I gave my blood to the bad witches and Oliver saved me and took it back. He said they could control me if they had it. He said I was never to give my blood away.\"</p><p>My stomach sinks, \"Phillip took Tristan's blood.\"</p><p>\"What if Lillith is bad? What if all along the hostage thing was fake? My mom loves him, Jonathan. She wasn\u2019t a prisoner like we thought she was. What if Lillith isn\u2019t either? What if she is using him to get the magic back?\"</p><p>Lorri rubs her hands on her eyes and shakes her head, \"Why? Why would she lie to the blue sisters and Henry and everyone else? Why would she pretend to be on the Fae's side if all along she was in it with Jonathan?\"</p><p>Sam shakes his head, \"What if the act wasn't an act? What if this was all part of the plan?\"</p><p>Giselle crosses her arms, \"Well, Adam did rape her in the garden and God's punishment was giving him another wife? Like dude. I would have smoked his ass with lightning, not given him another chick. Then he goes and tells him that shit ass story about the rib. Like bitch please. I am so not second to any man.\"</p><p>It's the smartest thing she has ever said.</p><p>I grab her head and kiss her. Lorri looks like she has been kicked between the legs. \"Oh my god. Sweet Jesus. All along. She played Jonathan. She made the evil. She did it on purpose. She never was going to let us have the magic back and end her and Jonathan. All of it was an elaborate plan. He was probably forcing the pregnancies on her to get the magic out a little bit at a time. He has spent all this time trying to get the magic. They have a power struggle for the same outcome.\" It feels like the end of a Murder She Wrote episode.</p><p>My voice is equally as hollow, \"Except Ari. That must have screwed with things.\"</p><p>\"I feel so dumb. How did she trick Lydia's magic and Annabelle's and O's?\" Aleks looks at Lorri, who is now stunned in silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watch as something changes on her face. Slowly, her eyes become bloodshot. Red veins fill them, until they take over and all of the color is consumed. I didn\u2019t even think she had red blood. She looks at me, \"They mean to sacrifice him and take back the power. His birthday is almost upon us. Jonathan weaseled the power out of Lillith, one baby at a time and we fucking put it all into Tristan for him. Now it's just a race for whoever can get it first?\"</p><p>I shake my head, still mesmerized by her eyes, \"Why? What does the magic do?\"</p><p>\"Tips the balance.\" Her words are a whisper. \"We need Henry.\" She is gone.</p> <p>We stand in the garden of the burning mansion and look at each other.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t get it.\"</p><p>Sam crosses his arms, his face is still burning with anger. \"The balance is everything. The prophecy's about the end of days are about the tipping of the balance, in the favor of the darkness.\"</p><p>Lucas whines and rubs against me. I sigh, \"Just switch back. This isn\u2019t Lassie. I don\u2019t know what you're trying to say.\"</p><p>\"I do.\" I look up to see Henry standing beside Lorri.</p> <p>Henry looks paler than normal. I've always seen him as a proper English butler in a bowler hat. But now his ageless face looks dazed and sickened. He licks his lips in spurts, \"He is right. Fae holds the balance. It was our job. It is why Lydia was right. If I murder Marcus before I would have taken in the darkness. As of now my soul is pure. I am part of the balance. Lillith's magic was given to each of her babies when she gave birth to them. The magic was never hers. It was always ours. She called it into her to fill the void of the pain and the suffering. The reason our king wouldn\u2019t go to her wasn't that she wasn\u2019t pure in virginity, but because she wasn't pure of heart. She was the darkness in the balance. Too much light is the same as too much darkness. But we believed her to be on our side in it all.\" His accent is so weird I can't even place it. His English is terrible.</p><p>I feel lost and not just because I've never heard Henry actually form real sentences before. It would take the end of the world to make him say whole paragraphs.</p><p>Giselle chews her lip, \"So, uhm. I don\u2019t get it. Are Jonathan and Lorri working together or not?\"</p><p>Henry shakes his head. His eyes are lost. He's been tricked too. \"We always believed she wanted to stop Jonathan. Not ruin the world with him. Always believed she was sorry for what she took.\"</p><p>I interrupt, \"Is it possible Jonathan doesn\u2019t understand what she is going to do?\"</p><p>He nods, \"Yes.\"</p> <p>Lorri interrupts him, \"No.\"</p><p>Henry ignores her and continues, \"He is seventh angel of god. He was good, until he let the darkness take him.\"</p><p>Lorri sighs, \"We don\u2019t know whole story. We know he loved her or lusted after her power anyway. We know he coveted her magic and powers. The problem is the prophecies come from them. She is the oldest thing alive and the strongest.\"</p><p>\"Not while Tristan has the magic.\" Sam says.</p><p>Aleks sighs, \"Which ends tomorrow.\"</p><p>Giselle looks sick, \"What does it look like if the evil tips the balance?\"</p><p>Lorri shakes her head, \"We don\u2019t know exactly. All we have is Revelations as a best estimate.\"</p><p>I burst into laughter. I'm having flashbacks of the dreams I had before, when my mom was dead. It feels alarming and impossible, I can\u2019t imagine it being true. Everyone gives me the same horrified look.</p> <p>I laugh and shake my head, \"Sorry. I just can't believe this is all true. This is the biggest disappointment I have ever suffered. And that is saying a lot.\" I pace, \"HOW DOES THE SYSTEM FAIL SO BADLY? HOW DO YOU PEOPLE GET TRICKED SO EASILY? JESUS.\" I squat down and sit on my heels and rock. I hold my face in my hands and think.</p><p>\"When Aimee is done having her breakdown, she can kill them both right?\" Sam asks. Ben nudges me with his dried blood coated muzzle. I wrap my arms around his huge neck. Aleks's hands are on my shoulders, massaging.</p><p>\"No. She can't kill Lillith.\" Lorri says. \"It has to be Tristan or maybe Henry, if we are lucky.\"</p><p>I look up at Henry with hope. He shakes his head, \"No. If she gets magic I cannot kill her. I barely believe this true. She is mother of Fae.\"</p><p>Lorri makes a face and shakes her head, \"We kill them all today. We kill all of them now. We start with Jonathan.\"</p><p>I stand up and put my hand in. Ben touches me with a paw. Giselle puts her hand in on his paw. She doesn\u2019t look well. I wonder if I have the same look on my face.</p><p>Lorri's red eyes are freaking me out. We flash as one to the same dark hallway.</p><p>\"Where are we?\"</p><p>\"Ireland.\" Henry whispers. The wolves scout ahead. I wink and keep up with them. We round the corner and see the same place with the same light.</p><p>\"At least Hanna has the whole place stunk up.\" Aleks whispers, \"They won't be able to smell us.\"</p><p>We stand outside the massive room that looks more like an underground hall.</p><p>Lorri gives the go signal. I almost get sick. I grab Giselle and Ben and wink in. Jonathan is bleeding from the lip and panting heavy. Hanna is laughing her menacing beast laugh. She looks psychotic. Her clothes are torn and a large chunk of hair is missing. Sam and Shane fight themselves not to attack her. Lorri slaps Shane and brings him back around. We surround them. Lillith is gone.</p><p>Jonathan realizes he's surrounded and winks but he doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>He looks up snarling. \"Something is wrong with your Siren, Lorri.\" His eyes are ablaze.</p><p>I laugh. It's slightly nervously. I don\u2019t know what he can do. We've waited so long to catch him. Lorri has been setting traps and baiting him to no end. He is always one step ahead of us or so well armed we don\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>\"Yeah, she's broken.\" Lorri winks a creepy red eye at Hanna. She chuckles her monster laugh.</p><p>Jonathan scowls at her.</p><p>Henry holds his hands out, no doubt he is the reason Jonathan isn't winking out.</p><p>Jonathan shakes his head, \"Always the last to know eh Lorri? If you do this now she wins. I was always the only thing stopping her.\"</p><p>Lorri looks at me, \"Do it.\"</p><p>I swallow hard. The spark is filling me. I step forward, reaching out for him. His hand swings at me. His nails cut into my throat. I feel the warmth of my black blood dripping down my neck and chest.</p><p>\"Aimee, if you kill me she wins.\" His eyes grow desperate.</p><p>A low growl escapes my lips.</p><p>His eyes sparkle, \"I've always been trying to help you Lorri. It was always you.\"</p><p>\"Cut that liars tongue for me Aimes.\"</p><p>He looks at me with daggers but it doesn\u2019t matter. Lorri hasn\u2019t called me Aimes before.</p><p>He swings again but I catch his hand. I rip as hard and fast as I can when my skin touches his. I don't savor it. Black blood shoots across the room. I drop to my knees as I do it.</p><p>The Hanna monster clasps the bracelet. The guys stop acting like savages. Lorri walks forward to me. A single tear leaves her eye. \"He was lying. You did the right thing.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"It felt wrong. In the end it felt wrong.\" I wink to Marcus's.</p><p>He's pacing outside his lab. The thing inside is slamming and bashing the door. His stormy mood is savage and evil. He sees me and leaps. I catch him and hold back the suck. He slams me into a wall and screams at the same time I do. He starts to laugh a bitter and twisted laugh. It's scary and hideous. His robe is disheveled and stinky. He shoves me and walks back to the lab door. He points, \"Fix this. You fix this.\" He sounds like he is at his breaking point. I'm out of breath and still healing slowly. I know I can't take watching something as strong as him lose it and cry.</p><p>\"You fix this Aimee. God damned you. It was designed to keep your kind out.\" His hand trembles where he points. I walk to him. He flinches but I pull him in. I wrap myself around him and hold him.</p><p>He sobs. It fills me with dread and terror. If he can cry and be broken then the rest of us are doomed.</p><p>His huge body almost crushes me. I slam into the wall. He winces with me. I'm holding up his trembling body.</p><p>\"I killed him. It was me. It was my fault. He was my brother.\" He spits on my neck when he says brother. \"He was my best friend in the whole world once.\"</p><p>I can't imagine how it all feels. How painful it all is to have it slammed like that into you.</p><p>He straightens up and sniffs. He wipes his eyes and looks back at the door, \"Please kill that thing before it destroys my lab.\"</p><p>I nod, \"We need to maybe be prepared that it has destroyed the lab.\" I wince when I say it and hope we don\u2019t have to fight anymore.</p><p>He shakes his head, \"I am going to kick your ass one day when it doesn\u2019t hurt me quite so much.\"</p><p>\"Deal.\" I wink into the room and peek. I wink back out, \"It's ruined.\"</p><p>He inhales sharply and exhales like he is yoga breathing.</p><p>Sam and the others are in the hall.</p><p>\"I put the witch in there.\" I say.</p><p>They frown. Lorri asks, \"Witch?\"</p><p>\"The witch that Jonathan was telling to stay at the house. The plan was for her to shield the bad guys while we were blown up on the third floor. She was working for him.\"</p><p>Lorri looks at the lab and winces, \"Is, is that the, lab?\"</p><p>Marcus's jaw tightens.</p><p>Lorri nods \"Wow. Aimee that was an intense move. How bad is it in there?\"</p><p>Marcus nods, \"Done. Gone.\"</p><p>Hanna walks to him and puts her hand on his arm, \"You okay?\"</p><p>He shakes his head and looks at Henry who is sporting a severe expression.</p><p>Marcus walks away from Hanna and past them all. We all look at Henry. He laughs. \"You all not feel for him when he was killing people and making this one evil.\" He points to Shane.</p><p>Shane shakes his head, \"He had no soul, it was gone. Soulless. Cursed. It's not exactly the same thing as him just running around killing shit for no reason.\"</p><p>Henry gives us a disgusted look and walks away too.</p><p>I smirk at Aleks, \"I need you to come with me.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He takes my hand, \"Okay.\"</p><p>I wink us in and instantly Aleks is gone. He mustn't be able to pass though the walls Marcus had built to keep things out. The Witch points at me through the smoke and flames and dust and shoots me with a bolt of lightning again. I fly back crying out. I cough and wink behind her. As my skin touches hers I'm shocked again, but my hand clamps down on her neck. I take her to the ground and suck fast and hard. Her blood explodes out of her. I cringe. It's almost greenish in the dull light.</p><p>I flick it off me and shiver as I wink out. Everyone in the hallway makes a disgusted face. I walk like Frankenstein would and mutter, \"Going home. Shower. Save Tristan in a bit.\" I wink home.</p> <p>My dad's home. I freeze. He's in his room whistling. I step back and wink to the front door. I open it gingerly, trying not to get dead witch all over everything. I walk in and slam the door good and hard. \"Hey Dad.\" I call and wink to the bathroom downstairs.</p><p>\"Aimee?\" He calls out.</p><p>I shout at the bathroom door. \"Yup. Just showering and getting clean. I got home a while ago with Giselle and just needed a shower.\" I have no idea what I'm saying. I just need to be at home. The smell and the surroundings are everything. I turn on the water and undress. I try not to think about my boots being ruined. I just strip and fling everything out onto the tiles. The water is hot. Aleks is there suddenly. He steps into the shower. I frown at his flashing naked, \"How many places did you go before here?\" I ask.</p><p>He looks a bit frazzled, \"A few. I went to my place and the apartment in Italy and then Lydia's. Completely forgot about the house being destroyed. Standing in the yard naked was a bit rejuvenating. I thought I should try here, since you did say home. I went upstairs first though. Your mom almost caught me.\"</p><p>My jaw drops, \"Oh god.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah. That was after I flashed into every shower at Marcus's. Just caught Ben and Giselle having sex. That was weird.\"</p><p>I put a hand up to my mouth, \"No.\"</p><p>He rolls his eyes, \"Like you didn\u2019t see that coming.\"</p><p>\"You flashing about naked or Giselle. Cause I did see the Giselle-Ben thing in the works when she was the vampire queen of the world.\"</p><p>His face flushes, \"Well, she thought I was there to join in and even seemed excited about it. I'm not really sure she's as serious as he is about the whole thing.\"</p><p>I grimace, \"Oh god.\" I can't fight the shaking laughter.</p> <p>He grabs my face, \"You owe me something.\"</p><p>I look defensively up at him, \"Not here. It's my dad's house.\"</p><p>\"And mom's.\"</p><p>\"Right. Of course. I keep forgetting she's alive. How horrid is that?\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"I'm lucky you remember I'm alive, with all the frigging around Ari's done.\"</p><p>He bends to kiss me but the name reminds me what I wanted to do. I shake my head, \"NO! I need to see her. Get clean fast.\" I scrub myself up and down and jump out. I dry off and wink to my bedroom. I open the closet and smile. My things look exactly the same. I pull on a pale blue t-shirt and a light green hoodie. Clean underwear that my mom folded and some boyfriend cut jeans from American eagle. I sigh. I flop back on my bed and let the feel of the familiar soak in.</p><p>My mom knocks and opens the door as I'm pulling on socks and knee high red boots that remind me of Lorri's. I realize I started wearing them when I met her. I wanted to be her. Now I'm grateful to have her respect and love. Even if it's scary and savage.</p><p>Mom frowns, \"Is there someone still in the shower downstairs?\"</p> <p>I grin and blush, \"Yup. My boyfriend. Aleks. He's from the company I'm training with.\"</p><p>She raises a mom eyebrow at me, \"You're showering together?\"</p><p>\"Yeah.\" I laugh. \"Mom, Alise has been showering with boys since she was like thirteen.\"</p><p>She sighs, \"Yeah, but she never loves them. She uses them and moves on.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"She's with Blake. Has been for ages. She isn\u2019t moving on. Neither am I.\"</p><p>She sits beside me and pats my thigh, \"I just hate that you're so old. It makes me old. I need you to be eleven again and practicing your English accent and convincing your sister that you can't talk normally anymore.\"</p><p>I laugh again. It feels so nice and normal. I almost cry but that would freak her out.</p><p>Aleks walks into my room with wet hair and pair of pale blue jeans and a white polo. He is heavenly with his wet hair all messy and sexy.</p><p>My mom's face flushes. She stands and puts a hand out, \"Hi.\"</p><p>His eyes flinch, before a look of bliss crosses his face. He grabs her and hugs her. He holds her tight. Her back is stiff and her arms are out. I laugh, \"Mom, this is Aleks. He's from Norway. They hug a lot?\" I feel like an idiot.</p><p>He has his eyes closed and a smile across his lips. She pats his huge arm, \"Okay. Well, wow. It's nice to meet you. Okay.\"</p><p>Aleks pulls away and nods. When he speaks he sounds like he's a foreigner, \"Sorry. I just get really excited to meet Aimee's family. I just love her so much.\" His cheeks are red and he's never sounded more Norwegian in all the time I've known him. He can lay it on thick when he wants to. I laugh. She looks back and mouths, \"Oh my god!\"</p><p>I widen my eyes in agreement. She is grinning ear to ear as she leaves the room. She looks back, \"Door stays open.\"</p><p>I wince and shake my head, \"You know how old I am right. Like twenty.\" I look at Aleks and whisper, \"Twenty right?\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"I don\u2019t know. It feels more like twenty-six or seven maybe.\"</p><p>I laugh and point, \"What was that?\"</p><p>He looks confused, \"I just got so excited. She's alive and I panicked.\"</p><p>I laugh again. He grabs my hand. I shout at my mom, \"Hey. Tell dad Aleks and I will be back later. We have to go out. Love you.\" I wink back to Marcus's. Lorri walks past us wearing her red boots and frowns seeing mine. \"Aimee. I know I called you Aimes and told you I love you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to be The Sisterhood of the bloody boots and shit.\"</p><p>I cross my arms, \"Lorri, how was I to know you would wear them too?\"</p><p>She snuggles into Abbey, \"You shouldn\u2019t have even bought them.\" Abbey laughs and shakes her head. They disappear and I look at Aleks, \"I can't get past how gross it is. Abbey is like eighteen and Lorri is like a million.\"</p><p>He snorts and flashes us to Ari's room. Her black eyes meet mine. I jump, \"Ari, you\u2019re awake?\"</p><p>She swallows and talks softly, \"Yeah.\" She sounds like death. Lucas is sitting beside her, all stinky and gross. I shove him, \"Go get cleaned up.\"</p><p>He snarls at me. I swat him, \"Go. Aleks make him go.\" Aleks flashes them both out. I sit in his chair, \"Smells like wet dog in here.\"</p><p>Her lips attempt a pathetic smile, \"You get used to it.\"</p><p>My look grows serious. I can't fight it, \"I gotta get that baby out, Ari.\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"No.\"</p><p>I nod, \"Yeah. You can hate me all you want, but I have to.\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"You can't. It'll kill me too.\"</p><p>I shake my head. My heart hurts with the words that are about to leave my lips. \"I lied when I said I starved on the streets in the beginning when I crawled out of the harbor. I didn\u2019t starve. Not completely.\"</p><p>She looks confused.</p><p>I want to look away but her black eyes hold me hostage. \"A girl fell on me. I was lying, cold and alone, in some garbage. She was young, maybe fifteen or sixteen. She fell on me in the middle of my hunger. Her belly landed on my hands. When I finished pulling she was still alive.\"</p><p>Ari's face looks like she gets where this is going. In fact she looks horrified. \"You know Aimes, sometimes friends share shit they could have kept to themselves.\"</p><p>A broken laugh bursts from me.</p><p>She grips my hand, \"I want this baby. I want to try. I want it to heal me and make me comfortable around kids.\"</p><p>I wrinkle my nose, involuntarily.</p><p>She laughs again. Her eyes water, \"I just want to feel something so big that no one can ever take it away from me. Not even me.\"</p><p>I hug her so hard I tremble. \"You saved my whole family Ari. My entire family.\"</p><p>She shakes, \"It cost us Lydia.\"</p><p>I pull back, \"Didn\u2019t they tell you about Dorian?\"</p><p>Her face crumples, \"No.\"</p><p>I can't fight the tears, \"I am so sorry. It was my fault.\"</p><p>She looks disgusted, \"You killed him? Why?\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"I didn\u2019t kill him.\" I stroke her head and tell her all about Momma Holt in Blackwater Bayou.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Hanna</p><p>I smile, thinking about him. The way it felt for him to wash my hair when we were at Roses training together. The way his eyes looked when he saw me again, for the first time this time. He had to pretend he didn\u2019t know me and love me. I tilt my head back and scrub the conditioner out. I open my eyes to his smile.</p><p>\"You owe me something that I feel you have owed me for some time.\" He speaks like he's discussing the weather.</p><p>A naughty look crosses my face, \"Would it be wrong if I undid the bracelet and took advantage of you.\"</p><p>His look matches mine. He nods pleasantly, \"Please do.\"</p><p>I raise an eyebrow and hold the wrist with the bright glowing bracelet up. I fake like I'm going to, making him take a deep breath. I frown, \"You look nervous.\"</p><p>He nods, \"I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\"</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>He continues, \"Because then you'll become the beast and hurt me.\"</p><p>I laugh harder. I run my hands over my body once more to ensure the soap is all gone and click the clasp. He jumps me. His cock is instantly hard. I giggle as the heat and frenzy fills us both. The sound of my giggle frightens me. I'm scared of becoming the beast too.</p><p>He lifts me in the air. The cold-water handle water gets bumped making the water freezing. I cry out. He walks out of the running shower and carries me to the bathroom counter. Still holding me, he swipes everything off and sits me down on the cold hard counter. I squeeze him with my thighs and pull him into me. His body against mine, drives my feverish Siren rage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth crashes on my nipple. I gasp and reach down, grabbing for his cock. He's already thrusting when I touch it. I laugh again. I guide him to me, opening my legs more. When he pushes himself inside of me, I cry out, orgasming with a few strokes. He is bucking wildly. The mirror behind me crashes. He's slamming me into the wall. My legs are probably crushing him I'm squeezing so hard. I orgasm a second time. His teeth sink into my nipple. I scream as my hands rake his back. He cries out and lifts me off the counter. He spins and slams my back into the wall. I moan, but his lips muffle it. I bite down on his lip. I'm resting on his thighs almost and arching my back. It\u2019s the weirdest position, but it's amazing. He is rocking in and out of me so hard, when I come, I lose control of my arms and almost can't hang on anymore. He rams into me savagely, lifting me back up in the air. My back, dragging up the wall, stings. His hard body against mine is rough and brutal. He pumps harder, moaning and breathing into my hair. I feel his legs twitching and buckling. He adjusts his grip and flashes us. He throws me down on the bed and plunks down next to me. I snap the bracelet back on and laugh. I'm lucky I never crushed the shells while I was holding it.</p><p>He winces, \"Did I hurt you?\"</p><p>I nod, panting and gasping for air \"Yup.\"</p> <p>He takes my hand and kisses my bloody knuckle, \"You bloody well hurt me too. That was brutal. When you came, I feared you might rip my cock off.\"</p><p>I laugh and kiss his lips, \"Bracelet on from now on?\"</p><p>\"Yeah. Your back is bleeding.\" He points to the blood stained sheets behind me. I roll over. He looks horrified, \"Oh my god, it's covered in blood. I think this is why Siren's don\u2019t mate other Sirens often.\"</p><p>I whimper a bit when he pulls out the first shard.</p><p>\"You did amazing with Jonathan.\" He says.</p> <p>I look back, \"You did too. Lorri was right. Without you we never could have finished him off. You tracked him.\"</p><p>He smirks. I stare at his lips and pray I have at least one full lifetime of him.</p><p>Aimee</p><p>She is a sobbing mess. The pain I've caused her is killing me. Her face hasn\u2019t changed since the story start. She won't meet my eyes, \"Did you know?\" She asks quietly.</p><p>I shake my head, \"Not until he did it. Momma Holt gave me everything. Every stolen glance, every moment he had with me in it. She showed me the way he saw me and how he felt every time.\" I could throw up I'm so sickened by it all.</p><p>\"You never loved him?\" It's more of a statement than a question.</p> <p>I bite my lips. I know that it's not a true statement. \"There was something. We made out all the time. I cheated on Aleks all the time. Shane too. I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I know there was something. He made me feel like someone I think I might have been happy as. He was an amazing man who sacrificed everything for everyone else.\"</p><p>Tears stream down her pale cheeks, \"I loved him. He was crazy and weird but he was my dad. I never got to tell him that.\" She looks at me with her black eyes glistening like pools of despair, \"Do you think he knew? I never told him.\"</p><p>\"He knew.\" My heart is broken. I clutch the white feather in my hand selfishly. I never told her about it. I can't part with it. I know I should, she has nothing from him. But I can't. I hate myself for it.</p><p>\"I can't believe he's gone.\" I can see the sparkle in her eyes. I know she is wondering who she can push to bring him back.</p><p>\"Ari, we need to talk about something else.\"</p><p>She looks at me and shakes her head, \"I need to be alone Aimes.\"</p><p>I put my hands on her belly, \"I made Dorian a promise I have to keep.\"</p><p>Her black eyes grow wide. I suck before she has the chance to stop me. I suck hard and fast. She pushes at the same time and knocks me out.</p> <p>I wake to the sobs of Ari and the consoling voice of Lucas. I don\u2019t open my eyes. I know she is going to hate me. I just listen to the heartbreak in her cries. I deserve to hear ever second of it. I clutch my feather.</p><p>Lucas tries to reason with her, \"Baby. Aimes is your best friend in the whole world. She's the sister you never had. Christ she's the sister I never had. She would never hurt you on purpose, never. If she swore to keep you safe and alive to your da...Dorian, she just kept that promise. We don\u2019t know what the baby could do to you. We don\u2019t know what happens when Fae have a baby with Nephilim. I'm not willing to risk it.\"</p><p>\"B-b-but I'm immortal.\" She sniffs.</p><p>\"So was my aunt. My cousin lived and my aunt didn\u2019t. There is something not right in the soul of a baby that never came from god.\"</p><p>She cries into him. His shirt muffles it. I open my eyes and look at them both. I wink and end up in Sam's room. He isn\u2019t there. The bathroom light is on. I tap the wooden door, making it swing open slowly. In case he's in there.</p><p>He isn\u2019t but, I take a step back. My hand comes up to my mouth. He's there suddenly. I see him and then I don\u2019t and then I do. He's holding a towel in front of himself. I point to the bathroom, missing his nakedness. Well trying to miss it. I shake my head, \"Someone has been murdered in there.\"</p><p>He pauses and moans his answer, \"Welllllll, no. Uhm. Me and Hanna...\"</p><p>\"Oh god, stop. I don\u2019t want to know. That\u2019s a lot of blood. I just wanted to talk. I'll come back.\" I wink. My heart does the controlling.</p><p>I look out over the N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord and sigh. Sam is there within seconds.</p><p>\"We tried having no bracelet sex. It wasn\u2019t like some filthy weird kinky thing. It was just rough.\"</p><p>I look back at him and scowl, \"What makes you think I want to know that, firstly. And secondly, dude, I chose this place to be alone.\"</p><p>I look over and see Aleks strolling up to us, looking confused.</p><p>Sam laughs. I sigh.</p><p>\"I saw Luke.\"</p><p>I look at Aleks but I can\u2019t say anything. Nothing wants to come out. My heart is broken and having one of his lectures isn\u2019t going improve things for me.</p><p>\"She is pissed but she'll come around.\"</p><p>Sam sits beside me, \"What's happening?\"</p><p>\"Aimee took the baby out of Ari.\"</p><p>Sam's nose scrunches up, \"Oh wow. How? Where?\"</p><p>Aleks pauses with a confused look on his brow, \"Well. I guess. She did the suck thing and she ate it.\"</p><p>Sam gags.</p><p>I gasp and swat Aleks, who is hysterically laughing. He is never as easy going as he is being.</p><p>\"I hate you guys.\" I laugh too. I don\u2019t even know why we're laughing. It's sick and gross. \"I never ate it. It was like a spirit abortion.\"</p><p>Sam puts a hand out, \"Stop. I'm sorry I told you about the bracelet sex. I give, please. Stop.\"</p><p>I laugh again.</p><p>\"She'll pass the baby. Calm down. You know you saved her from whatever little monster Lucas put in there.\" Aleks says through the tears rolling down his cheeks. He's officially lost his mind.</p><p>Sam punches Aleks in the arm. Aleks is still laughing.</p><p>\"You're both sick.\" I shake my head in disgust.</p><p>They laugh harder.</p><p>I frown, \"She hates me. I got Dorian killed and killed her baby and you two assholes are laughing. Why are you laughing?\"</p><p>Sam shakes he laughs so hard, \"Aimes. Babe. Come on. It's crazy. Think about what you're saying. You sound nuts.\"</p><p>I pout and wink back to Marcus's. Ben is in my room. I frown, \"What's going on?\"</p><p>\"Giselle. She isn't into me at all. Like being serious and shit.\" He sulks and sighs. I pull his huge body into mine and hug him.</p><p>I feel weird about bringing it up but it's better to clear the air. \"Aleks told me what happened.\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"She thought he was coming in to join in. She actually thought we were going to have a three way.\" I cringe.</p><p>\"I got mad and we never finished. I just left. I was so pissed.\" He pulls back and grins, \"You wanna help me out?\"</p><p>I snort and shove him, \"No. Wanna cuddle?\"</p><p>\"Spoon?\" His grin makes me almost say yes.</p><p>I shove him again, \"No.\"</p><p>He shrugs, \"I gotta try.\"</p><p>We climb on my bed and he wraps his arms around me. I look up at the ceiling, \"Did you talk to Luke?\"</p><p>He nods, \"Yup. He's so relieved. Ari's sick still but she's coming around. The poison was in the baby I guess. Lillith and those bad witches did something to the baby. Ari could lose the baby and live or have the baby and then die. You saved her. Don\u2019t feel guilty.\"</p><p>\"I do though. I can't help it. I feel sick. She begged me not to.\"</p><p>He squeezes and kisses the top of my head, \"Aimes, you saved her.\"</p><p>\"I got her dad killed too. Worst friend ever.\"</p><p>He kisses the top of my head and smells my head when he does it. \"No. You're the best friend ever. You sacrificed your friendship to save her life. You made her more important than yourself.\"</p><p>Lorri bursts in, \"We gotta go. That place in Ireland is an old castle. Lillith is there with Phillip and Trist. He turns eighteen at sunset.\" I jump, startled. She looks at us and shakes her head, \"I don\u2019t even wanna know.\"</p><p>Ben laughs and kisses my head, \"You're a good friend. You always have been. Well maybe not so much during the whole Shane and Aleks era.\"</p><p>I wink us to the living room. He gags, shooting me a fierce look, \"Dude. Warning.\"</p><p>Grinning, I snap my eyes at him and walk over to where Lucas is sitting. \"I'm sorry.\"</p><p>He shakes his shaggy dark head and stands up. \"You've got nothing to be sorry for. You made the right choice for her. She'll see it one day.\" His green eyes sparkle, \"I owe you big time.\"</p><p>\"Getting fixed anytime soon? Cause I don't want to do that again.\"</p><p>He grins, \"Already done.\"</p><p>I whisper, \"You got neutered?\"</p><p>An offended look crosses his brow, \"I'm a man, not a dog. What the hell?\"</p><p>I punch him in the arm, \"You know what I mean. It's all the same surgery. Ask the vet next time you're there.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabs my head and pushes it down. I back up laughing.</p><p>\"What's up with you guys? Everyone is laughing and enjoying themselves lately. Something's up?\" Lorri crosses her arms and stares me down.</p><p>I look around. The tension's cut. Even Marcus has pants on. The kids are gaming and the house feels content.</p> <p>\"Jonathan is dead.\" Giselle says as if that is the obvious answer. Like we are too stupid to see it. \"That\u2019s been a pretty big deal to everyone. Aimee killed him. That\u2019s pretty much the most important thing to happen yet.\"</p><p>I narrow my eyes and look around.</p><p>Sam is beside me, \"Henry.\" He whispers.</p><p>Marcus snaps his head around, \"He's cast something on us.\" He looks down at his pants and mutters, \"I'll kill him.\"</p><p>Giselle points at the pants, \"No, that\u2019s an improvement. I was about six seconds away from tackling you with a garden hose.\"</p> <p>Shane laughs, \"You were pretty funky man.\"</p><p>Ben looks around, \"Where is Henry?\"</p><p>\"He left obviously. After he cast the happy cloud over us.\" Lukas snorts.</p><p>\"ENOUGH!\" Lorri shouts.</p><p>We all snap out of it.</p><p>She froths at the bit, \"We have to get out of this house.\"</p> <p>Everyone but Ari comes into the room one by one. Lorri looks at Marcus, \"Stay here in happy land with the kids and Ari, if you want to.\"</p><p>\"I'm not staying.\" My head swings around to see Ari in military boots and skinny jeans.</p><p>I swallow hard. She meets my eyes and then turns away.</p><p>Lorri looks at Luke. He shakes his head, \"She should stay.\"</p><p>Ari shoots him a look. \"You don\u2019t get to have a say in every aspect of my life Lucas.\"</p><p>Aleks steps beside Luke and puts a hand on him, \"Take a breath.\" He whispers.</p><p>Luke shakes his head and mutters, \"Let's just go.\"</p><p>Lorri holds up her phone. I grab Giselle and Shane and Ben and wink fast.</p> <p>\"That was awkward.\" Shane says. I nod, \"Super.\" I point up the bright green hill, \"We're going this way. If she is doing the magic now, she's outside. She's stronger outside.\" I remember Henry saying that once.</p><p>Hanna and Sam wink up to us. \"I sent my dad and Roland a text. They're heading to Marcus's right now. To stay with the kids.\" Hanna says quietly.</p><p>I glance at her and catch Marcus in my peripheral. He's beside Lorri and slightly pissy looking.</p><p>\"He came?\"</p><p>Hanna nods, \"He's pretty mad about the lab.\"</p><p>\"I feel bad. I just couldn\u2019t think of another place.\"</p><p>Sam laughs, \"He just wants to kill some people.\"</p><p>Shane points up to the wall around the castle, \"Well I guess that\u2019s lucky. Look.\"</p><p>\"Frig. Reinforcements.\"</p><p>Lorri growls, \"Where did you think they all were. The whole army is here. I have a slight fear that the stupid snow globe was glamour and she hasn\u2019t ever really left here. I am not sure she was ever in Alaska.\" I don\u2019t say anything but I have a terrible fear Jonathan was telling us the truth. The only thing stopping her from taking over and destroying everything was Jonathan.</p><p>Aleks shoots Lorri a glare, \"Thanks for the heads up.\"</p><p>She shrugs, \"Wouldn\u2019t have helped. I have the Asian Roses and the African Roses coming now. The European ones are already here.\"</p><p>\"I feel like the Power Rangers.\" Ben mutters and phases mid air.</p><p>I laugh, \"You totally stole that from my lips.\"</p><p>He sniffs at me and runs up ahead. He hides in the bushes. I look around and try not to let the beauty of it all overwhelm me. We are at a huge brick and stone castle with a wall all the way around it and turrets. The extensive grounds lead up into the hillside, which turns into a thick forest. It's stunning and everything is emerald green.</p><p>\"This castle is built on a forest the Fae believe is guarded with magic. They believe it's where the Fae originally came from. If Lillith is evil, she tricked the strongest of the Fae just to be here.\" Marcus says skeptically.</p><p>We follow Ben into the woods and look around.</p><p>Lorri starts the lecture, \"The army is inside. Shifters, Fae, Witches, Vamps, Nephilim and god only knows what else. There will be no Ari, Aimee, Hanna and even the succubuses aren\u2019t like Giselle. But everything else exists inside of there. This is the real deal.\" She points to a turret, \"The other side of the castle is where everyone else on our team is hiding in the woods. I don't think Lillith is expecting us. They will likely think Jonathan has finished us off or tricked us once again. If we catch them off guard we should be able to take them down before the sunsets completely. We move in five minutes. Aimee, Aleks, Sam and I are going for the Shifters. Be right back. Don\u2019t move.\"</p><p>Confusion fills me, \"We're going for the shifters?\"</p><p>She looks distant. \"We are since Henry joined the ranks of the deserters.\"</p><p>Hanna points to the castle, \"What if Lillith is good and there is something else in there?\"</p><p>Lorri snaps, \"We take our chances. No matter what we end the magic.\" She flashes a picture of where Lucas and Ben are from but I remember it all. We wink and flash and the whole council is there ready. We each grab our maximum and flash them back. At least fifty, maybe seventy-five shifters fill the woods around us. The chatter grows with all the new people. They shift quickly. I glance at Ari and grin, \"Yay. The wolf council. Janine is here.\"</p><p>She bursts into a laugh, \"I'm pissed at you. Don't make me laugh.\" I grab her and pull her in.</p><p>\"I love you.\"</p><p>She sighs, \"I know. I still hate you. I get to hate you for like ten minutes.\"</p><p>\"I'll be dead in ten minutes.\"</p><p>\"Five minutes.\"</p><p>\"Dude, think about the world we live in. All those Nephilim kids are orphans. It's no life for a kid. Besides what would we do without you?\"</p><p>\"Shut up.\"</p><p>I laugh and pull away, \"Okay. Five minutes. Then we wrestle.\"</p><p>Shane pokes his head into the conversation, \"In Jello?\"</p><p>Ari grins, \"I don\u2019t actually like Jello. I ate lots of it at the orphanage.\" She shivers. I do too. I can't help it when she talks about that place.</p><p>The dusk lighting is perfect. Most of them see better in the dark. Ari, Hanna, Giselle and I don\u2019t.</p><p>\"Is this the pow wow for girls who don\u2019t fit in?\" Hanna and Giselle walk up. I laugh, \"Pretty much.\"</p><p>\"Stay close to each other okay.\"</p><p>Giselle takes a deep breath, \"I just want you guys to know if we die. I love you bitches. This shit is the best shit that ever happened to me.\"</p><p>We stare at her and laugh. We do the big group hug. It feels fake. I still hate Hanna in a twisted way, but we hug anyway.</p><p>\"Henry healed me before he left.\" Ari whispers.</p><p>We all look at her, \"What if he hurt you?\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"He told me he was healing me because he could feel the pain inside of me and he felt badly. He said he knew what they did to me and it wasn't kind. He seemed disgusted. He said that the poison they put in me was slow. They wanted to get my power from me or learn to control me. If they couldn\u2019t I would have died anyway. If not for Henry. He also said he met my mother. Even knew her a little.\"</p><p>The look of remorse lifts from my eyes, \"What?\"</p><p>She nods, \"He was there. He was there when I was born. He went with Marcus. Marcus knew Dorian had reproduced, even though Dorian didn\u2019t. Marcus had to see me, he knew I would be different. He was the reason my uncle left with me. He convinced him to take me and runaway. He saved my life. Henry was there with him.\"</p><p>\"He could have saved your mother?\" Hanna says astonished.</p><p>Ari shakes her head, \"No. He said she was dead already when they got there. He had seen her before. When she was pregnant. She was newly pregnant then. Dorian didn\u2019t know but Henry could tell. They broke up before she ever told him she was pregnant. He said Dorian really liked my mom. Not love, but he really liked her a lot.\"</p><p>I grab her hand and look for something in the black eyes.</p><p>\"You okay?\" Giselle asks sweetly.</p><p>Ari nods, \"It made me feel better.\"</p><p>Lorri snaps her finger. We all look.</p><p>\"Let's do this.\" She holds her hand in the air with three fingers. Two. One.</p><p>I grab Giselle, Hanna and Ari and wink. We are standing on top of the roof of the castle. I see the guards roaming, \"Them.\" I point to the men on the wall of the castle.</p><p>I wink us again. We start the fight fast. Fists fly at me. A gunshot hits me in the gut. I wince and rip the souls fast. Blood sprays and splatters. Giselle is wooing and leading a group of them like the pied piper. I shake my head. As she walks them to me I flash my hands past and rip their souls out. Ari is doing the same by pinning the men to the stonewalls. Only Hanna is just ripping heads off and tossing bodies down below. Shots are fired at us. I pull an arrow out of my thigh. My black blood spills into my red boot. I see the archer. I wink behind him and rip his soul.</p><p>Screams are everywhere. The shifter Fae are biting and gnashing. Lorri is biting throats out. Several of the shifters are hurt. I can't see if it's Ben and Lucas. Things like Shane are everywhere. He and Marcus fight like it's UFC.</p><p>Aleks is with Sam. They're doing the ever annoying winky-flashy-fighting-thing that pisses everyone off.</p><p>The Asian Roses are obvious. Beautiful Vampires and Nephilim. One girl makes a light with her hands and blinds a group of people, until one of the witches shoots lightning at her from a window. I feel the ground rumble beneath my feet. I wink into the window and rip the witch's soul, just as spikes shoot up from the ground. Lighting is striking everywhere. There is dust and chaos and blood in every direction. The last bit of daylight is gone and as if strengthened by it, the vampires and wolves start going savage. I see less and less. I snap my fingers making snaps of light.</p><p>There is a flash of something. I duck against the wall and wait. Someone is in the hallway with me. I wink out to the roof again and then instantly back in. I grab and spin the person. Aleks plants a huge kiss on my lips, \"Ass.\" I shove him. He flashes us again as light fills the dark hallway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"What was that?\" I whisper from the corner where we hide.</p><p>\"The witches.

The warm breeze will always be me. Holding you and loving you.\"</p><p>He presses his lips into mine and I have a sinking feeling that he knows he's going to die. He flashes us back to the dark hallway.</p><p>\"Fucking Nephilim. They keep winking.\"</p><p>I freeze. I know the voice.</p><p>\"Phillip.\" I mouth. Aleks nods. He flashes and comes back holding Phillip's in a headlock. Phillip is struggling. I look out the window and wink us to where Ari is holding some men against a wall.</p> <p>\"Push him!\" I shout.</p><p>She pushes Phillip and knocks him out.</p><p>Aleks drops him and winces. His arms are covered in dark spots.</p><p>\"What's that?\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"It's his thing. He can push darkness into you. To poison you.\"</p><p>Ari grabs his arm, \"I watched him do it to someone at the witch's village. It'll kill you.\"</p> <p>I roll my eyes, \"That speech better not have been real, you son of a bitch.\"</p><p>He laughs and shakes his head, \"Nothing can kill me Aimes. Nothing but you.\"</p><p>I see a man about to decapitate Shane. I wink and suck the man as Shane spins. He stabs his hand into the man's chest as the man dies.</p><p>\"I had him.\" He grins. His face is covered in blood, red and black.</p><p>\"Whatever.\"</p><p>I wink to the group. Hanna is carrying the dead body of a man with her. I look harder. It's a guy they met at Rose's training.</p><p>\"Oh my god.\" I hear someone shout.</p><p>Ben runs over and whines and nuzzles against Hanna. She lowers the dead man.</p> <p>Giselle looks shocked. I know the look. She slept with the dead guy. It's so obvious. She digs her hands into Ben's coat and rubs his fur. He rubs against her. I don\u2019t really know the guy but I recognize him. Sam flashes to us, \"Shit, is that Don?\"</p><p>Hanna nods and makes weird monster noises.</p><p>I look at the castle grounds. The dirt has become mud with the blood of the dead littered everywhere.</p><p>\"This is disgusting. I need to take a picture for Blake. He's gonna shit. It's like a real raid.\"</p><p>Everyone looks at me in horror.</p><p>\"What? We just killed a lot of people. This battle is done. This was pathetic.\"</p><p>\"Like a diversion?\" Aleks says. He has actually been to battle.</p><p>Lorri winks to where we are, \"They're in the back. Now. Hands in.\" She looks panicked. We all touch her and Sam. She winks and Sam follows. We arrive at the real party. The other Roses are not there. I see Tristan. He's sitting on a stone bench with his head hanging down. I wink to him and grab him, but when my skin touches his I shoot off the roof. I see the ground and wink back to where everyone is. I look around but the tall gorgeous blonde, I am assuming is Lillith, and the other witches never noticed my little indiscretion. They don\u2019t seem to be paying attention to Tristan. I wink so fast, they miss it.</p><p>Lorri scowls at me, \"Yeah, they never thought about the fact we all wink and flash about like faeries.\"</p><p>I sneer, \"It was worth a try.\"</p><p>Sam points, \"She is the one making the guard.\"</p><p>Henry isn\u2019t there. But Lillith is.</p><p>Lorri whispers and points across the massive stone balcony, \"I go for Lillith. Aimes, you get the one who is making the guard. Sam, you get Tristan. Aleks come with me for Lillith. Everyone else stay here just in case. Go.\"</p><p>We wink. I grab the guard witch, as Sam grabs Tristan. I wink to the lab and dodge a hellfire blast from her fingers as I wink back out.</p><p>I feel sick suddenly leaving her there. My voice cracks when I am with the group again, \"I think I just screwed up. Hanna, tell your dad and Roland to get the kids and go to your house. Now.\" My voice is panicked.</p><p>Hanna texts Roland. \"Done. He says they already did that. They aren\u2019t there. He hates Marcus's house. Why?\"</p><p>I sigh, \"Oh my god. I just left a witch who can do hellfire in the lab.\"</p><p>Marcus turns his face and snarls, \"My lab? My house?\"</p><p>I open my mouth but shut it as a giggle escapes.</p><p>His face pinches. He puts a hand up to the bridge of his nose and does the yoga breathing again. \"Aimee, have I wronged you in some way that you feel the need to ruin all my shit? Is this penance for my misdeeds? Did God himself ask you to do it?\"</p><p>I grimace, \"I'm sorry.\"</p><p>I look around and realize Lorri, Aleks and Sam are all still gone, \"Where are they?\"</p><p>I speak too soon. Aleks shows up. His side is burning.</p><p>\"Hellfire?\" I shout.</p><p>He shakes his head, \"No. Regular fire. Lorri is fighting her. She's too strong for me. Lorri sent me back to help here in case it's an ambush or more glamour. She wanted me to make sure Tristan still had the power.\"</p><p>\"Do we have Tristan?\" I panic when I see Aleks's face paling. Sam flashes back with the limp Tristan in his arms.</p><p>Sam shakes his head, \"It doesn\u2019t matter now. He's drained. She has it.\"</p><p>Aleks looks at him, \"Lorri is with her fighting right now in some place Lorri called the Garden of Eden.\"</p><p>I feel my eyes light up, \"I know that place.\" I look back, \"Marcus can you wash Phillip's mind so he remembers shit again? Then we go to the Garden and kill Lillith?\"</p><p>He nods, \"Really? A favor? After what you just did? A favor? Aimee, I am not happy with you right now.\"</p><p>Giselle grabs his face and plants a huge kiss on his lips, \"Please.\" She whispers.</p><p>He nods like a robot. Giselle looks back and winks at me.</p><p>\"I know. I owe you a new castle.\"</p><p>He grabs Phillip and looks at me harshly, \"You replacing the priceless art as well?\"</p><p>He speaks softly to Phillip who sputters and sits up. He looks at us all and then past us. He's up like a shot, \"Trist.\" He winks across the patio to where Tristan is being held by Sam. His eyes well. Phillip grabs him and kisses him but his face is sallow and soft.</p><p>\"He's dead inside. She took it all.\" He cries. He rocks back and forth with Tristan lying limp in his arms. \"Baby, I'm so sorry. I don\u2019t know what happened. Baby.\"</p><p>It's gut wrenching to watch.</p><p>\"Trist. My love. My only love.\"</p><p>Sam steps forward, \"We can help. Aimes can suck you both and send you off.\"</p><p>I glance at Sam and shake my head, \"You want me to kill them?\"</p><p>He nods, \"Yes. Now get over here.\"</p><p>I take a step back, \"I don\u2019t want to.\"</p><p>Phillip looks at me and cries out, \"Please Aimee. He will never wake up. We are both clean in the conscience. Everything we have done they made us do. We can be together in heaven. Aimee this is him, for eternity, if you don't do it. This is it. Please, send us on our way. Please.\" He is begging me with trembling lips and silent tears. I shake my head but walk towards them.</p><p>I put my hands on them at the same time.</p><p>\"I'm sorry.\" I whisper into the cold wind that is blowing my words around.</p><p>He shakes his head, \"Not as sorry as I am.\"</p><p>I pull slowly. I savor the taste of them both. Phillip squeezes my hand with the last of his strength and soul and then he too is gone.</p><p>I don\u2019t cry. I turn and look at everyone, \"Let's go find her.\"</p><p>I want her dead. I want her to suffer and cry and scream in pain like we have. Everyone is dead. We are but a handful of what we once were.</p><p>Lorri appears looking like herself. She does a head count and then her eyes meet mine. I'm glad they're normal colored again, until she winks at me with finger to her lips.</p><p>I'm about to send Sam after her, when she winks back holding Blake's hand.</p><p>He looks around, \"Holy shit is this a castle? Where are we?\" He looks queasy from the wink.</p><p>My stomach flutters when I see him in her arms.</p><p>\"Time for me to show you what I make.\" She says softly. She grabs his mouth and plants the biggest kiss ever. He pulls back sputtering, \"Lorri. What the heck?\"</p><p>She smiles softly, \"Bite the inside of your mouth till it bleeds.\"</p><p>\"Blake, don't do it.\" I step towards them but he does it. He looks into her eyes and she kisses him again. His red blood and her black mix and seeps out the creases. Gasps, curious looks, trembling hands brought to trembling lips, all ignored. They kiss like it's the last time they will ever touch another human being.</p><p>He pulls back, gasping for air. He looks at me confusedly. I shake my head in tiny movements, \"Blake.\" I whisper. I can't imagine the horror crossing my face, but his confusion fades into fear when he sees me.</p><p>\"Lorri.\" I say stepping forward. \"Why did you do that?\"</p><p>Her face is tragic and beautiful in the faded light of dusk on the hillside. She looks classic and dreadful.</p><p>She shoves him hard off the balcony where we are. He screams. I wink but she winks and catches me in the air, taking us to the balcony where we were.</p><p>She holds me. I try winking but she takes us back. I don\u2019t hear his screams. Giselle is crying and Shane is holding her. His face is confused. We all are.</p><p>\"It only takes a second.\" She whispers, holding my head to her shoulders like a mother would a child.</p><p>\"What did you make him?\"</p><p>\"A savior.\"</p><p>I pull back. Lucas and Ben whine. They shake their heads like they hear something we do not.</p><p>She grabs my face and looks into my eyes, \"Do the same thing he did. Bite your cheek.\"</p><p>I do it. I don\u2019t know why but I trust her. She kisses me hard and passionately. She pulls back and grabs my head roughly. Everything goes black just as I catch a glimpse of something in the darkness. A bright light like I have never seen before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>I wake and push myself up from the ground. Everything hurts like it did when Dorian changed me but it's sudden and brutal.</p><p>I glance over at Ari. She is on the ground too. She looks confused and in pain like I do.</p> <p>I look up at Lorri standing above me.</p><p>\"What did you do?\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"I don't know.\"</p><p>Blake is standing beside her. He almost glows in the dark. \"What have you done to him.\"</p><p>His head snaps toward me with a grin like I've never seen. He's ecstatic. \"Aimes, I'm an angel.\"</p> <p>I focus my eyes better and look. His shirt is gone. Stretched out from his back, is a pair of huge black wings. They blend into the night. I glance at Shane and see the same thing. His chiseled and muscular chest is bare, but behind him is a pair of massive wings.</p><p>\"You make angels?\"</p><p>She presses her lips together, \"Not just any kind.\"</p><p>It dawns on me when I look at Aleks. He is dressed and normal looking, except his face which is angry.</p><p>\"You have condemned our souls?\" Sam says slowly looking behind him at the wings on his back.</p><p>Giselle is shaking and attempting to stand. I wink and I'm on the mountaintop in Norway. I wink back, \"I can still wink.\"</p> <p>She nods, \"You can never go to heaven Aimee. I've taken your souls.\"</p><p>\"You are the devil? The real devil?\" I mutter, still stunned.</p><p>Only Lucas, Ben and Aleks look the way they did before. I scream, as my shirt is ripped from me and my back explodes in pain. I look back at the black wings and cry. They're so beautiful and frightening I can't cope. I cover my breasts and sob. Aleks looks frightened.</p><p>\"I am the real devil, Aimee. I was sent with the mission of keeping the balance. I've always had the ability to create an army of darkness. An army of beings so strong that there is no force that can kill them. But all of my brother's have betrayed me. All of them. It was always a losing battle. I just didn\u2019t see it. Like Jonathan said, always the last to know.\" She strolls to where Aleks is. She looks at me, \"I have never done it before. I needed to be sure.\" She punches Aleks in the face hard. She grabs his mouth and plants a kiss on him. They flash and wink and then they're back and he is on the ground \"Lorri, what the hell?\" He growls at her.</p><p>She stands back and watches us changing and touching ourselves. Lucas and Ben creep back on the balcony.</p><p>She points at them and wags her finger.</p><p>I run to Aleks and hold him close. His warmth sends chills across my naked skin.</p><p>I look back at her, \"Why would you do this to us?\"</p> <p>She shakes her head, \"It's too late.\" She winks and is behind Aleks. She snaps his neck. He drops to the ground. I scream.</p><p>His neck starts making popping sounds. She sighs, \"I have failed. You are plan b.\" She winks and grabs the wolves and winks them away.</p><p>Ari is crying and shaking. She turns to face me. I am covering Aleks with my naked skin.</p><p>My wings feel the breeze in them. They feel the way my arms or legs do. I can feel every feather.</p><p>Giselle is spinning like a dog trying to catch its tail.</p><p>Shane starts to smile at Blake who is jumping and flapping the wings like a bird. Shane's start to twitch.</p><p>Ari is shaking and trembling until Lucas's dead body is dumped next to hers. Then Ben's. They are in naked human form. Ari is shirtless and covering herself, sobbing into Lucas's bare skin.</p><p>Lorri is back. Marcus steps forward, \"You had this all along? Why didn't you use it?\"</p><p>She shakes her head, \"I couldn\u2019t. It was the emergency hatch. Once pulled it couldn\u2019t be un-pulled. These cannot be unmade. There is no destroying them. No hellfire. No magic. No angel. No nothing. They're completely indestructible. God's last stand against it all. Do you have any idea the kind of power that is to bestow upon someone?\"</p><p>He laughs and points, \"You chose this group? These people?\"</p><p>She nods, \"I have. They are called redeemers. They can redeem a soul and send it back to heaven. For every soul they save, the balance will tip slightly in the favor of the light.\" I catch the stolen glance she sends me. I know what she wants.</p><p>Aleks starts to stir. He wakes and screams. He flashes away. We all have our safe haven we go to when we're scared. He and I share the same one.</p><p>Lorri points, \"These are true angels. How I was before I fell.\"</p><p>Marcus sighs and looks at Giselle, who is still moving in a circle trying to touch her wings. \"This is the best you had to choose from?\"</p><p>Lorri laughs, \"Yes. No human or immortal has lived through what they have. Except you and I buddy.\"</p><p>He puffs his chest out, \"I'm one of them.\"</p><p>Lorri gives him a look and rolls her eyes, \"I trust them. Completely.\"</p><p>Shane looks back at Lorri, \"What do we do now?\"</p><p>Lorri looks grimly at us all, \"Prepare. You can feel pain. You can bleed. You can suffer. She will try to make you live through all of those things. She will try to make you join her. She will have things equally as strong as you are.\"</p><p>I glance at Ben's twitching body. Lucas wakes with a start and screams. He tries to phase but instead his wings shoot from his back.</p><p>Aleks is back. His huge beautiful black wings look amazing on his strong thick physique.</p><p>Blake tries to see things through his glasses and then takes them off. He puts them in his pocket, \"So you made us into angels of darkness, but we are good?\"</p><p>Lorri nods, \"You are what you want to be. I have given you the ultimate immortality. You will live forever. With that come horrible amounts of responsibility and terrible things to cope with.\"</p><p>Blake looks upset, \"Alise?\"</p><p>Lorri nods, \"She can't ever know.\"</p><p>He looks heartbroken but nods, \"Well, we all know her.\"</p><p>I glance at Hanna and realize my hatred is gone. I just see the sweet girl she is. Has always been. She holds her hands over her breasts and shakes her head, \"My Siren? My beast?\"</p><p>Lorri shakes her head, \"Gone. You can all wink but no more wolves, no more blood lust or succubus powers. Nothing but the pure power of God.\"</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest and shiver, \"It's too much. You've made a mistake. We aren\u2019t worthy of something like this. We'll screw it up. I know we will. One of us is going to be bad and join Lillith in her evil deeds. I know it.\" My voice is panicked.</p><p>Lorri laughs, \"I'm counting on it. I'm also counting on the rest of you to be the team you've always been. The best Roses I have ever had. You have to be there for each other.\"</p><p>Sam spins around, \"Where are you going to be?\"</p><p>She laughs, \"Retired. I will ask one of you to step forward and help me out. Then Abbey. If you don't mind.\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"Retired?\"</p><p>\"How?\"</p><p>\"Lorri we can't do this alone.\"</p><p>\"She's kidding. She's kidding us.\"</p><p>She shakes her head. She winks and is back a moment later. The silence of the dark is creepy. She smiles at me. Abbey looks confused.</p><p>\"You guys have wings?\" She looks at Lorri, \"That\u2019s sweet eh? You got wings too baby?\"</p><p>Lorri shakes her head, \"Not yet.\"</p><p>She looks at me, \"It works exactly the same as before Aimes.\"</p><p>I take a breath.</p><p>\"I have a million questions. You can't go.\"</p><p>She puts her arms out, \"You have each other. I'm afraid I don\u2019t have a choice. Making you all, took all there was in me. There is nothing left. I'll be useless now.\"</p><p>I swallow and step forward. The fever and heat isn\u2019t there. There is nothing. My hand's shudder when I lift them and touch her and Abbey. Abbey looks confused, \"Aimee? Lorri?\"</p><p>Lorri nods a head toward Abbey, \"One at a time now Aimes. Her first.\"</p><p>I pull my hand off Lorri and squeeze Abbey's arm. She tries to pull away but I grip her hard.</p><p>\"Aimee!\" Her voice breaks with panic and fear. Terror fills her watery eyes. I close my eyes and do my thing. It's different. It's cool and refreshing. I don\u2019t feel like I'm feeding. I'm floating. I'm sailing down the river of her memories and thoughts. It's instant. I open my eyes. She is on the ground in a heap.</p><p>My eyes sting instantly when I look into her eyes, \"Don't leave me.\"</p><p>Lorri shakes her head, \"Never. You'll always have help Aimee.\" She offer's me her hand. I look back at the others. They look desperate. Aleks takes a step forward. I shake my head and look back at her. I close my eyes again. This time it's long and musical almost. Her memories are huge and amazing. They span the world's life. I see so many things all at once. I can't keep up. I don\u2019t keep them as memories or knowledge. They float past me in a cool breeze. Joy and pain, bliss and love. The way Abbey's face beams in her mind. There is a bright light, a flash. And then it's black.</p><p>I open my eyes. She is on the ground in a heap next to her love.</p><p>I step back. I don\u2019t want to touch them. I don\u2019t want them near me. My jaw trembles. I turn and look at Marcus. He shakes his head and sighs, \"Brilliant. Bloody brilliant.\"</p><p>I turn and face the others. The looks are the same. The faces are desperately sad and horrified.</p><p>My wings twitch in the dark wind.</p><p>\"How do we find Lillith now?\"</p><p>Aleks steps toward me and takes my hand in his.</p><p>\"How do we know what to do?\" Hanna asks.</p><p>Marcus paces, \"Henry. We find Henry. I can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t make me one of you.\"</p><p>Sam laughs and for the first time it's bitter and harsh, \"You can't?\"</p><p>Marcus snorts, \"Well of course I can, but I am still pissed about it.\"</p><p>Hanna looks at Sam's wings, \"How do we get rid of the wings?\"</p><p>In the dark we look awesome. There is no doubt. Our skin is slightly glowing, with a light that seems to be who we are now. Our wings are black as the night and filled with shiny black feathers. We all stand topless and glowing. The looks on our faces are all the same. Awe and confusion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You must pull them back in. You must forget everything else you think at the moment and pull them in.\"</p><p>We all look in one sweep at the voice speaking to us.</p><p>\"Henry. There you bloody well are. How could you?\" Marcus asks haughtily.</p> <p>Henry laughs, \"You not need me at the time. You need me now. Shamans know about need. We hear the calling.\"</p><p>Lucas makes a noise and then he stands wingless next to Ari. \"It's just like phasing.\" He says it like it's helpful.</p><p>Blake frowns, \"Oh, okay then.\" He makes a face. As I laugh Ben pulls his wings in.</p><p>Then Aleks does his. The rest of us are staring at them helplessly.</p><p>\"What does phasing feel like?\" Giselle asks.</p> <p>Shane pulls his back. \"Hah, just like the fangs.\"</p><p>Giselle pulls hers in at the same time as Hanna. Ari and I look at each other and laugh.</p><p>\"It's like exploding from your skin.\"</p><p>Blake frowns, \"And if you've never exploded?\"</p><p>Aleks laughs, \"Like when you run and you push the last couple seconds. Push the exertion.\"</p><p>Ari's wings pull in.</p> <p>I sigh and look at Blake. He shakes his head, \"We played a lot of WOW and didn\u2019t run, ever.\"</p><p>\"How can we suck at this? We're the smartest people here.\"</p><p>Marcus walks over and grabs my face, \"Orgasming Aimee.\"</p><p>I feel the flushing in my face and instantly my wings pull back. Blake's do as well.</p><p>\"See, you did it.\" Giselle smiles.</p><p>Marcus shrugs and walks to Henry, \"How do we find Lillith?\"</p><p>He shakes his face, \"She has the power. Impossible. You failed. Now you must prepare.\"</p><p>I snap, \"What does that even mean?\"</p> <p>Sam looks horrified as if a light bulb has come on for him, \"Oh my god. Revelations.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Blake asks.</p><p>Henry nods, \"The world as you knew it, is over. The world now is broken. You have seven years to fix it before it's too late.\"</p><p>\"Friggen hell. Great. Seven more years.\"</p><p>Ari beams, \"At least I can't switch the time anymore.\"</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>\"Where do we go from here?\"</p><p>Henry points at Shane, \"His house. Protected lands.\"</p><p>I laugh. Aleks laughs with me.</p><p>Everyone else shakes his or her head.</p><p>\"That stupid Shaman story is true?\" Shane asks, making Aleks and I laugh harder.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Lorri</p><p>The warm breeze billows through the pillar. I look at him and grin. He winks and he's there. He kisses me but then he pulls back, \"Wait if you're bloody well here, where are they?\" He looks past me.</p><p>I shake my head, \"Dorian, I had no choice. She got the magic.\"</p><p>He pulls back, \"How in the bloody hell did that happen?\"</p><p>\"I don\u2019t know. We were obviously betrayed. Is Michael still here?\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"No. Several of them fell recently.\"</p><p>I grimace, \"Then I guess that explains that.\"</p><p>The warmth is comforting. I sigh, \"I missed this place.\"</p><p>\"Have you seen Lydia and Annabelle yet?\"</p><p>\"No. O and Oliver both here as well?\"</p><p>\"The whole family. It's a bit intense.\"</p><p>I hear her shouting and running. I blush. Dorian rolls his eyes, \"Of course the human breaking the silence would be with you.\"</p><p>I look back and smile. She leaps into my arms. We kiss and it's the best feeling ever.</p><p>\"This is heaven?\" She asks.</p><p>I smile at her, \"It is.\"</p><p>\"Is O here?\"</p><p>I nod, \"Yup. Tristan and Phillip and O and Oliver and Lydia and Annabelle and everyone.\"</p><p>She grins and I kiss her again. Dorian groans behind me, \"Okay, I'm going to go find out about Michael. Someone knows something. I'm certain.\"</p><p>I close my eyes and let the warmth and peace seep in. After thousands of years believing I would never make it back, I can't believe I am here. With my girl.</p><p>Failure never felt so good.</p><p>\"Daughter.\" I pull back from the kiss. \"You hear that?\"</p><p>Abbey shakes her head.</p><p>\"Daughter.\"</p><p>I close my eyes and moan, \"Be right back.\" I step away from her and wink to the place. I stand in the shadows again and wait for it.</p><p>The air is still until his words sneak in like the fog, \"You failed.\"</p><p>I nod, the intensity of his voice makes me tremble, \"I did father. I'm so sorry.\"</p><p>\"You were betrayed by your brothers.\"</p><p>Tears leak from my eyes, \"I was father.\"</p><p>\"You are my most treasured creation Lucifer. You must know my love for you.\"</p><p>Dread tries to creep in, but His love is bigger than my own heart. I nod, \"I do father.\"</p><p>\"The sacrifice you made was met with unkindness and hatred. Yet you did as I asked. You saved them. You saved them all. The redeemers will save my children.\"</p><p>I nod and believe the words, \"They will father.\"</p><p>\"Thank you Lucifer. I may call upon you again.\"</p><p>My words become a whisper, \"Yes father.\"</p><p>The air and light moves and leaves me where I am, standing in the shadows. My skin crawls from the intense energy.</p><p>I look up and fight the begging in my mind that doesn\u2019t want to be called on again. Ever.</p><p>Aimee</p><p>The scene is my dream exactly. Bombs have dropped. Destruction is everywhere. People fighting in the anger that has overtaken the planet. Our country is ripe with pain and suffering, but still very far behind the rest of the world. South America is filled with Vampires and Succubus. Lillith has the power to make them all.</p><p>All varieties of demons.</p><p>She moves constantly. Never out of the company that shields her from us. But we fight her darkness with our own. It's a constant battle.</p><p>I look out at the city and sigh. The heat of the midday sun is intense in Rio. I glance at Aleks and grin. I get lost for a second. He shakes his head, \"Stop staring at them. It makes me feel weird when you do that.\"</p><p>\"What? You look hot with those in that black t-shirt. That\u2019s all.\"</p><p>He rolls his eyes, \"You look hot without your black t-shirt and I don\u2019t stare at you.\"</p><p>\"Yes, you do.\"</p><p>He ignores me, \"You ready?\"</p><p>I nod once. We jump together. Our wings shoot from our bodies. We sail to the ground and look out at the chaos and destruction everywhere. Lillith has used the magic she stole to make hell on earth.</p><p>\"I love you.\" I say.</p><p>He leans in and kisses me when our feet touch the ground, \"I love you more.\" Our wings pull in fast now.</p><p>I laugh, \"Cheesy and sad. You've been alive for hundreds of years and that\u2019s the best you got?\"</p><p>He nods, \"Yup. I love you so much that my brain stops functioning when you're near me.\"</p><p>I point at him, \"That I believe.\"</p><p>Hanna walks up with Sam, Ben, Giselle, and Shane with her.</p><p>Sam looks annoyed, \"We found another one.\"</p><p>\"Vampires?\"</p><p>Sam nods, \"And succubus.\"</p><p>\"Where is Ari?\"</p><p>Ben winces, \"With Luke. She isn\u2019t coming for this ride.\"</p><p>I look down the alley, \"Why.\"</p><p>\"Kids. She doesn\u2019t do kids.\"</p><p>Aleks nods, \"Fair enough. In the words of our fallen leader, let's do this.\"</p><p>We walk down the alley into the dark building, where dark creatures are doing the dark deeds.</p><p>Fortunately nothing is as dark as we are.</p><p>I enter the building first, with Hanna. The man standing at the front greeting guests, smiles when he sees me. \"Hello Madame.\" He says in English. His accent is strong.</p><p>I love the effect I get when they see them, so I flash my wings fast. I have slits in my shirts, so my clothes don\u2019t get ripped off like before.</p><p>His jaw drops, \"Do Diablo.\" He backs away with his hands out. I glance to my right at Hanna. She smirks and lets hers loose too.</p><p>He screams.</p><p>The whole house fills with screams.</p><p>It's music to my ears.</p><p>It's the end of something dark and sinister.</p><p>We leave the house at the end of the fight, with dirty blood and dirtier images bathing our bodies and minds.</p><p>It rolls off fast now. I feel good.</p><p>We wink home to Port Mackenzie.</p><p>Shane's house is an oddly delightful sight now.</p><p>Henry and the kids are there full time with us. He makes it feel warm and fuzzy all the time. Just like the spell he put on Marcus's house.</p><p>Shane's mom let us buy the house when she moved to the city. She was happy to get away from the small town and the gossip and the wedding of her ex to a twenty-seven year old. Some people think it's a hostel. Some think it's an Orphanage. My parents are just grateful I was able to find work in town. I run a research center as far as they know. I live with Shane and help him run the orphanage, with my boyfriend. Marcus does a lot of memory construction.</p><p>I walk through the front door and look at Aleks, \"Is the house in England safe yet?\"</p><p>\"No. We have to get Henry there to bless the land. Bombs have been dropped on a town close by to the house. The land might not be able to be blessed.\"</p><p>I frown, as he plants a huge kiss on my cheek.</p><p>Shane makes a face, \"Get a room.\"</p><p>Ben walks by and grabs Giselle's hand, \"You can't have ours.\" They are gone before I can mock them.</p><p>I look around, \"Where is Blake?\"</p><p>Shane laughs, \"Pretending to be busy, so we won't assume he's having sexy time with Alise.\"</p><p>\"Still?\"</p><p>He shrugs, \"He's in love.\"</p><p>I shake my head, \"I can't believe she hasn\u2019t moved on. I never saw that coming.\"</p><p>Aleks walks into the kitchen. I watch his butt when he walks.</p><p>Shane nudges me, \"I remember how it was before.\"</p><p>The words tiptoe through my mind. I spin around and see the truth of it on Shane's face, \"You do?\"</p><p>He nods slowly, \"I remember it the other ways.\"</p><p>\"Oh my god.\"</p><p>He shakes his head, \"No. This is the best possible outcome for us both. I just wanted you to know. You know, in case you catch me staring or something.\" He takes my hand in his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>I laugh and pull away, \"Great. Just great.\" I walk into the kitchen after Aleks who, is feeding Shakespeare and rubbing his hands over his furry black face. \"Who is a good kitty? Who? You are.\"</p><p>I lean into the frame of the wall and glance over at the sunroom. It forces a smile across my lips.</p><p>The End.</p>   </body></html>"]
