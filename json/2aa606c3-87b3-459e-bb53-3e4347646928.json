I\u2019ll give you a biscuit, any of my hair ribbons, anything! Oh, I\u2019m going to make a scarf out of you . . .\u201d</p><p>As soon as she caught her sister\u2019s pet, Poppy swore she was going to alert the management of the Rutledge that Beatrix was harboring wild creatures in their family suite, which was definitely against hotel policy. Of course, that might cause the entire Hathaway clan to be forcibly removed from the premises.</p><p>At the moment, Poppy didn\u2019t care.</p> <p>Dodger had stolen a love letter that had been sent to her from Michael Bayning, and nothing in the world mattered except retrieving it. All the situation needed was for Dodger to hide the blasted thing in some public place where it would be discovered. And then Poppy\u2019s chances of marrying a respectable and perfectly wonderful young man would be forever lost.</p><p>Dodger hurried through the luxurious hallways of the Rutledge Hotel in a sinuous lope, staying just out of reach. The letter was clamped in his long front teeth.</p><p>As she dashed after him, Poppy prayed that she would not be seen. No matter how reputable the hotel, a respectable young woman should never have left her suite unescorted. However, Miss Marks, her companion, was still abed. And Beatrix had gone for an early morning ride with their sister, Amelia.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for this, Dodger!\u201d</p><p>The mischievous creature thought everything in the world was for his own amusement. No basket or container could go without being overturned or investigated, no stocking or comb or handkerchief could be left alone. Dodger stole personal items and left them in heaps beneath chairs and sofas, and he took naps in drawers of clean clothes, and worst of all, he was so entertaining in his naughtiness that the entire Hathaway family was inclined to overlook his behavior.</p><p>Whenever Poppy objected to the ferret\u2019s outrageous antics, Beatrix was always apologetic and promised that Dodger would never do it again, and she seemed genuinely surprised when Dodger didn\u2019t heed her earnest lectures. And because Poppy loved her younger sister, she had tried to endure living with the obnoxious pet.</p> <p>This time, however, Dodger had gone too far.</p><p>The ferret paused at a corner, checked to make certain he was still being chased, and in his happy excitement, he did a little war dance, a series of sideways hops that expressed pure delight. Even now, when Poppy wanted to murder him, she couldn\u2019t help but acknowledge that he was adorable. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to die,\u201d she told him, approaching him in as unthreatening a manner as possible. \u201cGive me the letter, Dodger.\u201d</p><p>The ferret streaked past a colonnaded lightwell that admitted sunshine from overhead and sent it down three floors to the mezzanine level. Grimly, Poppy wondered how far she was going to have to chase him. He could cover quite a lot of territory, and the Rutledge was massive, occupying five full blocks in the theater district.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d she muttered beneath her breath, \u201cis what happens when you\u2019re a Hathaway. Misadventures . . . wild animals . . . house fires . . . curses . . . scandals . . .\u201d</p><p>Poppy loved her family dearly, but she longed for the kind of quiet, normal life that didn\u2019t seem possible for a Hathaway. She wanted peace. Predictability.</p><p>Dodger ran through the doorway of the third-floor steward\u2019s offices, which belonged to Mr. Brimbley. The steward was an elderly man with a full white mustache, the ends neatly waxed into points. As the Hathaways had stayed at the Rutledge many times in the past, Poppy knew that Brimbley reported every detail of what occurred on his floor to his superiors. If the steward found out what she was after, the letter would be confiscated, and Poppy\u2019s relationship with Michael would be exposed. And Michael\u2019s father, Lord Andover, would never approve of the match if there were even one whiff of impropriety attached to it.</p><p>Poppy caught her breath and backed up against the wall as Brimbley exited his offices with two of the Rutledge staff. \u201c. . . go to the front office at once, Harkins,\u201d the steward was saying. \u201cI want you to investigate the matter of Mr. W\u2019s room charges. He has a history of claiming that charges are incorrect when they are, in fact, accurate. From now on, I think it best to have him sign a receipt whenever a charge is made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Brimbley.\u201d The three men proceeded along the hallway, away from Poppy.</p> <p>Cautiously, she crept to the doorway of the offices and peeked around the jamb. The two connected rooms appeared to be unoccupied. \u201cDodger,\u201d she whispered urgently, and saw him scurry beneath a chair. \u201cDodger, do come here!\u201d</p><p>Which, of course, produced more excited hopping and dancing.</p><p>Biting her lower lip, Poppy went across the threshold. The main office room was generously sized, furnished with a massive desk piled high with ledgers and papers. An armchair upholstered in burgundy leather had been pushed up against the desk, while another was positioned near an empty fireplace with a marble mantel.</p><p>Dodger waited beside the desk, regarding Poppy with bright eyes. His whiskers twitched above the coveted letter. He held very still, holding Poppy\u2019s gaze as she inched toward him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she soothed, extending her hand slowly. \u201cWhat a good boy, a lovely boy . . . wait right there, and I\u2019ll take the letter and carry you back to our suite, and give you\u2014Drat!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just before she could grasp the letter, Dodger had slithered beneath the desk with it.</p><p>Red with fury, Poppy glanced around the room in search of something, anything, she could use to poke Dodger from his hiding place. Spying a candlestick in a silver holder on the mantel, she tried to pull it down. But the candle wouldn\u2019t budge. The silver holder had been affixed to the mantel.</p><p>Before Poppy\u2019s astonished eyes, the entire back of the fireplace rotated noiselessly. She gasped at the mechanical wizardry of the door as it revolved with a smooth automated motion. What had appeared to be solid brick was nothing but a textured fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>Gleefully, Dodger darted from the desk and went through the opening.</p> <p>\u201cBother,\u201d Poppy said breathlessly. \u201cDodger, don\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>But the ferret paid no heed. And to make matters worse, she could hear the rumble of Mr. Brimbley\u2019s voice as he returned to the room. \u201c. . . of course Mr. Rutledge must be informed. Put it in the report. And by all means don\u2019t forget\u2014\u201d</p><p>With no time to consider her options or the consequences, Poppy dashed through the fireplace, and the door closed behind her.</p><p>She was engulfed in near darkness as she waited, straining to hear what was happening inside the office. Apparently she had not been detected. Mr. Brimbley continued his conversation, something about reports and housekeeping concerns.</p><p>It occurred to Poppy that she might have to wait for a long time before the steward left the office again. Or she would have to find another way out. Of course, she could simply go back through the fireplace and announce her presence to Mr. Brimbley. However, she couldn\u2019t begin to imagine how much explaining she would have to do, and how embarrassing it would be.</p> <p>Turning, Poppy discerned that she was in a long passageway, with a source of diffused light coming from somewhere overhead. She looked upward. The passage was illuminated by a daylight shaft, similar to the ones that ancient Egyptians had used to determine the positioning of stars and planets.</p><p>She could hear the ferret creeping somewhere nearby. \u201cWell, Dodger,\u201d she muttered, \u201cyou got us into this. Why don\u2019t you help me find a door?\u201d</p><p>Obligingly Dodger advanced along the passageway and disappeared into the shadows. Poppy heaved a sigh and followed. She refused to panic, having learned during the Hathaways\u2019 many brushes with calamity that losing one\u2019s head never helped a situation.</p><p>As Poppy made her way through the darkness, she kept her fingertips against the wall to maintain her bearings. She had gone only a few yards when she heard a scraping noise. Freezing in place, Poppy waited and listened intently.</p><p>All was quiet.</p><p>But her nerves prickled with awareness and her heart began to drum as she saw the glow of yellow lamplight ahead. And then it was extinguished.</p> <p>She was not alone in the passageway.</p><p>The footsteps came closer, closer, with the swift purpose of a predator. Someone was heading right for her.</p><p>Now, Poppy decided, was the appropriate time to panic. Whirling around in full-scale alarm, she dashed back the way she had come. Being chased by unknown people in dark corridors was a novel experience even for a Hathaway. She cursed her heavy skirts, grabbing them up in frantic handfuls as she tried to run. But the person who chased her was much too fast to be eluded.</p><p>A cry escaped her as she was caught up in a brutal, expert grip. It was a man\u2014a large one\u2014and he seized her in a way that arched her back against his chest. One of his hands pressed her head sharply to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou should know,\u201d came a low, chilling voice close to her ear, \u201cthat with just a bit more pressure than this, I could snap your neck. Tell me your name, and what you\u2019re doing in here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Poppy could scarcely think above the blood rushing in her ears and the pain of his tight grasp. The stranger\u2019s chest was very hard behind her. \u201cThis is a mistake,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cPlease\u2014\u201d</p><p>He forced her head farther to the side until she felt a cruel pinch of the nerves in the joint between her neck and shoulder. \u201cYour name,\u201d he insisted gently.</p> <p>\u201cPoppy Hathaway,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d His hold loosened.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Why had he said her name as if he knew her? \u201cAre you . . . you must be one of the hotel staff?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question. One of his hands coasted lightly over her arms and her front as if he were searching for something. Her heart threshed like the wing beats of a small bird.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she gasped between fragmented breaths, arching away from his touch.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in here?\u201d He turned her to face him. No one of Poppy\u2019s acquaintance had ever handled her so familiarly. They were close enough to the overhead lightwell that Poppy could see the outline of hard, lean features and the glitter of deep-set eyes.</p><p>Fighting to catch her breath, Poppy winced at the sharp ache in her neck. She reached for it and tried to soothe the pain as she spoke. \u201cI was . . . I was chasing a ferret, and the fireplace in Mr. Brimbley\u2019s office opened, and we went through it and then I tried to find another way out.\u201d</p><p>Nonsensical as the explanation was, the stranger sorted through it efficiently. \u201cA ferret? One of your sister\u2019s pets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, bewildered. She rubbed her neck and winced. \u201cBut how did you know . . . have we met before? No, please don\u2019t touch me, I . . . ouch!\u201d</p><p>He had turned her around and had put his hand on the side of her neck. \u201cBe still.\u201d His touch was deft and sure as he massaged the tender nerve. \u201cIf you try to run from me, I\u2019ll only catch you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quivering, Poppy endured his kneading, probing fingers and wondered if she were at the mercy of a madman. He pressed harder, exacting a sensation that was neither pleasure nor pain but some unfamiliar mingling of the two. She made a sound of distress, writhing helplessly. To her surprise, the burn of the pinched nerve eased, and her rigid muscles went lax with relief. She went still and let out a long breath, her head dropping.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked, using both hands now, his thumbs stroking the back of her neck, slipping beneath the soft lace that trimmed the high-throated bodice of her dress.</p><p>Thoroughly unnerved, Poppy tried to step away from him, but his hands clamped on her shoulders instantly. She cleared her throat and attempted a dignified tone. \u201cSir, I\u2014I should like you to guide me out of here. My family will reward you. No questions will be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He released her slowly. \u201cNo one ever uses this passageway without my permission. I assumed that anyone in here was up to no good.\u201d</p> <p>The comments bore a resemblance to an apology, although his tone wasn\u2019t regretful in the least.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I had no intention of doing anything other than retrieving this atrocious animal.\u201d She felt Dodger rustling near the hem of her skirts.</p><p>The stranger bent and scooped up the ferret. Holding Dodger by the scruff of his neck, he handed him to Poppy.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The ferret\u2019s supple body went limp and compliant in Poppy\u2019s grasp. As she might have expected, the letter was gone. \u201cDodger, you blasted thief\u2014where is it? What have you done with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA letter,\u201d Poppy said tensely. \u201cDodger stole it and carried it in here . . . it must be somewhere nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be found later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, if you\u2019ve gone to such trouble to recover it. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Poppy murmured her assent and allowed him to take her elbow. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>There was no reply.</p> <p>\u201cI would prefer that no one knew about this,\u201d Poppy ventured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I rely on your discretion, sir? I must avoid scandal at all costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung women who wish to avoid scandal should probably stay in their hotel suites,\u201d he pointed out unhelpfully.</p><p>\u201cI was perfectly content to stay in my room,\u201d Poppy protested. \u201cIt was only because of Dodger that I had to leave. I must have my letter back. And I\u2019m certain my family will compensate you for your trouble, if you would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d</p><p>He found his way through the shadow-tricked passageway with no difficulty at all, his grip on Poppy\u2019s elbow gentle but inexorable. They did not go toward Mr. Brimbley\u2019s office but instead went the opposite direction, for what seemed an interminable distance.</p><p>Finally the stranger stopped and turned to a place in the wall, and pushed a door open. \u201cGo in.\u201d</p> <p>Hesitantly Poppy preceded him into a well-lit room, a sort of parlor, with a row of Palladian windows overlooking the street. A heavy oak drafting table occupied one side of the room, and bookshelves lined nearly every inch of wall space. There was a pleasant and oddly familiar mixture of scents in the air\u2014candle wax and vellum and ink and book dust\u2014it smelled like her father\u2019s old study.</p><p>Poppy turned toward the stranger, who had come into the room and closed the concealed door.</p><p>It was difficult to ascertain his age\u2014he appeared to be on the early side of his thirties, but there was an air of hard-bitten worldliness about him, a sense that he had seen enough of life to cease being surprised by anything. He had heavy, well-cut hair, black as midnight, and a fair complexion in which his dark brows stood out in striking contrast. And he was as handsome as Lucifer, his brows strong, the nose straight and defined, the mouth brooding. The angle of his jaw was sharp, tenacious, anchoring the grave features of a man who perhaps took everything\u2014including himself\u2014a bit too seriously.</p><p>Poppy felt herself flush as she stared into a pair of remarkable eyes . . . intense cool green with dark rims, shadowed by bristly black lashes. His gaze seemed to take her in, consuming every detail. She noticed faint shadows beneath his eyes, but they did nothing to impair his hard-faced good looks.</p><p>A gentleman would have uttered some pleasantry, something reassuring, but the stranger remained silent.</p><p>Why did he stare at her like that? Who was he, and what authority did he wield in this place?</p><p>She had to say something, anything, to break the tension. \u201cThe smell of books and candle wax,\u201d she remarked inanely, \u201c. . . it reminds me of my father\u2019s study.\u201d</p><p>The man stepped toward her, and Poppy shrank back reflexively. They both went still. It seemed that questions filled the air between them as if they had been written in invisible ink.</p><p>\u201cYour father passed away some time ago, I believe.\u201d His voice matched the rest of him, polished, dark, inflexible. He had an interesting accent, not fully British, the vowels flat and open, the r\u2019s heavy.</p><p>Poppy gave a bewildered nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother soon after,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cHow . . . how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my business to know as much about the hotel guests as possible.\u201d</p><p>Dodger wriggled in her grasp. Poppy bent to set him down. The ferret pranced to an oversized chair near a small hearth, and settled deep into the velvet upholstery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy brought herself to look at the stranger again. He was dressed in beautiful dark clothes, tailored with sophisticated looseness. Fine garments, but he wore a simple black cravat with no pins, and there were no gold buttons on his shirt, or any other ornamentation that would proclaim him as a gentleman of means. Only a plain watch chain at the front of his gray waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like an American,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBuffalo, New York,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I\u2019ve lived here for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you employed by Mr. Rutledge?\u201d she asked cautiously.</p> <p>A single nod was her answer.</p><p>\u201cYou are one of his managers, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>His face was inscrutable. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>She began to inch toward the door. \u201cThen I will leave you to your labors, Mister . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need a proper companion to walk back with you.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy considered that. Should she ask him to send for her companion? No . . . Miss Marks was probably still sleeping. It had been a difficult night for her. Miss Marks was sometimes prone to nightmares that left her shaky and exhausted the next day. It didn\u2019t happen often, but when it did, Poppy and Beatrix tried to let her rest as much as possible afterward.</p><p>The stranger contemplated her for a moment. \u201cShall I send for a housemaid to accompany you?\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s first inclination was to agree. But she didn\u2019t want to wait here with him, even for a few minutes. She didn\u2019t trust him in the least.</p><p>As he saw her indecision, his mouth twisted sardonically. \u201cIf I were going to molest you,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cI would have done so by now.\u201d</p><p>Her flush deepened at his bluntness. \u201cSo you say. But for all I know, you could be a very slow molester.\u201d</p><p>He looked away for a moment, and when he glanced back at her, his eyes were bright with amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, Miss Hathaway.\u201d His voice was rich with unspent laughter. \u201cReally. Let me send for a maid.\u201d</p> <p>The glow of humor changed his face, imparting such warmth and charm that Poppy was almost startled. She felt her heart begin to pump some new and agreeable feeling through her body.</p><p>As she watched him go to the bellpull, Poppy recalled the problem of the missing letter. \u201cSir, while we wait, would you be so kind as to look for the letter that was lost in the passageway? I must have it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, returning to her.</p><p>\u201cPersonal reasons,\u201d Poppy said shortly.</p><p>\u201cIs it from a man?\u201d</p><p>She did her best to deliver the kind of withering glance she had seen Miss Marks give to importunate gentlemen. \u201cThat is none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything that occurs in this hotel is my concern.\u201d He paused, studying her. \u201cIt is from a man, or you would have said otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Poppy turned her back to him. She went to look more closely at one of the many shelves lined with peculiar objects.</p> <p>She discovered a gilded, enameled samovar, a large knife in a beaded sheath, collections of primitive stone carvings and pottery vessels, an Egyptian headrest, exotic coins, boxes made of every conceivable material, what looked like an iron sword with a rusted blade, and a Venetian glass reading stone.</p><p>\u201cWhat room is this?\u201d Poppy couldn\u2019t help asking.</p><p>\u201cMr. Rutledge\u2019s curiosities room. He collected many of the objects, others are gifts from foreign visitors. Have a look if you like.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was intrigued, reflecting on the large contingent of foreigners among the hotel guests, including European royalty, nobility, and members of the corps diplomatique. No doubt some unusual gifts had been presented to Mr. Rutledge.</p><p>Browsing among the shelves, Poppy paused to examine a jeweled silver figurine of a horse, its hooves extended in mid-gallop. \u201cHow lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift from the Crown Prince Yizhu of China,\u201d the man behind her said. \u201cA Celestial horse.\u201d</p><p>Fascinated, Poppy ran a fingertip along the figure\u2019s back. \u201cNow the prince has been crowned as the Emperor Xianfeng,\u201d she said. \u201cA rather ironic ruling name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Coming to stand beside her, the stranger glanced at her alertly. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it means \u2018universal prosperity.\u2019 And that is certainly not the case, considering the internal rebellions he is facing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say the challenges from Europe are an even greater danger to him, at present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Poppy said ruefully, nudging the figurine back into place. \u201cOne wonders how long Chinese sovereignty can last against such an onslaught.\u201d</p><p>Her companion was standing close enough that she could detect the scents of pressed linen and shaving soap. He stared at her intently. \u201cI know very few women who are able to discuss Far East politics.\u201d</p><p>She felt color rise in her cheeks. \u201cMy family has rather unusual conversations around the supper table. At least, they\u2019re unusual in that my sisters and I always take part. My companion says it\u2019s perfectly all right to do that at home, but she has advised me not to appear too learned when I\u2019m out in society. It tends to drive away suitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be careful, then,\u201d he said softly, smiling. \u201cIt would be a shame for some intelligent comment to slip out at the wrong moment.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was relieved when she heard a discreet tap at the door. The maid had come sooner than she had expected. The stranger went to answer. Opening the door a crack, he murmured something to the maid, who bobbed a curtsey and disappeared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere is she going?\u201d Poppy asked, nonplussed. \u201cShe was supposed to escort me to my suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent her to fetch a tea tray.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was momentarily speechless. \u201cSir, I can\u2019t have tea with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long.

I\u2019m sure you are well aware of how improper it would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly as improper as sneaking through the hotel unescorted,\u201d he agreed smoothly, and she scowled.</p><p>\u201cI was not sneaking, I was chasing a ferret.\u201d Hearing herself make such a ridiculous statement, she felt her color rise. She attempted a dignified tone. \u201cThe situation was not at all of my making. And I will be in very . . . serious . . . trouble . . . if I am not returned to my room soon. If we wait much longer, you may find yourself involved in a scandal, which I am certain Mr. Rutledge would not approve of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen please call the maid back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo late. We\u2019ll have to wait until she comes with the tea.\u201d</p><p>Poppy heaved a sigh. \u201cThis has been a most difficult morning.\u201d Glancing at the ferret, she saw bits of fluff and clumps of horsehair being tossed in the air, and she blanched. \u201cNo, Dodger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the man asked, following as Poppy raced toward the busy ferret.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s eating your chair,\u201d she said miserably, scooping up the ferret. \u201cOr rather, Mr. Rutledge\u2019s chair. He\u2019s trying to make a nest for himself. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She stared at the gaping hole in the thick, luxurious velvet upholstery. \u201cI promise you, my family will pay for the damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d the man said. \u201cThere\u2019s a monthly allotment in the hotel budget for repairs.\u201d</p><p>Lowering to her haunches\u2014not an easy feat when one was wearing stay laces and stiffened petticoats\u2014Poppy grabbed bits of fluff and tried to stuff them back into the hole. \u201cIf necessary, I will provide a written statement to explain how this happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your reputation?\u201d the stranger asked gently, reaching down to pull her to a standing position.</p><p>\u201cMy reputation is nothing compared to a man\u2019s livelihood. You might be sacked for this. You undoubtedly have a family to support\u2014a wife and children\u2014and whereas I could survive the disgrace, you might not be able to secure a new position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is very kind of you,\u201d he said, taking the ferret from Poppy\u2019s grasp and depositing him back on the chair. \u201cBut I have no family. And I can\u2019t be sacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDodger,\u201d Poppy said anxiously, as bits of fluff went flying again. Clearly the ferret was having a grand time.</p><p>\u201cThe chair is already ruined. Let him have at it.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was bemused by the stranger\u2019s easy consignment of an expensive piece of hotel furniture to a ferret\u2019s mischief. \u201cYou,\u201d she said distinctly, \u201care not like the other managers here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not like other young women.\u201d</p><p>That elicited a wry smile from her. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p> <p>The sky had turned the color of pewter. A heavy drizzle fell to the gravel-covered paving blocks of the street, tamping down the pungent dust that had been stirred by passing vehicles.</p><p>Taking care not to be seen from the street, Poppy went to the side of one window and watched pedestrians scatter. Some methodically unfolded umbrellas and continued walking.</p><p>Costermongers crowded the thoroughfare, hawking their wares with impatient cries. They sold everything imaginable: ropes of onions and braces of dead game, teapots, flowers, matches, and caged larks and nightingales. This last presented frequent problems to the Hathaways, as Beatrix was determined to rescue every living creature she saw. Many a bird had been reluctantly purchased by their brother-in-law, Mr. Rohan, and set free at their country estate. Rohan swore that by now he had purchased half the avian population in Hampshire.</p><p>Turning from the window, Poppy saw that the stranger had settled his shoulder against one of the bookshelves and folded his arms across his chest. He was watching her as if puzzling what to make of her. Despite his relaxed posture, Poppy had the unnerving sense that if she tried to bolt, he would catch her in an instant.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you betrothed to anyone?\u201d he asked with startling directness. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out in society for two, three years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d Poppy said, feeling more than a little defensive.</p><p>\u201cYour family is one of means\u2014one would assume you have a generous dowry on the table. Your brother is a viscount\u2014another advantage. Why haven\u2019t you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always ask such personal questions of people you\u2019ve just met?\u201d Poppy asked in amazement.</p><p>\u201cNot always. But I find you . . . interesting.\u201d</p><p>She considered the question he had put to her, and shrugged. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want any of the gentlemen I\u2019ve met during the past three years. None of them are remotely appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of man appeals to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone with whom I could share a quiet, ordinary life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost young women dream of excitement and romance.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly. \u201cI suppose I have a great appreciation for the mundane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it occurred to you that London is the wrong place to seek a quiet, ordinary life?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course. But I\u2019m not in a position to look in the right places.\u201d She should have stopped there. There was no need to explain more. But it was one of Poppy\u2019s failings that she loved conversation, and like Dodger facing a drawer full of garters, she couldn\u2019t resist indulging. \u201cThe problem began when my brother, Lord Ramsay, inherited the title.\u201d</p><p>The stranger\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cThat was a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Poppy said earnestly. \u201cYou see, none of the Hathaways were prepared for it. We were distant cousins of the previous Lord Ramsay. The title only came to Leo because of a series of untimely deaths. The Hathaways had no knowledge of etiquette\u2014we knew nothing of the ways of the upper classes. We were happy in Primrose Place.\u201d</p><p>She paused to sort through the comforting memories of her childhood: the cheerful cottage with its thatched roof, the flower garden where her father had tended his prized Apothecary\u2019s Roses, the pair of lop-eared Belgian rabbits who had lived in a hutch near the back doorstep, the piles of books in every corner. Now the abandoned cottage was in ruins and the garden lay fallow.</p> <p>\u201cBut there\u2019s never any going back, is there,\u201d she said rather than asked. She bent to regard an object on a lower shelf. \u201cWhat is this? Oh. An astrolabe.\u201d She picked up an intricate brass disk that contained engraved plates, the rim notched with degrees of arc.</p><p>\u201cYou know what an astrolabe is?\u201d the stranger asked, following her.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. A tool used by astronomers and navigators. Also astrologers.\u201d Poppy inspected the tiny star chart etched in one of the disks. \u201cThis is Persian. I would estimate it to be about five hundred years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred and twelve,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>Poppy couldn\u2019t repress a satisfied grin. \u201cMy father was a medieval scholar. He had a collection of these. He even taught me how to make one out of wood, string, and a nail.\u201d She dialed the disks carefully. \u201cWhat is the date of your birth?\u201d</p> <p>The stranger hesitated before replying, as if he disliked having to give information about himself. \u201cNovember the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were born under Scorpius\u2019s reign,\u201d she said, turning the astrolabe over in her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou believe in astrology?\u201d he asked, his tone edged with derision.</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has no scientific basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father always encouraged me to be open-minded about such matters.\u201d She played a fingertip across the star chart, and looked up at him with a sly smile. \u201cScorpions are quite ruthless, you know. That is why Artemis bid one of them to kill her foe Orion. And as a reward, she set the scorpion up in the sky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not ruthless. I merely do whatever it takes to achieve my goals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not ruthless?\u201d Poppy asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cThe word implies cruelty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not cruel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when necessary.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s amusement dissolved. \u201cCruelty is never necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen much of the world, if you can say that.\u201d</p><p>Deciding not to pursue the subject, Poppy stood on her toes to view the contents of another shelf. It featured an intriguing collection of what looked like tinplate toys. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAutomata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they for?\u201d</p><p>He reached up, lifted one of the painted metal objects, and gave it to her.</p><p>Holding the machine by its circular base, Poppy examined it carefully. There were a group of tiny racehorses, each on its own track. Seeing the end of a pull cord on the side of the base, Poppy tugged it gently. That set off a series of inner mechanisms, including a flywheel, which sent the little horses spinning around the track as if they were racing.</p><p>Poppy laughed in delight. \u201cHow clever! I wish my sister Beatrix could see this. Where did it come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Rutledge fashions them in his spare time, as a means of relaxing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I see another?\u201d Poppy was enchanted by the objects, which were not toys so much as miniature feats of engineering. There was Admiral Nelson on a little tossing ship, a monkey climbing a banana tree, a cat playing with mice, and a lion tamer who cracked his whip while the lion shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>Seeming to enjoy Poppy\u2019s interest, the stranger showed her a picture on the wall, a tableau of couples waltzing at a ball. Before her wide eyes, the picture seemed to come to life, gentlemen guiding their partners smoothly across the floor. \u201cGood heavens,\u201d Poppy said in wonder. \u201cHow is it done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA clockwork mechanism.\u201d He removed the picture from the wall and displayed the open back. \u201cThere it is, attached to a flywheel by that drive band. And the pins work these wire levers . . . here . . . which in turn activate the other levers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemarkable!\u201d In her enthusiasm, Poppy forgot to be guarded or cautious. \u201cObviously Mr. Rutledge is mechanically gifted. This brings to mind a biography I read recently, about Roger Bacon, a Franciscan friar of the Middle Ages. My father was a great admirer of his work. Friar Bacon did a great deal of mechanical experimentation, which of course led some people to accuse him of sorcery. It was said that he once built a mechanical bronze head, which\u2014\u201d Poppy stopped abruptly, realizing she had been chattering. \u201cThere, you see? This is what I do at balls and soir\u00e9es. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m not sought after.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had begun to smile. \u201cI thought talking was encouraged at such affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my sort of talking.\u201d</p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p>They both turned at the sound. The maid had arrived.</p><p>\u201cI must go,\u201d Poppy said uneasily. \u201cMy companion will be very distressed if she wakes to find me missing.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired stranger contemplated her for what seemed a very long time. \u201cI\u2019m not finished with you yet,\u201d he said with stunning casualness. As if no one ever refused him anything. As if he planned to keep her with him for as long as he wished.</p><p>Poppy took a deep breath. \u201cNevertheless, I am leaving,\u201d she said calmly, and went to the door.</p><p>He reached it at the same time she did, one hand flattening against the door panel.</p><p>Alarm jolted through her, and she turned to face him. A swift, frantic throbbing awakened in her throat and wrists and the backs of her knees. He was standing much too close, his long, hard body nearly touching hers. She shrank against the wall.</p><p>\u201cBefore you leave,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI have some advice for you. It\u2019s not safe for a young woman to wander alone through the hotel. Don\u2019t take such a foolish risk again.\u201d</p><p>Poppy stiffened. \u201cIt\u2019s a reputable hotel,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nothing to fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re looking right at it.\u201d</p><p>And before she could think, or move, or breathe, he bent his head and took her mouth with his.</p><p>Stunned, Poppy went motionless beneath the soft, burning kiss, so subtle in its demand that she wasn\u2019t aware of the moment her own lips parted. His hands came to her jaw, cradling, angling her face upward.</p><p>One arm slid around her, bringing her body fully against his, and the feel of him was hard and richly stimulating. With every breath, she drew in an enticing scent, an incense of amber and musk, starched linen and male skin. She should have struggled in his arms . . . but his mouth was so tenderly persuasive, erotic, imparting messages of peril and promise. His lips slid to her throat and he hunted for her pulse, working his way downward, layering sensations like silken gauze until she shivered and arched away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>The stranger gripped her chin carefully, forcing her to look at him. They both went still. As Poppy met his searching gaze, she saw a flash of baffled animosity, as if he had just made some unwelcome discovery.</p><p>He let go of her with great care and opened the door. \u201cBring it in,\u201d he told the maid, who waited at the threshold with a large silver tea tray.</p><p>The servant obeyed quickly, too well trained to evince curiosity about Poppy\u2019s presence in the room.</p><p>The man went to retrieve Dodger, who had fallen asleep in his chair. Returning with the drowsy ferret, he gave it to Poppy. She took Dodger with an inarticulate murmur, cradling him against her midriff. The ferret\u2019s eyes remained closed, lids completely concealed in the black mask that crossed his face. She felt the tapping of his tiny heartbeat beneath her fingertips, the silkiness of the white undercoat beneath the overlying guard hairs.</p><p>\u201cWill there be anything else, sir?\u201d the maid asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I want you to accompany this lady to her suite. And come back to inform me when she is safely returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Rutledge.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Rutledge?</p><p>Poppy felt her heart stop. She looked back at the stranger. Deviltry glittered in his green eyes. He seemed to relish her open astonishment.</p><p>Harry Rutledge . . . the mysterious and reclusive owner of the hotel. Who was nothing at all as she had imagined him to be.</p><p>Bewildered and mortified, Poppy turned from him. She crossed the threshold and heard the door close, the latch clicking smoothly shut. How wicked he was, to have amused himself at her expense! She consoled herself with the knowledge that she would never see him again.</p><p>And she went down the hallway with the housemaid . . . never suspecting that the course of her entire life had just changed.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Harry went to stare at the fire in the hearth.</p><p>\u201cPoppy Hathaway,\u201d he whispered as if it were a magical incantation.</p><p>He had seen her from a distance on two occasions, once when she had been entering a carriage at the front of the hotel, and once at a ball held at the Rutledge. Harry hadn\u2019t attended the event, but he had watched for a few minutes from a vantage point at an upper floor balcony. Despite her fine-spun beauty and mahogany hair, he hadn\u2019t spared her a second thought.</p><p>Meeting her in person, however, had been a revelation.</p><p>Harry began to lower himself into a chair and noted the shredded velvet and clumps of stuffing left by the ferret.</p><p>A reluctant smile curved his lips as he moved to take the other chair.</p><p>Poppy. How artless she had been, chatting casually about astrolabes and Franciscan monks as she had browsed among his treasures. She had thrown out words in bright clusters, as if she were scattering confetti. She had radiated a kind of cheery astuteness that should have been annoying, but instead it had given him unexpected pleasure. There was something about her, something . . . it was what the French called esprit, a liveliness of mind and spirit. And that face . . . innocent and knowing, and open.</p><p>He wanted her.</p><p>Usually Jay Harry Rutledge was given something before it ever occurred to him to want it. In his busy, well-regulated life, meals arrived before he was hungry, cravats were replaced before they had shown any signs of wear, reports were placed on his desk before he asked for them. And women were everywhere, and always available, and every last one of them told him what she assumed he wanted to hear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry was aware that it was high time to marry. At least, most of his acquaintances assured him that it was high time, although he suspected it was because they had all put that particular noose around their own necks and wanted him to do the same. He had considered it without enthusiasm. But Poppy Hathaway was too compelling to resist.</p><p>Reaching into his left coat sleeve, Harry tugged out Poppy\u2019s letter. It was addressed to her from the Honourable Michael Bayning. He considered what he knew of the young man. Bayning had attended Winchester, where his studious nature had acquitted him well. Unlike other young men at university, Bayning had never gotten into debt, and there had been no scandals. More than a few women were attracted by his good looks and even more by the title and fortune he would inherit someday.</p><p>Frowning, Harry began to read.</p><p>Dearest love,</p> <p>As I reflected on our last conversation, I kissed the place on my wrist where your tears fell. How can you not believe that I weep the same tears every day and night that we\u2019re apart? You have made it impossible for me to think of anyone or anything but you. I am mad with ardor for you, don\u2019t doubt it in the least.</p><p>If you will be patient only a bit longer, I will soon find the opportunity to approach my father. Once he understands how utterly and completely I adore you, I know he will give his approval to our union. We have a close bond, Father and I, and he has indicated that he wishes to see me as happy in my marriage as he was with my mother, God rest her soul. How she would have enjoyed you, Poppy . . . your sensible, happy nature, your love of family and home. If only she were here to help persuade my father that there could be no better wife for me than you.</p><p>Wait for me, Poppy, as I am waiting for you.</p><p>I am, as always, forever under your spell,</p><p>\u2014M</p> <p>A quiet, scoffing breath escaped him. Harry stared into the hearth, his face still, his mind busy with schemes. A log broke, part of it falling from the grate with a plush pop, sending out fresh heat and white sparks. Bayning wanted Poppy to wait? Unfathomable, when every cell in Harry\u2019s body was charged with impatient desire.</p><p>Closing the note with the care of a man handling valuable currency, Harry slipped it into his coat pocket.</p><p>Once Poppy was safely inside the family suite, she settled Dodger into his favorite sleeping place, a basket that her sister Beatrix had lined with soft cloth. The ferret remained asleep, as limp as a rag.</p><p>Standing, Poppy leaned back against the wall and closed her eyes. A sigh slid upward from her lungs.</p><p>Why had he done it?</p><p>More importantly, why had she allowed it?</p> <p>It was not the way a man should have kissed an innocent girl. Poppy was mortified that she had landed herself in such a position, and even more that she had behaved in a way she would have judged harshly in someone else. She felt very certain of her feelings for Michael.</p><p>Why, then, had she responded to Harry Rutledge in such a way?</p><p>Poppy wished she could ask someone, but her instincts warned that it was a matter best forgotten.</p><p>Clearing the worried grimace from her face, Poppy tapped at her companion\u2019s door. \u201cMiss Marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d came a wan voice.</p><p>Poppy entered the small bedroom and found Miss Marks in her nightgown, standing at the washstand.</p><p>Miss Marks looked dreadful, her complexion ashen, her quiet blue eyes shadowed the color of bruises. Her light brown hair, usually braided and pinned in a scrupulous knot, was loose and tangled. After tilting a paper of medicinal powder to the back of her tongue, she took an unsteady gulp of water.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Poppy said softly. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p> <p>Miss Marks shook her head and then winced. \u201cNothing, Poppy. Thank you, you\u2019re very kind to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore nightmares?\u201d Poppy watched in concern as she went to a dresser and rummaged for stockings and garters and undergarments.</p><p>\u201cYes. I shouldn\u2019t have slept so late. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive. I only wish your dreams were more pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, most of the time.\u201d Miss Marks smiled faintly. \u201cMy best dreams are of being back at Ramsay House, with the elders in bloom and the nuthatches nesting in the hedgerow. Everything peaceful and safe. How I miss it all.\u201d</p><p>Poppy missed Ramsay House, too. London, with all its sophisticated delights and entertainments, could not hold a candle to Hampshire. And she was eager to see her older sister Win, whose husband Merripen was managing the Ramsay estate. \u201cThe season\u2019s almost over,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back there soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I live that long,\u201d Miss Marks muttered.</p><p>Poppy smiled sympathetically. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you return to bed? I\u2019ll fetch a cool cloth for your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t give in to it. I\u2019m going to dress and have a cup of strong tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you\u2019d say,\u201d Poppy commented wryly.</p><p>Miss Marks had been steeped in the classic British temperament, possessing a deep suspicion of all things sentimental or carnal. She was a young woman, barely older than Poppy, with a preternatural composure that would have allowed her to face any disaster, whether divine or man-made, without blinking an eye. The only time Poppy had ever seen her ruffled was when she was in the company of Leo, the Hathaways\u2019 brother, whose sarcastic wit seemed to annoy Miss Marks beyond endurance.</p><p>Two years earlier, Miss Marks had been hired as a governess, not to supplement the girls\u2019 academic learning, but to teach them the infinite variety of rules for young ladies who wished to navigate the hazards of upper society. Now her position was that of paid companion and chaperone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the beginning, Poppy and Beatrix had been daunted by the challenge of learning so many social rules. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a game of it,\u201d Miss Marks had declared, and she had written a series of poems for the girls to memorize.</p><p>For example:</p><p>If a lady you wish to be,</p><p>Behave with all formality.</p> <p>At supper when you sit to eat,</p><p>Don\u2019t refer to beef as \u201cmeat.\u201d</p><p>Never gesture with your spoon,</p><p>Or use your fork as a harpoon.</p><p>Please don\u2019t play with your food,</p> <p>And try to keep your voice subdued.</p><p>When it came to taking public walks:</p><p>Don\u2019t go running in the street,</p><p>And if a stranger you should meet,</p><p>Do not acknowledge him or her,</p><p>But to your chaperone defer.</p> <p>When crossing mud, I beg,</p><p>Don\u2019t raise your skirts and show your leg.</p><p>Instead draw them slightly up and to the right,</p><p>Keeping ankles out of sight.</p><p>For Beatrix, there were also special codas:</p><p>When paying calls, wear gloves and hat,</p><p>And never bring a squirrel, or rat,</p><p>Or any four-legged creatures who</p> <p>Do not belong indoors with you.</p><p>The unconventional approach had worked, giving Poppy and Beatrix enough confidence to participate in the season without disgracing themselves. The family had praised Miss Mark for her cleverness. All except for Leo, who had told her sardonically that Elizabeth Barrett Browning had nothing to fear. And Miss Marks had replied that she doubted Leo had sufficient mental aptitude to judge the merits of any kind of poetry at all.</p><p>Poppy had no idea why her brother and Miss Marks displayed such antagonism toward each other.</p><p>\u201cI think they secretly like each other,\u201d Beatrix had said mildly.</p><p>Poppy had been so astonished by the idea, she had laughed. \u201cThey war with each other whenever they\u2019re in the same room, which, thank heavens, isn\u2019t often. Why would you suggest such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you consider the mating habits of certain animals\u2014ferrets, for example\u2014it can be quite a rough-and-tumble business\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBea, please don\u2019t talk about mating habits,\u201d Poppy said, trying to suppress a grin. Her nineteen-year-old sister had a perpetual and cheerful disregard for propriety. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s vulgar, and . . . how do you know about mating habits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVeterinary books, mostly. But also from occasional glimpses. Animals aren\u2019t very discreet, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not. But do keep such thoughts to yourself, Bea. If Miss Marks heard you, she would write another poem for us to memorize.\u201d</p><p>Bea looked at her for a moment, her blue eyes innocent. \u201cYoung ladies never contemplate . . . the ways that creatures procreate . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr their companion will be irate,\u201d Poppy finished for her.</p><p>Beatrix had grinned. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t be attracted to each other. Leo is a viscount, and he\u2019s quite handsome, and Miss Marks is intelligent and pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard Leo aspire to marry an intelligent woman,\u201d Poppy had said. \u201cBut I agree\u2014Miss Marks is very pretty. Especially of late. She used to be so dreadfully thin and white, I didn\u2019t think much of her looks. But now she\u2019s filled out a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least a stone,\u201d Beatrix had confirmed. \u201cAnd she seems much happier. When we first met her, I think she had been through some dreadful experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too. I wonder if we\u2019ll ever find out what it was?\u201d</p><p>Poppy hadn\u2019t been certain of the answer. But as she glanced at Miss Marks\u2019s weary face this morning, she thought there was a good chance that her recurrent nightmares had something to do with her mysterious past.</p><p>Going to the wardrobe, Poppy viewed the row of tidy, neatly pressed dresses made up with quiet colors and prim white collars and cuffs. \u201cWhich dress shall I find for you?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cAny of them. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Poppy chose a dark blue wool twill, and laid the dress out on the rumpled bed. Tactfully she looked away as her companion removed her nightgown and donned a chemise and drawers and stockings.</p><p>The last thing Poppy wanted to do was trouble Miss Marks when her head was aching. However, the events of the morning had to be confessed. If any hint of her misadventure involving Harry Rutledge ever got out, it was far better for her companion to be prepared.</p><p>\u201cMiss Marks,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to make your headache worse but I have something to tell you . . .\u201d Her voice trailed away as Miss Marks shot her a brief, pained glance.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>Now was not a good time, Poppy decided. In fact . . . was there any obligation to say anything ever? In all likelihood, she would never see Harry Rutledge again. He certainly didn\u2019t attend the same social events the Hathaways did. And really, why would he bother causing trouble for a girl who was so far beneath his notice? He had nothing to do with her world, nor she with his.</p><p>\u201cI dropped a bit of something-or-other on the bodice of my pink muslin frock the other evening at supper,\u201d Poppy improvised. \u201cAnd now there\u2019s a grease stain on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d Miss Marks paused in the middle of hooking up the front of her corset. \u201cWe\u2019ll mix a solution of hartshorn powder and water and sponge the stain. Hopefully that will take it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>Feeling only the tiniest bit guilty, Poppy picked up Miss Marks\u2019s discarded nightgown and folded it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Jake Valentine had been born a filius nullius, the Latin term for \u201cson of nobody.\u201d His mother Edith had been a maidservant for a well-to-do barrister in Oxford, and his father the selfsame barrister. Contriving to rid himself of mother and son in one fell swoop, the barrister had bribed a loutish farmer to marry Edith. At the age of ten, having had enough of the farmer\u2019s bullying and beatings, Jake had left home for good and struck out for London.</p><p>He had labored in a blacksmith\u2019s forge for ten years, gaining significant size and strength, as well as a reputation for hard work and trustworthiness. It had never occurred to Jake to want more for himself. He had been employed, and his belly had been full, and the world outside London held no interest for him.</p><p>One day, however, a dark-haired man came to the blacksmith\u2019s shop and asked to speak to Jake. Intimidated by the gentleman\u2019s fine clothes and sophisticated bearing, Jake mumbled answers to a multitude of questions about his personal history and his work experience. And then the man astonished Jake by offering employment as his own valet, with many times the wages he was now getting.</p> <p>Suspiciously, Jake had asked why the man would hire a novice, largely uneducated and roughcast in nature and appearance. \u201cYou could have your pick of the finest valets in London,\u201d Jake had pointed out. \u201cWhy someone like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause those valets are notorious gossips, and they\u2019re acquainted with the servants of leading families across England and the continent. You have a reputation for keeping your mouth shut, which I value far more than experience. Also, you look as though you could give a good account of yourself in a dustup.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes had narrowed. \u201cWhy would a valet need to fight?\u201d</p><p>The man had smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be doing errands for me. Some of them will be easy, some of them less so. Come, are you in or not?\u201d</p><p>And that was how Jake had come to work for Jay Harry Rutledge, first as a valet, and then as an assistant.</p> <p>Jake had never known anyone like Rutledge\u2014eccentric, driven, manipulative, demanding. Rutledge had a shrewder understanding of human nature than anyone Jake had ever met. Within a few minutes of meeting someone, he sized them up with complete accuracy. He knew how to make people do what he wanted, and he nearly always got his way.</p><p>It seemed to Jake that Rutledge\u2019s brain never shut off, not even for the necessary act of sleeping. He was constantly active. Jake had seen him work out some problem in his head while simultaneously writing a letter and carrying on a fully coherent conversation. His appetite for information was voracious, and he possessed a singular gift for recall. Once Rutledge saw or read or heard something, it was in his brain forever. People could never lie to him, and if they were foolish enough to try, he decimated them.</p><p>Rutledge was not above gestures of kindness or consideration, and he rarely lost his temper. But Jake had never been certain how much, if at all, Rutledge cared for his fellow men. At his core, he was cold as a glacier. And as many things as Jake knew about Harry Rutledge, they were still essentially strangers.</p><p>No matter. Jake would have died for the man. The hotelier had secured the loyalty of all his servants, who were made to work hard but were given fair treatment and generous salaries. In return, they safeguarded his privacy zealously. Rutledge was acquainted with a great many people, but these friendships were rarely discussed. And he was highly selective about whom he admitted into his inner circle.</p><p>Rutledge was besieged by women, of course\u2014his rampaging energy often found outlet in the arms of some beauty or another. But at the first indication that a woman felt the merest flicker of affection, Jake was dispatched to her residence to deliver a letter that broke off all future communications. In other words, Jake was required to endure the tears, anger, or other messy emotions that Rutledge could not tolerate. And Jake would have felt sorry for the women, except that along with each letter, Rutledge usually included some monstrously expensive piece of jewelry that served to mollify any hurt feelings.</p><p>There were certain areas of Rutledge\u2019s life where women were never allowed. He did not allow them to stay in his private apartments, nor did he let any of them into his curiosities room. It was there that Rutledge went to dwell on his most difficult problems. And on the many nights when Rutledge was unable to sleep, he would go to the drafting table to occupy himself with automata, working with watch parts and bits of paper and wire until he had settled his overactive brain.</p> <p>So when Jake was discreetly told by a housemaid that a young woman had been with Rutledge in the curiosities room, he knew something significant had occurred.</p><p>Jake finished his breakfast in the hotel kitchens with dispatch, hurrying over a plate of creamed eggs scattered with crisp curls of fried bacon. Ordinarily, he would have taken the time to savor the fare. However, he couldn\u2019t be late for his morning meeting with Rutledge.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast,\u201d said Andre Broussard, a chef whom Rutledge had lured away from the French ambassador two years earlier. Broussard was the only employee in the hotel who possibly slept less than Rutledge. The young chef had been known to rise at three in the morning to begin preparing for a day\u2019s work, going to the morning markets to personally select the best produce. He was fair-haired and slight of build, but he possessed the discipline and will of an army commander.</p><p>Pausing in the act of whisking a sauce, Broussard regarded Jake with amusement. \u201cYou might try chewing, Valentine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to chew,\u201d Jake replied, setting aside his napkin. \u201cI\u2019m due to get the morning list from Mr. Rutledge in\u2014\u201d he paused to consult his pocket watch, \u201c\u2014two and a half minutes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, yes, the morning list.\u201d The chef proceeded to mimic his employer. \u201c \u2018Valentine, I want you to arrange for a soir\u00e9e in honor of the Portuguese ambassador to be held here on Tuesday with a pyrotechnic display at the conclusion. Afterward, run to the patent office with the drawings for my latest invention. And on the way back, stop by Regent Street and purchase six French cambric handkerchiefs, plain not patterned, and God help me no lace\u2014\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Broussard,\u201d Jake said, trying not to smile.</p><p>The chef returned his attention to the sauce. \u201cBy the way, Valentine . . . when you find out who the girl was, come back and tell me. And in return I\u2019ll let you have your pick of the pastry tray before I send it to the dining room.\u201d</p><p>Jake shot him a sharp look, his brown eyes narrowing. \u201cWhat girl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know very well what girl. The one Mr. Rutledge was seen with this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jake frowned. \u201cWho told you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least three people mentioned it to me in the past half hour. Everyone\u2019s talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rutledge employees are forbidden to gossip,\u201d Jake said sternly.</p><p>Broussard rolled his eyes. \u201cTo outsiders, yes. But Mr. Rutledge never said we couldn\u2019t gossip amongst ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why the presence of a girl in the curiosities room should be so interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm . . . could it be because Rutledge never allows anyone in there? Could it be because everyone who works here is praying that Rutledge will soon find a wife to distract him from his constant meddling?\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head ruefully. \u201cI doubt he\u2019ll ever marry. The hotel is his mistress.\u201d</p><p>The chef gave him a patronizing glance. \u201cThat\u2019s how much you know. Mr. Rutledge will marry, once he finds the right woman. As my countrymen say, \u2018A wife and a melon are hard to choose.\u2019 \u201d He watched as Jake buttoned his coat and straightened his cravat. \u201cBring back information, mon ami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I would never reveal one detail of Rutledge\u2019s private affairs.\u201d</p><p>Broussard sighed. \u201cLoyal to a fault. I suppose if Rutledge told you to murder someone, you\u2019d do it?\u201d</p> <p>Although the question was asked in a light vein, the chef\u2019s gray eyes were alert. Because no one, not even Jake, was entirely certain what Harry Rutledge was capable of, or how far Jake\u2019s allegiance would go.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t asked that of me,\u201d Jake replied, and paused to add with a flash of humor, \u201cyet.\u201d</p><p>As Jake hurried to the private suite of unnumbered rooms on the third floor, he passed many employees on the back stairs. These stairs, and the entrances at the back of the hotel, were used by servants and deliverymen as they went about their daily tasks. A few people tried to stop Jake with questions or concerns, but he shook his head and quickened his pace. Jake took care never to be late for his morning meetings with Rutledge. These consultations were usually brief, no more than a quarter hour, but Rutledge demanded punctuality.</p><p>Jake paused before the entrance of the suite, tucked at the back of a small private lobby lined with marble and priceless artwork. A secure inner hallway led to a discreet staircase and side door of the hotel, so that Rutledge never had to use the main hallways for his comings and goings. Rutledge, who liked to keep track of everyone else, did not allow anyone to do the same to him. He took most of his meals in private, and came and went as he pleased, sometimes with no indication of when he would return.</p><p>Jake knocked at the door and waited until he heard a muffled assent to enter.</p><p>He went into the suite, a series of four connected rooms that could be expanded into as large an apartment as one desired, up to fifteen rooms. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Rutledge,\u201d he said, entering the study.</p><p>The hotelier sat at a massive mahogany desk fitted with a cupboard filled with drawers and cubbies. As usual, the desk was covered with folios, papers, books, correspondence, calling cards, a stamp box, and an array of writing implements. Rutledge was closing a letter, applying a seal precisely into a little pool of hot wax.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Valentine. How did the staff meeting go?\u201d</p> <p>Jake handed him the daily sheaf of manager reports. \u201cEverything is going smoothly, for the most part. There have been few issues with the diplomatic contingent from Nagaraja.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>The tiny kingdom of Nagaraja, wedged between Burma and Siam, had just become a British ally. After offering to help the Nagarajans drive out the encroaching Siamese, Britain had now made the country one of its protectorates. Which was akin to being pinned beneath a lion\u2019s paw and being informed by the lion that you were perfectly safe. Since the British were currently fighting the Burmese and annexing provinces right and left, the Nagarajans hoped desperately to remain self-governing. Toward that end, the kingdom had sent a trio of high-level envoys on a diplomatic mission to England, bearing costly gifts in tribute to Queen Victoria.</p><p>\u201cThe reception manager,\u201d Jake said, \u201chad to change their rooms three times when they first arrived yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Rutledge\u2019s brows rose. \u201cThere was a problem with the rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the rooms themselves . . . the room numbers, which according to Nagarajan superstition were not auspicious. We finally settled them into suite 218. However, not long afterward, the second-floor manager detected the odor of smoke coming from the suite. It seems they were conducting an arrival-in-a-new-land ceremony, which involved starting a small fire on a bronze plate. Unfortunately the fire got out of hand, and the carpet was scorched.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A smile curved Rutledge\u2019s mouth. \u201cAs I recall, Nagarajans have ceremonies for nearly everything. See that an appropriate location is found for them to start as many sacred fires as they like without burning the hotel down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Rutledge riffled through the managers\u2019 reports. \u201cWhat\u2019s our current occupancy rate?\u201d he asked without looking up.</p><p>\u201cNinety-five percent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Rutledge continued to peruse the reports.</p><p>In the silence that followed, Jake let his gaze wander over the desk. He saw a letter addressed to Miss Poppy Hathaway, from the Honourable Michael Bayning.</p><p>He wondered why it was in Rutledge\u2019s possession. Poppy Hathaway . . . one of the sisters of a family that stayed at the Rutledge during the London season. Like other families of the peerage who didn\u2019t own a residence in town, they were obligated either to let a furnished house or stay in a private hotel. The Hathaways had been loyal customers of the Rutledge for three years. Was it possible that Poppy was the girl Rutledge had been seen with that morning?</p><p>\u201cValentine,\u201d the hotelier said in an offhand manner, \u201cOne of the chairs in my curiosities room needs to be reupholstered. There was a slight mishap this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jake usually knew better than to ask questions, but he couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cWhat kind of mishap, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a ferret. I believe he was trying to make a nest in the cushions.\u201d</p><p>A ferret?</p><p>The Hathaways were definitely involved.</p><p>\u201cIs the creature still at large?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was retrieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy one of the Hathaway sisters?\u201d Jake guessed.</p> <p>A warning glint appeared in the cool green eyes. \u201cYes, as a matter of fact.\u201d Setting the reports aside, Rutledge leaned back in his chair. The position of ease was belied by the repeated tapping of his fingers as he rested his hand on the desk. \u201cI have a few errands for you, Valentine. First, go to the residence of Lord Andover in Upper Brook Street. Arrange for a private meeting between myself and Andover within the next two days, preferably here. Make it clear that no one is to know about it, and impress upon Andover that the matter is one of great importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Jake didn\u2019t think there would be any difficulty in making the arrangements. Whenever Harry Rutledge wanted to meet with someone, they complied without delay. \u201cLord Andover is the father of Mr. Michael Bayning, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>What the devil was going on?</p><p>Before Jake could respond, Rutledge went on with the list. \u201cNext, take this\u2014\u201d he handed Jake a narrow-bound folio tied with leather cord, \u201c\u2014to Sir Gerald at the War Office. Place it directly into his hands. After that, go to Watherston &amp; Son, and buy a necklace or bracelet on my credit. Something nice, Valentine. And deliver it to Mrs. Rawlings at her residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your compliments?\u201d Jake asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, with this note.\u201d Rutledge gave him a sealed letter. \u201cI\u2019m getting rid of her.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s face fell. God. Another scene. \u201cSir, I\u2019d rather go on an errand in east London and be pummeled by street thieves.\u201d</p> <p>Rutledge smiled. \u201cThat will probably happen later in the week.\u201d</p><p>Jake gave his employer a speaking glance and left.</p><p>Poppy was well aware that in terms of marriageability, she had good points and bad points.</p><p>In her favor: Her family was wealthy, which meant she would have a handsome dowry.</p><p>Not in her favor: The Hathaways were neither a distinguished family nor blue-blooded, in spite of Leo\u2019s title.</p><p>In her favor: She was attractive.</p><p>Not in her favor: She was chatty and awkward, often at the same time, and when she was nervous, both problems worsened.</p><p>In her favor: The aristocracy could not afford to be as particular as they once had been. While the peerage\u2019s power slowly diminished, a class of industrialists and merchants was swiftly rising. Therefore, marriages between moneyed commoners and impoverished nobility occurred with increasing frequency. More and more often, the peerage had to figuratively hold its nose and mingle with those of low origins.</p><p>Not in her favor: Michael Bayning\u2019s father, the viscount, was a man of high standards, especially where his son was concerned.</p><p>\u201cThe viscount will certainly have to consider the match,\u201d Miss Marks had told her. \u201cHe may have impeccable lineage, but from all accounts, his fortune is waning. His son will have to marry a girl from a family of means. It may as well be a Hathaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d Poppy had replied feelingly.</p><p>Poppy had no doubt that she would be happy as Michael Bayning\u2019s wife. He was intelligent, affectionate, quick to laugh . . . a born and bred gentleman. She loved him, not in a bonfire of passion, but in a warm, steady flame. She loved his temperament, the confidence that superseded any hint of arrogance. And she loved his looks, as unladylike as it was to admit such a thing. But he had thick chestnut hair and warm brown eyes, and his form was tall and well exercised.</p><p>Once Poppy had met Michael, it had seemed almost too easy . . . in no time at all she had fallen in love with him.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not trifling with me,\u201d Michael had told her one evening as they browsed along the art gallery of a London mansion during a soir\u00e9e. \u201cThat is, I hope I haven\u2019t mistaken what might be mere politeness on your part for something more meaningful.\u201d He had stopped with her in front of a large landscape done in oils. \u201cThe truth is, Miss Hathaway . . . Poppy . . . every minute I spend in your company gives me such pleasure that I can scarcely bear to be apart from you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she had stared up at him in wonder. \u201cCould it be possible?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat I love you?\u201d Michael had whispered back, a wry smile touching his lips. \u201cPoppy Hathaway, it is impossible not to love you.\u201d</p><p>She had taken an unsteady breath, her entire being filled with joy. \u201cMiss Marks never told me what a lady is supposed to do in this situation.\u201d</p><p>Michael had grinned and leaned a bit closer, as if imparting a highly confidential secret. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to give me discreet encouragement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not discreet.\u201d His brown eyes sparkled. \u201cBut it\u2019s very nice to hear.\u201d</p><p>The courtship had been beyond circumspect. Michael\u2019s father, Viscount Andover, was protective of his son. A good man, Michael had said, but stern. And Michael had asked for sufficient time to approach the viscount and convince him of the rightness of the match. Poppy was entirely willing to give Michael however much time he needed.</p><p>The rest of the Hathaways, however, were not quite as amenable. To them, Poppy was a treasure, and she deserved to be courted openly and with pride.</p><p>\u201cShall I go and discuss the situation with Andover?\u201d Cam Rohan had suggested as the family relaxed in the parlor of their hotel suite after supper. He lounged on the settee next to Amelia, who was holding their six-month-old baby. When the baby grew up, his gadjo name\u2014gadjo being the word that Gypsies used for outsiders\u2014would be Ronan Cole, but among the family he was called by his Romany name, Rye.</p> <p>Poppy and Miss Marks occupied the other settee, while Beatrix lounged on the floor by the hearth, playing idly with a pet hedgehog named Medusa. Dodger sulked nearby in his basket, having learned through hard experience that it was unwise to tangle with Medusa and her quills.</p><p>Frowning contemplatively, Poppy looked up from her needlework. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would help,\u201d she told her brother-in-law regretfully. \u201cI know how persuasive you are . . . but Michael is very firm on how to handle his father.\u201d</p><p>Cam appeared to be thinking the matter over. With his black hair worn a trifle too long, his gleaming dark-honey complexion, and a diamond stud sparkling at one ear, Rohan looked far more like a pagan prince than a businessman who had garnered a fortune in manufacturing investments. Ever since he had married Amelia, Rohan had been the de facto head of the Hathaway family. No man alive would have been able to manage the unruly lot as adeptly as he did. His tribe, he called them.</p><p>\u201cLittle sister,\u201d he said to Poppy, sounding relaxed even though his gaze was intent, \u201cas the Rom say, \u2018the tree without sunlight will bear no fruit.\u2019 I see no reason why Bayning should not ask for permission to court you, and then go about it openly in the usual way of the gadjos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d Poppy said carefully, \u201cI know the Rom has a more . . . well, straightforward . . . approach to courtship\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that, Amelia smothered a laugh. Cam pointedly ignored her. Miss Marks looked perplexed, clearly having no idea that the Romany tradition of courtship often involved stealing a woman right out of her bed.</p> <p>\u201cBut you know as well as any of us,\u201d Poppy continued, \u201cthat it is a far more delicate process for the British peerage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Amelia said dryly, \u201cfrom what I\u2019ve seen, the British peerage negotiates marriages with all the romantic sensibilities of a bank transaction.\u201d</p><p>Poppy scowled at her older sister. \u201cAmelia, whose side are you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, there is no side but yours.\u201d Amelia\u2019s blue eyes were filled with concern. \u201cAnd that is why I don\u2019t care for this kind of covert courtship . . . arriving separately at events, never coming to take you and Miss Marks on a carriage drive . . . it bears the odor of shame. Embarrassment. As if you were some guilty secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you doubt Mr. Bayning\u2019s intentions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. But I don\u2019t like his methods.\u201d</p><p>Poppy sighed shortly. \u201cI am an unconventional choice for a peer\u2019s son. And therefore Mr. Bayning must proceed with caution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most conventional person in the entire family,\u201d Amelia protested.</p> <p>Poppy gave her a dark glance. \u201cBeing the most conventional Hathaway is hardly something to boast about.\u201d</p><p>Looking annoyed, Amelia glanced at her companion. \u201cMiss Marks, my sister seems to believe that her family is so outlandish, so completely out of the ordinary, that Mr. Bayning must go through these exertions\u2014sneaking about and so forth\u2014instead of going to the viscount in an upstanding manner and saying \u2018Father, I intend to marry Poppy Hathaway and I would like your blessing.\u2019 Can you tell me why there is a need for such excessive caution on Mr. Bayning\u2019s part?\u201d</p><p>For once, Miss Marks seemed at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put her on the spot,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cHere are the facts, Amelia: You and Win are married to Gypsies, Leo is a notorious rake, Beatrix has more pets than the Royal Zoological Society, and I am socially awkward and can\u2019t carry on a proper conversation to save my life. Is it so difficult to understand why Mr. Bayning has to break the news to his father gently?\u201d</p><p>Amelia looked as though she wanted to argue, but instead she muttered, \u201cProper conversations are very dull, in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d Poppy said glumly. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix looked up from the hedgehog, who had curled up in a ball in her hands. \u201cDoes Mr. Bayning make interesting conversation?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t need to ask,\u201d Amelia said, \u201cif he dared to come here for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest,\u201d Miss Marks said hastily, before Poppy could retort, \u201cthat as a family, we invite Mr. Bayning to accompany us to the Chelsea flower show, the day after next. That will allow us to spend the afternoon with Mr. Bayning\u2014and perhaps we will gain some reassurance about his intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a lovely idea,\u201d Poppy exclaimed. Attending a flower show together was far more innocuous and discreet than Michael having to call on them at the Rutledge. \u201cI\u2019m sure that talking to Mr. Bayning will ease your worries, Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d her sister replied, sounding unconvinced. A tiny frown pleated the space between her sister\u2019s slim brows. She turned her attention to Miss Marks. \u201cAs Poppy\u2019s chaperon, you have seen far more of this furtive suitor than I have. What is your opinion of him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom what I have observed,\u201d the companion said carefully, \u201cMr. Bayning is well regarded and honorable. He has an excellent reputation, with no history of seducing women, spending beyond his means, or brawling in public venues. In short, he is the complete opposite of Lord Ramsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat speaks well of him,\u201d Cam said gravely. His golden hazel eyes twinkled as he glanced down at his wife. A moment of silent communication passed between them before he murmured softly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you send him an invitation, monisha?\u201d</p><p>A sardonic smile flitted across Amelia\u2019s soft lips. \u201cYou would voluntarily attend a flower show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like flowers,\u201d Cam said innocently.</p><p>\u201cYes, scattered across meadows and marshes. But you hate seeing them organized in raised beds and neat little boxes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can tolerate it for an afternoon,\u201d Cam assured her. Idly he toyed with a loose lock of hair that had fallen on her neck. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s worth the effort to gain an in-law like Bayning.\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201cWe need at least one respectable man in the family, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>An invitation was sent to Michael Bayning the next day, and to Poppy\u2019s elation, it was accepted immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time now,\u201d she told Beatrix, barely restraining herself from hopping in excitement the way Dodger did. \u201cI\u2019m going to be Mrs. Michael Bayning, and I love him, I love everyone and everything . . . I even love your smelly old ferret, Bea!\u201d</p><p>Late in the morning, Poppy and Beatrix dressed for a walk. It was a clear, warm day, and the hotel gardens, intercut with neatly graveled paths, were a symphony of blooms.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly wait to go out,\u201d Poppy said, standing at the window and staring down at the extensive gardens. \u201cIt almost reminds me of Hampshire, the flowers are so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t remind me at all of Hampshire,\u201d Beatrix said, \u201cIt\u2019s too orderly. But I do like walking through the Rutledge rose garden. The air smells so sweet. Do you know, I spoke with the master gardener a few mornings ago, when Cam and Amelia and I went out, and he told me his secret recipe for making the roses so large and healthy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFish broth, vinegar and a dash of sugar. He sprinkles them with it right before they bloom. And they love it.\u201d</p><p>Poppy wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhat a dreadful concoction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master gardener said that old Mr. Rutledge is especially fond of roses, and people have brought him some of the exotic varieties you see in the garden. The lavender roses are from China, for example, and the Maiden\u2019s Blush variety comes from France, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld Mr. Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t actually say Mr. Rutledge was old. I just can\u2019t help thinking of him that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s so awfully mysterious, and no one ever sees him. It reminds me of the stories of mad old King George, locked away in his apartments at Windsor Castle.\u201d Beatrix grinned. \u201cPerhaps they keep Mr. Rutledge up in the attic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBea,\u201d Poppy whispered urgently, filled with an overwhelming urge to confide in her, \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019m bursting to tell you, but it must remain a secret.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s eyes lit with interest. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst promise you won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear on something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear on St. Francis, the patron saint of all animals.\u201d Seeing Poppy\u2019s hesitation, Beatrix added enthusiastically, \u201cIf a band of pirates kidnapped me and took me to their ship and threatened to make me walk the plank over a shiver of starving sharks unless I told them your secret, I still wouldn\u2019t tell it. If I were tied by a villain and thrown before a herd of stampeding horses all shod in iron, and the only way to keep from being trampled was to tell the villain your secret, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, you\u2019ve convinced me,\u201d Poppy said with a grin. Dragging her sister to the corner, she said softly, \u201cI have met Mr. Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix\u2019s blue eyes turned huge. \u201cYou have? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday morning.\u201d And Poppy told her the entire story, describing the passageway, the curiosities room, and Mr. Rutledge himself. The only thing she left out was the kiss, which, as far as she was concerned, had never happened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so terribly sorry about Dodger,\u201d Beatrix said earnestly. \u201cI apologize on his behalf.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Bea. Only . . . I do wish he hadn\u2019t lost the letter. So long as no one finds it, I suppose there\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Mr. Rutledge is not a decrepit madman?\u201d Beatrix asked, sounding disappointed.</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuite handsome, actually. He\u2019s very tall, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs tall as Merripen?\u201d</p><p>Kev Merripen had come to live with the Hathaways after his tribe had been attacked by Englishmen who had wished to drive the Gypsies out of the county. The boy had been left for dead, but the Hathaways had taken him in, and he had stayed for good. Recently he had married the second oldest sister, Winnifred. Merripen had undertaken the monumental task of running the Ramsay estate in Leo\u2019s absence. The newlyweds were both quite happy to stay in Hampshire during the season, enjoying the beauty and relative privacy of Ramsay House.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s as tall as Merripen,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cBut Mr. Rutledge is tall nonetheless, and he has dark hair and piercing green eyes . . .\u201d Her stomach gave an unexpected little leap as she remembered.</p><p>\u201cDid you like him?\u201d</p> <p>Poppy hesitated. \u201cMr. Rutledge is . . . unsettling. He\u2019s charming, but one has the feeling he\u2019s capable of nearly anything. He\u2019s like some wicked angel from a William Blake poem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could have seen him,\u201d Beatrix said wistfully. \u201cAnd I wish even more that I could visit the curiosities room. I envy you, Poppy. It\u2019s been so long since anything interesting has happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Poppy laughed quietly. \u201cWhat, when we\u2019ve just gone through nearly the entire London season?\u201d</p><p>Beatrix rolled her eyes. \u201cThe London season is about as interesting as a snail race. In January. With dead snails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls, I\u2019m ready,\u201d came Miss Marks\u2019s cheerful summons, and she entered the room. \u201cMake certain to fetch your parasols\u2014you don\u2019t want to become sunbrowned.\u201d The trio left the suite and proceeded at a dignified pace along the hallway. Before they turned the corner to approach the grand staircase, they became aware of an unusual disturbance in the decorous hotel.</p><p>Men\u2019s voices tangled in the air, some agitated, at least one of them angry, and there was the sound of foreign accents, and heavy thumping, and a queer metallic rattling.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the devil . . .\u201d Miss Marks said under her breath.</p><p>Rounding the corner, the three women stopped abruptly at the sight of a half dozen men clustered near the food lift. A shriek rent the air.</p><p>\u201cIs it a woman?\u201d Poppy asked, turning pale. \u201cA child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Miss Marks said tensely. \u201cI\u2019ll undertake to find out\u2014\u201d</p><p>The three of them flinched at a series of screams, the sounds blistered with panic.</p><p>\u201cIt is a child,\u201d Poppy said, striding forward despite Miss Marks\u2019s command to stay. \u201cWe must do something to help.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix had already run ahead of her. \u201cIt\u2019s not a child,\u201d she said over her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a monkey!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>There were few activities Harry enjoyed as much as fencing, even more so because it had become an obsolete art. Swords were no longer necessary as weapons or fashion accessories, and its practitioners were now mainly military officers and a handful of amateur enthusiasts. But Harry liked the elegance of it, the precision that required both physical and mental discipline. A fencer had to plan several moves in advance, something that came naturally to Harry.</p><p>A year earlier, he had joined a fencing club consisting of approximately a hundred members, including peers, bankers, actors, politicians, and soldiers from various ranks of the military. Thrice weekly, Harry and a few trusted friends met at the club, practicing with both foils and quarterstaffs beneath the watchful eye of a fencing master. Although the club had a changing room and shower baths, there was often a queue, so Harry usually left directly from practice.</p><p>This morning\u2019s practice had been especially vigorous, as the fencing master had taught them techniques for fighting off two opponents simultaneously. Although it had been invigorating, it was also challenging, and they had all been left bruised and tired. Harry had gotten a few hard strikes on his chest and bicep, and he was soaked in sweat.</p><p>When he returned to the hotel, he was still in his fencing whites, although he had removed the protective leather padding. He was looking forward to a shower bath, but it quickly became evident that the shower bath would have to wait.</p><p>One of his managers, a bespectacled young man named William Cullip, met him as he entered the back of the hotel. Cullip\u2019s face was drawn with anxiety. \u201cMr. Rutledge,\u201d he said apologetically, \u201cI was told by Mr. Valentine to tell you immediately upon your return that we are having a . . . well, a difficulty . . .\u201d</p><p>Harry stared at him and remained silent, waiting with forced patience. One could not rush Cullip, or the information would take forever to get out.</p><p>\u201cIt involves the Nagarajan diplomats,\u201d the manager continued.</p><p>\u201cAnother fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. It has to do with one of the articles of tribute the Nagarajans had planned to present to the Queen tomorrow. It has disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Harry frowned, reflecting on the collection of priceless gemstones, artwork and textiles the Nagarajans had brought. \u201cTheir possessions are stored in a locked basement room. How could something go missing?\u201d</p><p>Cullip let out a ragged breath. \u201cWell, sir, it has apparently left on its own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cWhat the hell is going on, Cullip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong the items the Nagarajans brought for the Queen are a pair of rare animals . . . blue macaques . . . which are found only in the Nagarajan teak forest. They are to be housed at the zoological gardens at Regent\u2019s Park. Evidently each macaque was kept in its own crate, but somehow one of them learned to pick a lock, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe devil you say!\u201d Incredulity was rapidly crushed by outrage. Yet somehow Harry managed to keep his voice quiet. \u201cMay I ask why no one bothered to inform me that we\u2019re harboring a pair of monkeys in my hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere seems to be some confusion on that point, sir. You see, Mr. Lufton in reception is certain that he included it in his report, but Mr. Valentine says he never read anything about it, and he lost his temper and frightened a housemaid and two stewards, and now everyone is searching while at the same time making certain not to alert the guests\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCullip.\u201d Harry gritted his teeth with the effort to stay calm. \u201cHow long has the macaque been missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe estimate at least forty-five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Valentine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last I heard, he had gone up to the third floor. One of the housemaids discovered what she thought might be droppings near the food lift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonkey droppings near the food lift,\u201d Harry repeated, disbelieving his own ears. Christ. All the situation needed was for one of his elderly guests to be frightened into apoplexy from having a wild animal spring out from nowhere, or to have a woman or child bitten, or some other outrageous scenario.</p> <p>It would be impossible to find the damned creature. The hotel was a virtual maze, riddled with hallways and concealed doors and passages. It could take days, during which the Rutledge would be in an uproar. He would lose business. And worst of all, he would be the butt of jokes for years. By the time the humorists got through with him . . .</p><p>\u201cBy God, heads are going to roll,\u201d Harry said with a lethal softness that caused Cullip to flinch. \u201cGo to my apartments, Cullip, and get the Dreyse from the mahogany cabinet in my private office.\u201d</p><p>The young manager looked perplexed. \u201cThe Dreyse, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shotgun. It\u2019s the only percussion cap breechloader in the cabinet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA percussion . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brown one,\u201d Harry said gently. \u201cWith a large bolt sticking out of the side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t point it at anyone. It\u2019s loaded.\u201d</p><p>Still gripping the foil, Harry raced up the back stairs. He took them two at a time, swiftly passing a pair of startled housemaids carrying baskets of linens.</p><p>Reaching the third floor, he headed to the food lift, where he found Valentine, all three of the Nagarajan diplomats, and Brimbley, the floor steward. A wood and metal crate had been positioned nearby. The men had gathered around the opening to the food lift, and were looking inside.</p><p>\u201cValentine,\u201d Harry said curtly, striding up to his right-hand man, \u201chave you found it?\u201d</p><p>Jake Valentine threw him a harassed glance. \u201cHe climbed up the rope pulley in the food lift. Now he\u2019s sitting on top of the movable frame. Every time we try to lower it, he hangs onto the rope and dangles above us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he close enough for me to reach him?\u201d</p><p>Valentine\u2019s gaze flickered to the foil in his employer\u2019s grasp. His dark eyes widened as he understood that Harry intended to skewer the creature rather than let it roam freely through the hotel.</p> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be easy,\u201d Valentine said. \u201cYou\u2019d probably only end up agitating him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried to lure it with food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t take the bait. I reached up in the shaft with an apple, and he tried to bite my hand.\u201d Valentine cast a distracted glance at the food lift, where the other men were whistling and cooing to the obstinate monkey.</p><p>One of the Nagarajans, a slim middle-aged man dressed in a light suit with a richly patterned cloth draped over both shoulders, stepped forward. His expression was fraught with distress. \u201cYou are Mr. Rutledge? Good, yes, I thank you for coming to help retrieve this most important gift for Her Majesty. Very rare macaque. Very special. It must not be harmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d Harry asked brusquely.</p><p>\u201cNiran,\u201d the diplomat supplied.</p><p>\u201cMr. Niran, while I understand your concern for the animal, I have a responsibility to protect my guests.\u201d</p><p>The Nagarajan glowered. \u201cIf you damage our gift to the Queen, I fear it will not go well for you.\u201d</p><p>Leveling a hard stare at the diplomat, Harry said evenly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a way to get that animal out of my food lift and into that crate in five minutes, Niran, I\u2019m going to make a kabob out of him.\u201d</p><p>This statement produced a stare of purest indignation, and the Nagarajan rushed to the opening of the food lift. The monkey gave an excited hoot, followed by a series of grunts.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what a kabob is,\u201d Valentine said to no one in particular, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think the monkey\u2019s going to like it.\u201d</p><p>Before Harry could reply, Valentine caught sight of something behind him, and he groaned. \u201cGuests,\u201d the assistant muttered.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Harry said beneath his breath, and turned to face the approaching guests, wondering what he was going to say to them.</p><p>A trio of women rushed toward him, two of them in pursuit of a dark-haired girl. A small shock of recognition went through Harry as he recognized Catherine Marks and Poppy Hathaway. He guessed the third was Beatrix, who seemed determined to plow through him in her haste to reach the food lift. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry moved to block her way. \u201cGood morning, miss. I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t go over there. Nor would you want to.\u201d</p><p>She stopped immediately, staring at him with eyes the same rich blue as her sister\u2019s. Catherine Marks regarded him with flinty composure, while Poppy took an extra breath, her cheeks infused with color.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know my sister, sir,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cIf there is a wild creature in the vicinity, she most definitely wants to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think there\u2019s a wild creature in my hotel?\u201d Harry asked, as if the idea were inconceivable.</p> <p>The macaque chose that moment to utter an enthusiastic screech.</p><p>Holding his gaze, Poppy grinned. Despite his annoyance at the situation and his lack of control over it, Harry couldn\u2019t help smiling back. She was even more exquisite than he had remembered, her eyes a dark, lucid blue. There were many beautiful women in London, but not one of them possessed her combination of intelligence and subtly off-kilter charm. He wanted to sweep her away somewhere, that very minute, and have her all to himself.</p><p>Schooling his expression, Harry recalled that although they had met the previous day, they weren\u2019t supposed to know each other. He bowed with impeccable politeness. \u201cHarry Rutledge, at your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Beatrix Hathaway,\u201d the younger girl said, \u201cand this is my sister Poppy and my companion Miss Marks. There\u2019s a monkey in the food lift, isn\u2019t there?\u201d She seemed remarkably prosaic, as if discovering exotic animals in one\u2019s residence occurred all the time.</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never catch him that way,\u201d Beatrix interrupted.</p><p>Harry, who was never interrupted by anyone, found himself biting back another smile. \u201cI assure you, we have the situation well in hand, Miss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need help,\u201d Beatrix told him. \u201cI\u2019ll return directly. Don\u2019t do anything to upset the monkey. And don\u2019t try to poke him out with that sword\u2014you may accidentally pierce him.\u201d With no further ado, she dashed back in the direction she had come from.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be accidental,\u201d Harry muttered.</p><p>Miss Marks looked from Harry to her retreating charge, her mouth falling open. \u201cBeatrix, do not run through the hotel like that. Stop at once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she has a plan,\u201d Poppy remarked. \u201cYou\u2019d better go after her, Miss Marks.\u201d</p> <p>The companion threw her a beseeching glance. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>But Poppy didn\u2019t move, only said innocently, \u201cI\u2019ll wait here, Miss Marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not proper\u2014\u201d The companion looked from Beatrix\u2019s fast-disappearing form to Poppy\u2019s unmoving one. Deciding in a flash that Beatrix posed the greater problem, she turned with an unladylike curse and ran after her charge.</p><p>Harry found himself left with Poppy, who, like her sister, seemed remarkably unperturbed by the macaque\u2019s antics. They faced each other, he with his foil, she with her parasol.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s gaze traveled over his fencing whites, and rather than staying demurely silent or displaying the appropriate nervousness of a young lady with no companion to protect her . . . she launched into conversation. \u201cMy father called fencing \u2018physical chess,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cHe very much admired the sport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a novice,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cAccording to my father, the trick of it is to hold the foil as if it were a bird in your hand\u2014close enough to prevent its escape, but not tight enough to crush it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave you lessons?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, my father encouraged all his daughters to try it. He said he knew of no other sport that would fall so directly in a woman\u2019s line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Women are agile and fast.\u201d</p><p>Poppy smiled ruefully. \u201cNot enough to elude you, it seems.\u201d</p><p>The single comment managed, with wry humor, to gently mock herself and him.</p><p>Somehow they were standing closer together, although Harry wasn\u2019t certain who had stepped toward whom. A delicious scent clung to her, sweet skin and perfume and soap. Remembering how soft her mouth had been, he wanted to kiss her so badly that it was all he could do not to reach for her. He was stunned to realize that he was a bit breathless.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d Valentine\u2019s voice recalled him from his thoughts. \u201cThe macaque is climbing up the rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nowhere to go,\u201d Harry said curtly. \u201cTry moving the lift upward and trapping it against the ceiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will injure the macaque!\u201d the Nagarajan exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cI can only hope so,\u201d Harry said, aggravated by the distraction. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered with the logistics of capturing an unruly macaque. He wanted to be alone with Poppy Hathaway.</p><p>William Cullip arrived, carrying the Dreyse with extreme care. \u201cMr. Valentine, here it is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Harry began to reach for it, but at that second Poppy reared back in a startle reflex, her shoulders colliding with his chest. Harry caught her by the arms and felt the thrills of panic running through her. Carefully, he turned her to face him. Her face was bleached, her gaze not quite focused. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked softly, holding her against him. \u201cThe shotgun? You\u2019re afraid of guns?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, struggling to catch her breath.</p><p>Harry was shocked by the force of his own reaction to her, the tidal wave of protectiveness. She was trembling and winded, one hand pressing on the center of his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he murmured. He couldn\u2019t recall the last time anyone had sought comfort from him. Perhaps no one ever had. He wanted to draw her fully against him and soothe her. It seemed he had always wanted this, waited for it, without even knowing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the same quiet tone Harry murmured, \u201cCullip, the shotgun won\u2019t be needed. Take it back to the cabinet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>Poppy stayed in the shelter of his arms, her head downbent. Her exposed ear looked so tender. The fragrance of her perfume teased him. He wanted to explore every part of her, hold her until she relaxed against him. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he murmured again, stroking a circle on her back with his palm. \u201cIt\u2019s gone. I\u2019m sorry you were frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I . . .\u201d Poppy drew back, her white face now infused with color. \u201cI\u2019m not usually skittish, it was only the surprise. A long time ago\u2014\u201d She stopped herself and fidgeted, and muttered, \u201cI\u2019m not going to babble.\u201d</p> <p>Harry didn\u2019t want her to stop. He found everything about her endlessly interesting, although he couldn\u2019t explain why. She simply was.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>Poppy made a helpless gesture and gave him a wry glance as if to convey that she had warned him. \u201cWhen I was a child, one of my favorite people in the world was my Uncle Howard, my father\u2019s brother. He had no wife or children of his own, so he lavished all his attention on us.\u201d</p><p>A reminiscent smile touched her lips. \u201cUncle Howard was very patient with me. My chattering drove everyone else to distraction, but he always listened as if he had all the time in the world. One morning he came to visit us while Father went shooting with some of the village men. When they returned with a brace of birds, Uncle Howard and I went to the end of the lane to meet them. But someone\u2019s rifle discharged accidentally . . . I\u2019m not certain if it was dropped, or if the man was carrying it incorrectly . . . I remember the sound if it, a boom like thunder, and there were a few hard pinches on my arm, and another on my shoulder. I turned to tell Uncle Howard, but he was crumpling very slowly to the ground. He\u2019d been fatally wounded, and I had been hit by a few stray pellets.\u201d</p><p>Poppy hesitated, her eyes glittering. \u201cThere was blood all over him. I went to him and put my arms beneath his head, and asked him what I should do. And he whispered that I must always be a good girl, so that we could meet again in heaven someday.\u201d She cleared her throat and sighed shortly. \u201cForgive me. I talk excessively. I shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said, overwhelmed by a baffling and unfamiliar emotion, white-knuckled with it. \u201cI could listen to you all day.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise, jostled out of her melancholy. A shy grin rose to her lips. \u201cAside from my Uncle Howard, you\u2019re the first man ever to say that to me.\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted by exclamations from the men gathered around the rope lift, as the macaque climbed higher.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Harry muttered.</p><p>\u201cPlease wait just a moment more,\u201d Poppy said to him earnestly. \u201cMy sister is very good with animals. She\u2019ll have him out with no injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has experience with primates?\u201d Harry asked sardonically.</p> <p>Poppy considered that. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been through the London season. Does that count?\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled, with a genuine amusement that didn\u2019t often occur, and both Valentine and Brimbley glanced at him with astonishment.</p><p>Beatrix hurried back to them, clutching something in her arms. She paid no attention to Miss Marks, who was following and scolding. \u201cHere we are,\u201d Beatrix said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cOur comfit jar?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already offered him food, miss,\u201d Valentine said. \u201cHe won\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll take these.\u201d Beatrix strode confidently to the opening of the food lift. \u201cLet\u2019s send the jar up to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you adulterated the sweets?\u201d Valentine asked hopefully.</p><p>All three of the Nagarajan envoys exclaimed anxiously to the effect that they did not want the macaque to be drugged or poisoned.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Beatrix said, \u201cHe might fall down the shaft if I did that, and this precious animal must not be harmed.\u201d</p><p>The foreigners subsided at her reassurance.</p><p>\u201cHow may I help, Bea?\u201d Poppy asked, approaching her.</p><p>Her younger sister handed her a length of heavy silk cord. \u201cTie this \u2019round the neck of the jar, please. Your knots are always much better than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA clove hitch?\u201d Poppy suggested, taking the twine.</p><p>\u201cYes, perfect.\u201d</p><p>Jake Valentine regarded the two intent young women dubiously, and looked at Harry. \u201cMr. Rutledge\u2014\u201d</p><p>Harry gestured for him to be silent and allow the Hathaway sisters to proceed. Whether or not their attempt actually worked, he was enjoying this too much to stop them.</p><p>\u201cCould you make some kind of loop for a handle at the other end?\u201d Beatrix asked.</p><p>Poppy frowned. \u201cAn overhand knot, perhaps? I\u2019m not sure I remember how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d Harry volunteered, stepping forward.</p><p>Poppy surrendered the end of the cord to him, her eyes twinkling.</p><p>Harry tied the end of the cord into an elaborate rope ball, first wrapping it several times around his fingers, then passing the free end back and forth. Not above a bit of showmanship, he tightened the whole thing with a deft flourish.</p><p>\u201cNicely done,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cWhat knot is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIronically,\u201d Harry replied, \u201cit is known as the \u2018Monkey\u2019s Fist.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Poppy smiled. \u201cIs it really? No, you\u2019re teasing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never tease about knots. A good knot is a thing of beauty.\u201d Harry gave the rope end to Beatrix, and watched as she placed the jar atop the frame of the food lift cab. Then he realized what her plan was. \u201cClever,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt may not work,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cIt depends on whether the monkey is more intelligent than we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rather afraid of the answer,\u201d Harry replied dryly. Reaching inside the food lift shaft, he pulled the rope slowly, sending the jar up to the macaque, while Beatrix kept hold of the silk cord.</p><p>All was quiet. The group held their breath en masse as they waited.</p> <p>Thump.</p><p>The monkey had descended to the top of the cab. A few inquiring hoots and grunts echoed through the shaft. A rattle, a silence, and then a sharp tug at the line. Offended screams filled the air, and heavy thumps shook the food lift.</p><p>\u201cWe caught him,\u201d Beatrix exclaimed.</p><p>Harry took the line from her, while Valentine lowered the cab. \u201cPlease stand back, Miss Hathaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do it,\u201d Beatrix urged. \u201cThe macaque is much more likely to spring at you than me. Animals trust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, I can\u2019t risk one of my guests being injured.\u201d</p><p>Poppy and Miss Marks both drew Beatrix away from the food lift opening. They all gasped as a large, blue black macaque appeared, his eyes huge and bright above a hairless muzzle, his head comically tufted with a shock of fur. The monkey was stocky and powerful in appearance, with hardly any tail to speak of. His expressive face contorted in fury, white teeth gleaming as it screeched.</p><p>One of the front paws appeared to be stuck in the comfit jar. The irate macaque tugged frantically to get it out, without success. His own clenched fist was the reason for his captivity\u2014he refused to let go of the comfits even to remove his paw from the jar.</p><p>\u201cOh, isn\u2019t he beautiful!\u201d Beatrix enthused.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps to a female macaque,\u201d Poppy said dubiously.</p><p>Harry held the cord attached to the jar with one hand, his fencing foil with the other. The macaque was larger than he had expected, capable of inflicting considerable damage. And it was clearly considering whom to attack first.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, old fellow,\u201d Harry murmured, attempting to lead the monkey to the open crate.</p><p>Beatrix reached into her pocket, pulled out a few comfits, and went to toss them into the crate. \u201cThere you are, greedy boy,\u201d she said to the macaque. \u201cYour treats are in there. Go on, and don\u2019t make such a fuss.\u201d</p><p>Miraculously, the monkey obeyed, dragging his jar with him. After casting a baleful glance at Harry, he entered his crate and scooped up the scattered comfits with his free paw.</p><p>\u201cGive me the jar,\u201d Beatrix said patiently, tugging at the cord, and she pulled it out of the crate. She tossed a last handful of comfits to the monkey and closed the door. The Nagarajans hastened to lock it.</p><p>\u201cI want it triple chained,\u201d Harry said to Valentine, \u201cand the other monkey\u2019s crate chained as well. And then I want them delivered directly to Regent\u2019s Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Poppy went to her sister, hugging her in an open display of affection. \u201cWell done, Bea,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHow did you know the monkey wouldn\u2019t let go of the comfits in his hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it is a well-known fact that monkeys are nearly as greedy as people,\u201d Beatrix said, and Poppy laughed.</p> <p>\u201cGirls,\u201d Miss Marks said in a low voice, trying to hush them, draw them away. \u201cThis is unseemly. We must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss Marks. We\u2019ll go on with our walk.\u201d</p><p>However, the companion\u2019s attempt to urge the sisters to leave was foiled as the Nagarajans crowded around Beatrix.</p><p>\u201cYou have done us a very great service,\u201d the head diplomat, Niran, told the girl. \u201cVery great indeed. You have the gratitude of our country and our king, and you shall be recommended to Her Majesty Queen Victoria for your brave assistance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Miss Marks interceded firmly. \u201cMiss Hathaway does not wish to be recommended. You will harm her reputation by exposing her publicly. If you are indeed grateful for her kindness, we beg you to repay her with silence.\u201d</p><p>This produced more discussion and vigorous nodding.</p><p>Beatrix sighed and watched as the macaque was carried away in his crate. \u201cI wish I had a monkey of my own,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>Miss Marks gave Poppy a long-suffering glance. \u201cOne might wish she were as eager to acquire a husband.\u201d</p><p>Smothering a grin, Poppy tried to look sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cHave the food lift cleaned,\u201d Harry told Valentine and Brimbley. \u201cEvery inch of it.\u201d</p><p>The men hastened to comply, the older man using the pulleys to send the food lift down, while Valentine departed in swift, controlled strides.</p><p>Harry glanced at all three of the women, lingering an extra moment on Miss Marks\u2019s set face. \u201cI thank you for your assistance, ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Poppy said, her eyes dancing. \u201cAnd if there are further problems with recalcitrant monkeys, do not hesitate to send for us.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s blood quickened as lurid images filled his mind . . . her, against him, beneath him. That smiling mouth, his alone, her whispers curling into his ear. Her skin, soft and ivory pale in the darkness. Skin heated by skin, sensation emerging as he touched her.</p><p>She was worth anything, he thought, even giving up the last remnants of his soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood day,\u201d he heard himself say, his voice husky but polite. And he forced himself to walk away.</p><p>For now.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cNow I understand what you meant earlier,\u201d Beatrix said to Poppy, when Miss Marks had gone on some undisclosed errand. Poppy had settled in her bed, while Beatrix had washed Dodger and was now drying him with a towel before the hearth. \u201cWhat you were trying to say about Mr. Rutledge,\u201d she continued. \u201cNo wonder you found him unsettling.\u201d She paused to grin at the happy ferret, who was wriggling on a warm towel. \u201cDodger, you do like to be clean, don\u2019t you? You smell so lovely after a good washing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always say that, and he always smells the same.\u201d Poppy raised herself on an elbow and watched them, her hair spilling around her shoulders. She felt too restless to nap. \u201cThen you found Mr. Rutledge unsettling, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I understand why you do. He watches you like one of those ambushing sort of predators. The kind that lie in wait before they spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dramatic,\u201d Poppy said with a dismissive laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s not a predator, Bea. He\u2019s only a man.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix made no reply, only made a project of smoothing Dodger\u2019s fur. As she leaned over him, he strained upward and kissed her nose affectionately. \u201cPoppy,\u201d she murmured, \u201cno matter how Miss Marks tries to civilize me\u2014and I do try to listen to her\u2014I still have my own way of looking at the world. To me, people are scarcely different from animals. We\u2019re all God\u2019s creatures, aren\u2019t we? When I meet someone, I know immediately what animal they would be. When we first met Cam, for example, I knew he was a fox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose Cam is somewhat fox-like,\u201d Poppy said, amused. \u201cWhat is Merripen? A bear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, unquestionably a horse. And Amelia is a hen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say an owl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t you remember when one of our hens in Hampshire chased after a cow that had strayed too close to the nest? That\u2019s Amelia.\u201d</p><p>Poppy grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Win is a swan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I also a bird? A lark? A robin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re a rabbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rabbit?\u201d Poppy made a face. \u201cI don\u2019t like that. Why am I a rabbit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, rabbits are beautiful soft animals who love to be cuddled. They\u2019re very sociable, but they\u2019re happiest in pairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re timid,\u201d Poppy protested.</p><p>\u201cNot always. They\u2019re brave enough to be companions to many other creatures. Even cats and dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Poppy said in resignation, \u201cit\u2019s better than being a hedgehog, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Marks is a hedgehog,\u201d Beatrix said in a matter-of-fact tone that made Poppy grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a ferret, aren\u2019t you, Bea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. But I was leading to a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say that Mr. Rutledge is a cat. A solitary hunter. With an apparent taste for rabbit.\u201d</p><p>Poppy blinked in bewilderment. \u201cYou think he is interested in . . . Oh, but Bea, I\u2019m not at all . . . and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever see him again . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Settling on her side, Poppy watched her sister in the flickering glow of the hearth, while a chill of uneasiness penetrated the very marrow of her bones.</p><p>Not because she feared Harry Rutledge.</p><p>Because she liked him.</p><p>Catherine Marks knew that Harry was up to something. He was always up to something. He certainly had no intention of inquiring after her welfare\u2014he didn\u2019t give a damn about her. He considered most people, including Catherine, a waste of his time.</p><p>Whatever mysterious mechanism sent Harry Rutledge\u2019s blood pumping through his veins, it wasn\u2019t a heart.</p><p>In the years of their acquaintance, Catherine had never asked anything of him. Once Harry did someone a favor, it went into the invisible ledger he carried around in that infernally clever brain, and it was only a matter of time until he demanded repayment with interest. People feared him for good reason. Harry had powerful friends and powerful enemies, and it was doubtful that even they knew what category they fell in.</p><p>The valet, or assistant, whatever he was, showed her into Harry\u2019s palatial apartment. Catherine thanked him with a frosty murmur. She sat in a receiving room with her hands resting in her lap. The receiving room had been designed to intimidate visitors, all of it done in slick, pale fabrics and cold marble and priceless Renaissance art.</p><p>Harry entered the room, large and breathtakingly self-assured. As always, he was elegantly dressed and meticulously groomed.</p><p>Stopping before her, he surveyed her with insolent green eyes. \u201cCat. You look well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to the devil,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>His gaze dropped to the white plait of her fingers, and a lazy smile crossed his face. \u201cI suppose to you, I am the devil.\u201d He nodded toward the other side of the settee she occupied. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>Catherine gave a short nod and waited until he had seated himself. \u201cWhy did you send for me?\u201d Her voice was brittle.</p><p>\u201cIt was an amusing scene this morning, wasn\u2019t it? Your Hathaways were a delight. They\u2019re certainly not your run-of-the-mill society misses.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Catherine raised her gaze to his, trying not to flinch as she stared into the vivid depths of green. Harry excelled at hiding his thoughts . . . but this morning he had stared at Poppy with a hunger that he was usually too well disciplined to reveal. And Poppy had no idea of how to defend herself against a man like Harry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Catherine strove to keep her voice even. \u201cI will not discuss the Hathaways with you. And I warn you to stay away from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou warn me?\u201d Harry repeated softly, his eyes bright with mocking amusement.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt anyone in my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family?\u201d One of his dark brows lifted. \u201cYou have no family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI meant the family I work for,\u201d Catherine said with icy dignity. \u201cI meant my charges. Especially Poppy. I saw the way you looked at her this morning. If you try to harm her in any way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of harming anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of your intentions, it happens, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Catherine felt a stab of satisfaction as she saw his eyes narrow. \u201cPoppy is far too good for you,\u201d she continued, \u201cand she is out of your reach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly anything is out of my reach, Cat.\u201d He said it without arrogance. It happened to be the truth. Which made Catherine all the more fearful.</p><p>\u201cPoppy is practically betrothed,\u201d she replied sharply. \u201cShe is in love with someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMichael Bayning.\u201d</p><p>Her heart began to hammer with alarm. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Harry ignored the question. \u201cDo you really think that Viscount Andover, a man of notoriously exacting standards, would allow his son to marry a Hathaway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. He loves his son, and therefore he will choose to overlook the fact that Poppy comes from an unconventional family. He could ask for no better mother for his future heirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a peer. Bloodlines are everything to him. And while Poppy\u2019s bloodlines have led to an obviously charming result, they\u2019re far from pure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer brother is a peer,\u201d Catherine snapped.</p> <p>\u201cOnly by accident. The Hathaways are a twig on the farthest limb of the family tree. Ramsay may have inherited a title, but in terms of nobility, he\u2019s no more a peer than you or I. And Andover knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a snob you are,\u201d Catherine observed in as calm a tone as she could manage.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t mind the Hathaways\u2019 common blood one bit. In fact, I like them all the better for it. All those anemic daughters of the peerage\u2014none of them could hold a candle to the two girls I saw this morning.\u201d His smile became genuine for one dazzling moment. \u201cWhat a pair. Catching a wild monkey with a comfit jar and string.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave them alone,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cYou play with people as a cat does with mice. Entertain yourself with someone else, Harry. God knows you have no shortage of women who would do anything to please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes them boring,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cNo, don\u2019t leave yet\u2014there\u2019s something I want to ask. Has Poppy said anything to you about me?\u201d</p><p>Mystified, Catherine shook her head. \u201cOnly that it was interesting to finally be able to put a face to the mysterious hotelier.\u201d She stared at him intently. \u201cWhat else should she have told me?\u201d</p><p>Harry adopted an innocent expression. \u201cNothing. I merely wondered if I had made an impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Poppy overlooked you entirely. Her affections are with Mr. Bayning, who, unlike you, is a good, honorable man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wound me. Fortunately in matters of love, most women can be persuaded to choose a bad man over a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you understood anything about love,\u201d Catherine said acidly, \u201cyou would know that Poppy would never choose anyone over the man she has already given her heart to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can have her heart,\u201d came Harry\u2019s casual reply. \u201cAs long as I have the rest of her.\u201d</p><p>As Catherine spluttered in offended fury, Harry stood and went to the door. \u201cLet me show you out. No doubt you\u2019ll want to go back and sound the alarms. For all the good it will do.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long time since Catherine had known such fathomless anxiety. Harry . . . Poppy . . . could he really have designs on her, or had he simply decided to torture Catherine with a cruel jest?</p><p>No, he had not been playacting. Of course Harry wanted Poppy, whose warmth and spontaneity and kindness was completely alien in his sophisticated world. He wanted a respite from his own inexhaustible needs, and once he was done with Poppy, he would have drained her of all the happiness and innocent charm that had attracted him in the first place.</p><p>Catherine didn\u2019t know what to do. She couldn\u2019t expose her own connection to Harry Rutledge, and he knew it.</p><p>The answer was to make certain that Poppy was betrothed to Michael Bayning, publicly betrothed, as soon as possible. Tomorrow Bayning would meet with the family and accompany them to the flower show. Afterward Catherine would find a way to hasten the courtship process. She would tell Cam and Amelia that they must press for the matter to be quickly resolved.</p><p>And if for some reason there was no betrothal\u2014perish the thought\u2014Catherine would suggest that she accompany Poppy on a trip abroad. Perhaps France or Italy. She would even tolerate the company of the galling Lord Ramsay, if he chose to go with them. Anything to keep Poppy safe from Harry Rutledge.</p><p>\u201cWake up, slugabed.\u201d Amelia strode into the bedroom wearing a dressing gown trimmed with cascades of soft lace, her dark hair gathered in a thick, neat braid over one shoulder. She had just come from feeding the baby. Having left him in the nurse-maid\u2019s care, she was now set on the course of waking her husband.</p><p>Cam\u2019s natural preference was to stay up all hours of the night and rise late in the day. This habit was directly opposed to Amelia\u2019s early to bed, early to rise philosophy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Going to one of the windows, she whisked open the curtains to admit the morning light, and was rewarded with a protesting groan from the bed. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cThe maid will be here soon to help me dress. You\u2019d better put something on.\u201d</p><p>She busied herself at her dresser, sorting through a drawer of embroidered stockings. Out of the periphery of her vision she saw Cam stretch, his body lithe and powerful, his skin glowing like clover honey.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Cam said in a sleep-darkened voice, drawing back the bed linens.</p><p>A laugh stirred in her throat. \u201cAbsolutely not. There is too much to be done. Everyone is busy except you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI intend to be busy. As soon as you come here. Monisha, don\u2019t make me chase you this early.\u201d</p><p>Amelia gave him a severe glance as she obeyed. \u201cIt\u2019s not early. In fact, if you don\u2019t wash and dress quickly, we\u2019ll be late to the flower show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be late for flowers?\u201d Cam shook his head and smiled, as he always did when she said something he considered to be gadjo nonsense. His gaze was hot and slumberous. \u201cCome closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d She gave a helpless gasp of laughter as he reached out with astonishing dexterity, snaring her wrist in his hand. \u201cCam, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good Romany wife never refuses her husband,\u201d he teased.</p> <p>\u201cThe maid\u2014\u201d she said breathlessly as she was pulled across the mattress, and clasped against all that warm golden skin.</p><p>\u201cShe can wait.\u201d He unbuttoned her robe, his hand slipping past the lace, fingertips exploring the sensitive curves of her br**sts.</p><p>Amelia\u2019s giggles died away. He knew so much about her\u2014too much\u2014and he never hesitated to take ruthless advantage. She closed her eyes as she reached up to the nape of his neck. The clean, silky locks of his hair slipped through her fingers like liquid.</p><p>Cam kissed her tender throat, while one of his knees nudged between hers. \u201cIt\u2019s either now,\u201d he murmured, \u201cor behind the rhododendrons at the flower show. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>She writhed a little, not in protest but excitement as he trapped her arms in the confining sleeves of the dressing gown. \u201cCam,\u201d she managed to say as his head bent over her exposed br**sts. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be so terribly late . . .\u201d</p><p>He murmured his desire to her, speaking in Romany as he did whenever his mood turned un-civilized, and the exotic syllables fell hotly against her sensitive skin. And for the next several minutes he possessed her, consumed her, with a lack of inhibition that would have seemed barbaric had he not been so gentle.</p> <p>\u201cCam,\u201d she said afterward, her arms clasped around his neck, \u201care you going to say something to Mr. Bayning today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout pansies and primulas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout his intentions toward my sister.\u201d</p><p>Cam smiled down at her as he fingered a loose lock of her hair. \u201cWould you object if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to.\u201d A frown notched the space between her brows. \u201cPoppy is adamant that no one should criticize Mr. Bayning for taking so long to speak to his father about courting her.\u201d</p><p>Gently Cam used the pad of his thumb to smooth away the little frown. \u201cHe\u2019s waited long enough. The Rom say of a man like Bayning, \u2018he would like to eat fish, but he would not like to get in the water.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Amelia responded with a humorless chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating, to know that he\u2019s tiptoeing around the issue like this. I wish Bayning would simply go to his father and have it out.\u201d</p><p>Cam, who knew something about the aristocracy from his days as the manager of an exclusive gaming club, said dryly, \u201cA young man who stands to inherit as much as Bayning has to tread softly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. He has gotten my sister\u2019s hopes very high. If it all comes to naught, she\u2019ll be devastated. And he has kept her from being courted by other men, and wasted an entire season\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d Cam rolled to his side, taking her with him. \u201cI agree with you, monisha . . . this shadow courtship must end. I\u2019ll make certain Bayning understands that it\u2019s time to take action. And I\u2019ll speak to the viscount, if that will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Amelia tucked her cheek into one of the hard curves of his chest, seeking comfort. \u201cI\u2019ll be so glad when this is resolved. Lately I haven\u2019t been able to rid myself of the feeling that things won\u2019t turn out well for Poppy and Mr. Bayning. I hope I\u2019m wrong. I want so badly for Poppy to be happy, and . . . what will we do, if he breaks her heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d he murmured, cuddling her. \u201cAnd love her. That\u2019s what a family is for.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Poppy was light-headed with nerves and excitement. Michael would soon arrive to accompany the family to the flower show. After all their subterfuge, this was the first step toward an openly acknowledged courtship.</p><p>She had dressed with extra care in a yellow walking dress trimmed with black velvet cord. The layered skirts were caught up at intervals with black velvet bows. Beatrix wore a similar ensemble, only hers was blue trimmed in chocolate.</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Miss Marks had pronounced, smiling as they entered the receiving room of the family suite. \u201cYou will be the two most elegant young ladies at the flower show.\u201d She reached up to Poppy\u2019s upswept curls and anchored a pin more securely. \u201cAnd I predict that Mr. Bayning will not be able to take his gaze off you,\u201d she added. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bit late,\u201d Poppy said tensely. \u201cIt\u2019s not like him.

I would never have had your patience. Really, they should levy a tax on London bachelors until they marry. That would hasten the entire courtship process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why people have to marry at all,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cThere was no one to marry Adam and Eve, was there? They lived together naturally. Why should any of us bother with a wedding if they didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Poppy gave a nervous laugh. \u201cWhen Mr. Bayning is here,\u201d she said, \u201clet\u2019s not bring up any outlandish debate topics, Bea. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not used to our way of . . . well, our . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cColorful discussions,\u201d Miss Marks suggested.</p> <p>Amelia grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Poppy. We\u2019ll be so staid and proper, we\u2019ll be absolute bores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Poppy said fervently.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to be boring, too?\u201d Beatrix asked Miss Marks, who nodded emphatically.</p><p>With a sigh, Beatrix went to a table in the corner and began to empty her pockets.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s stomach flipped as she heard a knock at the door. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI will answer,\u201d Miss Marks said. She gave Poppy a quick smile. \u201cBreathe, dear.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy nodded and tried to calm herself. She saw Amelia and Cam exchange a glance she could not interpret. The understanding between the pair was so absolute, it seemed they could read each other\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>She was tempted to smile as she remembered Beatrix\u2019s comment that rabbits were happiest in pairs. Beatrix had been right. Poppy wanted very much to be loved, to be part of a pair. And she had waited for so long, and she was still unwed when friends her age had already married and had two or three children. It seemed a common fate for Hathaways to find love later rather than sooner.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s thoughts were interrupted as Michael entered the room and bowed. A surge of gladness was tempered by the sight of his expression, more grim than she had ever imagined possible. His complexion was pale, his eyes reddened as if he\u2019d had no sleep. He looked ill, as a matter of fact.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bayning,\u201d she said softly, her heart beating like a small animal fighting to free itself from a net. \u201cAre you well? What is the matter?\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s brown eyes, usually so warm, were bleak as he glanced at her family. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI hardly know what to say.\u201d His breath seemed to shiver in his throat. \u201cI am in some . . . some difficulty . . . it\u2019s impossible.\u201d His gaze settled on Poppy. \u201cMiss Hathaway, I must speak with you. I don\u2019t know if it would be possible to have a moment alone . . .\u201d</p><p>A difficult silence followed the request. Cam stared at the young man with an unfathomable expression, while Amelia gave a slight shake of her head as if to deny what was coming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that would not be proper, Mr. Bayning,\u201d Miss Marks murmured. \u201cWe have Miss Hathaway\u2019s reputation to consider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He passed a hand over his forehead, and Poppy realized that his fingers were trembling.</p> <p>Something was very wrong indeed.</p><p>An icy calm settled over her. She spoke in a dazed voice that didn\u2019t sound quite like her own. \u201cAmelia, perhaps you might stay in the room with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the family, including Miss Marks, left the room.</p><p>Poppy felt cold runnels of perspiration beneath her chemise, damp patches blossoming at the pits of her arms. She took a place on the settee and watched Michael with dilated eyes. \u201cYou may have a seat,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He hesitated and glanced at Amelia, who had gone to stand beside the window.</p><p>\u201cPlease do have a seat, Mr. Bayning,\u201d Amelia said, staring at the street outside. \u201cI\u2019m trying to pretend I\u2019m not here. I\u2019m so sorry you can\u2019t have more privacy than this, but I\u2019m afraid Miss Marks is right. Poppy\u2019s reputation must be protected.\u201d</p><p>Although there was no trace of rebuke in her tone, Michael flinched visibly. Occupying the space next to Poppy, he took her hands and bent his head over them. His fingers were even colder than hers. \u201cI had an unholy row with my father last night,\u201d he said, his voice muffled. \u201cIt seems one of the rumors reached him about my interest in you. About my intentions. He was . . . outraged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been dreadful,\u201d Poppy said, knowing that Michael rarely, if ever, quarreled with his father. He held the viscount in awe, striving always to please him.</p><p>\u201cWorse than dreadful.\u201d Michael took an unsteady breath. \u201cI\u2019ll spare you the particulars. The result of a long, very ugly argument is that the viscount gave me an ultimatum. If I marry you, I will be cut off. He will no longer recognize me as his son, and I will be disinherited.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no sound in the room except for Amelia\u2019s swiftly indrawn breath.</p><p>Pain unfolded in Poppy\u2019s chest, crowding the breath from her lungs. \u201cWhat reason did he give?\u201d she managed to ask.</p><p>\u201cOnly that you do not fit the mold of a Bayning bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you allow time for his temper to cool . . . try to change his mind . . . I can wait, Michael. I\u2019ll wait forever.\u201d</p> <p>Michael shook his head. \u201cI cannot encourage you to wait. My father\u2019s refusal was absolute. It could take years to change his mind, if ever. And in the meantime, you deserve the chance to find happiness.\u201d</p><p>Poppy stared at him steadily. \u201cI could only be happy with you.\u201d</p><p>Michael raised his head, his eyes dark and glittering. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Poppy. Sorry for giving you any reason to hope, when it was never possible. My only excuse is that I thought I knew my father, when apparently I don\u2019t. I always believed I could convince him to accept the woman I loved, that my judgment would be enough. And I\u2014\u201d His voice cracked. He swallowed audibly. \u201cI do love you. I . . . hell and damnation, I\u2019ll never forgive him for this.\u201d Releasing her hands, he reached into his coat pocket and extracted a packet of letters tied with cord. All the letters she had written to him. \u201cI\u2019m honor bound to return these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give yours back,\u201d Poppy said, taking the letters in a shaking hand. \u201cI want to keep them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is your right, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMichael,\u201d Poppy said brokenly, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I can\u2019t give you any reason to hope.\u201d</p><p>They were both quiet and trembling, staring at each other in despair.</p><p>Amelia\u2019s voice pierced through the suffocating silence. She sounded blessedly rational. \u201cThe viscount\u2019s objections needn\u2019t stop you, Mr. Bayning. He can\u2019t prevent you from inheriting the title and entailed properties, can he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake my sister to Gretna Green. We\u2019ll provide the carriage. My sister\u2019s dowry is large enough to secure a handsome annuity for you both. If you need more, my husband will increase it.\u201d Amelia leveled a steady, challenging gaze at him. \u201cIf you want my sister, Mr. Bayning, marry her. The Hathaways will help you weather what storms may come.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy had never loved her sister more than she did at that moment. She stared at Amelia with a wobbly smile, her eyes brimming.</p><p>Her smile vanished, however, as Michael answered dully. \u201cThe title and real estate are entailed, but until my father dies, I would be abandoned to my own resources, which are nonexistent. And I can\u2019t live off the charity of my wife\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not charity when it\u2019s family,\u201d Amelia countered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand how things are with the Baynings,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThis is a matter of honor. I\u2019m the only son. I\u2019ve been raised for one thing since I was born\u2014to assume the responsibilities of my rank and title. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known. I can\u2019t live as an outcast, outside my father\u2019s sphere. I can\u2019t live with scandal and ostracism.\u201d He hung his head. \u201cSweet God, I\u2019m weary of arguing. My brain\u2019s gone in circles all night.\u201d</p><p>Poppy saw the impatience on her sister\u2019s face, and she knew that Amelia was prepared to fight him on every point, for her sake. But she held Amelia\u2019s gaze and shook her head, sending the silent message, It\u2019s no use. Michael had already decided on his course. He would never defy his father. Arguing would only make him more miserable than he already was.</p><p>Amelia closed her mouth and turned to stare out the window again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Michael said after a long silence, still gripping Poppy\u2019s hands. \u201cI never meant to deceive you. Everything I told you about my feelings\u2014every word was true. My only regret is that I wasted your time. Valuable time for a girl in your position.\u201d</p><p>Although he hadn\u2019t meant that as a slight, Poppy winced.</p> <p>A girl in her position.</p><p>Twenty-three. Unmarried. On the shelf after her third season.</p><p>Carefully she drew her hands from Michael\u2019s. \u201cNot a moment was wasted,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cI am the better for having known you, Mr. Bayning. Please don\u2019t have any regrets. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d he said in an aching voice that nearly undid her.</p><p>She was terrified that she might burst into tears. \u201cPlease go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could make you understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I do. And I will be perfectly\u2014\u201d She broke off and swallowed hard. \u201cPlease go. Please.\u201d</p><p>She was aware of Amelia coming forward, murmuring something to Michael, efficiently shepherding him out of the suite before Poppy lost her composure. Dear Amelia, who did not hesitate to take charge of a man much larger than herself.</p><p>A hen chasing a cow, Poppy thought, and she let out a watery giggle even as hot tears began to slide from her eyes.</p><p>After closing the door firmly, Amelia sat beside Poppy and reached out to grasp her shoulders. She stared into Poppy\u2019s blurred eyes. \u201cYou are,\u201d she said, her voice ragged with emotion, \u201csuch a lady, Poppy. And much kinder than he deserved. I am so proud of you. I wonder if he understands how much he has lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d</p><p>Amelia tugged a handkerchief from her sleeve and gave it to her. \u201cDebatable. But I won\u2019t criticize him, since it won\u2019t help matters. However, I must say . . . the phrase \u2018I can\u2019t\u2019 comes rather too easily to his lips.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe is an obedient son,\u201d Poppy said, mopping at her tears, then giving up and simply wadding the handkerchief against her flooding eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, well . . . from now on, I advise you to look for a man with his own means of support.\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head, her face still buried in the handkerchief. \u201cThere\u2019s no one for me.\u201d</p><p>She felt her sister\u2019s arms go around her. \u201cThere is. There is, I promise you. He\u2019s waiting. He\u2019ll find you. And someday Michael Bayning will be nothing but a distant memory.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy began to cry in earnest, wracking sobs that caused her ribs to ache. \u201cGod,\u201d she managed to gasp. \u201cThis hurts, Amelia. And it feels as if it will never end.\u201d</p><p>Carefully Amelia guided Poppy\u2019s head to her shoulder and kissed her wet cheek. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI lived through it once. I remember what it was like. You\u2019ll cry, and then you\u2019ll be angry, and then despairing, and then angry again. But I know of a cure for heartbreak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Poppy asked, letting out a shuddery sigh.</p><p>\u201cTime . . . prayer . . . and most of all a family that loves you. You will always be loved, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>Poppy managed a wavering smile. \u201cThank God for sisters,\u201d she said, and wept against Amelia\u2019s shoulder.</p> <p>Much later that night, there came a determined knock at the door of Harry Rutledge\u2019s private apartment. Jake Valentine paused in the act of laying out fresh clothes and polished black shoes for the morning. He went to answer the door and was confronted by a vaguely familiar\u2013looking woman. She was small and slight, with light brown hair and blue gray eyes, and a pair of round spectacles perched on her nose. He considered her for a moment, trying to place her.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish to see Mr. Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not at home.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted at the well-worn phrase, used by servants when the master didn\u2019t wish to be disturbed. She spoke to him with scalding contempt. \u201cDo you mean \u2018not at home\u2019 in the sense that he doesn\u2019t want to see me, or \u2018not at home\u2019 in the sense that he\u2019s actually gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way,\u201d Jake said implacably, \u201cyou won\u2019t see him tonight. But the truth is, he really isn\u2019t here. Is there a message I may convey to him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Tell him that I hope he rots in hell for what he did to Poppy Hathaway. And then tell him that if he goes near her, I\u2019ll murder him.\u201d</p><p>Jake responded with a complete lack of alarm due to the fact that death threats against Harry were a more or less common occurrence. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give him the message,\u201d she said curtly. \u201cHe\u2019ll know who it\u2019s from.\u201d</p><p>Two days after Michael Bayning had visited the hotel, the Hathaways\u2019 brother Leo, Lord Ramsay, came to call. Like other men-about-town, Leo leased a small Mayfair terrace during the season, and at the end of June retreated to his estate in the country. Although Leo could easily have chosen to live with the family at the Rutledge, he preferred privacy.</p><p>No one could deny that Leo was a handsome man, tall and broad shouldered, with dark brown hair and striking eyes. Unlike his sisters, his eyes were a light shade of blue, glacier colored with dark rims. Haunting. World-weary. He comported himself as a rake and did a thorough job of it, appearing never to care about anyone or anything. There were moments, however, when the mask was lifted just long enough to reveal a man of extraordinary feeling, and it was in those rare moments that Catherine was most apprehensive around him.</p><p>When they were in London, Leo was usually too busy to spend time with his family, for which Catherine was grateful. From the moment they had met, she had felt an intrinsic dislike for him, and he for her, flint and iron striking to create sparks of hatred. At times they competed to see who could say the most hurtful things to the other, each of them testing, prodding, trying to find places of vulnerability. They couldn\u2019t seem to help it, the constant urge to cut each other down to size.</p><p>Catherine answered the door of the family suite, and a jolt of reaction went through her as she was confronted by Leo\u2019s lanky, big-framed form. He was fashionably dressed in a dark coat with wide lapels, loose trousers with no creases, and a boldly patterned waistcoat with silver buttons.</p><p>He surveyed her with wintry eyes, an arrogant smile tilting the corners of his lips. \u201cGood afternoon, Marks.\u201d</p> <p>Catherine was stone-faced, her voice edged with scorn. \u201cLord Ramsay. I\u2019m surprised you could tear yourself away from your amusements long enough to visit your sister.\u201d</p><p>Leo gave her a look of bemused mockery. \u201cWhat have I done to earn a scolding? You know, Marks, if you ever learned to hold your tongue, your chances of attracting a man would rise exponentially.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy would I want to attract a man? I have yet to see anything they\u2019re good for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf for nothing else,\u201d Leo said, \u201cyou need us to help produce more women.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow is my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeartbroken.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s mouth turned grim. \u201cLet me in, Marks. I want to see her.\u201d</p><p>Catherine took a grudging step aside.</p><p>Leo went into the receiving room and found Poppy sitting alone with a book. He gave her an assessing glance. His normally bright-eyed sister was pale and drawn. She seemed unutterably weary, temporarily aged by grief.</p><p>Fury welled inside him. There were few people that mattered to him in the world, but Poppy was one of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was unfair that the people who longed for love the most, searched the hardest for it, found it so elusive. And there seemed no good reason why Poppy, the prettiest girl in London, shouldn\u2019t have been married by now. But Leo had gone through lists of acquaintances in his mind, pondering whether any of them would do for his sister, and none of them was remotely suitable. If one had the right temperament, he was an idiot or in his dotage. And then there were the lechers, the spendthrifts, and the reprobates. God help him, the peerage was a deplorable collection of male specimens. And he included himself in that estimation.</p><p>\u201cHello, sis,\u201d Leo said gently, approaching her. \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d</p><p>Poppy managed a wan smile. \u201cCam is out on business matters, and Amelia and Beatrix are at the park, pushing Rye in the perambulator.\u201d She moved her feet to make room for him on the settee. \u201cHow are you, Leo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind that. What about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever better,\u201d she said bravely.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see that.\u201d Leo sat and reached for Poppy, gathering her close. He held her, patting her back, until he heard her sniffle. \u201cThat bastard,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cShall I kill him for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said in a congested voice, \u201cit wasn\u2019t his fault. He sincerely wanted to marry me. His intentions were good.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t ever trust men with good intentions. They\u2019ll always disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>Refusing to smile at his quip, Poppy drew back to look at him. \u201cI want to go home, Leo,\u201d she said plaintively.</p> <p>\u201cOf course you do, darling. But you can\u2019t yet.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, why not?\u201d Catherine Marks asked tartly, sitting in a nearby chair.</p><p>Leo paused to send a brief scowl in the companion\u2019s direction before returning his attention to Poppy. \u201cRumors are flying,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cLast night I went to a drum, given by the wife of the Spanish ambassador\u2014one of those things you go to only to be able to say you went\u2014and I couldn\u2019t count the number of times I was asked about you and Bayning. Everyone seems to think that you were in love with Bayning, and that he rejected you because his father thinks you\u2019re not good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy, this is London society, where the truth can get you into trouble. If you tell one truth, you\u2019ll have to tell another truth, and another, to keep covering up.\u201d</p> <p>That elicited a genuine smile from her. \u201cAre you trying to give me advice, Leo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and although I always tell you to ignore my advice, this time you\u2019d better take it. The last significant event of the season is a ball held by Lord and Lady Norbury next week\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have just written our regrets,\u201d Catherine informed him. \u201cPoppy does not wish to attend.\u201d</p><p>Leo glanced at her sharply. \u201cHave the regrets been sent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTear them up, then. That\u2019s an order.\u201d Leo saw her narrow frame stiffen, and he got a perverse pleasure from the sight.</p><p>\u201cBut, Leo,\u201d Poppy protested, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to a ball. People might be watching to see if I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will certainly be watching,\u201d Leo said. \u201cLike a flock of vultures. Which is why you have to attend. Because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be shredded by the gossips, and mocked without mercy when next season begins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI\u2019ll never go through another season again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may change your mind. And I want you to have the choice. Which is why you\u2019re going to the ball, Poppy. You\u2019ll wear your prettiest dress, and blue ribbons in your hair, and show them all that you don\u2019t give a damn about Michael Bayning. You\u2019re going to dance and laugh, and hold your head high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d Poppy groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. Your pride demands it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to be proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d Leo said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t stop me, does it?\u201d He glanced from Poppy\u2019s reluctant expression to Catherine\u2019s unreadable one. \u201cTell her I\u2019m right, damn it,\u201d he told her. \u201cShe has to go, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Catherine hesitated uncomfortably. Much as it galled her to admit it, Leo was indeed right. A confident, smiling appearance by Poppy at the ball would do much to still the wagging tongues of London parlors. But her instincts urged that Poppy should be taken to the safety of Hampshire as soon as possible. As long as she remained in town, she was in Harry Rutledge\u2019s reach.</p><p>On the other hand . . . Harry never attended such events, where desperate matchmaking mothers with unclaimed daughters scrabbled to snare every last available bachelor. Harry would never lower himself to go to the Norbury ball, especially since his appearance there would turn it into a veritable circus.</p><p>\u201cPlease control your language,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cYes, you are right. However, it will be difficult for Poppy. And if she loses her composure at the ball\u2014if she gives way to tears\u2014it will give the gossips even more ammunition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lose my composure,\u201d Poppy said, sounding drained. \u201cI feel as if I\u2019ve cried enough for a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Leo said softly. He glanced at Catherine\u2019s troubled expression and smiled. \u201cIt appears we\u2019ve finally agreed on something, Marks. But don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>The Norbury ball was held in Belgravia, a district of calm and quietness in the heart of London. One could be overwhelmed by the bustle and roar of traffic and activity on Knightsbridge or Sloane Street, cross over to Belgrave Square, and find oneself in an oasis of soothing decorum. It was a place of large marble embassies and grand white terraces, of solemn mansions with tall powdered footmen and stout butlers, and carriages conveying languid young ladies and their tiny overfed dogs.</p><p>The surrounding districts of London held little interest for those fortunate enough to live in Belgravia. Conversations were largely about local matters\u2014who had taken a particular house, or what nearby street needed repairs, or what events had taken place at a neighboring residence.</p><p>To Poppy\u2019s dismay, Cam and Amelia had agreed with Leo\u2019s assessment of the situation. A show of pride and unconcern was called for if Poppy wished to stem the tide of gossip concerning Michael Bayning\u2019s rejection. \u201cThe gadje has a long memory of these matters,\u201d Cam had said sardonically. \u201cGod knows why they attach such importance to things of no consequence. But they do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only one evening,\u201d Amelia had told Poppy in concern. \u201cDo you think you could manage an appearance, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Poppy had agreed dully. \u201cIf you are there, I can manage it.\u201d</p><p>However, as she ascended the front steps to the mansion\u2019s portico, Poppy was swamped with regret and dread. The glass of wine she\u2019d had to bolster her courage had pooled like acid in her stomach, and her corset had been laced too tightly.</p><p>She wore a white dress, layers of draped satin and pale blue illusion. Her waist was cinched with a belt of satin folds, the bodice deep and scooped and trimmed with another delicate froth of blue. After arranging her hair in a mass of pinned-up curls, Amelia had threaded a thin blue ribbon through it.</p><p>Leo had arrived, as promised, to accompany the family to the ball. He held out his arm for Poppy and escorted her up the stairs, while the family followed en masse. They entered the overheated house, which was filled with flowers, music, and the din of hundreds of simultaneous conversations. Doors had been removed from their hinges to allow for the circulation of guests from the ballroom to the supper and card rooms.</p> <p>The Hathaways waited in a receiving line in the entrance hall.</p><p>\u201cLook how dignified and polite they all are,\u201d Leo said, observing the crowd. \u201cI can\u2019t stay long. Someone might influence me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised you would stay until after the first set,\u201d Poppy reminded him.</p><p>Her brother sighed. \u201cFor you, I will. But I despise these affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I,\u201d Miss Marks surprised them all by saying grimly, surveying the gathering as if it were enemy territory.</p><p>\u201cMy God. Something else we agree on.\u201d Leo gave the companion a half-mocking, half-uneasy glance. \u201cWe have to stop doing this, Marks. My stomach is starting to turn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease do not say that word,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cStomach? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is indelicate to refer to your anatomy.\u201d She gave his tall form a disdainful glance. \u201cAnd I assure you, no one has any interest in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think not? I\u2019ll have you know, Marks, that scores of women have remarked on my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRamsay,\u201d Cam interrupted, giving him a warning glance.</p><p>When they had made it through the entrance hall, the family dispersed to make the rounds. Leo and Cam went to the card rooms, while the women headed to the supper tables. Amelia was instantly captured by a small group of chattering matrons.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat,\u201d Poppy commented, glancing with revulsion at the long buffet of cold joints, beef, ham, and lobster salads.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved,\u201d Beatrix. said apologetically. \u201cDo you mind if I have something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all, we\u2019ll wait with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a spoonful of salad,\u201d Miss Marks murmured to Poppy. \u201cFor appearance\u2019s sake. And smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d Poppy attempted to turn the corners of her mouth upward.</p><p>Beatrix regarded her doubtfully. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not pretty at all. You look like a salmon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a salmon,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cOne that\u2019s been boiled, shredded and potted.\u201d</p><p>As the guests queued at the buffet, footmen filled their plates and carried them to nearby tables.</p><p>Poppy was still waiting in line when she was approached by Lady Belinda Wallscourt, a pretty young woman she had befriended during the Season. As soon as Belinda had come out into society, she was pursued by several eligible gentlemen, and had quickly become betrothed.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d Lady Belinda said warmly, \u201chow nice to see you here. There was uncertainty as to whether you would come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last ball of the Season?\u201d Poppy said with a forced smile. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad.\u201d Lady Belinda gave her a compassionate glance. Her voice lowered. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, what happened to you. I\u2019m dreadfully sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s nothing to be sorry about,\u201d Poppy said brightly. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very brave,\u201d Belinda replied. \u201cAnd Poppy, remember that someday you will meet a frog who will turn into a handsome prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cBecause all she\u2019s met so far are princes who turn into frogs.\u201d</p><p>Looking perplexed, Belinda managed a smile and left them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMr. Bayning is not a frog,\u201d Poppy protested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cThat was very unfair to frogs, who are lovely creatures.\u201d</p><p>As Poppy parted her lips to object, she heard Miss Marks snicker. And she began to laugh as well, until they attracted curious glances from the queue at the buffet.</p><p>After Beatrix had finished eating, they wandered to the ballroom. Music fluttered downward in continuous drifts from the orchestra playing in the upper gallery. The massive room glittered in the light of eight chandeliers, while the sweetness of abundant roses and greenery thickened the air.</p> <p>Locked in the unforgiving bondage of her corset, Poppy filled her lungs with strained breaths. \u201cIt\u2019s too warm in here,\u201d she said.</p><p>Miss Marks glanced at her perspiring face, quickly produced a handkerchief, and guided her into one of the many cane openwork chairs at the side of the room. \u201cIt is quite warm,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a moment, I will locate your brother or Mr. Rohan to escort you outside for some air. But first let me see to Beatrix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Poppy managed, seeing that two men had already approached Beatrix in hopes of entering their names on her dance card. Her younger sister was at ease with men in a way that Poppy could never manage. They seemed to adore Beatrix because she treated them as she did her wild creatures, gently humoring, showing patient interest.</p><p>While Miss Marks supervised Beatrix\u2019s dance card, Poppy settled back in her chair and concentrated on breathing around the iron prison of her corset. It was unfortunate that in this particular chair, she was able to hear a conversation from the other side of a garlanded column.</p><p>A trio of young women spoke in low tones that oozed with smug satisfaction.</p> <p>\u201cOf course Bayning wouldn\u2019t have her,\u201d one of them said. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty, I\u2019ll allow, but so mal-adroit, in the social sense. A gentleman I know said that he tried to talk to her at the private art viewing at the Royal Academy, and she was prattling about some ridiculous topic . . . something about a long-ago French balloon experiment when they sent a sheep up into the air in front of King Louis something-or-other . . . can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouis the sixteenth,\u201d Poppy whispered.</p><p>\u201cBut what would you expect?\u201d came another voice. \u201cSuch an odd family. The only one good enough for society is Lord Ramsay, and he is quite wicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA scapegrace,\u201d the other one agreed.</p><p>Poppy went from being overheated to chilled. She closed her eyes sickly, wishing she could disappear. It had been a mistake to come to the ball. She was trying to prove something to everyone . . . that she didn\u2019t care about Michael Bayning, when she did. That her heart wasn\u2019t broken, when it was. Everything in London was about appearances, pretenses . . . was it so unforgivable to be honest about one\u2019s feelings?</p><p>Apparently so.</p> <p>She sat quietly, knitting her gloved fingers together until her thoughts were diverted by a stir near the main entrance of the ballroom. It seemed that some important person had arrived, perhaps royalty, or a military celebrity, or an influential politician.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d one of the young women asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone new,\u201d the other said.</p><p>\u201cAnd handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivine,\u201d her companion agreed. \u201cHe must be a man of consequence\u2014otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be such a to-do.\u201d</p><p>A light laugh. \u201cAnd Lady Norbury wouldn\u2019t be fluttering so. See how she blushes!\u201d</p><p>Curious despite herself, Poppy leaned forward to catch a glimpse of the newcomer. All she could make out was a dark head, taller than the others around him. He walked further into the ballroom, talking easily with his companions while the stout, bejeweled, and beaming Lady Norbury clung to his arm.</p><p>Recognizing him, Poppy sat back in her chair.</p> <p>Harry Rutledge.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fathom why he would be here, or why that made her smile.</p><p>Probably because she couldn\u2019t help recalling the last time she had seen him, dressed in fencing whites, trying to skewer a misbehaving monkey. Tonight Harry was forbiddingly handsome in full evening attire and a crisp white cravat. And he moved and conversed with the same charismatic ease that he appeared to do everything.</p><p>Miss Marks returned to Poppy, while Beatrix and a fair-haired man disappeared into the whirl of waltzing couples. \u201cHow do you\u2014\u201d she began, but stopped with a sharply indrawn breath. \u201cDamn and blast,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time Poppy had ever heard her companion curse. Surprised by Miss Marks\u2019s reaction to Harry Rutledge\u2019s presence at the ball, Poppy frowned. \u201cI noticed. But why do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off as she followed the direction of her companion\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Miss Marks wasn\u2019t looking at Harry Rutledge.</p><p>She was looking at Michael Bayning.</p><p>An explosion of pain filled Poppy\u2019s chest as she saw her former suitor across the room, slim and handsome, his gaze fixed on her. He had rejected her, exposed her to public mockery, and then he had come to a ball? Was he searching for a new girl to court now? Perhaps he had assumed that while he danced with eager young women in Belgravia, Poppy would be hiding in her hotel suite, weeping into her pillow.</p><p>Which was precisely what she wanted to be doing.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Poppy whispered, staring into Miss Marks\u2019s concerned face. \u201cDon\u2019t let him talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t make a scene,\u201d her companion said softly. \u201cQuite the opposite\u2014a pleasantry or two will smooth the situation over for both of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Poppy said hoarsely. \u201cI can\u2019t do pleasantries right now. I can\u2019t face him. Please, Miss Marks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send him away,\u201d her companion said softly, squaring her narrow shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Collect yourself, dear.\u201d She moved in front of Poppy, blocking Michael\u2019s view, and went forward to speak to him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Poppy whispered, even though Miss Marks couldn\u2019t hear. Horrified to feel the sting of desperate tears, she concentrated blindly on a section of floor in front of her. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cMiss Hathaway.\u201d Lady Norbury\u2019s jovial voice intruded on her frantic thoughts. \u201cThis gentleman has requested an introduction, you fortunate girl! It is my honor and delight to present Mr. Harry Rutledge, the hotelier.\u201d</p> <p>A pair of highly polished black shoes came into her vision. Poppy glanced miserably up into his vivid green eyes.</p><p>Harry bowed, holding her gaze. \u201cMiss Hathaway, how do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to waltz,\u201d Poppy said, practically leaping from her chair and seizing his arm. Her throat was so tight, she could hardly speak. \u201cLet\u2019s go now.\u201d</p><p>Lady Norbury gave a disconcerted laugh. \u201cWhat charming enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>Poppy gripped Harry\u2019s arm as if it were a lifeline. His gaze dropped to the clench of her fingers on the fine black wool of his sleeve. He covered her fingers with the reassuring pressure of his free hand, his thumb smoothing over the edge of her wrist. And even through two layers of white gloves, she felt the comfort in his touch.</p> <p>At that moment Miss Marks returned, having just dispatched Michael Bayning. Her brows lowered in a scowl as she looked up at Harry. \u201cNo,\u201d she said shortly.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d His lips twitched with amusement. \u201cI haven\u2019t asked for anything yet.\u201d</p><p>Miss Marks gave him a cold stare. \u201cObviously you wish to dance with Miss Hathaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have objections?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cSeveral,\u201d Miss Marks said, her manner so curt that both Lady Norbury and Poppy looked askance.</p><p>\u201cMiss Marks,\u201d Lady Norbury said, \u201cI can vouch for this gentleman\u2019s character with all assurance.\u201d</p> <p>The companion pressed her lips into a hyphen. She surveyed Poppy\u2019s glittering eyes and flushed face, seeming to understand how close she was to losing her composure. \u201cWhen the dance is finished,\u201d she told Poppy grimly, \u201cyou will take his left arm, insist that he conduct you directly back to me, here, and then he will take his leave. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Poppy whispered, glancing over Harry\u2019s broad shoulder.</p><p>Michael was staring at her from across the room, his face ashen.</p><p>The situation was hideous. Poppy wanted to run from the ballroom. Instead, she would have to dance.</p><p>Harry led Poppy toward the crowd of waltzing couples and settled his gloved hand at her waist. She reached for him, one palm light and trembling at his shoulder, her other hand gripped securely in his. In one astute glance, Harry took in the entire scene: Poppy\u2019s unshed tears, Michael Bayning\u2019s set face, and the slew of curious gazes encompassing them.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cTake me away,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as possible from here. Timbuktu.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked sympathetic and amused. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re letting in Europeans these days.\u201d He drew Poppy into the current of dancers, swift counterclockwise turns in a clockwise pattern, and the only way to keep from stumbling was to follow him without hesitation.</p> <p>Poppy was profoundly grateful to have something to focus on besides Michael. As she might have expected, Harry Rutledge was an excellent dancer. Poppy relaxed into his smooth, strong lead. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t wonder. It was written on your face, and Bayning\u2019s, for everyone to see. You\u2019re not very good at subterfuge, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never needed to be.\u201d To Poppy\u2019s horror, her throat clenched and her eyes stung. She was about to burst into tears in front of everyone. As she tried to take a steadying breath, the corset squeezed her lungs, and she felt dizzy. \u201cMr. Rutledge,\u201d she wheezed, \u201cCould you take me out to the terrace for some air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d His voice was reassuringly calm. \u201cOne more circuit around the room, and we\u2019ll slip out.\u201d</p><p>In other circumstances, Poppy might have taken pleasure in the sureness of his lead, the music that gilded the air. She stared fixedly at the dark face of her unlikely rescuer. He was dazzling in the elegant clothes, his heavy dark hair brushed back in disciplined layers. But his eyes were underpinned by the ever-present hint of shadows. Windows to a restless soul. He didn\u2019t sleep enough, she thought, and wondered if anyone ever dared mention it to him.</p><p>Even through the haze of numb desolation, it occurred to Poppy that by asking her to dance, Harry Rutledge had singled her out in what could have been construed by many as a declaration of interest.</p><p>But that couldn\u2019t be true.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked faintly, without thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask me to dance?\u201d</p><p>Harry hesitated as if torn between the necessity of tact and the inclination toward honesty. He settled on the latter. \u201cBecause I wanted to hold you.\u201d</p><p>Thrown into confusion, Poppy focused on the simple knot of his white cravat. At another time, in another situation, she would have been extraordinarily flattered. At the moment, however, she was too absorbed in her despair over Michael. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With sneak-thief adroitness, Harry extricated her from the aggregate of dancers and led her to the row of French doors opening onto the terrace. She followed blindly, hardly caring if they were seen or not.</p><p>The air outside was a brace of coolness, dry and sharp in her lungs. Poppy breathed in rapid gasps, grateful to have escaped the smothering atmosphere of the ballroom. Hot tears slid from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Harry said, guiding her to the far side of the balcony, which extended nearly the full width of the mansion. The lawn below was a quiet ocean. Harry brought Poppy to a shadowed corner. Reaching inside his coat pocket, he found a pressed square of fine linen and gave it to her.</p><p>Poppy blotted her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you,\u201d she said unsteadily, \u201chow very sorry I am. You were so kind in asking me to dance, and now you\u2019re k-keeping company with a w-watering pot.\u201d</p> <p>Looking amused and sympathetic, Harry leaned an elbow on the balcony railing as he faced her. His quietness relieved her. He waited patiently, as if he understood that no words could be an adequate plaster for her bruised spirit.</p><p>Poppy let out a slow breath, feeling soothed by the coolness of the night and the blessed lack of noise. \u201cMr. Bayning was going to offer for me,\u201d she told Harry. She blew her nose with a childlike gust. \u201cBut he changed his mind.\u201d</p><p>Harry studied her, his eyes catlike in the darkness. \u201cWhat reason did he give?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father didn\u2019t approve of the match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that surprises you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cBecause he made promises to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen in Bayning\u2019s position are rarely, if ever, allowed to marry whomever they want. There\u2019s far more to consider than their personal preferences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore important than love?\u201d Poppy asked with bitter vehemence.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen all is said and done, marriage is a union of two people made by the same God. Nothing more, nothing less. Does that sound na\u00efve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said flatly.</p> <p>Poppy\u2019s lips quirked, although she felt nothing close to actual amusement. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve read too many fairy tales. The prince is supposed to slay the dragon, defeat the villain, and marry the servant girl, and carry her off to his castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairy tales are best read as entertainment,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNot as a guide to life.\u201d He removed his gloves methodically and tucked them into one of his coat pockets. Resting both his forearms on the railing, he sent her a sideways glance. \u201cWhat does the servant girl do when the prince abandons her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe goes home.\u201d Poppy\u2019s fingers tightened on the damp ball of the handkerchief. \u201cI\u2019m not suited for London and all its illusions. I want to return to Hampshire, where I can rusticate in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd marry a farmer?\u201d he asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Poppy dried the residue of her tears. \u201cI would make a wonderful farmwife. I\u2019m good with cows. I know how to make hotchpotch. And I would appreciate the peace and quiet for my reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHotchpotch? What is that?\u201d Harry seemed to have undue interest in the subject, his head inclined toward hers.</p> <p>\u201cA harvest vegetable broth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you learn to make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother.\u201d Poppy lowered her voice as if imparting highly confidential information. \u201cThe secret,\u201d she said wisely, \u201cis a splash of ale.\u201d</p><p>They were standing too close. Poppy knew she should move away. But his nearness felt like shelter, and his scent was fresh and beguiling. The night air raised gooseflesh on her bare arms. How large and warm he was. She wanted to match herself against him and burrow inside the haven of his coat as if she were one of Beatrix\u2019s small pets.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not meant to be a farmwife,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Poppy gave him a rueful glance. \u201cYou think no farmer would have me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthat you should marry a man who would appreciate you.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cThose are in short supply.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a supply. You just need one.\u201d He grasped Poppy\u2019s shoulder, his hand curving over the illusion-trimmed sleeve of her gown until she felt its warmth through the fragile gauze. His thumb toyed with the filmy edge of fabric, brushing her skin in a way that made her stomach tighten. \u201cPoppy,\u201d he said gently, \u201cwhat if I asked for permission to court you?\u201d</p><p>She went blank as astonishment swept through her.</p><p>Finally, someone had asked to court her.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t Michael, or any of the diffident, superior aristocrats she had met during three failed seasons. It was Harry Rutledge, an elusive and enigmatic man she had known only a matter of days.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d was all she could manage.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re interesting and beautiful. Because saying your name makes me smile. Most of all because this may be my only hope of ever having hotchpotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but . . . no. It wouldn\u2019t be a good idea at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve ever had. Why can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s mind was spinning. She could hardly stammer out a reply. \u201cI-I don\u2019t like courtship. It\u2019s very stressful. And disappointing.\u201d</p><p>His thumb found the soft ridge of her collarbone and traced it slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s arguable that you\u2019ve ever had a real courtship. But if it pleases you, we\u2019ll dispense with it altogether. That would save time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to dispense with it,\u201d Poppy said, increasingly flustered. She trembled as she felt his fingertips glide along the side of her neck. \u201cWhat I mean is . . . Mr. Rutledge, I\u2019ve just been through a very difficult experience. This is too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were courted by a boy, who had to do as he was told.\u201d His hot breath feathered against her lips as he whispered, \u201cYou should try it with a man, who needs no one\u2019s permission.\u201d</p><p>A man. Well, he certainly was that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting,\u201d Harry continued. \u201cNot when you\u2019re so hell-bent on going back to Hampshire. You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m here tonight, Poppy. Believe me, I wouldn\u2019t have come otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like balls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But the ones I attend are given by a far different crowd.\u201d</p><p>Poppy couldn\u2019t imagine what crowd he was referring to, or what kind of people he usually associated with. Harry Rutledge was too much of a mystery. Too experienced, too overwhelming in every way. He could never offer the quiet, ordinary, sane life she longed for.</p><p>\u201cMr. Rutledge, please don\u2019t take this as an affront, but you don\u2019t have the qualities I seek in a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? I have some excellent qualities you haven\u2019t even seen yet.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy gave a shaky laugh. \u201cI think you could talk a fish out of its skin,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut still, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d She stopped with a gasp as he ducked his head and stole an off-center kiss from her lips, as if her laughter were something he could taste. She felt the imprint of his mouth even after he drew back, her excited nerves reluctant to release the sensation.</p><p>\u201cSpend an afternoon with me,\u201d he urged. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Rutledge. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour?\u201d he whispered. He bent to her again, and she turned her face away in confusion. He sought her neck instead, his lips brushing the vulnerable flesh with half-open kisses.</p> <p>No one had ever done such a thing, even Michael. Who would have thought it would feel so delicious? Dazed, Poppy let her head fall back, her body accepting the steady support of his arms. He searched her throat with devastating care, touching his tongue to her pulse. His hand cradled her nape, the pad of his thumb tracing the satiny edge of her hairline. As her balance faltered, she reached around his neck.</p><p>He was so gentle, teasing color to the surface of her skin, chasing little shivers with his mouth. Blindly she followed, wanting the taste of him. As she angled her face toward his, her lips grazed the close-shaven surface of his jaw. His breath caught. \u201cYou should never cry over a man,\u201d he said against her cheek. His voice was soft, dark, like smoked honey. \u201cNo one is worth your tears.\u201d Before she could answer, he caught her mouth in a full, open kiss.</p><p>Poppy went weak, melting against him as he kissed her slowly. The tip of his tongue entered, played gently, and the feel of it was so strange and intimate and tantalizing that a wild tremor ran through her. His mouth lifted at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did I frighten you?\u201d</p><p>Poppy couldn\u2019t seem to think of an answer. It wasn\u2019t that he had frightened her, more that he had given her a glimpse of a vast erotic territory she had never encountered before. Even in her inexperience, she comprehended that this man had the power to turn her inside out with pleasure. And that was not something she had ever considered or bargained for.</p><p>She tried to swallow the heartbeat that had ascended in her throat. Her lips felt stung and swollen. Her body throbbed in unfamiliar places.</p><p>Harry framed her face in his hands, his thumbs stroking her crimson cheeks. \u201cThe waltz is over by now. Your companion is going to turn on me like a rat terrier for bringing you back late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very protective,\u201d Poppy managed to say.</p> <p>\u201cShe should be.\u201d Harry lowered his hands, setting her free.</p><p>Poppy stumbled, her knees astonishingly weak. Harry grabbed her in a swift reflex, pulling her back against him. \u201cEasy.\u201d She heard him laugh softly. \u201cMy fault. I shouldn\u2019t have kissed you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said, her sense of humor tentatively reasserting itself. \u201cI should give you a set-down . . . slap you or something . . . what is the usual response from ladies you\u2019ve taken liberties with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey encourage me to do it again?\u201d Harry suggested in such a helpful manner that Poppy couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to encourage you.\u201d</p><p>They faced each other in darkness relieved only by the slivers of light shed by upper-floor windows. How capricious life was, Poppy thought. She should have been dancing with Michael tonight. But now she was Michael\u2019s castoff, and she was standing outside the ballroom, in the shadows with a stranger.</p><p>Interesting, that she could be so in love with one man and yet find another so compelling. But Harry Rutledge was one of the most fascinating people she had ever met, with so many layers of charm and drive and ruthlessness that she couldn\u2019t fathom what kind of man he really was. She wondered what he was like in his private moments.</p><p>She was almost sorry she would never find out.</p><p>\u201cGive me a penance,\u201d Harry urged. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you ask.\u201d</p><p>As their gazes caught and held in the shadows, Poppy realized that he actually meant it. \u201cHow large a penance?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry tilted his head a little, studying her intently. \u201cAsk for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I wanted a castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said promptly.</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t want a castle. Too drafty. What about a diamond tiara?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCertainly. A modest one suitable for daytime wear, or something more elaborate?\u201d</p><p>Poppy began to smile, when a few minutes earlier she had thought she would never smile again. She felt a surge of liking and gratitude. She couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who would have been able to console her in these circumstances. But the smile turned bittersweet as she looked up at him once more.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid no one can give me the one thing I truly want.\u201d</p><p>Rising on her toes, she pressed her lips sweetly to his cheek. It was a friendly kiss.</p><p>A good-bye kiss.</p> <p>Harry looked down at her intently. His gaze flicked to something beyond her, before his mouth came down over hers with smoldering demand. Confounded by his sudden aggression, thrown off balance, she reached out for him reflexively. It was the wrong reaction, the wrong time and place . . . wrong to feel a surge of pleasure as he tasted and sweetly delved inside her mouth . . . but, as she was discovering, there were some temptations impossible to resist. And his kisses seemed to wring a helpless response from every part of her, a bonfire of feeling. She couldn\u2019t catch up with her own pulse, her own breath. Her nerves lit with sparks of sensation, while stars cascaded all around her, little bursts of light striking the tiles of the terrace floor with the sound of breaking crystal . . .</p><p>Trying to ignore the harsh noise, Poppy leaned harder against him. But Harry eased her away with a quiet murmur, and guided her head to his chest as if he were trying to protect her.</p><p>Her lashes lifted, and she went cold and still as she saw that someone . . . several someones . . . had come out to the balcony.</p><p>Lady Norbury, who had dropped a glass of champagne in her surprise. And Lord Norbury, and another elderly couple.</p><p>And Michael, with a blonde woman on his arm.</p><p>They all stared at Poppy and Harry in shock.</p> <p>Had the angel of death appeared at that moment, complete with black wings and a gleaming scythe, Poppy would have run to him with open arms. Because being caught on the balcony kissing Harry Rutledge was not just a scandal . . . it would be the stuff of legend. She was ruined. Her life was ruined. Her family was ruined. Everyone in London would know by sunrise.</p><p>Dumbstruck by the sheer awfulness of the situation, Poppy looked helplessly up at Harry. And for one confusing moment, she thought she saw a flicker of predatory satisfaction in his eyes. But then his expression changed.</p><p>\u201cThis might be difficult for us to explain,\u201d he said.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>As Leo made his way through the Norbury mansion, he was privately amused as he saw some of his friends\u2014young lords whose debauchery had put even his past exploits to shame\u2014now starched and buttoned up and impeccably mannered. Not for the first time, Leo reflected how unfair it was that men were allowed to get away with so much more than women.</p><p>This business of manners, for example . . . he had seen his sisters struggling to remember hundreds of inane points of etiquette that were expected of upper-class society. Whereas Leo\u2019s main interest in the rules of etiquette was how to break them. And he, as a man with a title, was unfailingly excused for nearly anything. Ladies at a supper party were criticized behind their backs if they used the wrong fork for the fish course, while a man could drink to excess or make some off-color remark, and everyone pretended not to notice.</p><p>Nonchalantly, Leo entered the ballroom and stood to the side of the triple-width doorway, surveying the scene. Dull, dull, dull. There was the ever-present row of virgins and their chaperones, and clusters of gossiping women that reminded him of nothing so much as a hen yard.</p><p>His attention was snared by the sight of Catherine Marks, standing in the corner and watching as Beatrix and her partner danced.</p> <p>Marks looked tense as usual, her slender dark-clad figure as straight as a ramrod. She never missed an opportunity to disdain Leo and treat him as if he had all the intellectual prowess of an oyster. And she was resistant to any attempts at charm or humor. Like any sensible man, Leo did his best to avoid her.</p><p>But to his chagrin, Leo couldn\u2019t stop himself from wondering what Catherine Marks would look like after a good, thorough tupping. Her spectacles cast aside, her silky hair loose and tumbled, her pale body released from the contraption of stays and laces . . .</p><p>Suddenly nothing at the ball seemed quite so interesting as his sisters\u2019 companion.</p><p>Leo decided to go bother her.</p><p>He sauntered to her. \u201cHello, Marks. How is the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she whispered violently, her eyes flashing furiously behind her spectacles.</p><p>\u201cIn the card room. And then I had a plate of supper. Where else should I have been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to have been helping with Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping with what? I promised I would dance with her, and here I am.\u201d Leo paused and glanced around them. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cHow can you not know? You mean to say you\u2019ve lost her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I saw Poppy was approximately ten minutes ago, when she went to dance with Mr. Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hotel owner? He never appears at these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did this evening,\u201d Miss Marks said grimly, keeping her tone low. \u201cAnd now they\u2019ve disappeared. Together. You must find her, my lord. Now. She is in danger of being ruined.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone after her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to keep an eye on Beatrix, or she\u2019ll disappear as well. Besides, I didn\u2019t want to draw attention to Poppy\u2019s absence. Go find her, and be quick about it.\u201d</p><p>Leo scowled. \u201cMarks, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, other servants don\u2019t snap out orders to their masters. So if you don\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my master,\u201d she had the nerve to say, glaring insolently at him.</p> <p>Oh, I\u2019d like to be, Leo thought in a quick, angry flush of arousal, every hair on his body standing erect. Along with a certain feature of his anatomy. He decided to leave before her effect on him became obvious. \u201cAll right, settle your feathers. I\u2019ll find Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart looking in all the places where you would take a woman to compromise her. There can\u2019t be that many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there can. You\u2019d be amazed at the variety of places I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019m feeling nauseous enough at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Casting an assessing glance around the ballroom, Leo spied the row of French doors at the far end. He headed for the balcony, trying to go as fast as possible without appearing to be in a hurry. It was his cursed luck to be snared in two separate conversations on the way, one with a friend who wanted his opinion of a certain lady, the other with a dowager who thought the punch was \u201coff\u201d and wanted to know if he\u2019d tried it.</p> <p>Finally Leo made it to one of the doors and slipped outside.</p><p>His eyes widened as he beheld an astonishing tableau. Poppy, clasped in the arms of a tall black-haired man . . . being watched by a small group of people who had come onto the balcony through another set of doors. And one of them was Michael Bayning, who looked sick with jealousy and outrage.</p><p>The black-haired man lifted his head, murmured something to Poppy, and leveled a cool glance at Michael Bayning.</p><p>A glance of triumph.</p><p>It only lasted a moment, but Leo saw it, and recognized it for what it was.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell,\u201d Leo whispered.</p> <p>His sister was in considerable trouble.</p><p>When a Hathaway caused a scandal, they never did it by half measures.</p><p>By the time Leo steered Poppy back into the ballroom and collected Miss Marks and Beatrix, the scandal had started to spread. In no time at all, Cam and Amelia had found them, and the family drew together in a protective cluster around Poppy.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Cam asked, looking deceptively relaxed, his hazel eyes alert.</p><p>\u201cHarry Rutledge happened,\u201d Leo muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything shortly. For now, let\u2019s leave here as quickly as possible and meet Rutledge at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Amelia leaned close to murmur into Poppy\u2019s scarlet ear. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear. Whatever it is, we\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Poppy whispered. \u201cNo one can.\u201d</p><p>Leo looked past his sisters and saw the subdued uproar of the crowd. Everyone was staring at them. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching an ocean wave,\u201d he remarked. \u201cOne can literally see the scandal sweep through the room.\u201d</p> <p>Cam looked sardonic and resigned. \u201cGadjos,\u201d he muttered. \u201cLeo, why don\u2019t you take your sister and Miss Marks in your carriage? Amelia and I will make our farewells to the Norburys.\u201d</p><p>In a daze of wretchedness, Poppy allowed Leo to usher her outside to his carriage. All of them were silent until the vehicle had pulled away from the mansion with a sharp lurch.</p><p>Beatrix was the first to speak. \u201cHave you been compromised, Poppy?\u201d she asked with concern. \u201cAs Win was last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she has,\u201d Leo replied, while Poppy let out a little moan. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad habit our family\u2019s gotten into. Marks, you\u2019d better write a poem about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis disaster could have been avoided,\u201d the companion told him tersely, \u201chad you found her sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could also have been avoided if you hadn\u2019t lost her in the first place,\u201d Leo shot back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m responsible,\u201d Poppy broke in, her voice muffled against Leo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI went off with Mr. Rutledge. I had just seen Mr. Bayning in the ballroom, and I was distraught, and Mr. Rutledge asked me to dance but I needed air and we went out to the balcony\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m responsible,\u201d Miss Marks said, looking equally as upset. \u201cI let you dance with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does no good to assign blame,\u201d Leo said. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. But if anyone is responsible, it\u2019s Rutledge, who apparently came to the ball on a hunting expedition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Poppy lifted her head and looked at him in bewilderment. \u201cYou think he . . . no, it was an accident, Leo. Mr. Rutledge didn\u2019t intend to compromise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was deliberate,\u201d Miss Marks said. \u201cHarry Rutledge never gets \u2018caught\u2019 doing anything. If he was seen in a compromising situation, it was because he wanted to be seen.\u201d</p><p>Leo looked at her alertly. \u201cHow do you know so much about Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>The companion flushed. It seemed to require an effort for her to hold his gaze. \u201cHis reputation, of course.\u201d</p><p>Leo\u2019s attention was diverted as Poppy buried her face against his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to die of humiliation,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Leo replied. \u201cI\u2019m an expert on humiliation, and if it were fatal, I\u2019d have died a dozen times by now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t die a dozen times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can if you\u2019re a Buddhist,\u201d Beatrix said helpfully.</p><p>Leo smoothed Poppy\u2019s shining hair. \u201cI hope Harry Rutledge is,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Beatrix asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do than kill him repeatedly.\u201d</p><p>Harry received Leo and Cam Rohan in his private library. Any other family in the situation would have been predictable . . . they would have demanded that he do the right thing, and terms of compensation would have been discussed, and arrangements would have been made. Because of Harry\u2019s vast fortune, most families would have accepted the results with good grace. He wasn\u2019t a peer, but he was a man of influence and means.</p><p>However, Harry knew better than to expect a predictable response to the situation from either Leo or Cam. They were not conventional, and they would have to be dealt with carefully. That being said, Harry wasn\u2019t worried in the least. He had negotiated over matters of far greater consequence than a woman\u2019s honor.</p><p>Pondering the events of the night, Harry was filled with immoral triumph. No, not triumph . . . elation. It was all turning out to be so much easier than he had expected, especially with Michael Bayning\u2019s unanticipated appearance at the Norbury ball. The idiot had practically handed Poppy to Harry on a silver platter. And when an opportunity presented itself, Harry took it.</p><p>Besides, Harry felt he deserved Poppy. Any man who allowed scruples to get in the way of having a woman like her was a fool. He recalled the way she had looked in the ballroom, pale and fragile and distraught. When Harry had approached her, there had been no mistaking the relief in her expression. She had turned to him, she had let him take her away.</p> <p>And as Harry had brought her outside to the terrace, his satisfaction had been quickly supplanted by an entirely new sensation . . . the desire to ease someone else\u2019s pain. The fact that he had helped to bring about her heartbreak in the first place was regrettable. But the end justified the means. And once she was his, he would do more for her, take better care of her, than Michael Bayning ever could.</p><p>Now he had to deal with Poppy\u2019s family, who were understandably outraged that he had compromised her. That didn\u2019t worry him in the slightest. He had no doubt of his ability to persuade Poppy to marry him. And no matter how much the Hathaways objected, they would ultimately have to come to terms.</p><p>Marrying him was the only way to redeem Poppy\u2019s honor. Everyone knew it.</p><p>Keeping his expression neutral, Harry offered wine as Leo and Cam entered the library, but they refused.</p><p>Leo went to the fireplace mantel and leaned beside it with his arms folded across his chest. Cam went to a leather-upholstered chair and settled into it, stretching out his long legs and crossing them at the ankles.</p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t deceived by their comfortable postures. Anger, masculine discord, permeated the room. Remaining relaxed, Harry waited for one of them to speak.</p> <p>\u201cYou should know, Rutledge,\u201d Leo said in a pleasant tone, \u201cthat I had planned to kill you right away, but Rohan says we should talk for a few minutes first. Personally, I think he\u2019s trying to delay me so he can have the pleasure of killing you himself. And even if Rohan and I don\u2019t kill you, we probably won\u2019t be able to stop my brother-in-law Merripen from killing you.\u201d</p><p>Harry half sat on the edge of the heavy mahogany library table. \u201cI suggest you wait until Poppy and I marry, so she can at least be made a respectable widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you assume,\u201d Cam asked, \u201cthat we would allow you to have Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t marry me after this, no one will receive her. For that matter, I doubt any of the rest of your family would be welcome in London parlors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re welcome as it is,\u201d Cam replied, his hazel eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cRutledge,\u201d Leo said with deceptive casualness, \u201cbefore I came into the title, the Hathaways lived outside London society for so many years that we couldn\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s arse as to whether we\u2019re received or not. Poppy doesn\u2019t have to marry anyone, for any reason, other than her own desire to do so. And Poppy is of the opinion that you and she would never suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe opinions of women are frequently changed,\u201d Harry said. \u201cLet me talk to your sister tomorrow. I\u2019ll convince her to make the best of the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you convince her,\u201d Cam said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to convince us. Because what little I know about you makes me damned uneasy.\u201d</p> <p>Of course Cam Rohan would have some knowledge of him. Cam\u2019s former position at the gentlemen\u2019s gaming club would have made him privy to all kinds of private information. Harry was curious as to how much he had found out.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what you know,\u201d Harry invited idly, \u201cand I\u2019ll confirm if it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>The amber-shaded eyes regarded him without blinking. \u201cYou\u2019re originally from New York City, where your father was a hotelier of middling success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffalo, actually,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get on with him. But you found mentors. You apprenticed at an engineering works, where you became known for your abilities as a mechanic and draftsman. You patented several innovations in valves and boilers. At the age of twenty, you left America and came to England for undisclosed reasons.\u201d</p><p>Cam paused to observe the effects of his recitation.</p><p>Harry\u2019s ease had evaporated, the muscles of his shoulders drawing upward. He forced them back down and resisted the temptation to reach up and ease a cramp of tension at the back of his neck. \u201cGo on,\u201d he invited softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cam obliged. \u201cYou put together a group of private investors and bought a row of houses with very little capital of your own. You leased the houses for a short time, razed them and bought the rest of the street, and built the hotel as it now stands. You have no family, save your father in New York, with whom you have no communication. You have a handful of loyal friends and a host of enemies, many of whom seem to like you in spite of themselves.\u201d</p><p>Harry reflected that Cam Rohan must have had impressive connections to have unearthed such information. \u201cThere are only three people in England who know that much about me,\u201d he muttered, wondering which one of them had talked.</p><p>\u201cNow there are five,\u201d Leo said. \u201cAnd Rohan forgot to mention the fascinating discovery that you\u2019ve become a favorite with the War Office after designing some modifications to the standard issue army rifle. But lest we assume that you are only allied with the British government, you also seem to have dealings with foreigners, royalty and criminals alike. It rather gives one the impression that the only side you\u2019re ever on is your own.\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled coolly. \u201cI\u2019ve never lied about myself or my past. But I keep things private whenever possible. And I owe allegiance to no one.\u201d He went to the sideboard and poured a brandy. Holding the bowl in the palms of his hands to warm it, he glanced at both men. He\u2019d bet his fortune that Cam knew more that he wasn\u2019t revealing. But this discussion, brief as it was, made it clear that there would be no helpful family coercion to make Poppy an honest woman. The Hathaways didn\u2019t give a damn about respectability, nor did they need his money, nor his influence.</p> <p>Which meant that he would have to focus solely on Poppy.</p><p>\u201cWhether you approve or not,\u201d he told Cam and Leo, \u201cI\u2019m going to propose to your sister. The choice is hers. And if she accepts, no power on earth will stop me from marrying her. I understand your concerns, so let me assure you that she will want for nothing. She\u2019ll be protected, cherished, even spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no bloody idea how to make her happy,\u201d Cam said quietly.</p><p>\u201cRohan,\u201d Harry said with a faint smile, \u201cI excel at making people happy\u2014or at least making them think they are.\u201d He paused to survey their set faces. \u201cAre you going to forbid me to speak to her?\u201d he asked in a tone of polite interest.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leo said. \u201cPoppy\u2019s not a child, nor a pet. If she wants to speak to you, she shall. But be aware that, whatever you say or do in the effort to convince her to marry you, it will be counterweighed by the opinions of her family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s one more thing to be aware of,\u201d Cam said, with a wintry softness that disguised all hint of feeling. \u201cIf you succeed in marrying her, we\u2019re not losing a sister. You\u2019re gaining an entire family\u2014who will protect her at any cost.\u201d</p><p>That was almost enough to give Harry pause.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cMy brother and Mr. Rohan don\u2019t like you,\u201d Poppy told Harry the next morning, as they walked slowly through the rose garden behind the hotel. As the news of the scandal traveled through London like wildfire, it was necessary to do something about it with all expediency. Poppy knew that as a gentleman, Harry Rutledge was bound to offer for her, to save her from social disgrace. However, she wasn\u2019t certain if a lifetime of being married to the wrong man was any better than being a pariah. She didn\u2019t know Harry well enough to make any judgments about his character. And her family was emphatically not in favor of him.</p><p>\u201cMy companion doesn\u2019t like you,\u201d she continued, \u201cand my sister Amelia says she doesn\u2019t know you well enough to decide, but she\u2019s inclined not to like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Beatrix?\u201d Harry asked, the sun striking glimmers in his dark hair as he looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cShe likes you. But then, she likes lizards and snakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t abide lizards or snakes.\u201d</p><p>A smile touched his lips. \u201cLet\u2019s not fence today, Poppy. You know what I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>She responded with an unsteady nod.</p><p>It had been a hellish night. She had talked and cried and argued with her family until the early hours of the morning, and then she\u2019d found it nearly impossible to sleep. And then more arguing and conversation this morning, until her chest was a cauldron of roiling emotions.</p><p>Her safe, familiar world had been turned upside down, and the peace of the garden was an unspeakable relief. Strangely, it made her feel better to be in Harry Rutledge\u2019s presence, even though he was partially responsible for the mess she was in. He was calm and self-assured, and there was something in his manner, sympathy woven with pragmatism, that soothed her.</p> <p>They paused in a long arbor draped in sheets of roses. It was a tunnel of pink and white blossoms. Beatrix wandered along a nearby hedgerow. Poppy had insisted on taking her in lieu of Miss Marks or Amelia, both of whom would have made it impossible for her to have even marginal privacy with Harry.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Poppy admitted bashfully. \u201cBut that\u2019s not enough to build a marriage on, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than many people start with.\u201d Harry studied her. \u201cI\u2019m sure your family has talked to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt length,\u201d Poppy said. Her family had framed the prospect of marriage with Harry Rutledge in such dire terms that she had already decided to refuse him. She twisted her mouth in an apologetic grimace. \u201cAnd after hearing what they had to say, I\u2019m sorry to tell you that I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait. Before you make a decision, I\u2019d like to hear what you have to say. What your feelings are.\u201d</p><p>Well. That was a change. Poppy blinked in disconcertion as she reflected that her family and Miss Marks, well intentioned as they had been, had told her what they thought she should do. Her own thoughts and feelings hadn\u2019t received much attention.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . you\u2019re a stranger,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I should make a decision about my future when I\u2019m in love with Mr. Bayning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have hopes of marrying him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no. All possibility of that is gone. But the feelings are still there, and until enough time passes for me to forget him, I don\u2019t trust my own judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sensible of you. Except that some decisions can\u2019t be put off. And I\u2019m afraid this is one of them.\u201d Harry paused before asking gently, \u201cIf you go back to Hampshire under the cloud of scandal, you know what to expect, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There will be . . . unpleasantness, to say the least.\u201d It was a mild word for the disdain, pity and scorn she would receive as a fallen woman. And worse, it might ruin Beatrix\u2019s chances of marrying well. \u201cAnd my family won\u2019t be able to shield me from it,\u201d she added dully.</p><p>\u201cBut I could,\u201d Harry said, reaching for the braided coil at the top of her head, using a fingertip to nudge an anchoring pin further into place. \u201cI could if you marry me. Otherwise, I\u2019m powerless to do anything for you. And no matter how anyone else advises you, Poppy, you\u2019re the one who will bear the brunt of the scandal.\u201d</p><p>Poppy tried, but couldn\u2019t quite manage, a weary smile. \u201cSo much for my dreams of a quiet, ordinary life. My choice is either to live as a social outcast or as the wife of a hotelier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs the latter choice so unappealing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I\u2019ve always hoped for,\u201d she said frankly.</p><p>Harry absorbed that, considered it, while reaching out to skim his fingers over clusters of pink roses. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a peaceful existence in a country cottage,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWe would live at the hotel most of the year. But there are times we could go to the country. If you want a house in Hampshire as a wedding present, it\u2019s yours. And a carriage of your own, and a team of four at your disposal.\u201d</p><p>Exactly what they said he\u2019d do, Poppy thought, and sent him a wry glance. \u201cAre you trying to bribe me, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is it working?\u201d</p><p>His hopeful tone made her smile. \u201cNo, although it was a very good effort.\u201d Hearing the rustling of foliage, Poppy called out, \u201cBeatrix, are you there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo rows away,\u201d came her sister\u2019s cheerful reply. \u201cMedusa found some worms!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d</p><p>Harry gave Poppy a bemused glance. \u201cWho . . . or should I say what . . . is Medusa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHedgehog,\u201d she replied. \u201cMedusa\u2019s getting a bit plump, and Beatrix is exercising her.\u201d</p><p>To Harry\u2019s credit, he remained composed as he remarked, \u201cYou know, I pay my staff a fortune to keep those out of the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, have no fear. Medusa is merely a guest hedgehog. She would never run away from Beatrix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuest hedgehog,\u201d Harry repeated, a smile working across his mouth. He paced a few impatient steps before turning to face her. A new urgency filtered through his voice. \u201cPoppy. Tell me what your worries are, and I\u2019ll try to answer them. There must be some terms we can come to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are persistent,\u201d she said. \u201cThey told me you would be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m everything they told you and worse,\u201d Harry said without hesitation. \u201cBut what they didn\u2019t tell you is that you are the most desirable and fascinating woman I\u2019ve ever met, and I would do anything to have you.\u201d</p><p>It was insanely flattering to have a man like Harry Rutledge pursuing her, especially after the hurt inflicted by Michael Bayning. Poppy flushed with cheek-stinging pleasure, as if she\u2019d been lying too long in the sun. She found herself thinking, Perhaps I\u2019ll consider it, just for a moment, in a purely hypothetical sense. Harry Rutledge and me . . .</p><p>\u201cI have questions,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAsk away.\u201d</p><p>Poppy decided to be blunt. \u201cAre you dangerous? Everyone says you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo others?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged innocently. \u201cI\u2019m a hotelier. How dangerous could I be?\u201d</p><p>Poppy gave him a dubious glance, not at all deceived. \u201cI may be gullible, Harry, but I\u2019m not brainless. You know the rumors . . . you\u2019re well aware of your reputation. Are you as unscrupulous as you\u2019re made out to be?\u201d</p><p>Harry was quiet for a long moment, his gaze fixed on a distant cluster of blossoms. The sun threw its light into the filter of branches, scattering leaf shadows over the pair in the arbor.</p><p>Eventually he lifted his head and looked at her directly, his eyes greener than the sunstruck rose leaves. \u201cI\u2019m not a gentleman,\u201d he said. \u201cNot by birth, and not by character. Very few men can afford to be honorable while trying to make a success of themselves. I don\u2019t lie, but I rarely tell everything I know. I\u2019m not a religious man, nor a spiritual one. I act in my own interests, and I make no secret of it. However, I always keep my side of a bargain, I don\u2019t cheat, and I pay my debts.\u201d</p><p>Pausing, Harry fished in his coat pocket, pulled out a penknife, and reached up to cut a rose in full bloom. After neatly severing the stem, he occupied himself with stripping the thorns with the sharp little blade. \u201cI would never use physical force against a woman, or anyone weaker than myself. I don\u2019t smoke, take snuff, or chew tobacco. I always hold my liquor. I don\u2019t sleep well. And I can make a clock from scratch.\u201d Removing the last thorn, he handed the rose to her, and slipped the knife back into his pocket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy concentrated on the satiny pink rose, running her fingers along the top edges of the petals.</p><p>\u201cMy full name is Jay Harry Rutledge,\u201d she heard him say. \u201cMy mother is the only one who ever called me Jay, which is why I don\u2019t like it. She left my father and me when I was very young. I never saw her again.\u201d</p><p>Poppy looked at him with wide eyes, understanding that this was a sensitive subject he rarely, if ever, discussed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said softly, although she kept her tone carefully devoid of pity.</p><p>He shrugged as if it was of no importance. \u201cIt was a long time ago. I barely remember her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you come to England?\u201d</p><p>Another pause. \u201cI wanted to have a go at the hotel business. And whether I was a success or failure, I wanted to be far away from my father.\u201d</p><p>Poppy could only guess at the wealth of information buried beneath the spare words. \u201cThat\u2019s not the entire story,\u201d she said rather than asked.</p><p>The ghost of a smile touched his lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the rose again, feeling her cheeks color. \u201cDo you . . . would you . . . want children?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Hopefully more than one. I didn\u2019t like being an only child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you want to raise them at the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it a suitable environment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would have the best of everything. Education. Travel. Lessons in anything that interested them.\u201d</p><p>Poppy tried to imagine bringing up children in a hotel. Could such a place ever feel like home? Cam had once told her that the Rom believed the entire world was their home. As long as you were with your family, you were home. She looked at Harry, wondering what it would be like to live intimately with him. He seemed so self-contained and invulnerable. It was hard to think of him doing ordinary things such as shaving, or having his hair trimmed, or staying in bed with a head cold.</p> <p>\u201cWould you keep your wedding vows?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Harry held her gaze. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make them otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Poppy decided that her family\u2019s worries about letting her talk to Harry had been entirely justified. Because he was so persuasive, and appealing, that she was beginning to consider the idea of marrying him, and seriously weigh the decision.</p><p>Fairy-tale dreams had to be set aside if she was to embark on marriage with a man she didn\u2019t love and hardly knew. But adults had to take responsibility for their actions. And then it occurred to Poppy that she was not the only one taking a risk. There was no guarantee for Harry that he would end up with the kind of wife he needed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair for me to ask all the questions,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou must have some as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve already decided that I want you.\u201d</p><p>Poppy couldn\u2019t prevent a bemused laugh. \u201cDo you make all your decisions so impulsively?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually. But I know when to trust my instincts.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed Harry was about to add something else when he saw a movement on the ground from the periphery of his vision. Following his gaze, Poppy saw Medusa pushing her way through the rose arbor, waddling innocently across the path. The little brown and white hedgehog looked like a walking scrub brush. To Poppy\u2019s surprise, Harry lowered to his haunches to retrieve the creature.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d Poppy warned. \u201cShe\u2019ll roll into a ball and sink her quills into you.\u201d</p><p>But Harry settled his hands on the ground, palms up, on either side of the inquisitive hedgehog. \u201cHello, Medusa.\u201d Gently he worked his hands beneath her. \u201cSorry to interrupt your exercise. But believe me, you don\u2019t want to run into any of my gardeners.\u201d</p><p>Poppy watched incredulously as Medusa relaxed and settled willingly into the warm masculine hands. Her spines flattened, and she let him lift and turn her so she was tummy upward. Harry stroked the soft white fur of her underbelly while Medusa\u2019s delicate snout lifted and she regarded him with her perpetual smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone except Beatrix handle her like that,\u201d Poppy said, standing beside him. \u201cYou have experience with hedgehogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He slanted a smile at her. \u201cBut I have some experience with prickly females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Beatrix\u2019s voice interrupted them, and she came into the tunnel of roses. She was disheveled, bits of leaves clinging to her dress, her hair straggling over her face. \u201cI seem to have lost track of . . . oh, there you are, Medusa!\u201d She broke into a grin as she saw Harry cradling the hedgehog in his hands. \u201cAlways trust a man who can handle a hedgehog, that\u2019s what I always say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Poppy asked dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only say it to Medusa.\u201d</p><p>Harry carefully transferred the pet to Beatrix\u2019s hands. \u201c \u2018The fox has many tricks,\u2019 \u201d he quoted, \u201c \u2018the hedgehog only one.\u2019 \u201d He smiled at Beatrix as he added, \u201cBut it\u2019s a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArchilochus,\u201d Beatrix said promptly. \u201cYou read Greek poetry, Mr. Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually. But I make an exception for Archilochus. He knew how to make a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather used to call him a \u2018raging iambic,\u2019 \u201d Poppy said, and Harry laughed.</p><p>And in that moment, Poppy made her decision.</p><p>Because even though Harry Rutledge had his flaws, he admitted them freely. And a man who could charm a hedgehog and understand jokes about ancient Greek poets was a man worth taking a risk on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wouldn\u2019t be able to marry for love, but she could at least marry for hope.</p><p>\u201cBea,\u201d she murmured, \u201cmight you allow us a few moments alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. Medusa would love to grub about in the next row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear.\u201d Poppy turned back to Harry, who was dusting his hands. \u201cMay I ask one more question?\u201d</p> <p>He looked at her alertly and spread his hands as if to show he had nothing to hide.</p><p>\u201cWould you say that you\u2019re a good man, Harry?\u201d</p><p>He had to think about that. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIn the fairy tale you mentioned last night, I would probably be the villain. But it\u2019s possible the villain would treat you far better than the prince would have.\u201d</p><p>Poppy wondered what was wrong with her, that she should be amused rather than frightened by his confession. \u201cHarry. You\u2019re not supposed to court a girl by telling her you\u2019re the villain.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an innocent glance that didn\u2019t deceive her in the least. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps. But you\u2019re also making certain that whatever anyone says about you, you\u2019ve already admitted it. Now you\u2019ve made all criticism of you ineffectual.\u201d</p><p>Harry blinked as if she\u2019d surprised him. \u201cYou think I\u2019m that manipulative?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Harry seemed stunned that she could see through him so easily. Instead of being annoyed, however, he stared at her with stark longing. \u201cPoppy, I have to have you.\u201d</p><p>Reaching her in two steps, he took her into his arms. Her heart thumped with sudden force, and she let her head fall back naturally as she waited for the warm pressure of his mouth. When nothing happened, however, she opened her eyes and glanced at him quizzically.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to kiss me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want your judgment clouded.\u201d But he brushed his lips against her forehead before he continued. \u201cHere are your choices, as I see them. First, you could go to Hampshire in a cloud of social scorn, and content yourself with the knowledge that at least you didn\u2019t get trapped into a loveless marriage. Or you could marry a man who wants you beyond anything, and live like a queen.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the country house and carriage.\u201d</p><p>Poppy could not contain a smile. \u201cBribery again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll throw in the castle and tiara,\u201d Harry said ruthlessly. \u201cGowns, furs, a yacht\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Poppy whispered, and touched his lips gently with her fingers, not knowing how else to make him stop. She took a deep breath, hardly able to believe what she was about to say. \u201cI\u2019ll settle for a betrothal ring. A small, simple one.\u201d</p><p>Harry stared at her as if he were afraid to trust his own ears. \u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Poppy said, her voice a bit suffocated. \u201cYes, I will marry you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>This was the phrase of Poppy\u2019s wedding day: \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to change your mind.\u201d</p> <p>She had heard it from every member of her family, or some variation thereof, since the early hours of the morning. That was, she\u2019d heard it from everyone except Beatrix, who thankfully didn\u2019t share the Hathaways\u2019 general animosity toward Harry.</p><p>In fact, Poppy had asked Beatrix why she hadn\u2019t objected to the betrothal.</p><p>\u201cI think it might turn out to be a good pairing,\u201d Beatrix said.</p><p>\u201cYou do? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rabbit and a cat can live together peaceably. But first the rabbit has to assert itself\u2014charge the cat a time or two\u2014and then they become friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Poppy said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ll have to remember that. Although I daresay Harry will be surprised when I knock him over like a ninepin.\u201d</p><p>The wedding and the reception afterward would be as large and heavily attended as humanly possible, as if Harry intended for half of London to witness the ceremony. As a result, Poppy would spend most of her wedding day amidst a sea of strangers.</p><p>She had hoped that she and Harry might become better acquainted in the three weeks of their betrothal, but she had scarcely seen him except for the two occasions when he had come to take her on a drive. And Miss Marks, who had accompanied them, had glowered so fiercely that it had embarrassed and infuriated Poppy.</p><p>The day before the wedding, her sister Win and brother-in-law Merripen had arrived. To Poppy\u2019s relief, Win had elected to remain neutral on the controversy of the marriage. She and Poppy sat together in a richly appointed hotel suite, talking over the matter at length. And just as in the days of their childhood, Win assumed the role of peacemaker.</p><p>The light from a fringed lamp slid over Win\u2019s blond hair in a brilliant varnish. \u201cIf you like him, Poppy,\u201d she said gently, \u201cif you\u2019ve found things to esteem in him, then I\u2019m sure I will, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish Amelia felt that way. And Miss Marks, too, for that matter. They\u2019re both so . . . well, opinionated . . . that I can hardly discuss anything with either of them.\u201d</p><p>Win smiled. \u201cRemember, Amelia has taken care of all of us for a very long time. And it\u2019s not easy for her to relinquish her role as our protector. But she will. Remember when Leo and I left for France, how difficult it was for her to see us off? How afraid she was for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she was more afraid for France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, France survived the Hathaways,\u201d Win said, smiling. \u201cAnd you will survive becoming Harry Rutledge\u2019s wife on the morrow. Only . . . if I may say my piece . . . ?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCertainly. Everyone else has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe London season is like one of those Drury Lane melodramas in which marriage is always the ending. And no one ever seems to give any thought as to what happens after. But marriage isn\u2019t the end of the story, it\u2019s the beginning. And it demands the efforts of both partners to make a success of it. I hope Mr. Rutledge has given assurances that he will be the kind of husband that your happiness requires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d Poppy paused uncomfortably. \u201cHe told me I would live like a queen. Although that\u2019s not quite the same thing, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Win said, her voice soft. \u201cBe careful, dear, that you don\u2019t end up as the queen of a lonely kingdom.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy nodded, stricken and uneasy, trying to hide it. In her gentle way, Win had offered more devastating advice than all the sharp warnings of the other Hathaways combined. \u201cI\u2019ll consider that,\u201d she said, staring at the floor, at the tiny printed flowers of her dress, anywhere other than into her sister\u2019s perceptive gaze. She twisted her betrothal ring around her finger. Although the current fashion was for diamond clusters, or colored stones, Harry had bought her a single rose-cut diamond, shaped at the top with facets that mimicked the inner spiral of a rose.</p><p>\u201cI asked for something small and simple,\u201d she had told Harry when he had given it to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he had countered.</p><p>\u201cBut not small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d he had told her with a smile, \u201cI never do anything in a small way.\u201d</p> <p>Spying the clock ticking busily on the mantel, Poppy brought her thoughts back to the present. \u201cI won\u2019t change my mind, Win. I promised Harry that I would marry him, and so I shall. He has been kind to me. I would never repay him by jilting him at the altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Win slid her hand over Poppy\u2019s, and pressed warmly. \u201cPoppy . . . has Amelia had a \u2018certain talk\u2019 with you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the \u2018what to expect on my wedding night\u2019 talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was planning to tell me later tonight, but I\u2019d just as soon hear it from you.\u201d Poppy paused. \u201cHowever, having spent so much time with Beatrix, I should tell you that I know the mating habits of at least twenty-three different species.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens,\u201d Win said with a grin. \u201cPerhaps you should be leading the discussion, dear.\u201d</p> <p>The fashionable, the powerful, and the wealthy usually married at St. George\u2019s in Hanover Square, located in the middle of Mayfair. In fact, so many peers and virgins had been united in holy wedlock at St. George\u2019s that it was unofficially and quite vulgarly known as the \u201cLondon Temple of Hymen.\u201d</p><p>A pediment with six massive columns fronted the impressive but relatively simple structure. St. George\u2019s had been designed with a deliberate lack of ornamentation so as not to detract from the beauty of the architecture. The interior was similarly austere, with a canopied pulpit built several feet higher than the box pews. But there was a magnificent work of stained glass above the front altar, depicting the Tree of Jesse and an assortment of biblical figures.</p><p>Surveying the crowd packed inside the church, Leo wore a carefully blank expression. So far he had given away two sisters in marriage. Neither of those weddings had begun to approach this kind of grandeur and visibility. But they had far eclipsed it in genuine happiness. Amelia and Win had both been in love with the men they had chosen to marry.</p><p>It was unfashionable to marry for love, a mark of the bourgeoisie. However, it was an ideal the Hathaways had always aspired to.</p><p>This wedding had nothing to do with love.</p><p>Dressed in a black morning coat with silver trousers and a white cravat, Leo stood beside the side door of the vestry room, where ceremonial and sacred objects were kept. Altar and choir robes hung in a row along one wall. This morning the vestry doubled as a waiting room for the bride.</p><p>Catherine Marks came to stand on the other side of the doorway as if she were a fellow sentinel guarding the castle gate. Leo glanced at her covertly. She was dressed in lavender, unlike her usual drab colors. Her mousy brown hair was pulled back into such a tight chignon as to make it difficult for her to blink. The spectacles sat oddly on her nose, one of the wire earpieces crimped. It gave her the appearance of a befuddled owl.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d she asked testily.</p> <p>\u201cYour spectacles are crooked,\u201d Leo said, trying not to smile.</p><p>She scowled. \u201cI tried to fix them, but it only made them worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive them to me.\u201d Before she could object, he took them from her face and began to fiddle with the bent wire.</p><p>She spluttered in protest. \u201cMy lord, I didn\u2019t ask you to\u2014if you damage them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you bend the earpiece?\u201d Leo asked, patiently straightening the wire.</p><p>\u201cI dropped them on the floor, and as I was searching, I stepped on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearsighted, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>Having reshaped the earpiece, Leo scrutinized the spectacles carefully. \u201cThere.\u201d He began to give them to her and paused as he stared into her eyes, all blue, green, and gray, contained in distinct dark rims. Brilliant, warm, changeable. Like opals. Why had he never noticed them before?</p><p>Awareness chased over him, making his skin prickle as if exposed to a sudden change in temperature. She wasn\u2019t plain at all. She was beautiful, in a fine, subtle way, like winter moonlight, or the sharp linen smell of daisies. So cool and pale . . . delicious. For a moment, Leo couldn\u2019t move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marks was similarly still, locked with him in a moment of peculiar intimacy.</p><p>She snatched the spectacles from him and replaced them firmly on her nose. \u201cThis is a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have let it happen.\u201d</p><p>Struggling through layers of bemusement and stimulation, Leo gathered that she was referring to his sister\u2019s wedding. He sent her an irritable glance. \u201cWhat do you suggest I do, Marks? Send Poppy to a nunnery? She has the right to marry whomever she pleases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it ends in disaster?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t end in disaster, it will end in estrangement. And I\u2019ve told Poppy as much. But she\u2019s bound and determined to marry him. I always thought Poppy was too sensible to make this kind of mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is sensible,\u201d Marks said. \u201cBut she\u2019s also lonely. And Rutledge took advantage of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could she be lonely? She\u2019s constantly surrounded by people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be the worst loneliness of all.\u201d</p><p>There was a disturbing note in her voice, a fragile sadness. Leo wanted to touch her . . . gather her close . . . pull her face into his neck . . . and that caused a twinge of something like panic. He had to do something, anything, to change the mood between them.</p> <p>\u201cCheer up, Marks,\u201d he said briskly. \u201cI\u2019m sure that someday you, too, will find that one special person you can torment for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>He was relieved to see her familiar scowl reassert itself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve yet to meet a man who could compete with a good strong cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>Leo was about to reply when he heard a noise from inside the vestry where Poppy was waiting.</p><p>A man\u2019s voice, taut with urgency.</p><p>Leo and Marks looked at each other.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she supposed to be alone?\u201d Leo asked.</p><p>The companion nodded uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cIs it Rutledge?\u201d Leo wondered aloud.</p><p>Marks shook her head. \u201cI just saw him outside the church.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Leo grasped the door handle and opened the portal, and Marks followed him inside the vestry.</p><p>Leo stopped so abruptly that the companion bumped into him from behind. His sister, clad in a high-necked white lace gown, was silhouetted against a row of black and purple robes. Poppy looked angelic, bathed in light from a narrow rectangular window, a veil cascading down her back from a neat coronet of white rosebuds.</p><p>And she was confronting Michael Bayning\u2014who looked like a madman, his eyes wild, his clothes disheveled.</p><p>\u201cBayning,\u201d Leo said, closing the door with an efficient swipe of his foot. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you\u2019d been invited. The guests are being seated in the pews. I suggest you join them.\u201d He paused, his voice iced with quiet warning. \u201cOr better yet, leave altogether.\u201d</p> <p>Bayning shook his head, desperate fury gleaming in his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t. I must talk with Poppy before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already too late,\u201d Poppy said, her complexion nearly as white as her dress. \u201cEverything\u2019s decided, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must know what I\u2019ve found out.\u201d Michael threw a pleading glance at Leo. \u201cLet me have just a moment alone with her.\u201d</p><p>Leo shook his head. He was not without sympathy for Bayning, but he couldn\u2019t see that any good would come of this. \u201cSorry, old fellow, but someone has to think of appearances. This has the earmarks of a last tryst before the wedding. And while that would be scandalous enough between the bride and groom, it\u2019s even more objectionable between the bride and someone else.\u201d He was aware of Marks coming to stand beside him.</p><p>\u201cLet him speak,\u201d the companion said.</p><p>Leo threw her an exasperated glance. \u201cBlast it, Marks, do you ever tire of telling me what to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you stop needing my advice,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll stop giving it.\u201d</p><p>Poppy hadn\u2019t taken her gaze off Michael. It was like something from a dream, a nightmare, having him come to her when she was dressed in her wedding gown, minutes away from marrying another man. Dread filled her. She didn\u2019t want to hear what Michael had to say, but neither could she turn him away.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she managed to ask.</p><p>Michael looked anguished and imploring. He held out something . . . a letter. \u201cDo you recognize this?\u201d</p><p>Taking the letter in lace-gloved fingers, Poppy stared at it closely. \u201cThe love letter,\u201d she said, bewildered. \u201cI lost it. Where . . . where did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father. Harry Rutledge gave it to him.\u201d Michael raked a hand through his hair with distracted roughness. \u201cThat bastard went to my father and exposed our relationship. He put the worst possible light on it. Rutledge turned my father against us before I ever had a chance to explain our side of it.\u201d</p><p>Poppy turned even colder, and her mouth went dry, and her heart labored with slow, painful thumps. At the same time, her brain was working too fast, racing through a chain of conclusions, each more unpleasant than the last.</p><p>The door opened, and all of them turned to watch as someone else entered the vestry.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Poppy heard Leo say dourly. \u201cThe drama only needed you to be complete.\u201d</p><p>Harry came into the small, overcrowded room, looking suave and astonishingly calm. He approached Poppy, his green eyes cool. He wore his self-control like impenetrable armor. \u201cHello, darling.\u201d He reached out to run a hand lightly over the transparent lace of her veil. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even though he hadn\u2019t touched her directly, Poppy stiffened. \u201cIt\u2019s bad luck,\u201d she whispered through dry lips, \u201cfor you to see me before the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately,\u201d Harry said, \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was filled with confusion, anger, and a dull ache of horror. Staring up into Harry\u2019s face, she saw no trace of remorse in his expression.</p><p>\u201cIn the fairy tale . . .\u201d he had told her, \u201cI would probably be the villain.\u201d</p> <p>It was true.</p><p>And she was about to marry him.</p><p>\u201cI told her what you did,\u201d Michael said to Harry. \u201cHow you made it impossible for us to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make it impossible,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI merely made it difficult.\u201d</p><p>How young and noble and vulnerable Michael appeared, a wronged hero.</p> <p>And how large and cruel and contemptuous Harry was. Poppy couldn\u2019t believe she had ever found him charming, that she had liked him, that she had thought some form of happiness would be possible with him.</p><p>\u201cShe was yours, if you\u2019d truly wanted her,\u201d Harry continued, a pitiless smile touching his lips. \u201cBut I wanted her more.\u201d</p><p>Michael launched at him with a choked cry, his fist raised.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Poppy gasped, and Leo started forward. Harry was faster, however, seizing Michael\u2019s arm and twisting it behind his back. Expertly he shoved him up against the door.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Poppy said, rushing to them, hitting Harry\u2019s shoulder and back with her fist. \u201cLet him go! Don\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t seem to feel her blows. \u201cOut with it, Bayning,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cDid you come here merely to complain, or is there some point to all this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her away from here. Away from you!\u201d</p><p>Harry gave a chilling smile. \u201cI\u2019ll send you to hell first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet . . . him . . . go,\u201d Poppy said in a voice she had never used before.</p><p>It was enough to make Harry listen. His gaze connected with hers in a flash of unholy green. Slowly he released Michael, who swung around, his chest heaving with the anguished force of his breaths.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Poppy,\u201d Michael pleaded. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to Gretna. I no longer give a damn about my father or my inheritance. I can\u2019t let you marry this monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love me?\u201d she asked in a half whisper. \u201cOr because you want to save me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Harry watched her intently, taking in every nuance of her expression. \u201cGo with him,\u201d he invited gently. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy wasn\u2019t at all deceived. Harry would go to any lengths to get what he wanted, no matter what destruction or pain he caused. He would never let her go. He was merely testing her, curious to see what choice she would make.</p><p>One thing was clear: she and Michael would never be happy together. Because Michael\u2019s righteous fury would eventually wear off, and then all the reasons that had seemed so important before would regain their validity. He would come to regret having married her. He would lament the scandal and the disinheritance, and the lifelong disapproval of his father. And eventually Poppy would come to be the focus of his resentment.</p><p>She had to send Michael away\u2014it was the best thing she could do for him.</p><p>As for her interests . . . all choices seemed equally bad.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you get rid of both these idiots,\u201d Leo told her, \u201cand let me take you home to Hampshire.\u201d</p><p>Poppy stared at her brother, her lips touched with a hopeless smile. \u201cWhat kind of life would I have in Hampshire after this, Leo?\u201d</p><p>His only reply was grim silence. Poppy turned her attention to Miss Marks, who looked anguished. In their shared gaze, Poppy saw that her companion understood her precarious situation more accurately than the men did. Women were judged and condemned far more harshly than men in these matters. Poppy\u2019s elusive dream of a simple, peaceful life had already vanished. If she didn\u2019t go through with the wedding, she would never marry, never have children, never have a place in society. The only thing left was to make the best of her situation.</p><p>She faced Michael with unyielding resolve. \u201cYou must go,\u201d she said.</p><p>His face contorted. \u201cPoppy, I haven\u2019t lost you. You\u2019re not saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she insisted. Her gaze switched to her brother. \u201cLeo, please escort Miss Marks to her seat in the congregation. The wedding will start soon. And I need to speak to Mr. Rutledge alone.\u201d</p><p>Michael stared at her in disbelief. \u201cPoppy, you can\u2019t marry him. Listen to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, Bayning,\u201d Leo said quietly. \u201cThere\u2019s no undoing the part you\u2019ve played in this bloody mess. Let my sister deal with it as she chooses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Michael lurched toward the door like a drunken man.</p><p>Poppy longed to comfort him, to follow him, to reassure him of her love. Instead, she stayed in the vestry with Harry Rutledge.</p><p>After what seemed an eternity, the other three left, and Poppy and Harry faced each other.</p><p>It was clear he was indifferent to the fact that she now knew him for what he was. Harry wanted neither forgiveness nor redemption . . . he regretted nothing.</p><p>A lifetime, Poppy thought. With a man I can never trust.</p><p>To marry a villain, or never to marry at all. To be Harry Rutledge\u2019s wife, or live as an object of disgrace, to have mothers scold their children for speaking to her as if their innocence would be contaminated by her presence. To be propositioned by men who thought she was immoral or desperate. That was her future if she didn\u2019t become his wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d Harry asked quietly. \u201cWill you go through with it or not?\u201d</p><p>Poppy felt foolish standing there in her bridal finery, bedecked in flowers and a veil, all of it symbolizing hope and innocence when there was none left. She longed to tear off her betrothal ring and throw it at him. She wanted to crumple to the floor like a hat someone had stepped on. A brief thought came to her, that she wanted to send for Amelia, who would take charge of the situation and manage everything.</p><p>Except that Poppy was no longer a child whose life could be managed.</p><p>She stared into Harry\u2019s implacable face and hard eyes. He looked mocking, supremely confident that he\u2019d won. No doubt he assumed he\u2019d be able to run circles around her for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>To be sure, she had underestimated him.</p><p>But he had underestimated her, too.</p><p>All of Poppy\u2019s sorrow and misery and helpless anger swirled together into some new bitter amalgam. She was surprised by the calmness of her own voice as she spoke to him. \u201cI will never forget that you took away the man I loved and put yourself in his place. I\u2019m not certain I can ever forgive you for that. The only thing I am absolutely certain of is that I will never love you. Do you still want to marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said without hesitation. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to be loved. And God knows no one\u2019s done it yet.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p> <p>Poppy had forbidden Leo to tell the rest of the family about what had happened with Michael Bayning before the wedding. \u201cYou may tell them anything you wish after the breakfast,\u201d she had said. \u201cBut for my sake, please keep quiet until then. I won\u2019t be able to endure all those rituals\u2014the breakfast, the wedding cake, the toasts\u2014if I have to look into their eyes and know that they know.\u201d</p><p>Leo had looked angry. \u201cYou expect me to take you to the front of this church and give you to Rutledge for reasons I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand. Just help me through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to help if it results in you becoming Mrs. Harry Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>But because she had asked it of him, Leo had played his part in the elaborate ceremony with grim-faced dignity. With a shake of his head, he had offered his arm, and they had followed Beatrix to the front of the church where Harry Rutledge was waiting.</p><p>The service was mercifully short and unemotional. There was only one moment when Poppy felt a sharp pang of unease, as the minister said, \u201c. . . if any man can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak; or else hereafter forever hold his peace.\u201d It seemed the whole world stilled for the two or three seconds that followed his pronouncement. Poppy\u2019s pulse quickened. She realized she expected, hoped, to hear Michael\u2019s vehement protest ring out through the church.</p> <p>But there was only silence. Michael had gone.</p><p>The ceremony went on.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hand was warm as it closed around her cold one. They repeated their vows, and the minister gave the ring to Harry, who slid it firmly onto Poppy\u2019s finger.</p><p>Harry\u2019s voice was quiet and steady. \u201cWith this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and with all my worldly goods I thee endow.\u201d</p><p>Poppy didn\u2019t meet his gaze, but instead stared at the gleaming circlet on her finger. To her relief, there was no kiss to follow. The custom of kissing the bride was in bad taste, a plebeian practice that was never done at St. George\u2019s.</p><p>Finally bringing herself to look up at Harry, Poppy flinched at the satisfaction in his eyes. She took his arm, and they walked back down the aisle together, toward the future and a fate that seemed anything but benevolent.</p><p>Harry knew that Poppy thought of him as a monster. He acknowledged that his methods had been unfair, selfish, but there had been no other way to have Poppy as his wife. And he couldn\u2019t work up even a second\u2019s worth of regret for having taken her away from Bayning. Perhaps he was amoral, but it was the only way he knew to make his way in the world.</p><p>Poppy was his now, and he would make certain that she would not be sorry for marrying him. He would be as kind as she would allow. And in his experience, women would forgive anything if one offered the right incentives.</p> <p>Harry was relaxed and in good spirits the rest of the day. A procession of \u201cglass coaches,\u201d elaborate carriages with gold empire decorations and abundant windows, conveyed the wedding party to the Rutledge Hotel, where a huge formal breakfast was held in the hotel banquet room. The windows were crowded with onlookers, eager to catch a glimpse of the glittering scene. Greek pillars and arches had been placed all around the room, swathed in tulle and masses of flowers.</p><p>A regiment of servants brought out silver platters and trays of champagne, and the guests settled in their chairs to enjoy the repast. They were given individual servings of goose dressed with cream and herbs and covered with a steaming golden crust . . . bowls of melons and grapes, boiled quail eggs scattered lavishly on crisp green salad, baskets of hot muffins, toast and scones, flitches of fried smoked bacon . . . plates of thinly sliced beefsteak, the pink strips littered with fragrant shavings of truffle. Three wedding cakes were brought out, thickly iced and stuffed with fruit.</p><p>As was the custom, Poppy was served first, and Harry could only guess at the effort it took for her to eat and smile. If anyone noticed that the bride was subdued, it was assumed that the event was overwhelming for her, or perhaps that, like all brides, she was nervously anticipating the wedding night.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s family regarded her with protective concern, especially Amelia, who seemed to sense that something was wrong. Harry was fascinated by the Hathaways, the mysterious connections between them, as if they shared some collective secret. One could almost see the wordless understanding that passed between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although Harry knew a great deal about people, he knew nothing about being part of a family.</p><p>After Harry\u2019s mother had run off with one of her lovers, his father had tried to get rid of every remaining trace of her existence. And he had done his best to forget that he even had a son, leaving Harry to the hotel staff and a succession of tutors.</p><p>Harry had few memories of his mother, only that she had been beautiful and had had golden hair. It seemed she had always been going out, away from him, forever elusive. He remembered crying for her once, clutching his hands in her velvet skirts, and she had tried to make him let go, laughing softly at his persistence.</p><p>In the wake of his parents\u2019 abandonment, Harry had taken his meals in the kitchen with the hotel employees. When he was sick, one or another of the maids had taken care of him. He saw families come and go, and he had learned to view them with the same detachment that the hotel staff did. Deep down Harry harbored a suspicion that the reason his mother had left, the reason his father never had anything to do with him, was because he was unlovable. And therefore he had no desire to be part of a family. Even if or when Poppy bore him children, Harry would never allow anyone close enough to form an attachment. He would never let himself be shackled that way. And yet he sometimes knew a fleeting envy for those who were capable of it, like the Hathaways.</p> <p>The breakfast wore on, with endless rounds of toasting. When Harry saw the betraying droop of Poppy\u2019s shoulders, he deduced she\u2019d had enough. He rose and made a short, gracious speech, offering his thanks for the honor of the guests\u2019 presence on such a significant day.</p><p>It was the signal for the bride to retire along with her bridesmaids. They would soon be followed by the general company, who would disperse to attend a variety of amusements for the rest of the day. Poppy paused at the doorway. As if she could feel Harry\u2019s gaze on her, she turned to glance over her shoulder.</p><p>A warning flashed in her eyes, and it aroused him instantly. Poppy would not be a complacent bride, nor had he expected her to be. She would try to exact compensation for what he had done, and he would indulge her . . . up to a point. He wondered how she would react when he came to her that evening.</p><p>Harry tore his gaze away from his bride as he was approached by Kev Merripen, Poppy\u2019s brother-in-law, a man who managed to stay relatively inconspicuous despite his size and striking appearance. He was a Romany Gypsy, tall and black haired, his austere exterior concealing a nature of dark intensity.</p><p>\u201cMerripen,\u201d Harry said pleasantly. \u201cDid you enjoy the breakfast?\u201d</p> <p>The Rom was in no mood for small talk. He stared at Harry with a gaze promising death. \u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve done something to harm Poppy, I will find you and rip your head from your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerripen!\u201d came a cheerful exclamation as Leo suddenly appeared beside them. Harry didn\u2019t miss the way Leo jabbed a warning elbow against the Gypsy\u2019s ribs. \u201cAll charm and lightness, as usual. You\u2019re supposed to congratulate the bridegroom, phral. Not threaten to dismember him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a threat,\u201d the Rom muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>Harry met Merripen\u2019s gaze directly. \u201cI appreciate your concern for her. I assure you, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make her happy. Poppy will have anything she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe a divorce would top the list,\u201d Leo mused aloud.</p><p>Harry leveled a cool stare at Merripen. \u201cI\u2019d like to point out that your sister married me voluntarily. Michael Bayning should have had the bollocks to come to the church and carry her out bodily if necessary. But he didn\u2019t. And if he wasn\u2019t willing to fight for her, he didn\u2019t deserve her.\u201d He saw from Merripen\u2019s quick blink that he had scored a point. \u201cMoreover, after going through these exertions to marry Poppy, the last thing I would do is mistreat her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat exertions?\u201d the Rom asked suspiciously, and Harry realized that he hadn\u2019t yet been told the entire story.</p><p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d Leo told Merripen. \u201cIf I told you now, you\u2019d only make an embarrassing scene at Poppy\u2019s wedding. And that\u2019s supposed to be my job.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a glance, and Merripen muttered something in Romany.</p><p>Leo smiled faintly. \u201cI have no idea what you just said. But I suspect it\u2019s something about battering Poppy\u2019s new husband into forest mulch.\u201d He paused. \u201cLater, old fellow,\u201d he said. A look of grim understanding passed between them.</p><p>Merripen gave him a curt nod and left without another word to Harry.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was one of his good moods,\u201d Leo remarked, staring after his brother-in-law with rueful affection. He returned his attention to Harry. Suddenly, his eyes were filled with a world-weariness that should have taken lifetimes to acquire. \u201cI\u2019m afraid no amount of discussion would ease Merripen\u2019s concern. He\u2019s lived with the family since he was a boy, and my sisters\u2019 welfare is everything to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take care of her,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll try. And whether you believe it or not, I hope you succeed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Leo focused on him with an astute gaze that would have troubled a man with a conscience. \u201cIncidentally, I\u2019m not going with the family when they depart for Hampshire on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness in London?\u201d Harry asked politely.</p><p>\u201cYes, a few last parliamentary obligations. And a bit of architectural dabbling\u2014a hobby of mine. But mainly I\u2019m staying for Poppy\u2019s sake. You see, I expect she\u2019ll want to leave you quite soon, and I intend to escort her home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry smiled contemptuously, amused by his new brother-in-law\u2019s effrontery. Did Leo have any idea how many ways Harry could ruin him, and how easily it could be done? \u201cTread carefully,\u201d Harry said softly.</p><p>It was a sign of either na\u00efvet\u00e9 or courage that Leo didn\u2019t flinch. He actually smiled, though there was no humor in it. \u201cThere\u2019s something you don\u2019t seem to understand, Rutledge. You\u2019ve managed to acquire Poppy, but you don\u2019t have what it takes to keep her. Therefore, I won\u2019t be far away. I\u2019ll be there when she needs me. And if you harm her, your life won\u2019t be worth a bloody farthing. No man is untouchable\u2014not even you.\u201d</p><p>After a maid had helped Poppy change from her wedding garments into a simple dressing gown, she brought a glass of iced champagne and tactfully left.</p><p>Grateful for the silence of the private apartments, Poppy sat at her dressing table and unpinned her hair slowly. Her mouth ached from smiling, and the tiny muscles of her forehead felt strained. She drank the champagne and made a project of brushing her hair in long strokes, letting it fall in mahogany waves. The boar bristles felt good against her scalp.</p> <p>Harry had not yet come to the apartment. Poppy considered what she would say to him once he appeared, but nothing came to mind. With dreamlike slowness, she wandered through the rooms. Unlike the icy formality of the receiving area, the rest of the rooms had been decorated in plush fabrics and warm colors, with abundant places for sitting, reading, relaxing. Everything was immaculate, the windowpanes polished to stunning clarity, the Turkish carpeting clean swept and scented of tea leaves. There were fireplaces with marble or carved wood mantels and tiled hearths, and many lamps and sconces to keep the rooms well lit in the evening.</p><p>An extra bedroom had been added for Poppy. Harry had told her that she could have as many rooms for her own use as she wished\u2014the apartments had been designed so that connecting spaces could be opened up with ease. The counterpane on the bed was a soft shade of robin\u2019s egg blue, the fine linen sheets embroidered with tiny blue flowers. Pale blue satin and velvet curtains swathed the windows. It was a beautiful, feminine room, and Poppy would have taken great pleasure in it, had the circumstances been different.</p><p>She tried to decide if she was most angry with Harry, Michael, or herself. Perhaps equally with all three of them. And she was increasingly nervous, knowing it wouldn\u2019t be long until Harry arrived. Her gaze fell to the bed. She reassured herself with the thought that Harry would not force her to submit to him. His villainy would not lend itself to crude violence.</p><p>Her stomach dropped as she heard someone entering the apartments. She took a deep breath, and another, and waited until Harry\u2019s broad-shouldered form appeared in the doorway.</p><p>He paused, watching her, his features impassive. His cravat had been removed, the shirt opened to reveal the strong line of his throat. Poppy steeled herself not to move as Harry approached her. He reached out to touch her shining hair, letting it slide through his fingers like liquid fire. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it down before,\u201d he said. He was close enough that she could smell a hint of shaving soap, and the tang of champagne on his breath. His fingers smoothed over her cheek, detecting the trembling within her stillness.</p> <p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Poppy forced herself to meet his gaze. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be. I\u2019m much nicer to people who are afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the opposite is true.\u201d</p><p>A smile touched his lips.</p><p>Poppy was disoriented by the complex mixture of emotions he stirred in her, the antagonism and attraction and curiosity and resentment. Pulling away from him, she went to her dressing table and examined a small porcelain box with a gilded top.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you go through with it?\u201d she heard him ask quietly.</p><p>\u201cI thought it best for Michael.\u201d She felt a twinge of satisfaction as she saw how that had annoyed him.</p><p>Harry half sat on the bed, his posture informal. His gaze didn\u2019t stray from her. \u201cHad there been a choice, I would have done all this the ordinary way. I would have courted you openly, won you fairly. But you\u2019d already decided on Bayning. This was the only alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. You could have let me be with Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s doubtful he ever would have offered for you. He deceived you, and himself, by assuming he could persuade his father to accept the match. You should have seen the old man when I showed him the letter\u2014he was mortally offended by the notion of his son taking a wife so far beneath him.\u201d</p><p>That hurt, as perhaps Harry had intended, and Poppy stiffened.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you let it all play out? Why not wait until Michael had abandoned me, and then come forward to pick up the pieces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there was a chance Bayning might have dared to run off with you. I couldn\u2019t risk it. And I knew that sooner or later you\u2019d realize that what you had with Bayning was nothing but infatuation.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy gave him a glance of purest contempt. \u201cWhat do you know of love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen how people in love behave. And what I witnessed in the vestry this morning was nothing close to it. Had you truly wanted each other, no force in the world could have stopped you from walking out of that church together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have allowed it!\u201d she shot back in outrage.</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I would have respected the effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of us gives a damn about your respect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fact that she was speaking for Michael as well as herself . . . \u201cus\u201d . . . caused Harry\u2019s face to harden. \u201cWhatever your feelings for Bayning are, you\u2019re my wife now. And he\u2019ll go on to marry some blue-blooded heiress as he should have done in the first place. Now all that\u2019s left to decide is how you and I will go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer a marriage in name only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you,\u201d Harry said calmly. \u201cHowever, the marriage isn\u2019t legal until I bed you. And, unfortunately, I never leave loopholes.\u201d</p><p>He was going to insist on his rights, then. Nothing would dissuade him from getting what he wanted. Poppy\u2019s eyes and nose stung. But she would have rather died than cry in front of him. She shot him a look of revulsion, while her heart pounded until she felt its reverberations in her temples and wrists and ankles.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed by such a poetic declaration. By all means, let\u2019s complete the contract.\u201d She began on the gilded buttons at the front of her dressing gown, her fingers stiff and shaking. Her breath trembled in her throat. \u201cAll I ask is that you make it quick.\u201d</p><p>Harry pushed away from the bed with graceful ease and came to her. One of his warm hands covered both of hers, and her fingers stilled. \u201cPoppy.\u201d He waited until she could bring herself to look up at him. Amusement glinted in his eyes. \u201cYou make me feel like a vile ravisher,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair to tell you that I\u2019ve never forced myself on a woman. A simple refusal would probably be enough to deter me.\u201d</p><p>He was lying, her instincts told her. But . . . perhaps he wasn\u2019t. Damn him for toying with her like a cat with a mouse.</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d she asked with offended dignity.</p><p>Harry gave her a guileless glance. \u201cRefuse me, and we\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that such a despicable human being could be so handsome was proof that the universe was vastly unfair, or at least very badly organized. \u201cI\u2019m not going to refuse you,\u201d she said, pushing his hand away. \u201cI\u2019m not going to entertain you with virginal theatrics.\u201d She continued to unfasten the buttons of her dressing gown. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to have done with this so I won\u2019t have anything to dread.\u201d</p><p>Obligingly Harry removed his coat and went to drape it over a chair. Poppy dropped her dressing robe to the floor and kicked off her slippers. The cool air wafted beneath the hem of her thin cambric nightgown and lingered in icy curls around her ankles. She could scarcely think, her head filled with fears and worries. The future she had once hoped for was gone, and another was being created, one with infinite complications. Harry would know her in a way no one else ever had, or ever would. But it wouldn\u2019t be anything like her sisters\u2019 marriages . . . it would be a relationship built on something far different from love and trust.</p><p>Her sister Win\u2019s information on marital intimacy had been garnished with flowers and moonbeams, with the barest description of the physical act. Win\u2019s advice had been to trust one\u2019s husband, and to relax, and to understand that sexual closeness was a wonderful part of love. None of that had any relevance to the situation Poppy now found herself in.</p><p>The room was utterly silent. This means nothing to me, she thought, trying to make herself believe it. She felt as if she were in a stranger\u2019s body as she undid her nightgown and pulled it over her head and let it fall to the carpeting in a limp heap. Gooseflesh rose everywhere, the tips of her br**sts contracting in the chill.</p><p>She went to the bed and turned back the covers and slipped in. Drawing the bed linens up to her br**sts, she settled back against the pillows. Only then did she glance at Harry.</p><p>Her husband had paused in the act of unfastening a shoe, his foot propped on a chair. He had already removed his shirt and waistcoat, and the muscles of his long back were bunched and tense. He stared at her over his shoulder, his thick lashes half lowered. His color was high, as if sun flushed, and his lips were parted as if he\u2019d forgotten something he\u2019d been about to say. Letting out a breath that wasn\u2019t entirely steady, he turned back to his shoe.</p> <p>His body was beautifully made, but Poppy took no pleasure in it. In fact, she resented it. She would have preferred a few signs of vulnerability, a touch of softness around the middle, a set of narrow shoulders, anything that would put him at a disadvantage. But he was lean and strong and powerfully proportioned. Still clad in his trousers, Harry came to stand beside the bed. Despite her efforts to appear indifferent, Poppy couldn\u2019t stop her fingers from curling into the embroidered sheets.</p><p>His hand went to her bare shoulder, his fingertips drifting to her throat and back again. He paused as he found a tiny, nearly invisible scar on her shoulder\u2014the place a stray shotgun pellet had once lodged. \u201cFrom the accident?\u201d he asked huskily.</p><p>Poppy nodded, unable to speak. She realized he would become familiar with every small and unique detail of her body . . . she had given him that right. He found three more scars on her arm, stroking each one as if he could soothe those long-ago injuries. Slowly his hand went to a lock of hair that lay in a fine mahogany river over her chest, following it beneath the sheets and blankets.</p><p>She gasped as she felt his thumb brush over the bud of her nipple, circling, sending runners of heat to the pit of her stomach. His hand left her for a moment, and when he reached for her breast again, his thumb was damp from his own mouth. Another teasing, acute circle, moisture enhancing the caress. Her knees drew up slightly, her h*ps tilting as if her entire body had become a vessel to contain sensation. His other hand slid softly beneath her chin, tilting her face up to his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He bent to kiss her, but Poppy turned her face away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the same man who kissed you on the terrace,\u201d she heard him say. \u201cYou liked it well enough then.\u201d</p><p>Poppy could hardly speak with his hand cupping her breast. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d A kiss meant more to her than a simple physical gesture. It was a gift of love, of affection, or at the very least liking, and she felt none of those things for him. He might have the right to her body, but not to her heart.</p><p>His hands left her, and she felt him nudge her gently to the side.</p><p>Poppy obeyed, her pulse racing as he joined her on the bed. He reclined on his side, his feet extending much farther than hers along the mattress. She forced her fingers to loosen from the covers as he drew them away from her.</p><p>Harry\u2019s gaze slid over her slim, exposed body, the curves of her br**sts, the clamped seam of her thighs. Heat surfaced everywhere, a flush that deepened as he drew her against him. His chest was warm and hard, with a covering of dark hair that tickled her br**sts.</p><p>Poppy shivered as his hand moved along her spine, pressing her close. The intimacy of being clasped against a half-naked man, breathing the scent of his skin, was almost more than her dazed mind could comprehend. He pressed her bare legs apart, the fabric of his trousers smooth and cool. And he held her like that, his hand roaming slowly over her back until the teeth-chattering shivers eased.</p><p>His mouth traced the taut side of her neck. He spent a long time kissing her there, investigating the hollow behind her ear, the edge of her hairline, the front of her throat. His tongue found the hectic throb of her pulse, lingering until she gasped and tried to push him away. His arms tightened, one hand coming to the bare curve of her bottom, keeping her against him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like that?\u201d he asked against her throat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Poppy said, trying to work her arms between them.</p><p>Harry pressed her back to the mattress, his eyes bright with diabolical amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to admit to liking any of this, are you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>His hand cradled the side of her face, his thumb brushing her closed lips. \u201cPoppy, if there\u2019s nothing else about me that pleases you, at least give this a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Not when I remember that I should be doing this with . . . him.\u201d As angry and resentful as she was, Poppy couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to say Michael\u2019s name.</p><p>As it was, it provoked even more of a reaction from Harry than she\u2019d expected. He gripped her jaw, his hand closing in a strong, not-quite-painful vise, his eyes flaring with fury. She stared back at him defiantly, almost willing him to do something awful, to prove that he was as contemptible as she thought him.</p><p>But Harry\u2019s voice, when he finally spoke, was scrupulously controlled. \u201cThen I\u2019ll see if I can put him out of your thoughts.\u201d The bedclothes were pushed away with ruthless insistence, robbing her of any means of concealment. She started upward, but he pushed her back down. His hand curved beneath her breast, plumping it upward, and he bent until his breath fell against the peak in light, repeated shocks.</p><p>He traced the aureole with his tongue, caught it tenderly with his teeth, playing with the sensitive flesh. Delight fed into her veins with every swirl and lick and soft tug. Poppy\u2019s hands clenched into fists as she tried to keep them by her sides. It seemed important not to touch him voluntarily. But he was skilled and persistent, arousing deep and writhing impulses, and her body was apparently inclined to choose pleasure over principle.</p><p>She reached up to his head, the dark hair thick and soft between her fingers. Gasping, she guided him to her other breast. He complied with a hoarse murmur, his lips opening over the heat-stung bud. His hands glided over her body, charting the curves of her waist and hips. The tip of his middle finger circled the rim of her navel and wove in a teasing path across the flat of her stomach, along the valley where her legs pressed together . . . from her knees to the top of her thighs . . . back again.</p><p>Stroking gently, Harry whispered, \u201cOpen for me.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was quiet, resisting, panting as if each breath were being torn from her throat. The pressure of tears rose behind her closed eyes. Experiencing any pleasure at all with Harry seemed like a betrayal.</p><p>And he knew it. His voice was soft against her ear as he said, \u201cWhat happens in this bed is only between us. There\u2019s no sin in submitting to your husband, and nothing to gain by denying what enjoyment I might be able to give you. Let it happen, Poppy. You don\u2019t have to be virtuous with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be,\u201d she said unsteadily.</p><p>\u201cThen let me touch you.\u201d</p> <p>At her silence, Harry pushed her resistless legs apart. His palm coursed along her inner thigh until his thumb brushed soft, private curls. The ragged rhythms of their breathing rustled through the quiet room. His thumb nestled into the curls, grazing against a place so sensitive that she jerked with a muffled protest.</p><p>He gathered her closer into hard muscle and smoothness and crisp hair. Reaching down again, he teased the yielding flesh apart. An irresistible urge came to press upward into his hand. But she forced herself to lay passive, even though the effort to hold still was exhausting.</p><p>Finding the entrance to her body, Harry stroked the softness until he had elicited a slick of hot serum. He fondled her, one of his fingers nudging inside. Startled, she stiffened and whimpered.</p><p>Harry kissed her throat. \u201cShhh . . . I\u2019m not hurting you. Easy.\u201d He stroked within her, his finger gently crooking as if to urge her forward. Over and over, so patiently. The pleasure acquired a new tension, her limbs weighted with thickening layers of sensation. His finger withdrew, and he began to play with her idly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sounds climbed in her throat, but she swallowed them back. She wanted to move, to twist in the restless heat. Her hands itched to grip the flexing muscles of his shoulders. Instead, she lay with martyred stillness.</p><p>But he knew how to make her body respond, how to coax delight from her unwilling flesh. She couldn\u2019t stop her h*ps from riding upward, her heels delving into the cool pliancy of the mattress. He slid along her front, kissing lower and lower, his mouth measuring tender distances across her body. When he nuzzled into the soft, private curls, however, she stiffened and tried to move away. Her mind was reeling. No one had told her about this. It couldn\u2019t be right.</p><p>As she wriggled, his hands slid beneath her bottom, gripping her in place, and his tongue found her in wet, fluent strokes. Carefully he guided her into a deliberate rhythm, urging her upward, and again, while he stroked in voluptuous countermeasure. Wicked mouth, merciless tongue. Hot breath, flowing over her. The feeling built and built, until it came to a startling summit and flared in all directions. A cry escaped her, and another, as dense spasms rolled through her. There was no escaping, no holding back. And he stayed with her, prolonging the descent with soft licks, extorting a few last twitches of pleasure as she lay trembling beneath him.</p><p>Then came the worst part, when Harry took her into his arms to comfort her . . . and she let him.</p><p>She could hardly help but feel how aroused he was, his body taut and solid, his heartbeat swift beneath her ear. He ran his hand over the supple curve of her spine. With a pang of reluctant excitement, she wondered if he would take her now.</p><p>But Harry surprised her by saying, \u201cI won\u2019t force the rest of it on you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her voice sounded strange and thick to her own ears. \u201cYou . . . you needn\u2019t stop. As I told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you want to have done with it,\u201d Harry said sardonically. \u201cSo you\u2019ll have nothing left to dread.\u201d Releasing her, he rolled away and stood, adjusting the front of his trousers with casual unconcern. Poppy\u2019s face flamed. \u201cBut I\u2019ve decided to let you dread it a bit longer. Just remember that if you have any idea about requesting an annulment, I\u2019ll have you on your back and divested of your virginity before you can blink.\u201d He drew the covers over her and paused. \u201cTell me, Poppy . . . Did you think of him at all just now? Was his face, his name in your mind while I was touching you?\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head, refusing to look at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a start,\u201d he said softly. He extinguished the lamp and left.</p><p>She lay alone in the darkness, shamed and sated and confused.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Sleep was always difficult for Harry. Tonight it was impossible. His mind, accustomed to working on multiple problems simultaneously, now had a new and endlessly interesting subject to ponder.</p><p>His wife.</p><p>He had learned a great deal about Poppy in one day. She had shown that she was exceptionally strong under duress, not a woman to go to pieces in a difficult situation. And although she loved her family, she had not run to them for shelter.</p><p>Harry admired the way Poppy had dealt with her wedding day. Even more, he admired the way she had dealt with him. No virginal theatrics, as she had put it.</p><p>He thought of those blistering minutes before he had left her, when she had been sweet and yielding, her beautiful body blazing in response. Aroused and restless, Harry lay in his bedroom, on the other side of the apartment from hers. The thought of Poppy sleeping in the place where he lived was more than sufficient to keep him awake. No woman had ever stayed in his apartments before. He had always conducted his liaisons away from his residence, never spending a full night with anyone. It made him uncomfortable, the notion of actually sleeping in a bed with another person. Just why that seemed more intimate than the sexual act was not something Harry cared to ponder.</p><p>Harry was relieved when daybreak approached, the sky\u2019s low roof enameled with dull silver. He arose, washed, and dressed. He let in a housemaid, who stirred the grate and brought freshly ironed copies of the Morning Chronicle, the Globe, and the Times. As per their usual routine, the floor waiter would arrive with breakfast, and then Jake Valentine would deliver the managers\u2019 reports and take his morning list.</p><p>\u201cWill Mrs. Rutledge want breakfast as well, sir?\u201d the maid asked.</p><p>Harry wondered how long Poppy would sleep. \u201cTap on her door and ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He saw the way the maid\u2019s gaze darted from the direction of his bedroom to Poppy\u2019s. Although it was common for upper-class couples to maintain separate bedrooms, the maid evinced a touch of surprise before she schooled her expression. Vaguely annoyed, Harry watched her leave the dining area.</p><p>He heard the housemaid\u2019s murmur, and Poppy\u2019s reply. The muffled sound of his wife\u2019s voice caused a pleasant ripple of awareness across his nerves.</p> <p>The housemaid returned to the dining area. \u201cI\u2019ll be bringing a tray for Mrs. Rutledge as well. Will there be anything else, sir?\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head, returning his attention to the papers as she left. He tried to read an article at least three times before finally giving up and staring in the direction of Poppy\u2019s room.</p><p>Finally she appeared, wearing a dressing gown made of blue taffeta, heavily embroidered with flowers. Her hair was loose, the brown locks shot with gleaming fire. Her expression was neutral, her eyes guarded. He wanted to peel the intricately stitched garment away from her, kiss her exposed body until she was flushed and panting.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Poppy murmured, not quite meeting his gaze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry stood and waited until she came to the small table. It didn\u2019t escape him that she tried to avoid being touched by him as he seated her. Patience, he reminded himself. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d It was clear that politeness rather than concern motivated her to ask, \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough.\u201d</p><p>Poppy glanced at the variety of papers on the table. Picking one up, she held it so that any view of her face was obstructed as she read. Since it appeared that she was not inclined to converse, Harry occupied himself with another paper.</p> <p>The silence was broken only by the rustling of flimsy news pages.</p><p>Breakfast was brought in, and two housemaids set out porcelain plates and flatware and crystal glasses.</p><p>Harry saw that Poppy had asked for crumpets, their flat, porous tops gently steaming. He began on his own breakfast of poached eggs on toast, cutting into the condensed yellow yolks and spreading the soft insides across the crisp bread.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to awaken early if you don\u2019t wish,\u201d he said, sprinkling a pinch of salt over his eggs. \u201cMany ladies of London sleep until noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to rise when the day begins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike a good farmwife,\u201d Harry said, casting her a brief smile.</p><p>But Poppy showed no reaction to the reminder, only applied herself to drizzling honey over the crumpets.</p><p>Harry paused with his fork held in midair, mesmerized by the sight of her slim fingers twirling the honey stick, meticulously filling each hole with thick amber liquid. Realizing that he was staring, Harry took a bite of his breakfast. Poppy replaced the honey stick in a small silver pot. Discovering a stray drop of sweetness on the tip of her thumb, she lifted it to her lips and sucked it clean.</p><p>Harry choked a little, reached for his tea, and took a swallow. The beverage scalded his tongue, causing him to flinch and curse.</p><p>Poppy gave him an odd look. \u201cIs there anything the matter?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. Except that watching his wife eating breakfast was the most erotic act he had ever seen. \u201cNothing at all,\u201d Harry said scratchily. \u201cTea\u2019s hot.\u201d</p> <p>When he dared to look at Poppy again, she was consuming a fresh strawberry, holding it by the green stem. Her lips rounded in a luscious pucker as she bit neatly into the ripe flesh of the fruit. Christ. He moved uncomfortably in his chair, while all the unsatisfied desire of the previous night reawakened with a vengeance. Poppy ate two more strawberries, nibbling slowly, while Harry tried to ignore her. Heat collected beneath his clothing, and he used a napkin to blot his forehead.</p><p>Poppy lifted a bite of honey-soaked crumpet to her mouth, and gave him a perplexed glance. \u201cAre you feeling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too warm in here,\u201d Harry said irritably, while lurid thoughts went through his mind. Thoughts involving honey, and soft feminine skin, and moist pink\u2014</p><p>A knock came at the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Harry said curtly, eager for any kind of distraction.</p><p>Jake Valentine entered the apartments more cautiously than usual, looking a bit surprised as he saw Poppy sitting at the breakfast table. Harry supposed the novelty of the situation would take a little getting used to on all sides.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Valentine said, uncertain whether to address only Harry or include Poppy.</p><p>She solved the dilemma by giving him an artless smile. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Valentine. I hope there are no fugitive monkeys in the hotel today?\u201d</p> <p>Valentine grinned. \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of, Mrs. Rutledge. But the day\u2019s still young.\u201d</p><p>Harry experienced a new sensation, a poisonous resentment that crept all through his body. Was it . . . jealousy? It had to be. He tried to suppress the feeling, but it lingered in the pit of his stomach. He wanted Poppy to smile at him like that. He wanted her playfulness, her charm, her attention.</p><p>Stirring a lump of sugar into his tea, Harry said coolly, \u201cTell me about the staff meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to report, really.\u201d Valentine handed him the sheaf of paper. \u201cThe sommelier asked that you approve a list of wines. And Mrs. Pennywhistle raised the problem of cutlery and flatware disappearing from trays when guests request food in their room.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue in the dining room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. It seems that few guests are inclined to take the flatware straight from the dining room. But in the privacy of their own rooms . . . well, the other morning, an entire breakfast service went missing. As a result, Mrs. Pennywhistle proposed that we purchase a set of tinware to be used strictly for private dining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guests, using tin knives and forks?\u201d Harry shook his head emphatically. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll have to find some other way of discouraging petty thievery. We\u2019re not a damned coaching inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you\u2019d say.\u201d Valentine watched Harry leaf through the top few pages. \u201cMrs. Pennywhistle said that whenever Mrs. Rutledge prefers, she would be honored to escort her around the hotel offices and kitchens, and introduce her to the staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d Harry began.</p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d Poppy interrupted. \u201cPlease tell her that I will be ready after breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if you\u2019ll have a hand in running the place.\u201d</p><p>Poppy turned to him with a polite smile. \u201cI would never dream of interfering. But since this is my new home, I would like to become more familiar with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a home,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Their gazes met.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cPeople live here. Don\u2019t you consider it your home?\u201d</p><p>Jake Valentine shifted his weight uncomfortably. \u201cIf you\u2019ll give me my morning list, Mr. Rutledge . . .\u201d</p> <p>Harry barely heard him. He continued to stare at his wife, wondering why the question seemed important to her. He tried to explain his reasoning. \u201cThe mere fact of people living here doesn\u2019t make it a home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no feelings of domestic affection for this place?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Valentine said awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019ll go now.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them took notice of his hasty departure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a place I happen to own,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI value it for practical reasons. But I attach no sentiment to it.\u201d</p> <p>Her blue eyes searched his, curious and perceptive, oddly compassionate. No one had ever looked at him that way before. It made his nerves prickle defensively. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent all your life in hotels, haven\u2019t you?\u201d she murmured. \u201cNever a house with a yard and a tree.\u201d</p><p>Harry was unable to fathom why any of that should signify. He brushed away the subject and tried to reassert his control. \u201cLet me be clear, Poppy . . . this is a business. And my employees are not to be treated as relations, or even as friends, or you\u2019ll create a management problem. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, still staring at him. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to.\u201d</p><p>This time it was Harry\u2019s turn to lift the newspaper, avoiding her gaze. Uneasiness stirred within him. He did not want any form of understanding from her. He merely wanted to enjoy her, browse over her as he did his room of treasures. Poppy would have to comply with the limits he set. And in return he would be a lenient husband\u2014as long as she understood that he would always have the upper hand.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2014\u201d Mrs. Pennywhistle, the head housekeeper said emphatically, \u201cFrom myself down to the laundry maids, is so very delighted that Mr. Rutledge has finally found a bride. And on behalf of the entire staff, we hope you will feel welcome here. You have three hundred people available to serve your every need.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was touched by the woman\u2019s obvious sincerity. The housekeeper was a tall, broad-shouldered woman with a ruddy complexion and an air of barely suppressed liveliness.</p> <p>\u201cI promise you,\u201d Poppy said with a smile, \u201cI won\u2019t require the assistance of three hundred people. Although I will need your help in finding a lady\u2019s maid. I\u2019ve never needed one before, but now without my sisters and my companion . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. We have a few girls among the staff who could be easily trained for such a purpose. You may interview them, and if none seems suitable, we will advertise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect that from time to time you may wish to view the housekeeping accounts and ledgers, and the supply lists and inventory. I am at your disposal, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very kind,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI\u2019m glad of the chance to meet some of the hotel staff. And to see some of the places I was never able to visit as a guest. The kitchens, especially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur chef, Monsieur Broussard, will be in raptures to show you his kitchen and boast of his achievements.\u201d She paused and added sotto voce, \u201cFortunately for us, his vanity is matched by his talent.\u201d</p><p>They began to descend the grand staircase. \u201cHow long have you been employed here, Mrs. Pennywhistle?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>\u201cWell nigh ten years . . . since the beginning.\u201d The housekeeper smiled at a distant memory. \u201cMr. Rutledge was so very young, lanky as a beanpole, with a sharp American accent and a habit of talking so fast, one could scarcely follow him. I worked in my father\u2019s tea shop in the Strand\u2014I managed it for him\u2014and Mr. Rutledge was a frequent customer. One day he came in and offered me the position I currently hold, although the hotel was still only a row of private houses. Nothing compared to what it is now. Of course I said yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy \u2018of course\u2019? Didn\u2019t your father want you to stay at his shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he had my sisters to help him. And there was something about Mr. Rutledge that I\u2019ve never seen in any man before or since . . . an extraordinary force of character. He is very persuasive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed,\u201d Poppy said dryly.</p><p>\u201cPeople want to follow him, or to be part of whatever it is he\u2019s involved in. It\u2019s why he was able to accomplish all this\u2014\u201d Mrs. Pennywhistle gestured at their surroundings, \u201c\u2014at such an early age.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Poppy that she could learn much about her husband from those who worked for him. She hoped at least a few of them would be as willing to talk as Mrs. Pennywhistle. \u201cIs he a demanding master?\u201d</p><p>The housekeeper chuckled. \u201cOh, yes. But fair, and always reasonable.\u201d</p><p>They went to the front office, where two men, one elderly, one in his middle years, were conferring over an enormous ledger, which lay open across an oak desk. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d the housekeeper said, \u201cI am touring Mrs. Rutledge around the hotel. Mrs. Rutledge, may I present Mr. Myles, our general manager, and Mr. Lufton, the concierge.\u201d</p><p>They bowed respectfully, regarding Poppy as if she were a visiting monarch. The younger of the two, Mr. Myles, beamed and blushed until the top of his balding head was pink. \u201cMrs. Rutledge, it is a very great honor indeed! May we offer our sincere congratulations on your marriage\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMost sincere,\u201d Mr. Lufton chimed in. \u201cYou are the answer to our prayers. We wish you and Mr. Rutledge every happiness.\u201d</p><p>Slightly taken aback by their enthusiasm, Poppy smiled and nodded to each of them in turn. \u201cThank you, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>They proceeded to show her the office, which housed a long row of arrival ledgers, managers\u2019 logs, books containing histories and customs of foreign countries, dictionaries for various languages, maps of all kinds, and floor plans of the hotel. The plans, tacked on a wall, were marked in pencil to indicate which rooms were vacant or under repair.</p><p>Two leather-bound books had been set apart from the rest, one red, one black.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are these volumes?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>The men glanced at each other, and Mr. Lufton replied cautiously. \u201cThere are very rare occasions on which a guest has proved so . . . well, difficult\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d Mr. Myles chimed in.</p><p>\u201cThat regrettably we must enter them in the black book, which means they are no longer precisely welcome\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndesirable,\u201d Mr. Myles added.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we are unable to allow them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver,\u201d Mr. Myles said emphatically.</p><p>Amused, Poppy nodded. \u201cI see. And the purpose of the red book?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lufton proceeded to explain. \u201cThat is for certain guests who are a bit more demanding than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem guests,\u201d Mr. Myles clarified.</p><p>\u201cThose who have special requests,\u201d Mr. Lufton continued, \u201cor don\u2019t like their rooms cleaned at certain times; those who insist on bringing pets, things of that sort. We don\u2019t discourage them from staying, but we do make a note of their peculiarities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Poppy picked up the red book and cast a mischievous glance at the housekeeper. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Hathaways were mentioned a few times in this book.\u201d</p><p>Silence greeted her comment.</p><p>Seeing the frozen looks on their faces, Poppy began to laugh. \u201cI knew it. Where is my family mentioned?\u201d She opened the book and glanced over a few pages at random.</p><p>The two men were instantly distressed, hovering as if searching for an opportunity to seize the book. \u201cMrs. Rutledge, please, you mustn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not in there,\u201d Mr. Myles said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we are,\u201d Poppy countered with a grin. \u201cIn fact, we probably have our own chapter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014I mean, no\u2014Mrs. Rutledge, I beg of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Poppy said, surrendering the red book. The men sighed with relief. \u201cHowever,\u201d she said, \u201cI may borrow this book someday. I\u2019m sure it would make excellent reading material.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you are done teasing these poor gentlemen, Mrs. Rutledge,\u201d the housekeeper said, her eyes twinkling, \u201cI see that many of our employees have gathered outside the door to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely!\u201d Poppy went to the reception area, where she was introduced to housemaids, floor managers, maintenance staff, and hotel valets. She repeated everyone\u2019s name, trying to memorize as many of them as possible, and she asked questions about their duties. They responded eagerly to her interest, volunteering information about the various parts of England they had come from and how long they had worked at the Rutledge.</p><p>Poppy reflected that despite the many occasions she had stayed at the hotel as a guest, she had never given much thought to the employees. They had always been nameless and faceless, moving in the background with quiet efficiency. Now she felt immediate kinship with them. She was part of the hotel just as they were . . . all of them existing in Harry Rutledge\u2019s sphere.</p><p>After the first week of living with Harry, it was clear to Poppy that her husband kept a schedule that would have killed a normal man. The only time she was sure to see him was in the mornings at breakfast; he was busy the rest of the day, often missing supper, and seldom retiring before midnight.</p><p>Harry liked to occupy himself with two or more things at once, making lists and plans, arranging meetings, reconciling arguments, doing favors. He was constantly approached by people who wanted him to apply his brilliant mind to some problem or other. People visited him at all hours, and it seemed a quarter hour couldn\u2019t pass without someone, usually Jake Valentine, tapping on the apartment door.</p><p>When Harry wasn\u2019t busy with his various intrigues, he meddled with the hotel and its staff. His demands for perfection and the highest quality of service were relentless. The employees were paid generously and treated well, but in return they were expected to work hard and, above all, to be loyal. If one of them were injured or ill, Harry sent for a doctor and paid for their treatments. If someone suggested a way to improve the hotel or its service, the idea was sent directly to Harry, and if he approved, he gave a handsome bonus. As a result, Harry\u2019s desk was always laden with piles of reports, letters and notes.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem to have occurred to Harry to suggest a honeymoon for himself and his new bride, and Poppy suspected he had no desire to leave the hotel. Certainly she had no desire for a honeymoon with a man who had betrayed her.</p><p>Since their wedding night, Poppy had been nervous around Harry, especially when they were alone. He made no secret of his desire for her, his interest in her, but so far there had been no more advances. In fact, he had gone out of his way to be polite and considerate. It seemed as if he were trying to get her accustomed to him, to the altered circumstances of her life. And she appreciated his patience, because it was all so very new. Ironically, however, his self-imposed restraint gave their occasional moments of contact\u2014the touch of his hand on her arm, the press of his body when they stood close in a crowd\u2014a charge of vibrant attraction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Attraction without trust . . . not a comfortable thing to feel for one\u2019s own husband.</p><p>Poppy had no idea how long he would continue this conjugal reprieve. She was only grateful that Harry was so consumed with his hotel. Although . . . she couldn\u2019t help thinking that this sunrise-to-midnight agenda was not at all good for him. If someone Poppy cared for had been working so relentlessly, she would have urged him to ease his pace, to take some time to rest.</p><p>Simple compassion got the better of her one afternoon when Harry came into their apartment unexpectedly, carrying his coat in one hand. He had spent most of the day with the Chief Officer of the LFEE, the London Fire Engine Establishment. Together they had meticulously gone through the hotel to examine its safety procedures and equipment.</p><p>If, heaven forbid, a fire should ever break out at the Rutledge, the employees had been trained to help as many guests as possible leave the building expediently. Escape ladders were routinely counted and inspected, and floor plans and exit routes were examined. Firemarks had been mortared onto the outside of the building to designate it as one the LFEE had been paid to protect.</p> <p>As Harry entered the apartment, Poppy saw that the day had been especially demanding. His face was etched with weariness.</p><p>He paused at the sight of Poppy curled in the corner of the settee, reading a book balanced on her drawn-up knees.</p><p>\u201cHow was the luncheon?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>Poppy had been invited to join a group of well-to-do young matrons, who held an annual charity bazaar. \u201cIt went nicely, thank you. They are a pleasant group. Although they do seem a bit too fond of forming committees. I\u2019ve always thought a committee takes a month to accomplish something a single person could have done in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled. \u201cThe goal of such groups isn\u2019t to be efficient. It\u2019s to have something to occupy their time.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy took a closer look at him, and her eyes widened. \u201cWhat happened to your clothes?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s white linen shirt and dark blue silk waistcoat had been streaked with soot. There were more black smudges on his hands, and one on the edge of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI was testing one of the safety ladders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou climbed down a ladder outside the building?\u201d Poppy was amazed that he would have taken such an unnecessary risk. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have asked someone else to do it? Mr. Valentine, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he would have. But I wouldn\u2019t provide equipment for my employees without trying it myself. I still have concerns about the housemaids\u2014their skirts would make their descent more difficult. However, I draw the line at trying that out.\u201d He cast a rueful glance at his palms. \u201cI have to wash and change before going back to work.\u201d</p><p>Poppy returned her attention to her book. But she was intensely aware of the quiet sounds coming from the other room, the opening of drawers, the splash of water and soap, the thud of a discarded shoe. She thought of him being unclothed, at that very moment, and a dart of warmth went through her stomach.</p> <p>Harry came back into the room, clean and impeccable as before. Except . . .</p><p>\u201cA smudge,\u201d Poppy said, conscious of a flutter of amusement. \u201cYou missed a spot.\u201d</p><p>Harry glanced down over his front. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour jaw. No, not that side.\u201d She picked up a napkin and gestured for him to come to her.</p><p>Harry leaned over the back of the settee, his face descending toward hers. He held very still as she wiped the soot from his jaw. The scent of his skin drifted to her, fresh and clean, with a slight smoky tinge like cedarwood.</p><p>Wishing to prolong the moment, Poppy stared into his fathomless green eyes. They were shadowed from lack of sleep. Good heavens, did the man ever pause for even a moment?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit with me?\u201d Poppy asked impulsively.</p><p>Harry blinked, clearly thrown off guard by the invitation. \u201cNow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. There\u2019s too much to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten today? Aside from a few bites of breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t had time.\u201d</p><p>Poppy pointed to the place on the settee beside her in wordless demand.</p><p>To her surprise, Harry actually obeyed. He came around the end of the settee and sat in the corner, staring at her. One of his dark brows arched questioningly.</p><p>Reaching for the tray beside her, Poppy lifted a plate laden with sandwiches, tarts, and biscuits. \u201cThe kitchen sent up far too much for one person. Have the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she insisted, pushing the plate into his hands.</p><p>Harry took a sandwich and began to consume it slowly. Taking her own teacup from the tray, Poppy poured fresh tea and added a spoonful of sugar. She gave it to Harry.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d he asked, glancing at the book in her lap.</p><p>\u201cA novel by a naturalist author. As of yet, I can\u2019t find anything resembling a plot, but the descriptions of the countryside are quite lyrical.\u201d She paused, watching him drain the teacup. \u201cDo you like novels?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI usually read for information, not entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disapprove of reading for pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t often manage to find the time for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s why you don\u2019t sleep well. You need an interlude between work and bedtime.\u201d</p><p>There was a dry, perfectly timed pause before Harry asked, \u201cWhat would you suggest?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aware of his meaning, Poppy felt a bloom of color emerge from head to toe. Harry seemed to enjoy her discomfiture, not in a mocking way, but as if he found her charming.</p><p>\u201cEveryone in my family loves novels,\u201d Poppy finally said, pushing the conversation back into line. \u201cWe gather in the parlor nearly every evening, and one of us reads aloud. Win is the best at it\u2014she invents a different voice for each character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear you read,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Poppy shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not half as entertaining as Win. I put everyone to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou have the voice of a scholar\u2019s daughter.\u201d Before she could take offense, he added, \u201cSoothing. Never grates. Soft . . .\u201d</p><p>He was extraordinarily tired, she realized. So much that even the effort to string words together was defeating him.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d he muttered, rubbing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFinish your sandwiches first,\u201d Poppy said authoritatively.</p><p>He picked up a sandwich obediently. While he ate, Poppy paged through the book until she found what she wanted . . . a description of walking through the countryside, under skies filled with fleecy clouds, past almond trees in blossom and white campion nestled beside quiet brooks. She read in a measured tone, occasionally stealing a glance at Harry while he polished off the entire plate of sandwiches. And then he settled deeper into the corner, more relaxed than she had ever seen him.</p> <p>She read a few pages more, about walking past hedges and meadows, through a wood dressed with a counterpane of fallen leaves, while soft pale sunshine gave way to a quiet rain . . .</p><p>And when she finally reached the end of the chapter, she looked at Harry once more.</p><p>He was asleep.</p><p>His chest rose and fell in an even rhythm, his long lashes fanned against his skin. One hand was palm down against his chest, while the other lay half open at his side, the strong fingers partially curled.</p><p>\u201cNever fails,\u201d Poppy murmured with a private grin. Her talent at putting people to sleep was too much even for Harry\u2019s relentless drive. Carefully she set the book aside.</p><p>This was the first time she\u2019d ever been able to view Harry at her leisure. It was strange to see him so utterly disarmed. In sleep, the lines of his face were relaxed and almost innocent, at odds with his usual expression of command. His mouth, always so purposeful, looked as soft as velvet. He looked like a boy lost in a solitary dream. Poppy felt an urge to safeguard the sleep Harry so badly needed, to cover him with a blanket, and stroke the dark hair from his brow.</p> <p>Several tranquil minutes passed, the silence disturbed only by distant sounds of activity in the hotel and from the street. This was something Poppy had not known she needed . . . time to contemplate the stranger who had taken utter possession of her life.</p><p>Trying to understand Harry Rutledge was like taking apart one of the intricate clockwork mechanisms he had constructed. One could examine every gear and ratchet wheel and lever, but that didn\u2019t mean one would ever comprehend what made it all work.</p><p>It seemed that Harry had spent his life wrestling with the world and trying to bend it to his will. And toward that end he had made a great deal of progress. But he was clearly dissatisfied, unable to enjoy what he had achieved, which made him very different from the other men in Poppy\u2019s life, especially Cam and Merripen.</p><p>Because of their Romany heritage, her brothers-in-law didn\u2019t view the world as something to be conquered, but rather something to roam through freely. And then there was Leo, who preferred to view life as an objective observer instead of as an active participant.</p><p>Harry was nothing short of a brigand, scheming to conquer everyone and everything in sight. How could such a man ever be restrained? How would he ever find peace?</p><p>Poppy was so lost in the peaceful stillness of the room that she started when she heard a tap at the door. Her nerves jangled unpleasantly. She made no response, wishing the blasted noise would go away. But there it was again.</p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p>Harry awakened with an inarticulate murmur, blinking with the confusion of someone who had been too quickly roused from sleep. \u201cYes?\u201d he said gruffly, struggling to sit up.</p> <p>The door opened, and Jack Valentine entered. He looked apologetic as he saw Harry and Poppy together on the settee. Poppy could barely refrain from scowling, even though he was only doing his job. Valentine came to hand Harry a folded note, murmured a few cryptic words, and left the apartment.</p><p>Harry scanned the note with a bleary glance. Tucking it into his coat pocket, he smiled ruefully at Poppy. \u201cI seem to have nodded off while you were reading.\u201d He stared at her, his eyes warmer than she had ever seen them. \u201cAn interlude,\u201d he murmured for no apparent reason, and a corner of his mouth hitched upward. \u201cI\u2019d like another one soon.\u201d</p><p>And he left while she was still struggling to form a reply.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Only the wealthiest of London ladies possessed their own carriages and horses, as it cost a fortune to maintain such a convenience. Women without their own stables, or those who lived alone, were compelled to \u201cjob\u201d the horses, brougham, and coachman, hiring it all from a livery service or jobmaster whenever they needed to knock about London.</p><p>Harry had insisted that Poppy must have her own carriage and pair, and had sent for a designer from a carriage works to come to the hotel. After consulting with Poppy, the carriage maker was commissioned to build a vehicle specifically to her taste. Poppy was left rather bemused by the process, and even a bit nettled because her insistence on asking the prices of materials had caused a tiff. \u201cYou\u2019re not here to question how much any of this costs,\u201d Harry had told her. \u201cYour only task is to choose what you like.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But in Poppy\u2019s experience, that had always been part of choosing something . . . viewing what was available and then comparing costs until one arrived at something that was neither the most expensive nor the least. Harry, however, seemed to view this approach as an affront, as if she were questioning his ability to provide for her.</p><p>Finally it was decided that the outside would be done in elegant black lacquer, the inside upholstered in green velvet and beige leather with brass bead trim, and the interior paneling would feature decorative paintwork. There would be green silk curtains and venetian blinds in lieu of mahogany shutters . . . morocco leather sleeping cushions . . . decorative welding on the outside steps, plated carriage lamps and matching door handles . . . it had never occurred to Poppy that there would be so much to decide.</p><p>She spent what was left of the afternoon in the kitchen with the chef, Monsieur Broussard, the pastry chef, Mr. Rupert, and Mrs. Pennywhistle. Broussard was involved in the creation of a new dessert . . . or more aptly, trying to re-create a dessert he had remembered from childhood.</p><p>\u201cMy great-aunt Albertine always made this with no recipe,\u201d Broussard explained ruefully as he pulled a bain-marie, or water bath, from the oven. Nestled inside were a half dozen perfect little steaming apple puddings. \u201cI watched her every time. But it has all slipped from my mind. Fifteen times I have tried it, and still it\u2019s not perfect . . . but quand on veut, on peut.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen one wants, one can,\u201d Poppy translated.</p><p>\u201cExactement.\u201d Broussard carefully removed the dishes from the hot water.</p><p>Chef Rupert drizzled cream sauce over each pudding, and topped them with delicate pastry leaves. \u201cShall we?\u201d he asked, handing out spoons.</p><p>Solemnly, Poppy, Mrs. Pennywhistle, and the two chefs each took a pudding and sampled it. Poppy\u2019s mouth was filled with cream, soft tart apple, and crisply imploding pastry. She closed her eyes to better enjoy the textures and flavors, and she heard satisfied sighs from Mrs. Pennywhistle and Chef Rupert.</p><p>\u201cStill not right,\u201d Monsieur Broussard fretted, scowling at the dish of pudding as if it were deliberately being obstinate.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s not right,\u201d the housekeeper said. \u201cThat is the best thing I\u2019ve ever tasted in my life.\u201d She turned to Poppy. \u201cDon\u2019t you agree, Mrs. Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s what angels must eat in heaven,\u201d Poppy said, digging into the pudding. Chef Rupert had already shoved another spoonful into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a touch more lemon and cinnamon . . .\u201d Monsieur Broussard mused.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>Poppy twisted to see who had spoken her name. Her smile dimmed as she saw Jake Valentine entering the kitchen. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t like him. In fact, Valentine had been very personable and kind. However, he seemed to have been appointed as a watchdog, enforcing Harry\u2019s mandate that Poppy should refrain from keeping company with the employees.</p><p>Mr. Valentine looked no happier than Poppy as he spoke. \u201cMrs. Rutledge, I\u2019ve been sent to remind you that you have an appointment at the dressmaker\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do? Now?\u201d Poppy looked at him blankly. \u201cI don\u2019t remember making an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was made for you. At Mr. Rutledge\u2019s request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Reluctantly Poppy set down her spoon. \u201cWhen must I leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a quarter hour.\u201d</p><p>That would give her just enough time to tidy her hair and fetch a walking cloak. \u201cI have enough clothes,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI don\u2019t need more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lady in your position,\u201d Mrs. Pennywhistle said wisely, \u201cneeds many dresses. I\u2019ve heard it said that fashionable ladies never wear the same frock twice.\u201d</p><p>Poppy rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that as well. And I think it\u2019s ridiculous. Why should it matter if a lady is seen in the same frock twice? Except to provide evidence that her husband is wealthy enough to buy her more clothes than a person needs.\u201d</p><p>The housekeeper smiled sympathetically. \u201cShall I walk with you to your apartments, Mrs. Rutledge?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019ll go along the servants\u2019 hallway. None of the guests will see me.\u201d</p><p>Valentine said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go unescorted.\u201d</p><p>Poppy heaved an impatient sigh. \u201cMr. Valentine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to walk to my apartment by myself. If I can\u2019t even do that, this entire hotel will start to feel like a prison.\u201d</p><p>He nodded with reluctant understanding.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Murmuring good-bye to the chefs and the housekeeper, Poppy left the kitchen.</p><p>Jake Valentine shifted his weight uncomfortably as the other three glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut Mr. Rutledge has decided that his wife shouldn\u2019t fraternize with the employees. He says it makes all of us less productive, and there are more suitable ways for her to occupy herself.\u201d</p><p>Although Mrs. Pennywhistle was usually disinclined to criticize the master, her face grew taut with annoyance. \u201cDoing what?\u201d she asked curtly. \u201cShopping for things she neither needs nor wants? Reading fashion periodicals by herself? Riding in the park with a footman in attendance? No doubt there are many fashion-plate wives who would be more than pleased by such a shallow existence. But that lonely young woman is from a close family, and she is accustomed to a great deal of affection. She needs someone to do things with . . . a companion . . . and she needs a husband.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe has a husband,\u201d Jake protested.</p><p>The housekeeper\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHave you noticed nothing odd about their relationship, Valentine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and it\u2019s not appropriate for us to discuss it.\u201d</p><p>Monsieur Broussard regarded Mrs. Pennywhistle with keen interest. \u201cI\u2019m French,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no problem discussing it.\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Pennywhistle lowered her voice, mindful of the scullery maids who were washing pots in the adjoining room. \u201cThere is some doubt as to whether they\u2019ve had conjugal relations yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow see here\u2014\u201d Jake began, outraged at this violation of his employer\u2019s privacy.</p><p>\u201cHave some of this, mon ami,\u201d Broussard said, shoving a pastry plate at him. As Jake sat and picked up a spoon, the chef gave Mrs. Pennywhistle an encouraging glance. \u201cWhat gives you the impression that he has not yet, er . . . sampled the watercress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatercress?\u201d Jake repeated incredulously.</p><p>\u201cCresson.\u201d Broussard gave him a superior look. \u201cA metaphor. And much nicer than the metaphors you English use for the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never use metaphors,\u201d Jake muttered.</p><p>\u201cBien sur, you have no imagination.\u201d The chef turned back to the housekeeper. \u201cWhy is there doubt about the relations between Monsieur and Madame Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheets,\u201d she said succinctly.</p><p>Jake nearly choked on his pastry. \u201cYou have the housemaids spying on them?\u201d he asked around a mouthful of custard and cream.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d the housekeeper said defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s only that we have vigilant maids who tell me everything. And even if they didn\u2019t, one hardly needs great powers of observation to see that they do not behave like a married couple.\u201d</p><p>The chef looked deeply concerned. \u201cYou think there\u2019s a problem with his carrot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWatercress, carrot\u2014is everything food to you?\u201d Jake demanded.</p><p>The chef shrugged. \u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jake said testily, \u201cthere is a string of Rutledge\u2019s past mistresses who would undoubtedly testify there is nothing wrong with his carrot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlors, he is a virile man . . . she is a beautiful woman . . . why are they not making salad together?\u201d</p><p>Jake paused with the spoon raised halfway to his lips as he recalled the business with the letter from Bayning and the secret meeting between Harry Rutledge and Viscount Andover. \u201cI think,\u201d he said uncomfortably, \u201cthat to win her hand in marriage, Mr. Rutledge may have . . . well, manipulated events to make things turn out the way he wanted. Without taking her feelings into consideration.\u201d</p><p>The other three looked at him blankly.</p><p>Chef Rupert was the first to speak. \u201cBut he does that to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently Mrs. Rutledge doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d Jake muttered.</p> <p>Mrs. Pennywhistle leaned her chin on her hand and tapped her jaw thoughtfully. \u201cI believe she would be a good influence on him, were she ever inclined to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jake said decisively, \u201cwill ever change Harry Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d the housekeeper mused, \u201cI think the two of them may need a bit of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom whom?\u201d Chef Rupert asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom all of us,\u201d the housekeeper replied. \u201cIt\u2019s all to our benefit if the master is happy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jake said firmly. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone more ill equipped for happiness. He wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason he should try it,\u201d Mrs. Pennywhistle declared.</p><p>Jake gave her a warning glance. \u201cWe are not going to meddle in Mr. Rutledge\u2019s personal life. I forbid it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Sitting at her dressing table, Poppy brushed powder on her nose and applied rose-petal salve to her lips. That night she and Harry were to attend a supper given in one of the private dining rooms, a highly formal affair attended by foreign diplomats and government officials to honor the visiting monarch of Prussia, King Frederick William IV. Mrs. Pennywhistle had shown Poppy the menu, and Poppy had remarked wryly that with ten courses, she expected the supper would last half the night.</p><p>Poppy was dressed in her best gown, a violet silk that shimmered with tones of blue and pink as the light moved over it. The unique color had been achieved with a new synthetic dye, and it was so striking that little ornamentation was needed. The bodice was intricately wrapped, leaving the tops of her shoulders bare, and the full, layered skirts rustled softly as she moved.</p><p>Just as she set down the powder brush, Harry came to the doorway and surveyed her leisurely. \u201cNo woman will compare to you tonight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Poppy smiled and murmured her thanks. \u201cYou look very fine,\u201d she said, although \u201cfine\u201d seemed an entirely inadequate word to describe her husband.</p><p>Harry was severely handsome in the formal scheme of black and white, his cravat crisp and snowy, his shoes highly polished. He wore the elegant clothes with unselfconscious ease, so debonair and beguiling that it was easy to forget how calculating he was.</p><p>\u201cIs it time to go downstairs yet?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>Pulling a watch from his pocket, Harry consulted it. \u201cFourteen . . . no, thirteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Her brows lifted as she saw how battered and scratched the watch was. \u201cMy goodness. You must have carried that for a long time.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated before showing it to her. Poppy took the object carefully. The watch was small but heavy in her palm, the gold casing warm from his body. Flipping it open, she saw that the scarred and scratched metal had not been inscribed or adorned in any way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Harry tucked the watch into his pocket. His expression was inscrutable. \u201cFrom my father, when I told him I was leaving for London. He said his father had given it to him years before, with the advice that when he became a success, he should celebrate by purchasing a much finer watch. And so my father passed it on to me with the same counsel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never bought one for yourself?\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head.</p><p>A perplexed smile touched her lips. \u201cI would say that you\u2019ve had more than enough success to merit a new watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She thought he must be joking, but there was no humor in his expression. Perturbed and fascinated, Poppy wondered how much more wealth he intended to gain, how much power he wanted to accrue, before he considered it enough.</p><p>Perhaps there was no such thing as \u201cenough\u201d for Harry Rutledge.</p><p>She was distracted from her thoughts as he pulled something from one of his coat pockets, a flat rectangular leather case.</p><p>\u201cA present,\u201d Harry said, giving it to her.</p><p>Her eyes rounded with surprise. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to give me anything. Thank you. I didn\u2019t expect . . . oh.\u201d This last as she opened the case and beheld a diamond necklace arranged on the velvet lining like a pool of glittering fire. It was a heavy garland of sparkling flowers and quatrefoil links.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Harry asked casually.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, it\u2019s . . . breathtaking.\u201d Poppy had never imagined owning such jewelry. The only necklace she possessed was a single pearl on a chain. \u201cShall I . . . shall I wear it tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be appropriate with that gown.\u201d Harry took the necklace from the case, stood behind Poppy, and fastened it gently around her neck. The cold weight of the diamonds and the warm brush of his fingers at her nape elicited a shiver. He remained behind her, his hands settling lightly on the curves of her neck, moving in a warm stroke to the tops of her shoulders. \u201cLovely,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAlthough nothing is as beautiful as your bare skin.\u201d</p><p>Poppy stared into the looking glass, not at her flushed face, but at his hands on her skin. They were both still, watching their shared reflection as if they were two forms encased in ice.</p><p>His hands moved sensitively, as if he were touching a priceless work of art. With the tip of his middle finger, he traced the line of her collarbone to the hollow at the base of her throat.</p><p>Feeling agitated, Poppy pulled away from his hands and stood to face him, coming around the little chair. \u201cThank you,\u201d she managed to say. Cautiously she moved to embrace him, her arms sliding over his shoulders.</p><p>It was more than Poppy had intended to do, but there was something in Harry\u2019s expression that touched her. She had sometimes seen the same expression on Leo\u2019s face in childhood, when he had been caught in mischief and had gone to their mother with a bouquet of flowers or some little treasure.</p><p>Harry\u2019s arms went around her, pulling her farther up against him. He smelled delicious, and he was warm and hard beneath the layers of linen, silk and wool. The soft gust of his breath against her neck was ragged at the finish.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Poppy let herself lean against him. He kissed the side of her throat, working up to the juncture of her neck and jaw. She felt warm from the bottom of her feet to the top of her head. She found something surprising in the embrace, a sense of security. They fit nicely together, softness and hardness, pliancy and tension. It seemed that every curve of her was perfectly reconciled with his masculine contours. She wouldn\u2019t have minded standing against him, with him, for a while longer.</p><p>But Harry chose to take more than had been offered. His hand went to the side of her head, easing her back at just the right angle to kiss her. His mouth descended swiftly. Poppy arched and twisted away from him, nearly causing an awkward collision of their heads.</p><p>She turned to face him, refusal stamped on her expression.</p><p>The evasion seemed to have stunned Harry. Sparks of wrath kindled in his eyes, as if she had been vastly unfair. \u201cIt seems the ban on virginal theatrics has been lifted.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy replied with stilted dignity. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s theatrical to pull away when I don\u2019t want to be kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA diamond necklace for one kiss. Is that such a bad bargain?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks went scarlet. \u201cI appreciate your generosity. But you\u2019re wrong to think that you can buy or bargain for my favors. I\u2019m not a mistress, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously. Because in return for such a necklace, a mistress would go to that bed, lie there willingly and offer to do whatever I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never denied you your marital rights,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you wish, I\u2019ll go to that bed willingly and do whatever you want, this very moment. But not because you gave me a necklace, as if it were part of some transaction.\u201d</p><p>Far from being appeased, Harry regarded her with gathering outrage. \u201cThe thought of you laid out like a martyr on the sacrificial altar is not what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it enough that I\u2019m willing to submit to you?\u201d Poppy asked, her own temper flaring. \u201cWhy must I be eager to lie with you, when you\u2019re not the husband I wanted?\u201d</p><p>The very second the words left her lips, Poppy regretted them. But it was too late. Harry\u2019s eyes turned to ice. His lips parted, and she braced herself, knowing he was about to say something decimating.</p><p>Instead, he turned and walked from the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Submit.</p><p>The word hovered, wasplike, in Harry\u2019s mind. Stinging repeatedly.</p><p>Submit to him . . . as if he were some loathsome toad, when some of the most beautiful women in London had begged for his attentions. Sensuous, accomplished women with clever mouths and hands, willing to satisfy his most exotic desires . . . in fact, he could have one of them tonight.</p><p>When his temper had eased enough that he could function normally, Harry went back into Poppy\u2019s bedroom and informed her that it was time to go down to supper. She sent him a wary glance, seeming to want to say something, but she had the sense to keep her mouth shut.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the husband I wanted.\u201d</p><p>And he never would be. No amount of scheming or manipulation could change it.</p><p>But Harry would continue to play out his hand. Poppy was legally his, and God knew he had money on his side. Time would have to take care of the rest.</p><p>The formal dinner was a great success. Every time Harry glanced at the other end of the long table, he saw that Poppy was acquitting herself splendidly. She was relaxed and smiling, taking part in conversation, appearing to charm her companions. It was exactly as Harry had expected: the same qualities that were considered faults in an unmarried girl were admired in a married woman. Poppy\u2019s acute observations and her enjoyment of lively debate made her far more interesting than a demure society miss with a modest downcast gaze.</p><p>She was breathtaking in the violet gown, her slender neck encircled with diamonds, her hair rich with dark fire. Nature had blessed her with abundant beauty. But it was her smile that made her irresistible, a smile so sweet and brilliant that it warmed him from the inside out.</p> <p>Harry wished she would smile at him like that. She had, in the beginning. There had to be something that would induce her to warm to him, to like him again. Everyone had a weakness.</p><p>In the meantime, Harry stole glances of her whenever he could, his lovely and distant wife . . . and he drank in the smiles she gave to other people.</p><p>The next morning Harry awoke at his usual hour. He washed and dressed, sat at the breakfast table with a newspaper, and glanced at Poppy\u2019s door. There was no sign of her. He assumed she would sleep late, since they had retired long after midnight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wake Mrs. Rutledge,\u201d he told the maid. \u201cShe needs to rest this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Harry ate his breakfast alone, trying to focus on the newspaper, but his gaze kept dragging to Poppy\u2019s closed door.</p> <p>He had gotten used to seeing her every morning. He liked to start his day with her. But Harry was aware that he had been nothing less than boorish the previous night, giving her jewelry and demanding a demonstration of gratitude. He should have known better.</p><p>It was just that he wanted her so damned badly. And he had become accustomed to having his way, especially where women were concerned. He reflected that it probably wouldn\u2019t hurt him to learn to consider someone else\u2019s feelings.</p><p>Especially if that would hasten the process of getting what he wanted.</p><p>After receiving the morning managers\u2019 reports from Jake Valentine, Harry went with him to the basement of the hotel to assess the damage from some minor flooding due to faulty drainage. \u201cWe\u2019ll need an engineering assessment,\u201d Harry said, \u201cAnd I want an inventory of the damaged storage items.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Valentine replied. \u201cUnfortunately there were some rolled-up Turkish carpets in the flooded area, but I don\u2019t know if the staining\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Rutledge!\u201d An agitated housemaid descended to the bottom of the stairs and rushed over to them. She could barely speak between labored breaths. \u201cMrs. Pennywhistle said . . . to come fetch you because . . . Mrs. Rutledge . . .\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at the housemaid sharply. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s injured, sir . . . took a fall . . .\u201d</p> <p>Alarm shot through him. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour apartments, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend for a doctor,\u201d Harry told Valentine, and he ran for the stairs, taking them two and three at a time. By the time he reached his apartments, full-scale panic roared through him. He tried to push it back enough to think clearly. There was a congregation of maids around the door, and he shouldered his way through them into the main room. \u201cPoppy?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Pennywhistle\u2019s voice echoed from the tiled bathing room. \u201cWe\u2019re in here, Mr. Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>Harry reached the bathing room in three strides, his stomach lurching in fear as he saw Poppy on the floor, reclining against the housekeeper\u2019s supportive arms. Toweling had been draped over her for modesty\u2019s sake, but her limbs were na**d and vulnerable looking in contrast to the hard gray tiling.</p><p>Harry dropped to his haunches beside her. \u201cWhat happened, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She looked pained and mortified and apologetic. \u201cIt was so silly. I stepped out of the bath and slipped on the tiles, and my leg went out from beneath me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank heavens one of the maids had come to clear the breakfast dishes,\u201d Mrs. Pennywhistle told him, \u201cand she heard Mrs. Rutledge cry out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI just twisted my ankle a bit.\u201d She gave the housekeeper a gently chiding glance. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of getting up, but Mrs. Pennywhistle won\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid to move her,\u201d the housekeeper told Harry.</p><p>\u201cYou were right to keep her still,\u201d Harry replied, examining Poppy\u2019s leg. The ankle was discolored and already beginning to swell. Even the light brush of his fingers was enough to make her flinch and inhale quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need a doctor,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cIf you could just wrap it with a light binding, and perhaps I could have some willow bark tea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re seeing a doctor,\u201d Harry said, suffused with grim concern. Glancing at Poppy\u2019s face, he saw the residue of tears, and he reached out to her with extreme gentleness, his fingers caressing the side of her face. Her skin was as smooth as fine-milled soap. There was a red mark in the center of her lower lip, where she must have bitten it.</p><p>Whatever she saw in his expression caused her eyes to widen and her cheeks to flush.</p><p>Mrs. Pennywhistle eased up from the floor. \u201cWell,\u201d she said briskly, \u201cNow that she\u2019s in your care, Mr. Rutledge, shall I fetch some bandages and salve? We may as well treat the ankle until the doctor arrives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said curtly. \u201cAnd send for another doctor\u2014I want a second opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The housekeeper fled.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten a first opinion yet,\u201d Poppy protested. \u201cAnd you\u2019re making far too much of this. It\u2019s just a minor sprain, and . . . what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Harry had laid two fingers on the top of her foot, two inches below the ankle, feeling for her pulse. \u201cMaking certain your circulation hasn\u2019t been compromised.\u201d</p><p>Poppy rolled her eyes. \u201cMy goodness. All I need is to sit somewhere with my foot up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to carry you to bed,\u201d he said, sliding one arm behind her back, the other beneath her knees. \u201cCan you put your arms around my neck?\u201d</p><p>She blushed from head to toe, and complied with an inarticulate murmur. He lifted her in a slow, easy movement. Poppy fumbled a little as the toweling began to slip from her body, and she gasped in pain.</p><p>\u201cDid I jostle your leg?\u201d Harry asked in concern.</p><p>\u201cNo. I think . . .\u201d She sounded sheepish. \u201cI think I may have hurt my back a little as well.\u201d</p><p>Harry let out a few quiet curses that caused her brows to raise, and he carried her into the bedroom. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he told her sternly, \u201cyou\u2019re not to step out of the bathing tub unless there\u2019s someone to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d she protested.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help with my bath every night. I\u2019m not a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d Harry said, \u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d He set her down gently and arranged the covers over her. After easing the damp towel away from her, he adjusted her pillows. \u201cWhere are your nightgowns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bottom dresser drawer.\u201d</p><p>Harry went to the dresser, jerked the drawer open, and pulled out a white gown. Returning to the bed, he helped Poppy into the nightgown, his face tautening with concern as she winced with every movement. She needed something for the pain. She needed a doctor.</p><p>Why the hell was it so quiet in the apartment? He wanted people running, fetching things. He wanted action.</p><p>After tucking the covers around Poppy, he left the room in rapid strides.</p><p>Three maids were still in the hallway, talking amongst themselves. Harry scowled, and the maids blanched simultaneously.</p> <p>\u201cS-sir?\u201d one of them asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you all standing here?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAnd where is Mrs. Pennywhistle? I want one of you to find her immediately, and tell her to hurry! And I want the other two of you to start fetching things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of things, sir?\u201d one of them quavered.</p><p>\u201cThings for Mrs. Rutledge. A hot water bottle. Ice. Laudanum. A pot of tea. A book. I don\u2019t give a damn, just start bringing things!\u201d</p><p>The two maids scampered away like terrified squirrels.</p><p>A half minute passed, and still no one appeared.</p><p>Where the devil was the doctor? Why was everyone so bloody slow?</p><p>He heard Poppy calling for him, and he turned on his heels and raced back into the apartments. He was at her bedside in an instant.</p><p>Poppy was huddled in a small, motionless heap.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d her voice came from beneath the bedclothes, \u201care you yelling at people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said instantly.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because this is not a serious situation, and it certainly doesn\u2019t merit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s serious to me.\u201d</p><p>Poppy pushed the covers away from her strained face and looked at him as if he were someone she had met before but couldn\u2019t quite place. A faint smile touched her lips. Tentatively her hand crept to Harry\u2019s, her small fingers curving around his palm.</p><p>That simple clasp did something strange to Harry\u2019s heartbeat. His pulse drove in erratic surges, and his chest turned hot with some unknown emotion. He took her entire hand in his, their palms gently pressing. He wanted to hold her in his arms, not in passion, but to give comfort. Even though his embrace was the last thing she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a moment,\u201d he said, striding from the room. He rushed to a sideboard in his private library, poured a small glass of French brandy, and brought it back to Poppy. \u201cTry this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandy.\u201d</p><p>She tried to sit up, wincing with every movement. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it. Just drink it.\u201d Harry tried to help her, feeling unaccountably awkward . . . he, who had always navigated his way around the female form with absolute confidence. Carefully he wedged another pillow behind her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sipped the brandy and made a face. \u201cUgh.\u201d</p><p>Had Harry not been so worried, he might have found some amusement in her reaction to the brandy, a heritage vintage that had been aged at least a hundred years. As she continued to sip the brandy, Harry pulled a chair beside the bed.</p><p>By the time Poppy had finished the brandy, some of the fine-grooved tension had gone from her face. \u201cThat actually helped a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cMy ankle still hurts, but I don\u2019t think I care as much.\u201d</p><p>Harry took the glass from her and set it aside. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWould you mind if I left you again momentarily?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re only going to yell at the staff again, and they\u2019re already doing their best. Stay with me.\u201d She reached for his hand.</p><p>That mystifying feeling again . . . the sense of puzzle pieces fitting together. Such an innocent connection, one hand in another, and yet it was enormously satisfying.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d The soft way she said his name caused the hair to rise pleasurably on his arms and the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYes, love?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cWould you . . . would you mind rubbing my back?\u201d</p> <p>Harry fought to conceal his reaction. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, striving to keep his tone casual. \u201cCan you turn to your side?\u201d Reaching for her lower back, he found the little reefs of muscle on either side of her spine. Poppy pushed the pillows aside and lay flat on her stomach. He worked up to her upper shoulders, finding the knotted muscles.</p><p>A soft groan escaped her, and Harry paused.</p><p>\u201cYes, there,\u201d she said, and the full-throated pleasure in her voice went straight to Harry\u2019s groin. He continued to knead her back, his fingers coaxing and sure. Poppy sighed deeply. \u201cI\u2019m keeping you from your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always have at least ten things planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s more important than you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou almost sound sincere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sincere. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your work is more important to you than anything, even people.\u201d</p><p>Annoyed, Harry held his tongue and continued to massage her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Poppy said after a minute. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. I don\u2019t know why I said it.\u201d</p><p>The words were an instant balm to Harry\u2019s anger. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting. And you\u2019re tipsy. It\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Pennywhistle\u2019s voice came from the threshold. \u201cHere we are. Hopefully this will suffice until the doctor arrives.\u201d She brought a tray laden with supplies, including rolled linen bandages, a pot of salve, and two or three large green leaves.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these for?\u201d Harry asked, picking up one of the leaves. He gave the housekeeper a questioning glance. \u201cCabbage?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very effective remedy,\u201d the housekeeper explained. \u201cIt reduces swelling and makes bruises disappear. Only make certain to break the spine of the leaf and crush it a bit, then wrap it around the ankle before you tie the bandage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to smell like cabbage,\u201d Poppy protested.</p><p>Harry gave her a severe glance. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what it smells like, if it will make you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not the one who has to wear a vegetable leaf on your leg!\u201d</p><p>But he had his way, of course, and Poppy reluctantly endured the poultice.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Harry said, tying off a neat bandage around it. He drew the hem of Poppy\u2019s nightgown back over her knee. \u201cMrs. Pennywhistle, if you wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll see if the doctor\u2019s arrived,\u201d the housekeeper said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have a brief talk with the housemaids. For some reason they\u2019re piling the strangest assortment of objects near the doorway . . .\u201d</p><p>The doctor had indeed arrived. Stoic soul that he was, he ignored Harry\u2019s muttered comment that he hoped the doctor didn\u2019t always take so long when there was a medical emergency, or half his patients would probably expire before he ever crossed the threshold.</p><p>After examining Poppy\u2019s ankle, the doctor diagnosed a light sprain, and he prescribed cold compresses for the swelling. He left a bottle of tonic for the pain, a pot of liniment for the pulled muscle in her shoulder, and advised that above all Mrs. Rutledge must rest.</p><p>Were it not for her discomfort, Poppy would have actually enjoyed the rest of the day. Apparently Harry had decided that she should be waited on hand and foot. Chef Broussard sent up a tray of pastry, fresh fruit, and creamed eggs. Mrs. Pennywhistle brought a selection of cushions to make her more comfortable. Harry had dispatched a footman to the book-shop, and the servant had returned with an armload of new publications.</p><p>Soon thereafter, a maid brought Poppy a tray of neat boxes tied with ribbons. Opening them, Poppy discovered that one was filled with toffee, another with boiled sweets, and another with Turkish delight. Best of all, one box was filled with a new confection called \u201ceating-chocolates\u201d that had been all the rage at the London Exhibition.</p><p>\u201cWhere did these come from?\u201d Poppy asked Harry when he returned to her room after a brief visit to the front offices.</p><p>\u201cFrom the sweet shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, these.\u201d Poppy showed him the eating-chocolates. \u201cNo one can get them. The makers, Fellows and Son, have closed their shop while they move to a new location. The ladies at the philanthropic luncheon were talking about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI sent Valentine to the Fellows residence to ask them to make a special batch for you.\u201d Harry smiled as he saw the paper twists scattered across the counterpane. \u201cI see you\u2019ve sampled them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave one,\u201d Poppy said generously.</p><p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like sweets.\u201d But he bent down obligingly as she gestured for him to come closer. She reached out to him, her fingers catching the knot of his necktie.</p><p>Harry\u2019s smile faded as Poppy exerted gentle tension, drawing him down. He was suspended over her, an impending weight of muscle and masculine drive. As her sugared breath blew against his lips, she sensed the deep tremor within him. And she was aware of a new equilibrium between them, a balance of will and curiosity. Harry held still, letting her do as she wished.</p> <p>She tugged him closer until her mouth brushed his. The contact was brief but vital, striking a glow of heat.</p><p>Poppy released him carefully, and Harry drew back.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t kiss me for diamonds,\u201d he said, his voice slightly raspy, \u201cbut you will for chocolates?\u201d</p><p>Poppy nodded.</p><p>As Harry turned his face away, she saw his cheek tauten with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll put in a daily order, then.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Accustomed as Harry was to arranging everyone\u2019s schedule, he seemed to take it for granted that Poppy would allow him to do the same for her. When she told him that she preferred to make her own decisions about planning her days, Harry had countered that if she insisted on socializing with the hotel employees, he would find better uses for her time.</p><p>\u201cI like to spend time with them,\u201d Poppy protested. \u201cI can\u2019t treat everyone who lives and works here as nothing more than cogs in a machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hotel has been run this way for years,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change. As I\u2019ve told you before, you\u2019ll create a management problem. From now on, no more visiting the kitchens. No more chats with the master gardener while he prunes the roses. No cups of tea with the housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>Poppy frowned. \u201cDoes it ever occur to you that your employees are people with thoughts and feelings? Have you thought to ask Mrs. Pennywhistle if her hand injury has healed?\u201d</p><p>Harry frowned. \u201cHand injury?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, she accidentally closed her fingers in the door. And when was the last time Mr. Valentine went on holiday?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s expression went blank.</p><p>\u201cThree years,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cEven the housemaids go on holiday to see their families, or go to the country. But Mr. Valentine is so devoted to his job that he forgoes all his personal time. And you\u2019ve probably never offered a word of praise or thanks for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pay him a salary,\u201d Harry said indignantly. \u201cWhy the devil are you so interested in the personal lives of the hotel staff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t live with people and see them day to day and not care about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can bloody well start with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to care about you?\u201d Her incredulous tone seemed to exasperate him.</p><p>\u201cI want you to behave like a wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen stop trying to control me as you do everyone else. You\u2019ve allowed me no choice in anything\u2014not even the choice of whether or not to marry you in the first place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s the heart of the matter,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never stop trying to punish me for taking you away from Michael Bayning. Has it occurred to you that it wasn\u2019t nearly as great a loss to him as it was to you?\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s found consolation from any number of women since the wedding. He\u2019s fast becoming known as the biggest whoremonger in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Poppy said, turning ashen. It wasn\u2019t possible. She couldn\u2019t conceive of Michael\u2014her Michael\u2014behaving in such a way.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over London,\u201d Harry said ruthlessly. \u201cHe drinks, gambles, and squanders money. And the devil knows how many bawdy-house diseases he\u2019s caught by now. It might console you that the viscount is probably regretting his decision to forbid the match between you and his son. At this rate, Bayning won\u2019t live long enough to inherit the title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk your brother. You should thank me. Because as much as you despise me, I\u2019m a better bargain than Michael Bayning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should thank you?\u201d Poppy asked thickly. \u201cAfter what you\u2019ve done to Michael?\u201d A dazed smile crossed her lips, and she shook her head. She put her hands to her temples, as if to stave off an encroaching headache. \u201cI need to see him. I must speak to him\u2014\u201d She broke off as he seized her arms in a harsh grip that was just short of painful.</p><p>\u201cTry,\u201d Harry said softly, \u201cand you\u2019ll both regret it.\u201d</p><p>Shoving his hands away, Poppy stared at his hard features and thought, this is the man I\u2019m married to.</p><p>Unable to endure one more minute of proximity to his wife, Harry left for the fencing club. He was going find someone, anyone, who wanted to practice, and he was going to fight until his muscles were sore and his frustration was spent. He was sick with need, half mad with it. But he didn\u2019t want Poppy to accept him out of duty. He wanted her willing. He wanted her warm and welcoming, the way she would have been with Michael Bayning. Harry would be damned if he\u2019d take anything less. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There had never been a woman he\u2019d wanted and hadn\u2019t gotten, until now. Why did his skills fail him when it came to seducing his own wife? It was becoming clear that as his craving for Poppy increased, his ability to charm her was decreasing at a proportionate rate.</p><p>The one brief kiss she\u2019d given him had been more pleasurable than entire nights Harry had spent with other women. He could try to ease his needs with someone else, but that wouldn\u2019t begin to satisfy him. He wanted something that only Poppy seemed able to provide.</p><p>Harry spent two hours at the club, dueling at lightning speed, until the fencing master had flatly refused to allow anymore. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished,\u201d Harry said, tearing off his mask, his chest heaving with the force of his breaths.</p> <p>\u201cI say you are.\u201d Approaching him, the fencing master said quietly, \u201cYou\u2019re relying on brute force instead of using your head. Fencing requires precision and control, and this evening you\u2019re lacking both.\u201d</p><p>Offended, Harry schooled his features and said calmly, \u201cGive me another chance. I\u2019ll prove you wrong.\u201d</p><p>The fencing master shook his head. \u201cIf I let you go on, there is every chance of an accident occurring. Go home, friend. Rest. You look tired.\u201d</p><p>The hour was late by the time Harry returned to the hotel. Still clad in fencing whites, he went into the hotel through the back entrance. Before he could ascend the stairs to his apartments, he was met by Jake Valentine.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Rutledge. How was your fencing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot worth discussing,\u201d Harry said shortly. His eyes narrowed as he saw the tension in his assistant\u2019s manner. \u201cIs there anything the matter, Valentine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA maintenance issue, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe carpenter was repairing a section of flooring that happens to be located directly above Mrs. Rutledge\u2019s room. You see, the last guest who stayed there complained of a creaking board, and so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my wife all right?\u201d Harry interrupted.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, sir. Beg pardon, I didn\u2019t mean to worry you. Mrs. Rutledge is quite well. But unfortunately the carpenter struck a nail into a plumbing pipe, and there was a significant leak in the ceiling of Mrs. Rutledge\u2019s room. We had to take out a section of the ceiling to reach the pipe and stop the flooding. The bed and carpet are ruined, I\u2019m afraid. And the room is uninhabitable at present.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Harry muttered, running a hand through his sweat-dampened hair. \u201cHow long until the repairs are done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe estimate two to three days. The noise will undoubtedly be a problem for some of the guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize on behalf of the hotel and cut their room rates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>With annoyance, Harry realized that Poppy would have to stay in his bedroom. Which meant that he would have to find another place to sleep. \u201cI\u2019ll stay in a guest suite for the time being,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich ones are empty?\u201d</p><p>Valentine\u2019s face was expressionless. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re at full occupancy tonight, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t one room available? In this entire hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p> <p>Harry scowled. \u201cSet up a spare bed in my apartments, then.\u201d</p><p>Now the valet looked apologetic. \u201cI\u2019ve already thought of that, sir. But we have no spare beds. Three have been requested and set up in guest suites, and the other two were loaned to Brown\u2019s Hotel earlier in the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did we do that?\u201d Harry demanded incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYou told me that if Mr. Brown ever asked a favor, I should oblige him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do too many damned favors for people!\u201d Harry snapped.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Rapidly Harry considered his alternatives . . . he could check into another hotel, he could prevail on a friend to allow him to stay overnight . . . but as he glanced at Valentine\u2019s implacable face, he knew how that would appear. And he\u2019d go hang before he gave anyone reason to speculate he wasn\u2019t sleeping with his own wife. With a mumbled curse, he brushed by the valet and headed up the private staircase, his overworked leg muscles aching in vicious protest.</p><p>The apartment was ominously silent. Was Poppy asleep? No . . . a lamp had been lit in his room. His heart began to thud heavily as he followed the soft spill of light through the hallway. Reaching the doorway of his room, he looked inside.</p><p>Poppy was in his bed, an open book in her lap.</p><p>Harry filled his gaze with her, taking in the demure white nightgown, the frills of lace on her sleeves, the rope of shiny braided hair trailing over one shoulder. Her cheeks were stained with a high flush. She looked soft and sweet and clean, her knees drawn up beneath the covers.</p><p>Violent desire surged through him. Harry was afraid to move, afraid he might actually leap on her with no thought given to her virginal sensibilities. Appalled by the extent of his own need, Harry fought to restrain it. He tore his gaze away and stared hard at the floor, willing himself back into control.</p><p>\u201cMy bedroom was damaged.\u201d he heard Poppy say awkwardly. \u201cThe ceiling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d His voice was low and rough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to inconvenience you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Harry brought himself to look at her again. A mistake. She was so pretty, so vulnerable, her slender throat rippling with a visible swallow. He wanted to ravish her. His body felt thick and hot with arousal, a merciless pulse pounding all through him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs there somewhere else you can sleep?\u201d she asked with difficulty.</p><p>Harry shook his head. \u201cThe hotel is fully occupied,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>She looked down at the book in her lap, remaining silent.</p><p>And Harry, who had never been less than perfectly articulate, grappled with words as if they were a wall of bricks tumbling over him. \u201cPoppy . . . sooner or later . . . you\u2019re going to have to let me . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she murmured, her head bent.</p><p>Harry\u2019s sanity began to dissolve in a rush of heat. He was going to take her, now, here. But as he started for her, he saw how tightly Poppy was gripping the book, the tips of her fingers white. She wouldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>She did not want him.</p><p>Why that mattered, he had no bloody idea.</p><p>But it did.</p> <p>Bloody hell.</p><p>Somehow, with all his force of will, Harry mustered a cool tone. \u201cSome other time, perhaps. I don\u2019t have the patience to tutor you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the bedroom, he went to the bathing room, to wash and douse himself with cold water. Repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Chef Broussard asked as Jake Valentine entered the kitchen the next morning.</p><p>Mrs. Pennywhistle and Chef Rupert, who were standing by the long table, looked at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI told you it was a bad idea,\u201d Jake said, glaring at the three of them. Sitting on a tall stool, he grabbed a warm croissant from a platter of pastries, and shoved half of it into his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work?\u201d the housekeeper asked gingerly.</p><p>Jake shook his head, swallowing the croissant and gesturing for a cup of tea. Mrs. Pennywhistle poured a cup, dropped in a lump of sugar, and gave it to him.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I could tell,\u201d Jake growled, \u201cRutledge spent the night on the settee. I\u2019ve never seen him in such a foul mood. He nearly took my head off when I brought him the managers\u2019 reports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Mrs. Pennywhistle murmured.</p><p>Broussard shook his head in disbelief. \u201cWhat is the matter with you British?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not British, he was born in America,\u201d Jake snapped.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Broussard said, recalling the indelicate fact. \u201cAmericans and romance. It\u2019s like watching a bird try to fly with one wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will we do now?\u201d Chef Rupert asked in concern.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jake said. \u201cNot only has our meddling not helped, it\u2019s made the situation worse. They\u2019re scarcely speaking to each other.\u201d</p><p>Poppy went through the day in a state of gloom, unable to stop worrying about Michael, knowing there was nothing she could do for him. Although his unhappiness was not her fault\u2014and given the same choices, she wouldn\u2019t change anything she\u2019d done\u2014Poppy felt responsible all the same, as if by marrying Harry, she had assumed a portion of his guilt.</p><p>Except that Harry was incapable of feeling guilty about anything.</p><p>Poppy thought it would make things far less complicated if she could simply bring herself to hate Harry. But in spite of his innumerable flaws, something about him touched her, even now. His determined solitude . . . his refusal to make emotional connections to the people around him, or even to think of the hotel as his home . . . these things were alien to Poppy.</p><p>How in heaven\u2019s name, when all she had ever wanted was someone to share affection and intimacy with, had she ended up with a man who was capable of neither? All Harry wanted was the use of her body, and the illusion of a marriage.</p><p>Well, she had much more to give than that. And he would have to take all of her or nothing.</p><p>In the evening, Harry came to the apartments to have dinner with Poppy. He informed her that, after the meal was concluded, he was going to meet with visitors in their apartment library room.</p><p>\u201cA meeting with whom?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone from the War Office. Sir Gerald Hubert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask what it is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Staring into his inscrutable features, Poppy felt a chill of unease. \u201cAm I to play hostess?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>The evening was cold and wet, rain striking in heavy sheets against the roof and windows, and washing the filth from the streets in muddy streams. The stilted dinner concluded, and a pair of maids cleared away the dishes and brought tea.</p><p>Stirring a spoonful of sugar into the dark liquid, Poppy stared at Harry thoughtfully. \u201cWhat rank is Sir Gerald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssistant adjutant general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he in charge of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinancial administration, personnel management, provost services. He\u2019s pushing for reforms to increase the army\u2019s strength. Badly needed reforms, in light of the tensions between the Russians and the Turks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf a war starts, will Britain be drawn into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost certainly. But it\u2019s possible that diplomacy will resolve the issue before it comes to war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible but not likely?\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled cynically. \u201cWar is always more profitable than diplomacy.\u201d</p><p>Poppy sipped her tea. \u201cMy brother-in-law Cam told me that you improved the design of the standard army rifle. And now the War Office is indebted to you.\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head to indicate that it had been nothing. \u201cI scratched out a few ideas when the subject came up at a supper party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously the ideas turned out to be very effective,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cAs most of your ideas are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry turned a glass of port idly in his hands. His gaze lifted to hers. \u201cAre you trying to ask something, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Yes. It seems likely that Sir Gerald will want to discuss weaponry with you, won\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly. He is bringing Mr. Edward Kinloch, who owns an arms manufactory.\u201d Seeing her expression, Harry gave her a quizzical glance. \u201cYou don\u2019t approve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think a brain as clever as yours should be put to better use than coming up with more efficient ways to kill people.\u201d</p> <p>Before Harry could reply, there came a knock at the door, and the visitors were announced.</p><p>Harry stood and helped Poppy rise from her chair, and she went with him to welcome his guests.</p><p>Sir Gerald was a large and stocky man, his florid face supported by a scaffolding of thick white whiskers. He wore a silver gray military coat trimmed with regimental buttons. The scent of tobacco smoke and heavy cologne wafted from him with each movement.</p><p>\u201cAn honor, Mrs. Rutledge,\u201d he said with a bow. \u201cI see the reports of your beauty are not at all exaggerated.\u201d</p><p>Poppy forced a smile. \u201cThank you, Sir Gerald.\u201d</p> <p>Harry, standing beside her, introduced the other man. \u201cMr. Edward Kinloch.\u201d</p><p>Kinloch bowed impatiently. Clearly, meeting Harry Rutledge\u2019s wife was an unwelcome distraction. He wanted to get about the business at hand. Everything about him, the narrow, dark suit of clothes, the ungenerous tightness of his smile, the guarded eyes, even the flat hair subjugated by a gleaming layer of pomade, spoke of rigid containment. \u201cMadam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome, gentlemen,\u201d Poppy murmured. \u201cI will leave you to your discussion. May I send for refreshments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you\u2014\u201d Sir Gerald began, but Kinloch interrupted.</p><p>\u201cThat is very gracious of you, Mrs. Rutledge, but it won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>Sir Gerald\u2019s jowls drooped in disappointment.</p> <p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Poppy said pleasantly. \u201cI will take my leave. I bid you good evening.\u201d</p><p>Harry showed the visitors to his library, while Poppy stared after them. She didn\u2019t like her husband\u2019s visitors, and she especially didn\u2019t like the subject they intended to discuss. Most of all, she loathed the idea of her husband\u2019s diabolical cleverness being applied to improve the art of war.</p><p>Retreating to Harry\u2019s bedroom, Poppy tried to read, but her mind kept returning to the conversation that was taking place in the library. Finally, she gave up the attempt and set the book aside.</p><p>She argued silently with herself. Eavesdropping was wrong. But really, in the spectrum of sin, how bad was it? What if one eavesdropped for a good reason? What if there was a beneficial result of the eavesdropping, such as preventing another person from making a mistake? Furthermore, wasn\u2019t it her duty as Harry\u2019s wife to be his helpmate whenever possible?</p><p>Yes, he might need her advice. And certainly the best way to be helpful was to find out what he was discussing with his guests.</p><p>Poppy tiptoed across the apartment to the library door, which had been left slightly ajar. Keeping herself tucked out of sight, she listened.</p><p>\u201c. . . you can feel the recoil power in the kick of the gun against your shoulder,\u201d Harry was saying in a matter-of-fact tone. \u201cThere might be a way to turn that to practical effect, using the recoil to draw in another bullet. Or better yet, I could devise a metallic casing that contains powder, bullet, and primer all in one. The recoil force would automatically eject the casing and draw in another, so the weapon could fire repeatedly. And it would have far more power and precision than any firearm yet developed.\u201d</p><p>His statements were met with silence. Poppy guessed that Kinloch and Sir Gerald, like herself, were struggling to take in what Harry had just described.</p> <p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Kinloch finally said, sounding breathless. \u201cThat is so far beyond anything we . . . that is leaps ahead of what I\u2019m currently manufacturing . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it be done?\u201d Sir Gerald asked tersely. \u201cBecause if so, it would give us an advantage over every army in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil they copy it,\u201d Harry said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Sir Gerald continued, \u201cin the time it would take them to reproduce our technology, we will have expanded the Empire . . . consolidated it so firmly . . . that our supremacy would be unchallenged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t go unchallenged for long. As Benjamin Franklin once said, empire is like a great cake\u2014most easily diminished around the edges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do Americans know about empire building?\u201d Sir Gerald asked with a scornful snort.</p><p>\u201cI should remind you,\u201d Harry murmured, \u201cthat I\u2019m American by birth.\u201d</p><p>Another silence.</p><p>\u201cWith whom do your loyalties lie?\u201d Sir Gerald asked.</p><p>\u201cWith no country in particular,\u201d Harry replied. \u201cDoes that pose a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019ll give us the rights to the weapon design. And license it exclusively to Kinloch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRutledge,\u201d came Kinloch\u2019s hard, eager voice, \u201chow long would it take for you to develop these ideas and create a prototype?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Harry sounded amused by the other men\u2019s fervor. \u201cWhen I have spare time, I\u2019ll work on it. But I can\u2019t promise you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare time?\u201d Now Kinloch was indignant. \u201cA fortune rests on this, not to mention the future of the Empire. By God, if I had your abilities, I wouldn\u2019t rest until I had brought this idea to fruition!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy felt ill as she heard the na**d greed in his voice. Kinloch wanted profits. Sir Gerald wanted power.</p><p>And if Harry obliged them . . .</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear to listen any longer. As the men continued to talk, she slipped away silently.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p> <p>After bidding farewell to Sir Gerald and Edward Kinloch, Harry turned and set his back against the inside door of his apartments. The prospect of designing the new gun and integrated bullet casings would ordinarily have been an interesting challenge.</p><p>At present, however, it was nothing but an annoying distraction. There was only one problem he was interested in solving, and it had nothing to do with mechanical wizardry.</p><p>Rubbing the back of his neck, Harry went to his bedroom in search of a nightshirt. Although he usually slept naked, it would hardly be comfortable to do so on the settee. The prospect of spending another night there caused him to question his own sanity. He was faced with the choice of sleeping in a comfortable bed with his enticing wife, or alone on a narrow piece of furniture . . . and he was going to opt for the latter?</p><p>His wife regarded him from the bed, her gaze accusatory. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even considering it,\u201d she said without preamble.</p><p>It took his distracted brain a moment to comprehend that she was not referring to their sleeping arrangements, but the meeting he\u2019d just concluded. Had he not been so weary, Harry might have thought to advise his wife that now was not the night to pick an argument.</p> <p>\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d he asked calmly, turning to rummage in one of the dresser drawers.</p><p>\u201cEnough to understand that you may design a new kind of weapon for them. And if so, you would be responsible for so much carnage and suffering\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Harry tugged off his necktie and coat, tossing them to the floor instead of laying them neatly on a chair. \u201cThe soldiers carrying the guns would be responsible for it. And the politicians and military men who sent them out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be disingenuous, Harry. If you didn\u2019t invent the weapons, no one would have them in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Giving up the search for the nightshirt, Harry untied his shoes and cast them on the heap of his discarded clothing. \u201cDo you think people will ever stop developing new ways to kill each other? If I don\u2019t do this, someone else will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let someone else. Don\u2019t let it be your legacy.\u201d</p> <p>Their gazes met, clashing. For God\u2019s sake, he wanted to beg her, don\u2019t push me tonight. The effort to carry on a coherent conversation was draining away what little self-restraint he had left.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I\u2019m right,\u201d Poppy persisted, flinging back the covers and hopping out of bed to confront him. \u201cYou know how I feel about guns. Doesn\u2019t that matter to you at all?\u201d</p><p>Harry could see the outline of her body in the thin white nightgown. He could even see the tips of her br**sts, rosy and firm in the chill of the room. Right and wrong . . . no, he didn\u2019t give a damn about useless moralizing. But if it would soften her toward him, if it would cause her to yield even a little of herself, he would tell Sir Gerald and the entire British government to go swive themselves. And somewhere in the depths of his soul, a fracture began as he experienced something entirely new . . . the desire to please another person.</p><p>Yielding to the feeling before he even knew what it was, he opened his mouth to tell Poppy that she could have her way. He would send word to the War Office tomorrow that the deal was off.</p><p>Before he could get out a word, however, Poppy said quietly. \u201cIf you keep your promise to Sir Gerald, I\u2019m going to leave you.\u201d</p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t aware of reaching out for her, only that she was in his grip, and that she was gasping. \u201cThat\u2019s not a choice for you,\u201d he managed to say.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me stay if I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t compromise on this, Harry. You will do as I ask, or I will leave.\u201d</p><p>All hell broke loose inside him. Leave him, would she?</p> <p>Not in this life, or the next.</p><p>She thought him a monster . . . well, he would prove her right. He would be everything she thought him and worse. He jerked her against him, hot blood teeming in his groin as he felt the cambric slide over her firm, smooth body. Grasping her braid in his hand, he pulled the ribbon loose. His mouth went to the curve of her neck and shoulder, and the scents of soap and perfume and female skin inundated his senses.</p><p>\u201cBefore I make a decision,\u201d he said in a guttural tone, \u201cI think I\u2019ll have a sample of what I might be forgoing.\u201d</p><p>Her hands came up to his shoulders as if to push him away.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t struggling. She was holding onto him.</p><p>Harry had never been so aroused, desperate beyond pride. He held her, absorbing the feel of her with his whole body. Her hair was loose, fiery silk sliding over his arms. He took handfuls of it, lifted the soft locks to his face. She smelled like roses, the intoxicating residue of perfumed soap or bath oil. He hunted for more of the scent, drawing it in with deep breaths.</p><p>Tugging the front of her nightgown open, Harry sent tiny cloth-covered buttons pattering to the carpet. Poppy quivered but offered no resistance as he tugged the garment to her waist, letting the sleeves trap her arms. His hand went to one of her br**sts, their shapes lush and beautiful in the muted light. He touched her with the backs of his fingers, drifting down until one of the pink buds was caught lightly between his knuckles. He pulled, just a little. At the feel of the gentle tug, Poppy gasped and bit her lip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Guiding Poppy backward, Harry stopped when her h*ps bumped against the edge of the mattress. \u201cLie down,\u201d he said, his voice rougher than he had intended. He helped her to lie back, supporting her with his arms, easing her to the bed. Bending over her flushed body, he savored all that rose-scented skin, wooing her with kisses . . . slow traveling kisses, wet and artful and fiendishly patient kisses. He licked his way to the tip of one breast and captured the taut point, flicking with his tongue. Poppy moaned, her body drawing into a helpless arch as he suckled her for long minutes.</p><p>Easing the muslin gown away from her, Harry dropped it to the floor. He stared at her with equal parts hunger and reverence. She was unspeakably beautiful, reclining in sweet abandon before him . . . lost, aroused, uncertain. Her gaze was distant, as if she were trying to encompass too many sensations at once.</p><p>Harry tore off the rest of his clothing and lowered himself over her. \u201cTouch me,\u201d he was mortified to hear himself rasp . . . something he had never asked of anyone before.</p><p>Slowly her arms lifted, one hand sliding around his neck. Her fingers laced through the shorter locks that curled slightly against his nape. The tentative caress drew a groan of pleasure from him. He lay beside her, easing a hand between her thighs.</p><p>Accustomed as he was to fine, intricate things, to delicate mechanisms, Harry was sensitive to every subtle response of her body. He discovered where and how she most liked to be stroked, what aroused her. What made her wet. Following the moisture, he slipped a finger inside, and she accepted it easily. When he tried to add another, however, she flinched and instinctively reached down to push his hand away. Withdrawing, he caressed her with a gentle palm, coaxing her to relax.</p><p>Pressing her back on the bed, Harry loomed over her. He heard her breathing quicken as he settled between her thighs. But he didn\u2019t try to enter her, only let her feel the pressure of him, the length fitting against the soft feminine rise. He knew how to tease, how to make her want him. He moved in the gentlest intimation of a thrust, sliding along dampness and sweetly vulnerable flesh, and then he rotated his h*ps slowly, every movement a syllable that added to a greater meaning.</p><p>Her lashes half lowered, and there was a faint, intent pull between her fine brows . . . she wanted what he was giving her, she wanted the tension and torment and relief. Desire had brought a mist of perspiration over her skin, until the scent of roses deepened and acquired a hint of musk, so wildly arousing and heady that he could have let himself go right then. But he rolled to his side, away from the enticing cradle of her hips.</p><p>He slid his hand over her mound and slipped his fingers inside her again, his touch coaxing and careful. This time her body relaxed and welcomed him. Kissing her throat, he caught the vibration of every moan against his lips. A faint, rhythmic clenching began around his knuckles as he thrust his fingers in her oh so gently. Every time she took them to the hilt, he let the heel of his hand brush her intimately. She panted and began to lift upward repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry whispered, letting his hot breath fill the shell of her ear. \u201cYes. When I\u2019m inside you, this is how you move. Show me what you want, and I\u2019ll give it to you, as much as you need, as long as you want . . .\u201d</p><p>She clamped on his fingers, tightening, convulsing, coming in erotic shivers. He teased out every last luscious ripple, relishing her cl**ax, lost in the feel of her.</p><p>Levering his body over hers, he pushed her thighs wide and lowered himself between them. Before her sated flesh had begun to close, he centered himself where she was wet and ready for him. He stopped thinking altogether. He pushed into the resisting ring, finding it even more difficult than he\u2019d expected despite the abundant moisture.</p><p>Poppy whimpered in pained surprise, her body stiffening.</p><p>\u201cHold onto me,\u201d Harry said hoarsely. She obeyed, her arms coming around his neck. He reached down and pulled her h*ps upward, trying to make it easier for her as he pressed deeper, harder, her flesh unbelievably tight and hot and sweet, and he gave her more, unable to help himself, until he was fully buried in the soft heat of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he whispered, shaking with the effort to hold still, to let her adjust around him.</p><p>Every nerve clamored for movement, for the sliding, teasing friction that would bring him release. He nudged gently. But Poppy grimaced, her legs straining on either side of his. He waited longer, caressing her with his hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she choked. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. He pushed again, and a pained sound escaped her. Again, and she braced and clenched her teeth. Every time he moved, it caused her agony.</p><p>Resisting her tight grip on his neck, Harry drew back far enough to look at her face. Poppy was white with distress, her lips bloodless. Holy hell, was it this painful for all virgins?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait,\u201d he said raggedly. \u201cIt will be easier in a moment.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her mouth stiff, her eyes tightly shut.</p><p>And they both held still and fast, while he tried to soothe her. But nothing changed. Despite Poppy\u2019s compliance, this was sheer misery for her.</p><p>Harry buried his face in her hair and cursed. And he withdrew, despite the vicious protest of his loins, when every impulse screamed for him to hammer into her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stifle a gasp of relief as the painful intrusion was removed. Hearing the sound, Harry nearly exploded with murderous frustration.</p> <p>He heard her murmur his name, her voice questioning.</p><p>Ignoring her, Harry left the bed and staggered toward the bathing room. He braced his hands on the tiled wall and closed his eyes, struggling for self-control. After a few minutes, he drew water and washed himself. He found smears of blood . . . Poppy\u2019s blood. That was only to be expected. But the sight of it made him want to howl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because the last thing he wanted on earth was to cause his wife even a moment\u2019s pain. He would die before hurting her, no matter what the consequences to himself.</p><p>Dear God, what had happened to him? He had never wanted to feel this way about anyone, never even imagined it possible.</p><p>He had to make it stop.</p><p>Sore and bewildered, Poppy lay on her side and listened to the sounds of Harry washing. It burned where he had taken her. The residue of blood was sticky between her thighs. She wanted to leave the bed and wash as well, but the thought of performing such an intimate task in front of Harry . . . no, she wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. And she was unsure, because even in her innocence, she knew that he had not finished making love to her.</p> <p>But why?</p><p>Had there been something she should have done?</p><p>Had she made some kind of mistake? Perhaps she should have been more stoic. She had tried her best, but it had hurt dreadfully, even though Harry had been gentle. Surely he knew that it was painful for a virgin the first time. Why, then, had he seemed angry with her?</p><p>Feeling inadequate and defensive, Poppy crept from the bed and found her nightgown. She put it on and hastily retreated beneath the covers as Harry came back into the room. Without a word, he picked up his discarded clothes and began to dress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out?\u201d she heard herself ask.</p> <p>Harry didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t. We\u2019ll talk later. But right now I\u2014\u201d He broke off as if words failed him.</p><p>Poppy curled on her side, gripping the edges of the bedclothes. Something was terribly wrong\u2014she couldn\u2019t fathom what it was, and she was too afraid to ask.</p><p>Pulling on his coat, Harry started for the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Poppy asked unsteadily.</p> <p>He sounded distant. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that, either.\u201d</p><p>She waited until he had left before she let a few tears slip out, and she blotted them with the sheet. Was Harry going to another woman?</p><p>Miserably, she reflected that her sister Win\u2019s advice about marital relations had been insufficient. There should have been a bit less about roses and moonlight and a bit more practical information.</p><p>She wanted to see her sisters, especially Amelia. She wanted her family, who would pet and praise and make much of her, and offer the reassurance she badly needed. It was more than a little disheartening to have failed at marriage after a mere three weeks.</p><p>Most of all, she needed advice about husbands.</p><p>Yes, it was time to retreat and consider what to do. She would go to Hampshire.</p> <p>A hot bath soothed her smarting flesh and eased the strained muscles on the insides of her thighs. After drying and powdering herself, she dressed in a wine-colored traveling gown. She packed a few belongings in a small valise, including undergarments and stockings, a silver-backed brush, a novel, and an automaton that Harry had made\u2014a little woodpecker on a tree trunk\u2014which she usually kept on her dressing table. However, she left the diamond necklace that Harry had given her, setting the velvet-lined case in a drawer.</p><p>When she was ready to depart, she rang the bellpull and sent a maid to fetch Jake Valentine.</p><p>The tall, brown-eyed young man appeared in an instant, making no effort to mask his concern. His gaze skimmed quickly over her traveling clothes. \u201cMay I be of service, Mrs. Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Valentine, has my husband left the hotel?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, a frown puckering his forehead.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you when he would return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Poppy wondered if she could trust him. His loyalty to Harry was well-known. However, she had no choice but to ask for his help. \u201cI must ask a favor of you, Mr. Valentine. However, I fear it may put you in a difficult position.\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes warmed with rueful amusement. \u201cMrs. Rutledge, I\u2019m nearly always in a difficult position. Please don\u2019t hesitate to ask me for anything.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cI need a carriage. I\u2019m going to visit my brother at his terrace in Mayfair.\u201d</p><p>The smile vanished from his eyes. He glanced at the valise by her feet. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am very sorry to ask you to ignore your obligations to my husband but . . . I would prefer you didn\u2019t let him know where I\u2019ve gone until morning. I will be perfectly safe in my brother\u2019s company. He is going to convey me to my family in Hampshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Of course I will help you.\u201d Valentine paused, appearing to choose his words carefully. \u201cI hope you will be returning soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Rutledge . . .\u201d he started, and cleared his throat uncomfortably. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t overstep my bounds. But I feel it necessary to say\u2014\u201d He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Poppy said gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked for Mr. Rutledge for more than five years. I daresay I know him as well as anyone. He\u2019s a complicated man . . . too smart for his own good, and he doesn\u2019t have much in the way of scruples, and he forces everyone around him to live by his terms. But he has changed many lives for the better. Including mine. And I believe there\u2019s good in him, if one looks deep enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not enough to found a marriage on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean something to him,\u201d Valentine insisted. \u201cHe\u2019s formed an attachment to you, and I\u2019ve never seen that before. Which is why I don\u2019t think anyone in the world can manage him except for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true,\u201d Poppy managed to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to manage him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am . . .\u201d Valentine said feelingly, \u201cSomeone has to.\u201d</p><p>Amusement broke through Poppy\u2019s distress, and she ducked her head to hide a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll consider it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the moment I need some time away. What do they call it in the rope ring . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA breather,\u201d he said, bending to pick up her valise.</p> <p>\u201cYes, a breather. Will you help me, Mr. Valentine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Valentine bid her to wait but a few minutes, and went to summon the carriage. Comprehending the need for discretion, he had the vehicle brought to the back of the hotel, where Poppy could depart unobserved.</p><p>She felt a pang of regret, leaving the Rutledge and its employees. In no time at all it had become home . . . but things could not stay the way they were. Something would have to yield. And that something\u2014or someone, rather\u2014was Harry Rutledge.</p><p>Valentine returned to escort her to the back entrance. Opening an umbrella to shelter her from the rain, Valentine guided her outside to the waiting vehicle.</p><p>Poppy climbed onto the block step that had been placed beside the carriage, and turned to face the valet. With the added height of the step, they stood nearly eye to eye. Raindrops glittered in the light from the hotel as they fell in jewel-like strands from the points of the umbrella.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Valentine . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do think he\u2019ll follow me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to the ends of the earth,\u201d he said gravely.</p><p>That drew a smile from her, and she turned to climb into the carriage.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p> <p>It had taken Mrs. Meredith Clifton three months of dedicated pursuit before she had finally seduced Leo, Lord Ramsay. Or more accurately, was about to seduce him. As the young and nubile wife of a distinguished British naval officer, she was frequently left to her own devices while her husband was off at sea. Meredith had bedded every man in London worth bedding\u2014excluding the handful of tiresomely faithful married ones, of course\u2014but then she had heard about Ramsay, a man reputedly as sexually audacious as herself.</p><p>Leo was a man of tantalizing contradictions. He was a handsome man, dark haired and blue eyed, with a clean and wholesome appeal . . . and yet he was rumored to be capable of shocking debauchery. He was cruel but gentle, callous but perceptive, selfish but charming. And from what she had heard, he was a vastly accomplished lover.</p><p>Now, in Leo\u2019s bedroom, Meredith stood quietly while he undressed her. He took his time about unfastening the row of buttons at her back. Sidling back, she let the backs of her fingers brush his trousers. The feel of him caused her to purr.</p><p>She heard Leo laugh, and he pushed her exploring hand away. \u201cPatience, Meredith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve anticipated this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I\u2019m terrible in bed.\u201d Gently he spread her dress open.</p><p>She shivered as she felt the exploratory stroke of his fingertips on her upper back. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon, won\u2019t you?\u201d He brushed aside the wisps of hair at her nape and kissed her there, letting his tongue brush her skin.</p> <p>That light, erotic touch caused Meredith to gasp. \u201cAre you ever serious about anything?\u201d she managed to ask.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve found that life is far kinder to shallow people.\u201d Turning her, Leo drew her up against his tall, well-muscled frame.</p><p>And in one long, slow blaze of a kiss, Meredith realized that she had finally met a predator more seductive, less inhibited, than anyone she had ever met. His sensual power was no less potent for being completely devoid of emotion or tenderness. This was pure, unashamed physicality.</p><p>Consumed in the kiss, Meredith gave an agitated little cry when he stopped.</p><p>\u201cThe door,\u201d Leo said.</p><p>Another tentative knock.</p><p>\u201cIgnore it,\u201d Meredith said, trying to slide her arms around his lean waist.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. My servants won\u2019t let me ignore them. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried.\u201d Releasing her, Leo went to the door, opened it a crack, and said curtly, \u201cThere had better be a fire or a felony in progress, or I swear you\u2019ll be sacked.\u201d</p><p>Another murmur from the servant, and Leo\u2019s tone changed, the arrogant drawl vanishing. \u201cGood God. Tell her I\u2019ll be down at once. Get her some tea or something.\u201d Raking his hand through the short dark brown layers of his hair, he went to a wardrobe and began to hunt through a row of jackets. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to ring for a maid to help you dress, Meredith. When you\u2019re ready, my servants will make certain you\u2019re escorted out to your carriage at the back.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister has arrived unexpectedly.\u201d Pausing in his search, Leo threw an apologetic glance over his shoulder. \u201cAnother time, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost certainly not,\u201d Meredith said indignantly. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d He pulled out a coat and shrugged into it. \u201cMy sister needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you! Tell her to return tomorrow. And if you don\u2019t send her away, you\u2019ll never have another chance with me.\u201d</p><p>Leo smiled. \u201cMy loss, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>His indifference aroused Meredith even further. \u201cOh Ramsay, please,\u201d she said heatedly. \u201cIt\u2019s ungentlemanly to leave a lady wanting!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than ungentlemanly, darling. It\u2019s a crime.\u201d Leo\u2019s face softened as he approached her. Taking her hand, he lifted it to kiss the backs of her fingers one by one. His eyes glinted with rueful amusement. \u201cThis is certainly not what I had planned for this evening. My apologies. Let\u2019s try again someday. Because, Meredith . . . I\u2019m actually not terrible in bed.\u201d He kissed her lightly, and smiled with such skillfully manufactured warmth that she almost believed it was real.</p><p>Poppy waited in the small front parlor of the terrace. At the sight of her brother\u2019s tall form entering the room, she stood and flew to him. \u201cLeo!\u201d</p><p>He gathered her close. After a brief, hard hug, he held her at arms\u2019 length. His gaze swept over her. \u201cYou\u2019ve left Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou lasted a week longer than I expected,\u201d he said, not unkindly. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to start with\u2014\u201d Poppy tried to sound pragmatic even though her eyes watered. \u201cI\u2019m not a virgin anymore.\u201d</p><p>Leo gave her a mock-shamed glance. \u201cNeither am I,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>A reluctant giggle escaped her.</p><p>Leo rummaged in his coat for a handkerchief, without success. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, darling. I have no handkerchief, and in any case, virginity is nearly impossible to find once you\u2019ve lost it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m weepy,\u201d she said, blotting her wet cheek on his shoulder. \u201cLeo . . . I\u2019m in a muddle. I need to think about some things. Will you take me to Hampshire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to depart immediately. Because if we wait too long, Harry may prevent us from going at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, the devil himself couldn\u2019t stop me from taking you home. That being said . . . yes, we\u2019ll go right away. I prefer to avoid confrontation whenever possible. And I doubt Rutledge will take it well when he discovers you\u2019ve left him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cHe\u2019ll take it quite badly. But I\u2019m not leaving him because I want to end my marriage. I\u2019m leaving him because I want to save it.\u201d</p><p>Leo shook his head, smiling. \u201cThere\u2019s Hathaway logic for you. What worries me is that I almost understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can explain once we\u2019re on our way. For the moment, wait here. I\u2019ll send for the driver and tell the servants to ready the carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to cause trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re used to it. I\u2019m the master of hasty departures.\u201d</p><p>There must have been some truth to Leo\u2019s claim, because a trunk was packed and the carriage was readied with astonishing speed. Poppy waited by the parlor fire until Leo came to the doorway. \u201cWe\u2019ll be off now,\u201d he said. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>He took her to his carriage, a comfortable and well-sprung vehicle with deep-upholstered seats. After arranging some cushions in the corner, Poppy settled back in preparation for a long journey. It would take the full night to reach Hampshire, and although the macadamized roadways were in decent repair, there were many rough stretches.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have come to you at such a late hour,\u201d she told her brother. \u201cNo doubt you would be sleeping soundly right now had I not arrived.\u201d</p><p>That produced a swift grin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d Leo said. \u201cBut no matter\u2014it\u2019s time to go to Hampshire. I want to see Win and that merciless brute she married, and I need to check on the estate and tenants.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy smiled slightly, knowing how fond Leo was of the so-called \u201cmerciless brute.\u201d Merripen had earned Leo\u2019s everlasting gratitude for rebuilding and managing the estate. They communicated frequently by letter, maintained two or three running arguments at any given time, and thoroughly enjoyed baiting each other.</p><p>Reaching to the dark brown shade that covered the window nearest her, Poppy lifted it to glance at the broken buildings, brick facings plastered with bills, and battered shop fronts, all of them bathed in the twilight gloom of street lamps. London at night was unsavory, unsafe, uncontrolled. Harry was out there somewhere. She had no doubt he could take care of himself, but the thought of what he might be doing\u2014or whom he might be doing it with\u2014filled her with melancholy. She sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cI loathe London in the summer,\u201d Leo said. \u201cThe Thames is working up to an unholy stench this year.\u201d He paused, his gaze resting on her. \u201cI suppose that look on your face isn\u2019t caused by worry over public sanitation. Tell me what you\u2019re thinking, sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry left the hotel tonight after\u2014\u201d Poppy broke off, unable to find a word to describe just what it was they had done. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll stay out, but at best, we\u2019re only about ten or twelve hours ahead of him. Of course, he may decide not to follow me, which would be rather anticlimactic but also a relief. Still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll follow,\u201d Leo said flatly. \u201cBut you won\u2019t have to see him if you don\u2019t wish it.\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head morosely. \u201cI\u2019ve never had such mixed-up feelings about anyone. I don\u2019t understand him. Tonight in bed, he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Leo said. \u201cSome things are better discussed between sisters. I\u2019m sure this is one of them. We\u2019ll reach Ramsay House by morning, and you can ask Amelia anything you like.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she would know anything about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? She\u2019s a married woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s . . . well . . . a masculine problem.\u201d</p><p>Leo blanched. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know anything about that, either. I don\u2019t have masculine problems. In fact, I don\u2019t even like saying the phrase \u2018masculine problems.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Crestfallen, Poppy pulled a lap blanket over herself.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. What exactly are we calling a \u2018masculine problem\u2019? Did he have trouble running the flag up? Or did it fall to half-staff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to speak about this metaphorically, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Leo said firmly.</p><p>\u201cAll right. He . . .\u201d Poppy frowned in concentration as she searched for the right words, \u201c. . . left me while the flag was still flying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas he drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you do or say something to make him leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the opposite. I asked him to stay, and he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Leo rummaged in a side compartment beside his seat and swore. \u201cWhere the blazes is my liquor? I told the servants to stock the carriage with drink for the journey. I\u2019m going to fire the bloody lot of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s water, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWater is for washing, not drinking.\u201d He muttered something about an evil conspiracy to keep him sober, and sighed. \u201cOne can only guess as to Rutledge\u2019s motivations. It\u2019s not easy for a man to stop in the middle of lovemaking. It puts us in a devil of a temper.\u201d Folding his arms across his chest, he watched her speculatively. \u201cI propose the radical notion of actually asking Rutledge why he left you tonight, and discussing it like two rational beings. But before your husband reaches Hampshire, you\u2019d better decide on something, and that\u2019s whether you\u2019re going to forgive him for what he did to you and Bayning.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise. \u201cDo you think I should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe devil knows I wouldn\u2019t want to, were I in your place.\u201d He paused. \u201cOn the other hand, I\u2019ve been forgiven for many things I should never have been forgiven for. The point is, if you can\u2019t forgive him, there\u2019s no use in trying to talk about anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Harry cares about being forgiven,\u201d Poppy said glumly.</p><p>\u201cOf course he does. Men love to be forgiven. It makes us feel better about our inability to learn from our mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready,\u201d Poppy protested. \u201cWhy must I do it so soon? There\u2019s no time limit for forgiveness, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Leo . . .\u201d She felt crushed under a weight of uncertainty and hurt and yearning.</p> <p>\u201cTry to sleep,\u201d her brother murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll have two hours, more or less, before it\u2019s time to change horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep for worrying,\u201d Poppy said, although a yawn had already overtaken her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in worrying. You already know what you want to do\u2014you just aren\u2019t ready to admit it yet.\u201d</p><p>Poppy settled deeper into the corner, closing her eyes. \u201cYou know a lot about women, don\u2019t you, Leo?\u201d</p><p>There was a smile in his voice. \u201cI should hope so, with four sisters.\u201d And he watched over her while she slept.</p><p>After returning to the hotel drunk as a boiled owl, Harry staggered to his apartments. He had gone to a tavern, flamboyantly decorated with mirrors, tiled walls, and expensive prostitutes. It had taken approximately three hours to drink himself into a suitable state of numbness that he could go back home. Despite the artful advances of more than a few lightskirts, Harry took no notice of any of them.</p><p>He wanted his wife.</p><p>And he knew that Poppy would never soften toward him unless he began with a sincere apology for taking her away from Michael Bayning. The problem was, he couldn\u2019t. Because he wasn\u2019t at all sorry about what he\u2019d done, he was only sorry that she was unhappy about it. He would never regret having done what was necessary to marry her, because she was what he had wanted most in his life.</p><p>Poppy was every fine, good, unselfish impulse that he would never have. She was every caring thought, loving gesture, happy moment, that he would never know. She was every minute of peaceful sleep that would forever elude him. According to the law of universal balance, Poppy had been put into the world to compensate for Harry and his wickedness. Which was probably why, as the opposite of two magnetic forces, Harry was so damnably drawn to her.</p><p>Therefore, the apology was not going to be sincere. But it would be made. And then he would ask to begin again with her.</p><p>Lowering himself to the narrow settee, which he loathed with a passion, Harry fell into a drunken stupor that almost passed for sleep.</p><p>The morning light, weak though it was, entered his brain like a stiletto. Groaning, Harry cracked his eyes open and took inventory of his abused body. He was dry mouthed, exhausted, and aching, and if there had ever been a time in his life he had needed a shower bath more, he couldn\u2019t remember it. He slitted a glance at the closed door of his bedroom, where Poppy still slept.</p><p>Remembering her gasp of pain the previous night, when he had thrust into her, Harry felt a cold, sick heaviness in the pit of his stomach. She would be sore this morning. She might need something.</p><p>She probably hated him.</p><p>Swamped with dread, Harry lurched upward from the settee and went to the bedroom. He opened the door and let his eyes adjust to the semidarkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bed was empty.</p><p>Harry stood there blinking while apprehension swept over him. He heard himself whisper her name.</p><p>In seconds he had reached the bellpull, but there was no need to call for anyone. As if by magic, Valentine was at the apartment door, his brown eyes alert in his lean face.</p><p>\u201cValentine,\u201d Harry began hoarsely, \u201cwhere is\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Rutledge is with Lord Ramsay. I believe they are traveling to Hampshire as we speak.\u201d</p><p>Harry grew very, very calm, as he always did when a situation was dire. \u201cWhen did she leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night, while you were out.\u201d</p><p>Resisting the urge to kill his valet where he stood, Harry asked softly, \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. She asked me not to.\u201d Valentine paused, looking momentarily bemused, as if he, too, couldn\u2019t believe that Harry hadn\u2019t already killed him. \u201cI have a carriage and team ready, if you intend to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I intend to.\u201d Harry\u2019s tone was as crisp as the strike of a chisel through granite. \u201cPack my clothes. I\u2019m leaving within the half hour.\u201d</p><p>Rage hovered nearby, so powerful that Harry could scarcely own it as his. But he shoved the feeling aside. Giving in to it would accomplish nothing. The undertaking for now was to wash and shave, change his clothes, and deal with the situation.</p><p>Any hint of concern or contrition burned to ashes. Any hope of being kind or gentlemanly had gone. He would keep Poppy no matter how he had to do it. He would lay out the law, and when he was through, she would never dare leave him again.</p><p>Poppy awakened from a jolting sleep and sat up, rubbing her eyes. Leo was dozing in the seat opposite hers, his broad shoulders hunched and one arm curled behind his head as he leaned against a paneled wall.</p><p>Nudging aside the little curtain over one of the windows, Poppy saw her beloved Hampshire . . . sun crossed, green, peaceful. She had been in London too long\u2014she had forgotten how beautiful the world could be. The carriage passed flushes of poppies and oxeye daisies and vibrant stands of lavender. The landscape was rich with wet meadows and chalk streams. Brilliant blue kingfishers and swifts darted through the sky, while green woodpeckers rattled the trees.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Leo awakened, yawning and stretching. His eyes narrowed in a protesting squint as he lifted a cloth panel for a glimpse of the passing countryside.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d Poppy asked, smiling. \u201cHave you ever seen such views?\u201d</p><p>Her brother dropped the panel. \u201cSheep. Grass. Thrilling.\u201d</p><p>Before long the carriage reached the Ramsay lands and passed the gatekeeper\u2019s house, which had been constructed of blue gray brick and cream stone. Owing to recent and extensive renovations, the landscape and manor were new looking, although the house had retained its haphazard charm. The estate was not a large one, certainly nothing compared to the massive neighboring estate owned by Lord Westcliff. But it was a jewel, the land fertile and varied, with fields irrigated by channels that had been dug from a nearby stream to the upper fields.</p><p>Before Leo had inherited the title, the estate had fallen into decay and disrepair, abandoned by many of the tenants. Now, however, it had been turned into a thriving and progressive enterprise, mostly due to the efforts of Kev Merripen. And Leo, though he was almost embarrassed to admit it, had come to care about the estate and was doing his best to acquire the vast amounts of knowledge necessary to make it run efficiently.</p><p>Ramsay House was a cheerful combination of architectural styles. Originally an Elizabethan manor house, it had been altered as successive generations had grafted on additions and wings. The result was an asymmetrical building with bristling chimney stacks, rows of leaded-glass windows, and a gray slate roof with h*ps and bays. Inside, there were interesting niches and nooks, odd-shaped rooms, hidden doors and staircases, all adding to an eccentric charm that perfectly suited the Hathaway family.</p><p>Roses in bloom hugged the exterior of the house. Behind the manor, white-graveled walking paths led to gardens and fruit orchards. Stables and a livestock yard were set to one side of the manor, while at a farther distance there was a timber yard in full production.</p><p>The carriage stopped on the front drive before a set of timbered doors with glass insets. By the time the footmen had gone to alert the household of their arrival and Leo had assisted Poppy from the vehicle, Win had come running from the house. She flung herself at Leo. He grinned and caught her easily, swinging her around.</p> <p>\u201cDear Poppy,\u201d Win exclaimed. \u201cI missed you dreadfully!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Leo asked, still holding her. \u201cHaven\u2019t you missed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a little,\u201d Win said with a grin, and kissed his cheek. She went to Poppy and embraced her. \u201cHow long will you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Leo asked.</p><p>Win kept her slender arm around Poppy\u2019s back as she turned to reply. \u201cCam is visiting Lord Westcliff at Stony Cross Park, Amelia is inside with the baby, Beatrix is roaming the woods, and Merripen is with some of the tenants, lecturing them on new techniques of hoeing.\u201d</p><p>The word caught Leo\u2019s attention. \u201cI know all about that. If you don\u2019t want to go to a brothel, there are certain districts of London\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoeing, Leo,\u201d Win said. \u201cBreaking ground with farm implements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I know nothing about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out a great deal about it once Merripen learns you\u2019re here.\u201d Win tried to look severe, although her eyes were twinkling. \u201cI do hope you\u2019ll behave, Leo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course I will. We\u2019re in the country. There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d Heaving a sigh, Leo shoved his hands in his pockets and observed their picturesque surroundings as if he\u2019d just been assigned a cell at Newgate. Then, with perfectly calibrated offhandedness he asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Marks? You didn\u2019t mention her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is well, but . . .\u201d Win paused, obviously searching for words. \u201cShe had a small mishap today, and she\u2019s rather upset. Of course, any woman would be, considering the nature of the problem. Therefore, Leo, I insist that you not tease her. And if you do, Merripen has already said that he will give you such a drubbing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. As if I\u2019d care enough to notice some problem of Marks\u2019s.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Win frowned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell you, except that the problem is obvious and you\u2019ll notice immediately. You see, Miss Marks dyes her hair, which I never knew before, but apparently\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDyes her hair?\u201d Poppy repeated in surprise. \u201cBut why? She\u2019s not old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. She won\u2019t explain why. But there are some unfortunate women who start to gray in their twenties, and perhaps she\u2019s one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cIt must embarrass her. She\u2019s certainly taken great pains to keep it secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, poor thing,\u201d Leo said, sounding not at all sympathetic. In fact, his eyes fairly danced with glee. \u201cTell us what happened, Win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think the London apothecary who mixed her usual solution must have gotten the proportions wrong. Because when she applied the dye this morning, the result was . . . well, distressing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid it fall out?\u201d Leo asked. \u201cIs she bald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. It\u2019s just that her hair is . . . green.\u201d</p><p>To look at Leo\u2019s face, one would think it was Christmas morning. \u201cWhat shade of green?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo, hush,\u201d Win said urgently. \u201cYou are not to torment her. It\u2019s been a very trying experience. We mixed a peroxide paste to take the green out, and I don\u2019t know if it worked or not. Amelia was helping her to wash it a little while ago. And no matter what the result is, you are to say nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that tonight, Marks will be sitting at the supper table with hair that matches the asparagus, and I\u2019m not supposed to remark on it?\u201d He snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not that strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Leo,\u201d Poppy murmured, touching his arm. \u201cIf it were one of your sisters, you wouldn\u2019t mock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think that little shrew would have any mercy on me, were the situations reversed?\u201d He rolled his eyes as he saw their expressions. \u201cVery well, I\u2019ll try not to jeer. But I make no promises.\u201d</p><p>Leo sauntered toward the house in no apparent hurry. He didn\u2019t deceive either of his sisters.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it will take him to find her?\u201d Poppy asked Win.</p><p>\u201cTwo, perhaps three minutes,\u201d Win replied, and they both sighed.</p><p>In precisely two minutes and forty-seven seconds, Leo had located his archenemy in the fruit orchard behind the house. Marks sat on a low stone wall, her narrow frame slightly hunched, her elbows close together. She had some kind of cloth wrapped around her head, a knotted turban that concealed her hair entirely.</p><p>Seeing the dispirited droop of her slender frame, anyone else might have been moved to pity. But Leo had no compunction about taking a few jabs at Catherine Marks. From the beginning of their acquaintance, she had never missed an opportunity to nag, insult or deflate him. On the few occasions he had said something charming or nice\u2014purely as an experiment, of course\u2014she willfully misinterpreted him.</p><p>Leo had never understood why they had started off on such bad footing, or why she was so determined to hate him. And even more perplexing, why it mattered. Prickly, narrow-minded, sharp-tongued, secretive woman, with her stern mouth and haughty little nose . . . she deserved green hair, and she deserved to be mocked for it.</p><p>The time for revenge was at hand.</p> <p>As Leo approached nonchalantly, Marks lifted her head, the sunlight flashing on the lenses of her spectacles. \u201cOh,\u201d she said sourly. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>She said it as if she had just discovered a vermin infestation.</p><p>\u201cHello, Marks,\u201d Leo said cheerfully. \u201cHmmm. You look different. What can it be?\u201d</p><p>She glowered at him.</p><p>\u201cIs it some new fashion, that wrapping on your head?\u201d he asked with polite interest.</p><p>Marks maintained a stony silence.</p><p>The moment was delicious. He knew, and she knew that he knew, and mortified color was creeping over her face.</p><p>\u201cI brought Poppy with me from London,\u201d Leo volunteered.</p><p>Her eyes turned alert behind the spectacles. \u201cDid Mr. Rutledge come, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Although I imagine he\u2019s not far behind us.\u201d</p><p>The companion stood from the stone wall and brushed at her skirts. \u201cI must see Poppy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be time for that.\u201d Leo moved to block her way. \u201cBut before we return to the house, I think you and I should reacquaint ourselves. How are things with you, Marks? Anything interesting happen lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no better than a ten-year-old,\u201d she said vehemently. \u201cAll ready to sneer at someone else\u2019s misfortune. You immature, mean-spirited\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Leo said kindly. \u201cLet me have a look, and I\u2019ll tell you if\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStay away from me!\u201d she snapped, and tried to dart around him.</p><p>Leo blocked her easily, a muffled laugh escaping him as she tried to shove him. \u201cAre you trying to push me out of the way?

It\u2019s all I want from life, to see you with\u2014\u201d another swipe, and he snagged the edge of the cloth, \u201c\u2014your hair all\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Leo broke off as the kerchief pulled free, and the hair that spilled out was not any conceivable shade of green. It was blond . . . pale amber and champagne and honey . . . and there was so much of it, cascading in shimmering waves to the middle of her back.</p><p>Leo went still, holding her in place as his astonished gaze raked over her. They both gulped for breath, worked up and winded like racehorses. Marks couldn\u2019t have looked more appalled if he had just stripped her naked. And the truth was, Leo couldn\u2019t have been any more confounded\u2014or aroused\u2014if he were actually viewing her naked. Though he certainly would have been willing to try it.</p><p>Such a commotion had risen in him, Leo hardly knew how to react. Just hair, just locks of hair . . . but it was like setting a previously undistinguished painting in the perfect frame, revealing its beauty in full luminous detail. Catherine Marks in the sunlight was a mythical creature, a nymph, with delicate features and opalescent eyes.</p><p>The most confounding realization was that it wasn\u2019t really hair color that had concealed all this from him . . . he had never noticed how stunning she was because she had deliberately kept him from seeing it.</p> <p>\u201cWhy,\u201d Leo asked, his voice husky, \u201cwould you conceal something so beautiful?\u201d Staring at her, nearly devouring her, he asked more softly still, \u201cWhat are you hiding from?\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled, and she gave a brief shake of her head, as if to answer would prove fatal to them both. And, wrenching free of him, she picked up her skirts and ran headlong to the house.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d Poppy said as she lay her head on her sister\u2019s shoulder, \u201cyou\u2019ve done me a terrible disservice, making marriage look so easy.\u201d</p><p>Amelia laughed softly, hugging her. \u201cOh, dear. If I\u2019ve given that impression, I do apologize. It\u2019s not. Especially when both individuals are strong willed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ladies\u2019 periodicals advise to let one\u2019s husband have his way most of the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, lies, lies. Only let your husband think he\u2019s having his way. That\u2019s the secret to a happy marriage.\u201d</p><p>They both snickered, and Poppy sat up.</p><p>Having put Rye down for his morning nap, Amelia had gone with Poppy to the family parlor, where they sat together on the settee. Although Win had been invited to join them, she had tactfully declined, sensitive to the fact that Amelia had a more maternal relationship with Poppy than she did.</p><p>During the two years that Win had spent away at a health clinic in France, recovering from the damages of scarlet fever, Poppy had grown even closer to their oldest sister. When Poppy wished to divulge her most private thoughts and problems, Amelia was the one she always felt most comfortable with.</p><p>A tea tray had been brought in, and there was a plate of treacle tarts made according to their mother\u2019s old recipe, strips of buttery shortbread topped with lemon syrup and sweet crumbs.</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted,\u201d Amelia remarked, putting a gentle hand to Poppy\u2019s cheek. \u201cI think you need a nap more than little Rye.\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head. \u201cLater. I must try to settle some things first, because I think Harry may arrive by nightfall. Of course, he may not, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d came a voice from the doorway, and Poppy looked up to behold her former companion. \u201cMiss Marks,\u201d she exclaimed, jumping to her feet.</p> <p>A brilliant smile broke out on Miss Marks\u2019s face, and she came to Poppy swiftly, catching her in a warm embrace. Poppy could tell that she had been outside. Instead of her usual pristine soap-and-starch smell, she carried the scents of earth and flowers and summer heat. \u201cNothing\u2019s the same without you here,\u201d Miss Marks said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much quieter.\u201d</p><p>Poppy laughed.</p><p>Drawing back, Miss Marks added hastily, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Still smiling, Poppy viewed her quizzically. \u201cHow pretty you look. Your hair . . .\u201d Instead of being scraped back and tightly pinned, the thick, fine locks flowed around her back and shoulders. And the nondescript shade of brown had been lightened to brilliant pale gold. \u201cIs that your natural color?\u201d</p><p>A blush swept over Miss Marks\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m going to darken it again as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust you?\u201d Poppy asked, perplexed. \u201cIt\u2019s so lovely this way.\u201d</p><p>Amelia spoke from the settee. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t advise applying any chemicals for a while, Catherine. Your hair may be too fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be right,\u201d Miss Marks said with a frown, self-consciously reaching up to finger the light, glinting strands.</p><p>Poppy looked askance at them both, having never heard Amelia call the companion by her first name before.</p><p>\u201cMay I sit with you both?\u201d Miss Marks asked Poppy gently. \u201cI want very much to hear what has transpired since the wedding. And\u2014\u201d There was a quick, oddly nervous pause. \u201cI have some things to tell you, that I believe are relevant to your situation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d Poppy said. Throwing a quick glance at Amelia, she saw that her older sister was already aware of what Miss Marks intended to tell her.</p><p>They sat together, the sisters on the settee and Catherine Marks on a nearby chair.</p><p>A long, supple shape streaked through the doorway and paused. It was Dodger, who caught sight of Poppy, did a few hops of joy, and raced to her.</p><p>\u201cDodger,\u201d Poppy exclaimed, almost happy to see the ferret. He loped to her, regarded her with bright eyes and chirped happily as she petted him. After a moment, he left her lap and stole toward Miss Marks.</p> <p>The companion glanced at him sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t come near me, you loathsome weasel.\u201d</p><p>Undeterred, he stopped by her feet and executed a slow roll, showing her his belly. It was a source of amusement to the Hathaways that Dodger adored Miss Marks, no matter that she despised him. \u201cGo away,\u201d she told him, but the lovestruck ferret continued his efforts to entice her.</p><p>Sighing, she reached down and removed one of her shoes, a sturdy black leather affair that laced up to the ankle. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to keep him quiet,\u201d she said dourly.</p><p>Immediately, the ferret\u2019s chatter ceased, and he buried his head inside the shoe.</p><p>Suppressing a grin, Amelia turned her attention to Poppy. \u201cDid you have a row with Harry?\u201d she asked gently.</p> <p>\u201cNot really. Well, it began as one, but\u2014\u201d Poppy felt a wash of heat over her face. \u201cEver since the wedding we\u2019ve done nothing more than circle around each other. And then last evening it seemed that we would finally\u2014\u201d The words seemed to bottle up in her throat, and she had to force them out in a jumble. \u201cI\u2019m so afraid it will always be this way, this push and pull . . . I think he cares for me, but he doesn\u2019t want me to care for him. It\u2019s as if he both wants and fears affection. And that leaves me in an impossible position.\u201d She let out a shaky, mirthless laugh and looked at her sister with a helpless grimace, as if to ask what can be done with such a man?</p><p>Instead of replying, Amelia turned her gaze to Miss Marks.</p><p>The companion appeared vulnerable, uneasy, turmoil churning beneath the veneer of composure. \u201cPoppy. I may be able to shed some light on the situation. On what makes Harry so unreachable.\u201d</p><p>Startled by the familiar way she had referred to Harry, Poppy stared at her without blinking. \u201cYou have some knowledge of my husband, Miss Marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Catherine. I would like very much for you to consider me as a friend.\u201d The fair-haired woman drew in a tense breath. \u201cI was acquainted with him in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Poppy asked faintly.</p> <p>\u201cI should have told you before. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not something I can speak of easily.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was silent with amazement. It wasn\u2019t often that someone she had known for a long time was suddenly revealed in a new and surprising way. A connection between Miss Marks and Harry? That was profoundly unnerving, especially since both of them had kept it secret. She suffered a chill of confusion as an awful thought occurred to her. \u201cOh, God. Were you and Harry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing like that. But it\u2019s a complicated story, and I\u2019m not certain how to . . . well, let me start by telling you what I know about Harry.\u201d</p><p>Poppy responded with a dazed nod.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s father, Arthur Rutledge, was an exceptionally ambitious man,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cHe built a hotel in Buffalo, New York, around the time they had started to expand the port and the harbor. And he made a moderate success of it, although he was by all accounts a poor manager\u2014proud and obstinate and domineering. Arthur didn\u2019t marry until he was in his forties. He chose a local beauty, Nicolette, known for her high spirits and charm. She was less than half his age, and they had little in common. I don\u2019t know if Nicolette married him solely for his money, or if there was affection between them at the beginning. Unfortunately, Harry was born a bit too early on in the marriage\u2014there was a great deal of speculation as to whether or not Arthur was the father. I think the rumors helped to bring about an estrangement. Whatever the cause, the marriage turned bitter. After Harry\u2019s birth, Nicolette was indiscreet in her affairs, until finally she ran away to England with one of her lovers. Harry was four years old at the time.\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned pensive. She was so deep in thought, in fact, that she didn\u2019t appear to notice that the ferret had crawled into her lap. \u201cHarry\u2019s parents had taken little enough notice of him before. After Nicolette left, however, he was utterly neglected. Worse than neglected\u2014he was deliberately isolated. Arthur put him in a kind of invisible prison. The hotel staff was instructed to have as little to do with the boy as possible. He was often locked alone in his room. Even when he took his meals in the kitchen, the employees were afraid to talk to him, for fear of reprisal. Arthur had made certain that Harry was given food, clothing, and education. No one could say Harry was being maltreated, you see, because he wasn\u2019t beaten or starved. But there are ways to break someone\u2019s spirit other than physical punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Poppy asked with difficulty, trying to absorb the idea of it, a child being brought up in such a cruel manner. \u201cWas the father so vindictive that he could blame a child for his mother\u2019s actions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry was a reminder of past humiliation and disappointment. And in all likelihood, Harry isn\u2019t even Arthur\u2019s son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s no excuse,\u201d Poppy burst out. \u201cI wish . . . oh, someone should have helped him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMany of the hotel staff felt terrible guilt over what was being done to Harry. The housekeeper, in particular. At one point she noticed that she hadn\u2019t seen the child in two days, and she went looking for him. He had been locked in his room with no food . . . Arthur had been so busy, he had forgotten to let him out. And Harry was only five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one had heard him crying? Hadn\u2019t he made any noise?\u201d Poppy asked unsteadily.</p><p>Catherine looked down at the ferret, stroking him compulsively. \u201cThe cardinal rule of the hotel was never to bother the guests. It had been drilled into him since birth. So he waited quietly, hoping someone would remember him, and come for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Poppy whispered.</p> <p>\u201cThe housekeeper was so horrified,\u201d Catherine continued, \u201cthat she managed to find out where Nicolette had gone, and she wrote letters describing the situation in the hopes that they might send for him. Anything, even living with a mother like Nicolette, would be better than the terrible isolation that was imposed on Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Nicolette never sent for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until much later, when it was too late for Harry. Too late for everyone, as it turned out. Nicolette took ill with a wasting disease. It was a long, slow decline, but when the end approached, it progressed quickly. She wanted to see what had become of her son before she died, and so she wrote asking him to come. He left for London on the next available ship. He was an adult by then, twenty years of age or so. I don\u2019t know what his motives for seeing his mother were. No doubt he had many questions. I suspect there was always an uncertainty in his mind, as to whether she had left because of him.\u201d She paused, momentarily preoccupied with her own thoughts. \u201cMost often, children blame themselves for how they are treated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d Poppy exclaimed, her heart wrenched with compassion. \u201cHe was only a little boy. No child deserves to be abandoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt anyone has ever said as much to Harry,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cHe won\u2019t discuss it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did his mother say when he found her?\u201d</p><p>Catherine looked away for a moment, seeming unable to speak. She stared at the curled-up ferret in her lap, stroking his sleek fur. Eventually she managed to reply in a strained voice, her gaze still averted. \u201cShe died the day before he reached London.\u201d Her fingers twined into a tight basket. \u201cForever eluding him. I suppose to Harry, any hope of finding answers, any hope of affection, died along with her.\u201d</p><p>The three women were silent.</p><p>Poppy was overwhelmed.</p><p>What would it do to a child, to be raised in such a barren and loveless environment? It must have seemed as if the world itself had betrayed him. What a cruel burden to carry.</p><p>I will never love you, she had told him on their wedding day. And his reply . . .</p> <p>I\u2019ve never wanted to be loved. And God knows no one\u2019s done it yet.</p><p>Poppy closed her eyes sickly. This was not a problem to be solved in a conversation, or in a day, or even a year. This was a wound to the soul.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you before,\u201d she heard Catherine say. \u201cBut I was afraid it might have inclined you more strongly in Harry\u2019s favor. You\u2019ve always been so easily moved to compassion. And the truth is, Harry won\u2019t ever want your sympathy, and probably not your love. I don\u2019t think it likely that he can become the kind of husband you deserve.\u201d</p><p>Poppy looked at her through tear-hazed eyes. \u201cThen why are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause even though I\u2019ve always believed that Harry is incapable of love, I\u2019m not entirely sure. I\u2019ve never been sure about anything regarding Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Marks\u2014\u201d Poppy began, and checked herself. \u201cCatherine. What is the association between you and he? How is it that you know all this about him?\u201d</p><p>A curious series of expressions crossed Catherine\u2019s face . . . anxiety, sorrow, pleading. She began to tremble visibly, until the ferret in her lap awoke and hiccupped.</p><p>As the silence drew out, Poppy threw a questioning glance at Amelia, who gave her a subtle nod as if to say, Be patient.</p> <p>Catherine removed her spectacles and polished the perspiration-misted edges of the lenses. Her entire face had gone damp with nervousness, the fine skin gleaming with the luster of a pearl. \u201cA few years after Nicolette came to England with her paramour,\u201d she said, \u201cshe had another child. A daughter.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was left to make the connection on her own. She found herself pressing her knuckles gently against her mouth. \u201cYou?\u201d she eventually managed to get out.</p><p>Catherine lifted her face, the spectacles still in her hand. A poetic, fine-boned face, but there was something direct and decisive in the lovely symmetry of her features. Yes, there was something of Harry in that face. And a quality in her reserve that spoke of deep-trammeled emotions.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you never mentioned it?\u201d Poppy asked, bewildered. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t my husband? Why is your existence a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my protection. I took a new name. No one can ever know why.\u201d</p><p>There was much more Poppy wanted to ask, but it seemed Catherine Marks had reached the limits of her tolerance. Murmuring another apology beneath her breath, and another, she stood and set the sleepy ferret onto the rug. Snatching up her discarded shoe, she left the room. Dodger shook himself awake and followed her instantly.</p><p>Left alone with her sister, Poppy contemplated the little pile of tarts on the nearby table. A long silence passed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTea?\u201d she heard Amelia ask.</p><p>Poppy responded with a distracted nod.</p><p>After the tea was poured, they both reached for tarts, using their fingers to cradle the heavy strips of pastry, biting carefully. Tart lemon, sugar syrup, the pie crust velvety and crumbly. It was one of the tastes of their childhood. Poppy washed it down with a sip of hot milky tea.</p><p>\u201cThings that remind me of our parents,\u201d Poppy said absently, \u201cand that lovely cottage in Primrose Place . . . they always make me feel better. Like eating these tarts. And flower-print curtains. And reading Aesop\u2019s fables.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe smell of Apothecary\u2019s Roses,\u201d Amelia reminisced. \u201cWatching the rain fall from the thatched eaves. And remember when Leo caught fireflies in jars, and we tried to use them as candlelight for supper?\u201d</p><p>Poppy smiled. \u201cI remember never being able to find the cake pan, because Beatrix was forever making it into a bed for her pets.\u201d</p><p>Amelia gave an unladylike snort of laughter. \u201cWhat about the time one of the chickens was so frightened by the neighbor\u2019s dog, it lost all its feathers? And Bea got Mother to knit a little sweater for it.\u201d</p><p>Poppy spluttered in her tea. \u201cI was mortified. Everyone in the village came to see our bald chicken strutting around in a sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know,\u201d Amelia said with a grin, \u201cLeo\u2019s never eaten poultry since. He says he can\u2019t have something for dinner if there\u2019s a chance it once wore clothes.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy sighed. \u201cI never realized how wonderful our childhood was. I wanted us to be ordinary, so people wouldn\u2019t refer to us as \u2018those peculiar Hathaways.\u201d She licked a tacky spot of syrup from a fingertip, and glanced ruefully at Amelia. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to be ordinary, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear. Although, I must confess, I\u2019ve never fully understood your desire for an ordinary life. To me, the word implies dullness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me, it means safety. Knowing what to expect. There have been so many terrible surprises for us, Amelia . . . Mother and Father dying, and the scarlet fever, and the house burning . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe you would have been safe with Mr. Bayning?\u201d Amelia asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d Poppy shook her head in bemusement. \u201cI was so certain that I would be content with him. But in retrospect, I can\u2019t help thinking . . . Michael didn\u2019t fight for me, did he? Harry said something to him on the morning of our wedding, right in front of me . . . \u2018She was yours, if you\u2019d wanted her, but I wanted her more.\u2019 And even though I hated what Harry had done . . . part of me liked it that Harry didn\u2019t think of me as being beneath him.\u201d</p><p>Drawing her feet up onto the settee, Amelia regarded her with fond concern. \u201cI suppose you know already that the family can\u2019t let you go back with Harry until we\u2019re satisfied that he will be kind to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he has been,\u201d Poppy said. And she told Amelia about the day when she had sprained her ankle, and Harry had taken care of her. \u201cHe was thoughtful and gentle and . . . well, loving. And if that was a glimpse of who Harry really is, I . . .\u201d She stopped and traced the edge of her teacup, staring intently into the empty bowl of it. \u201cLeo said something to me on the way here, that I had to decide whether or not to forgive Harry for the way our marriage started. I think I must, Amelia. For my own sake as well as Harry\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo err is human,\u201d Amelia said, \u201cto forgive, absolutely galling. But yes, I think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, that Harry\u2014the one who took care of me that day\u2014doesn\u2019t surface nearly often enough. He keeps himself ridiculously busy, and he meddles with everyone and everything in that blasted hotel to avoid having to think about anything personal. If I could get him away from the Rutledge, to some quiet, peaceful place, and just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep him in bed for a week?\u201d Amelia suggested, her eyes twinkling.</p><p>Glancing at her sister in surprise, Poppy flushed and tried to stifle a laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt might do wonders for your marriage,\u201d Amelia continued. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to talk to your husband after you\u2019ve been to bed together. They just lie there feeling grateful and say yes to everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if I could convince Harry to stay here with me for a few days,\u201d Poppy mused. \u201cIs the gamekeeper\u2019s cottage in the woods still empty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the caretaker\u2019s house is much nicer, and at a more convenient distance from the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish . . .\u201d Poppy hesitated. \u201cBut it would be impossible. Harry would never agree to stay away from the hotel so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it a condition of your returning to London with him,\u201d Amelia suggested. \u201cSeduce him. For heaven\u2019s sake, Poppy, it\u2019s not that difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Poppy protested.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Seduction is merely encouraging a man to do something he already wants to do.\u201d</p><p>Poppy gave her a bemused glance. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re giving me this advice now, when you were so against the marriage in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that you\u2019re married, there\u2019s not much anyone can do except try to make the best of it.\u201d A thoughtful pause. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re making the best of a situation, it turns out far better than you could have hoped for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you,\u201d Poppy said, \u201ccould make seducing a man sound like the most pragmatic option.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amelia grinned and reached for another tart. \u201cWhat I mean to suggest is, why don\u2019t you try making a headlong dash at him?

Show him what kind of marriage you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharge at him,\u201d Poppy murmured, \u201clike a rabbit at a cat.\u201d</p><p>Amelia gave her a perplexed glance. \u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>Poppy smiled. \u201cSomething Beatrix advised me to do early on. Perhaps she\u2019s wiser than the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t doubt it.\u201d Lifting her free hand, Amelia pushed aside the edge of a white lace curtain, sunlight falling over her shining sable hair, gilding her fine features. A laugh escaped her. \u201cI see her now, coming back from her ramble in the wood. She\u2019ll be thrilled to discover that you and Leo are here. And it appears she\u2019s carrying something in her apron. Lord, it could be anything. Lovely, wild girl . . . Catherine has done wonders with her, but you know she\u2019ll never be more than half tame.\u201d</p><p>Amelia said this without worry or censure, merely accepting Beatrix for what she was, trusting that fate would be kind. Undoubtedly that was Cam\u2019s influence. He\u2019d always had the good sense to give the Hathaways as much freedom as possible, making room for their eccentricities where someone else might have crushed them. The Ramsay estate was their safe harbor, their haven, where the rest of the world dared not intrude.</p><p>And Harry would be there soon.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Harry\u2019s journey to Hampshire had been long, dull, and uncomfortable, with no companionship except his own smoldering thoughts. He had tried to rest, but as a man who found sleep difficult in even the best of circumstances, trying to doze in a jolting carriage in the daytime was impossible. He had occupied himself with making up extravagant threats to bully his wife into obedience. Then he had fantasized about what he would do to Poppy in her chastised state, until those thoughts had made him aroused and aggravated.</p> <p>Damn her, he would not be left.</p><p>Harry had never been given to introspection, finding the territory of his own heart too treacherous and tricky to examine. But it was impossible to forget the earlier time in his life, when every bit of softness and pleasure and hope had disappeared, and he\u2019d had to fend for himself. Survival had meant never allowing himself to need another person again.</p><p>Harry tried to divert his thoughts by staring at the passing scenery, the summer sky still light as the hour approached nine. Of all the places in England he had visited, he had not yet gone to Hampshire. They were traveling south of the Downs, toward the thick wood and fertile grasslands near the New Forest and Southampton. The prosperous market town of Stony Cross was located in one of the most picturesque regions of England. But the town and its environs possessed something more than mere scenic appeal\u2014a mystical quality, something difficult to put his finger on. It seemed they were traveling to a place out of time, the ancient woods harboring creatures that could only exist in myth. As evening deepened, mist collected in the valley and crept across the roads in an otherworldly haze.</p><p>The carriage turned onto the private road of the Ramsay estate, past two sets of open gates and a caretaker\u2019s house made of blue gray stone. The main house was a composite of architectural styles that shouldn\u2019t have looked right together but somehow did.</p><p>Poppy was there. The knowledge spurred him, made him desperate to reach her. It was more than desperation. Losing Poppy was the one thing he couldn\u2019t recover from, and knowing that made him feel fearful and furious and caged. The feelings catalyzed into one impetus: He would not be kept apart from her.</p><p>With all the patience of a baited badger, Harry strode to the front door, not waiting for a footman. He shoved his way into the entrance hall, two stories high with immaculate cream paneling and a curving stone staircase at the back.</p> <p>Cam Rohan was there to greet him, casually dressed in a collarless shirt, trousers, and an open leather jerkin. \u201cRutledge,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cWe were just finishing supper. Will you have some?\u201d</p><p>Harry gave an impatient shake of his head. \u201cHow is Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s have some wine, and we\u2019ll discuss a few things\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she having supper as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see her. Now.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s pleasant expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me rephrase\u2014I\u2019m going to see her, if I have to turn this place into matchsticks.\u201d</p> <p>Cam received this imperturbably, his shoulders hitching in a shrug. \u201cOutside, then.\u201d</p><p>This ready acceptance of a brawl both surprised and gratified Harry. His blood was teeming with violence, his temper on the brink of explosion.</p><p>Some part of his mind recognized that he wasn\u2019t quite himself, that the precise workings of his mind were off-kilter, his self-control dismantled. His usual cool logic had deserted him. All he knew was that he wanted Poppy, and if he had to fight for her, so be it. He would fight until he bloody well dropped.</p><p>He followed Cam through the entrance, down a side hallway, and out to a small open conservatory and garden where a pair of torches burned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say this for you,\u201d the Rom remarked conversationally, \u201cit\u2019s in your favor that your first question was not \u2018Where is Poppy\u2019 but \u2018How is Poppy.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cDevil take you and your opinions,\u201d Harry growled, stripping off his coat and tossing it aside. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for permission to take my wife back. She\u2019s mine, and I\u2019ll have her, and be damned to all of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cam turned to face him, the torchlight gleaming in his eyes and over the black layers of his hair. \u201cShe\u2019s part of my tribe,\u201d he said, beginning to circle him. \u201cYou\u2019ll go back without her, unless you can find a way to make her want you.\u201d</p><p>Harry circled as well, the chaos of his thoughts settling as he focused on his opponent. \u201cNo rules?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cNo rules.\u201d</p><p>Harry threw the first punch, and Cam dodged easily. Adjusting, calculating, Harry retreated as Cam threw a right. A pivot, and then Harry connected with a left cross. Cam had reacted a fraction too late, deflecting some of the blow\u2019s force, but not all.</p><p>A quiet curse, a rueful grin, and Cam renewed his guard. \u201cHard and fast,\u201d he said approvingly. \u201cWhere did you learn to fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York.\u201d</p><p>Cam lunged forward and flipped him to the ground. \u201cWest London,\u201d he returned.</p><p>Tucking into a roll, Harry gained his footing instantly. As he came up, he used his elbow in a backward jab into Cam\u2019s midriff.</p><p>Cam grunted. Grabbing Harry\u2019s arm, he hooked a foot around his ankle and took him down again. They rolled once, twice, until Harry sprang away and retreated a few steps.</p><p>Breathing hard, he watched as Cam leapt to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou could have put a forearm to my throat,\u201d Cam pointed out, shaking a swath of hair from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to crush your windpipe,\u201d Harry said acidly, \u201cbefore I made you tell me where my wife is.\u201d</p><p>Cam grinned. Before he could reply, however, there was a commotion as all the Hathaways poured from the conservatory. Leo, Amelia, Win, Beatrix, Merripen, and Catherine Marks. Everyone except Poppy, Harry noted bleakly. Where the hell was she?</p><p>\u201cIs this the after-dinner entertainment?\u201d Leo asked sardonically, emerging from the group. \u201cSomeone might have asked me\u2014I would have preferred cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re next, Ramsay,\u201d Harry said with a scowl. \u201cAfter I finish with Rohan, I\u2019m going to flatten you for taking my wife away from London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Merripen said with deadly calm, stepping forward, \u201cI\u2019m next. And I\u2019m going to flatten you for taking advantage of my kinswoman.\u201d</p><p>Leo glanced from Merripen\u2019s grim face to Harry\u2019s, and rolled his eyes. \u201cForget it, then,\u201d he said, going back into the conservatory. \u201cAfter Merripen\u2019s done, there won\u2019t be anything left of him.\u201d Pausing beside his sisters, he spoke quietly to Win out of the side of his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019d better do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Cam only wants to knock a bit of sense into him. But Merripen actually intends to kill him, which I don\u2019t think Poppy would appreciate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do something to stop him, Leo?\u201d Amelia suggested acidly.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a peer. We aristocrats always try to get someone else to do something before we have to do it ourselves.\u201d He gave her a superior look. \u201cIt\u2019s called noblesse oblige.\u201d</p><p>Miss Marks\u2019s brows lowered. \u201cThat\u2019s not the definition of noblesse oblige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my definition,\u201d Leo said, seeming to enjoy her annoyance.</p> <p>\u201cKev,\u201d Win said calmly, stepping forward, \u201cI would like to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>Merripen, attentive as always to his wife, gave her a frowning glance. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t it wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Win said equably. At his continued hesitation, she said, \u201cI\u2019m expecting.\u201d</p><p>Merripen blinked. \u201cExpecting what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby.\u201d</p><p>They all watched as Merripen\u2019s face turned ashen. \u201cBut how . . .\u201d he asked dazedly, nearly staggering as he headed to Win.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Leo repeated. \u201cMerripen, don\u2019t you remember that special talk we had before your wedding night?\u201d He grinned as Merripen gave him a warning glance. Bending to Win\u2019s ear, Leo murmured, \u201cWell done. But what are you going to tell him when he discovers it was only a ploy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a ploy,\u201d Win said cheerfully.</p><p>Leo\u2019s smile vanished, and he clapped a hand to his forehead. \u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhere\u2019s my brandy?\u201d And he disappeared into the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he meant to say \u2018congratulations,\u2019 \u201d Beatrix remarked brightly, following the group as they all went inside.</p><p>Cam and Harry were left alone.</p><p>\u201cI should probably explain,\u201d Cam said to Harry, looking somewhat apologetic. \u201cWin used to be an invalid, and although she\u2019s recovered, Merripen is still afraid that childbirth may be difficult for her.\u201d He paused. \u201cWe all are,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut Win is determined to have children\u2014and God help anyone who tries to say no to a Hathaway.\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head in bemusement. \u201cYour family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cam said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to us eventually.\u201d A pause, and then he asked in a matter-of-fact tone, \u201cDo you want to take up the fight again, or shall we dispense with the rest of it and go have a brandy with Ramsay?\u201d</p><p>One thing was clear to Harry: His in-laws were not normal people.</p><p>One of the loveliest aspects of Hampshire summers was that even when the days were sun drenched and warm, most evenings were cool enough for a fire. Alone in the caretaker\u2019s house, Poppy snuggled by the small, crackling hearth and read a book by lamplight. She read the same page repeatedly, unable to concentrate as she waited for Harry. She had seen his carriage pass the cottage on the way to Ramsay House, and she knew it was only a matter of time before they sent him to her. \u201cYou won\u2019t see him,\u201d Cam had told her, \u201cuntil I\u2019ve decided that his temper has cooled sufficiently.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe would never hurt me, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the same, little sister, I intend to have a few words with him.\u201d</p><p>She wore a dressing gown borrowed from Win, a ruffled pale pink garment with a white lace inset at the top. The bodice was very low, exposing her cle**age, and since Win was more slender, the garment was a bit too snug, nearly causing her br**sts to spill over the lace. Knowing that Harry liked her hair down, she had brushed it and left it loose, a feathery, fiery curtain.</p><p>There was a sound from outside, a hard strike against the door. Poppy looked up sharply, her heartbeat quickening, her stomach turning over in a lazy somersault. She set the book aside and went to the door, turning the key in the lock, pulling at the knob.</p><p>She found herself standing face-to-face with her husband, who was one step below the stoop.</p><p>This was a new version of Harry, exhausted and rumpled and brutish, a day beyond a shave. Somehow the masculine dishevelment suited him, giving his handsomeness a raw, unvarnished appeal. He looked as if he were contemplating at least a dozen ways to punish her for having escaped him. His gaze raised gooseflesh all over her.</p><p>With a deep, arid breath, she stood back to let Harry in. Carefully, she closed the door.</p><p>The silence was pressing, the air charged with emotions she couldn\u2019t even name. A pulse drummed in the backs of her knees, the insides of her elbows, and the pit of her belly as Harry\u2019s gaze raked over her. \u201cIf you ever try to leave me again,\u201d he said with quiet menace, \u201cthe consequences will be worse than you could imagine.\u201d And he went on to say something to the effect that there were rules she would have to obey, and there were things he would not tolerate, and if she needed to be taught a lesson, he would be damned happy to oblige.</p><p>Despite his blistering tone, Poppy felt a wave of tenderness. He looked so hard faced and alone. So in need of comfort.</p><p>Before she gave herself a chance to reconsider, she went forward in two strides, removing all distance between them. Taking his stiff jaw in her hands, she stood on her toes and brought herself against him, and silenced him with her mouth.</p><p>She felt the shock of that tender contact jolt all through Harry. His breath slammed in his throat, and he seized her upper arms, pushing her back just far enough to stare at her incredulously. She felt how strong he was, able to break her in two if he chose. He was motionless, riveted by whatever he saw in her expression.</p><p>Eager and intent, Poppy strained upward to put her mouth to his again. He allowed it for just a moment, then pushed her back. A swallow rippled visibly down his throat. If the first kiss had startled him into silence, the second had utterly disarmed him.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d he said hoarsely, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you. I tried to be gentle.\u201d</p><p>Poppy laid her hand softly along his cheek. \u201cIs that why you think I left, Harry?\u201d</p><p>He seemed stunned by the caress. His lips parted in a wordless question, his features stamped with exquisite frustration. She saw the moment when he stopped trying to make sense of anything.</p><p>Bending over her with a groan, he kissed her.</p><p>The shared heat of their mouths, the sinuous brush of tongue against tongue, filled her with pleasure. She answered him ardently, withholding nothing, letting him search and stroke inside her as he wished. His arms went around her, one hand clasping beneath her bottom to pull her closer.</p><p>Caught up on her toes, Poppy felt her body list forward, chests, stomachs, h*ps pressing together. He was aggressively aroused, his flesh jutting boldly against her, every hint of friction wringing out deep and resonant delight.</p><p>His lips dragged along the side of her throat, and he bent her backward until her br**sts strained the front of the dressing gown. He nuzzled into the valley of compressed flesh, stroking between her br**sts with his tongue. His hot breath mingled in the white lace, his mouth dampening her skin. Roughly he sought the tip of her breast, but it was tucked too tightly beneath the soft pink fabric. She arched desperately, wanting his mouth there, everywhere, wanting everything.</p><p>She tried to say something, perhaps suggest they go to the bedroom, but it came out as a moan. Her knees were close to buckling. Harry tugged at the front of the bodice, discovering the row of concealed hook-and-eye closures. He opened the bodice with stunning swiftness and stripped the dressing gown away, leaving her naked.</p><p>Reaching for her, he turned her away from him and pushed the gleaming fall of her hair aside. His mouth descended to the nape of her neck, kissing, almost biting, his tongue playing, while his hands slid over her smooth front. He cupped a breast, gently pinching the hardening peak while his other hand slid between her thighs.</p><p>Poppy jumped a little, gasping in anticipation as he parted her. Instinctively she tried to widen her stance for him, offering herself, and his approving purr vibrated against her neck. He held her in a deep fondling embrace, feeling her, filling her with his fingers until she arched back against him, her bare bottom cradling the shape of his erection. He coaxed sensation from her, pleasuring her vulnerable flesh.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d she panted, \u201cI\u2019m going to f-fall\u2014\u201d</p> <p>They sank to the carpeted floor in a sort of slow, grappling collapse, with Harry still behind her. He muttered against her back, imprinting words of need and praise against her skin. The texture of his mouth, wet velvet surrounded by the bristle of his jaw, caused her to shiver in pleasure. He kissed his way along the curve of her spine, following it to the small of her back.</p><p>Poppy turned around to reach for the placket of his shirt. Her fingers were unusually clumsy as she undid the four buttons. Harry held still, his chest rising and falling rapidly as he watched her with volatile green eyes. He stripped off his open waistcoat, pulled his leather braces to the sides, and tugged the shirt over his head. His chest was magnificent, broad reaches of curved muscle and tough-knit hardness covered by a light fleece of hair. She stroked him with a trembling hand and reached down to his trousers, trying to find the concealed placket at the front. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Harry said brusquely.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she insisted, determined to learn this bit of wifely knowledge. She felt his stomach against her knuckles, hard as a board. Finding the elusive button, she worked on it with both hands while Harry forced himself to wait. They both jumped as her delving fingers inadvertently brushed against his erection.</p><p>He made a choked sound, something between a groan and a laugh. \u201cPoppy.\u201d He was breathless. \u201cDamn it, please let me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be so difficult\u2014\u201d she protested, finally managing to free the button, \u201c\u2014if your trousers weren\u2019t so tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not usually.\u201d</p><p>Comprehending what he meant, she paused and met his gaze, and a shy, rueful grin curved her mouth. He took her head in his hands, staring at her with a longing that raised the hairs on the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d he said raggedly, \u201cI thought about you every minute of that twelve-hour carriage drive. About how to make you come back with me. I\u2019ll do anything. I\u2019ll buy you half of bloody London, if that will suffice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want half of London,\u201d she said faintly. Her fingers tightened on the waist of his trousers. This was Harry as she had never seen him before, all defenses down, speaking to her with raw honesty.</p><p>\u201cI know I should apologize for coming between you and Bayning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you should,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019ll never be sorry about it. Because if I hadn\u2019t done it, you\u2019d be his now. And he only wanted you if it was easy for him. But I want you any way I can get you. Not because you\u2019re beautiful or clever or kind or adorable, although the devil knows you\u2019re all those things. I want you because there\u2019s no one else like you, and I don\u2019t ever want to start a day without seeing you.\u201d</p><p>As Poppy opened her mouth to reply, he smoothed his thumb across her lower lip, coaxing her to wait until he had finished. \u201cDo you know what a balance wheel is?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slightly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one in every clock or watch. It rotates back and forth without stopping. It\u2019s what makes the ticking sound . . . what makes the hands move forward to mark the minutes. Without it, the watch wouldn\u2019t work. You\u2019re my balance wheel, Poppy.\u201d He paused, his fingers compulsively following the fine curve of her jaw up to the lobe of her ear. \u201cI spent today trying to think of what I could apologize for and maybe sound at least half sincere. And I finally came up with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not the husband you wanted.\u201d His voice turned gravelly. \u201cBut I swear on my life, if you\u2019ll tell me what you need, I\u2019ll listen. I\u2019ll do anything you ask. Just don\u2019t leave me again.\u201d</p><p>Poppy stared at him in wonder. Perhaps most women wouldn\u2019t find this talk of watch mechanisms to be terribly romantic, but she did. She understood what Harry was trying to say, perhaps even more than he himself did.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d she said softly, daring to reach out and caress his jaw, \u201cwhat am I to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d he said with a heartfelt vehemence that almost made her laugh. Leaning forward, Harry pressed his face into the silky mass of her hair.</p><p>She continued to work on his trousers, popping the last two buttons from their holes. Her fingers trembled as she gripped him tentatively. He let out a growl of pleasure, his arms sliding around her back. Unsure of how to touch him, she clasped him, squeezed gently, drew her fingertips up the hot length. She was fascinated by him, the silk and hardness and contained force of him, the way his entire body shivered as she stroked him.</p><p>His mouth sought hers in a full-open kiss, obliterating all thought. He rose above her, powerful and predatory, famished for the pleasures that were still so new to her. As he lowered her to the carpet, she realized that he was going to take her, now, here, instead of seeking the more civilized comforts of the bedroom. But he hardly seemed aware of where they were, his eyes focused only on her, his color high, his lungs pumping like hearth bellows.</p><p>Murmuring his name, she lifted her arms to him. He struggled out of the rest of his clothes and bent to feast on her br**sts . . . hot, wet mouth . . . restless tongue. She kept trying to pull him farther over her, seeking the weight of his body, needing to be anchored. She groped for the hard, aching length of him, and urged him against her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cWait . . . I have to make sure you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p> <p>But she was determined, her grip insistent, and somewhere amid his groans and pants, a husky laugh emerged. He mounted her, adjusted her hips, and paused as he struggled for a measure of self-restraint.</p><p>Poppy wriggled helplessly as she felt the gradual pressure of his entry . . . torturously slow . . . maddening, heavy, sweet.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Harry panted, hanging over her, bracing his weight on his arms to keep from crushing her. \u201cShall I stop?\u201d</p><p>The concern on his face was her undoing, filling her with warmth. Her arms slid around his neck, and she pressed kisses on his cheek, neck, ear, everywhere she could reach. Her body held him tightly down below. \u201cI want more of you, Harry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>He groaned her name and surged into her, alert to every subtle response . . . lingering when it pleased her, pressing deeper when she lifted, every slow plunge tamping more sensation inside her. She let her hands glide over his sleek, flexing back, the burning silk of his skin, loving the feel of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Following the long lines of muscle, she went lower until her palms smoothed circles over the tight curves of his backside. His response was electric, his thrusts turning more forceful, a quiet grunt escaping his throat. He liked that, she thought with a smile, or would have smiled if her mouth hadn\u2019t been so thoroughly occupied with his. She wanted to discover more about him, all the ways to please him, but the accumulating pleasure reached a tipping point and began to spill powerfully, inundating her, drowning all thought.</p><p>Her body clenched him in strong spasms, extorting release, pulling it from him. He let out a harsh cry and sank into her with a last thrust, shuddering violently. It was indescribably satisfying to feel him cl**ax inside her, his body powerful and yet vulnerable in that ultimate moment. And better still to have him lower into her arms, his head dropping on her soft shoulder. Here was the closeness she had always craved.</p><p>She cradled his head, his hair a silky tickle against her inner wrist, his breath flowing over her in hot rushes. His unshaven bristle was scratchy against the tender skin of her breast, but she wouldn\u2019t have moved him for all the world.</p><p>Their breathing slowed, and Harry\u2019s weight became crushingly heavy. Poppy realized he was falling asleep. She pushed at him. \u201cHarry.\u201d</p> <p>He lurched upward, blinking, his gaze disoriented.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed,\u201d Poppy murmured, rising. \u201cThe bedroom is just over there.\u201d She murmured a few encouragements, urging him to follow. \u201cDid you bring a traveling bag?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr a gentleman\u2019s case?\u201d</p><p>Harry glanced at her as if she\u2019d spoken in a foreign language. \u201cCase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, with your clothes, toiletries, that sort of . . .\u201d Perceiving how utterly exhausted he was, she smiled and shook her head. \u201cNever mind. We\u2019ll sort it out in the morning.\u201d She towed him to the bedroom. \u201cCome . . . we\u2019ll sleep . . . we\u2019ll talk later. A few more steps . . .\u201d</p><p>The wooden bed was utilitarian, but easily large enough for two, and it was made up with quilts and fresh white linens. Harry went to it without hesitation, climbing beneath the covers\u2014collapsing, really\u2014and he fell asleep with startling immediacy.</p> <p>Poppy paused to look down at the large, unshaven man in her bed. Even in his unkempt state, his dark-angel handsomeness was breathtaking. His lids trembled infinitesimally as he succumbed to encroaching dreams. Complex, remarkable, driven man. Not incapable of love . . . not at all. He merely needed to be shown how.</p><p>And just as she had a few days earlier, Poppy thought, this is the man I\u2019m married to.</p><p>Except that now, she felt a stirring of gladness.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Harry had never known such sleep, so deep and restorative that it seemed he had never experienced real sleep before, only an imitation. He felt drugged when he awoke, drunk on sleep, steeped in it.</p><p>Squinting his eyes open, he discovered that it was morning, the curtained windows limned with sunlight. He felt no overwhelming need to leap out of bed as he usually did. Rolling to his side, he stretched lazily. His hand encountered empty space.</p> <p>Had Poppy shared the bed with him? A frown gathered on his forehead. Had he slept all night with someone for the first time and missed it? Turning to his stomach, he levered himself to the other side of the bed, hunting for her scent. Yes . . . there was a flowery hint of her on the pillow, and the sheets carried a whiff of her skin, a lavender-tinged sweetness that aroused him with every breath.</p><p>He wanted to hold Poppy, to reassure himself that the previous night hadn\u2019t been a dream.</p><p>In fact, it had been so preposterously good that he felt a twinge of worry. Had it been a dream? Frowning, he sat up and scrubbed his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d he said, not really calling out for her, just saying her name aloud. Quiet as the sound was, she appeared in the doorway as if she\u2019d been waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d She was already dressed for the day in a simple blue gown, her hair in a loose braid tied with a white ribbon. How apt it was that she\u2019d been named for the showiest of wildflowers, rich and vivid, a gleaming finish to the bloom. Her blue eyes surveyed him with such attentive warmth that he felt a catch in his chest, a dart of pleasure-pain.</p><p>\u201cThe shadows are gone,\u201d Poppy said softly. Seeing that he didn\u2019t follow, she added, \u201cBeneath your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Self-consciously, Harry looked away and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>Poppy went to a chair, where his clothes had been set in a folded pile, and rummaged for his pocket watch. Flipping open the gold case, she went to the windows and parted the curtains. Vigorous sunlight pushed into the room. \u201cHalf past eleven,\u201d she said, closing the watch with a decisive snap.</p> <p>Harry stared at her blankly. Holy hell. Half the day was over. \u201cI\u2019ve never slept so late in my life.\u201d</p><p>His disgruntled surprise seemed to amuse Poppy. \u201cNo stack of managers\u2019 reports. No one rapping at the door. No questions or emergencies. Your hotel is a demanding mistress, Harry. But today, you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Harry absorbed that, a tug of inner resistance quickly vanishing into the pull of his enormous attraction to her.</p><p>\u201cWill you dispute it?\u201d she asked, looking vastly pleased with herself. \u201cThat you\u2019re mine today?\u201d</p><p>Harry found himself smiling back at her, unable to help himself. \u201cYours to command,\u201d he said. His smile turned rueful as he became uncomfortably aware of his unwashed state, his unshaven face. \u201cIs there a bathing room?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, through that door. The house is plumbed. There\u2019s cold water pumped directly from a well to the bathtub, and I have cans of hot water ready on the cookstove.\u201d She tucked the watch back into his waistcoat. Straightening, she glanced over his na**d torso with covert interest. \u201cThey sent your things from the main house this morning, along with some breakfast. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Harry had never been so ravenous. But he wanted to wash and shave, and put on fresh clothes. He felt out of his element, needing to recapture a measure of his usual equanimity. \u201cI\u2019ll wash first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She turned to go to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\u2014\u201d He waited until she glanced back at him. \u201cLast night . . .\u201d he forced himself to ask, \u201c. . . after what we . . . was it all right?\u201d</p> <p>Comprehending his concern, Poppy\u2019s expression cleared. \u201cNot all right.\u201d She paused only a second before adding, \u201cIt was wonderful.\u201d And she smiled at him.</p><p>Harry entered the cottage kitchen area, which was essentially a portion of the main room, with a small cast-iron cookstove, a cupboard, a hearth, and a pine table that served both as workstation and dining surface. Poppy had set out a feast of hot tea, boiled eggs, Oxford sausages, and massive pasties\u2014thick flaky crusts wrapped around fillings.</p><p>\u201cThese are a Stony Cross specialty,\u201d Poppy said, gesturing to a plate bearing two hefty baked loaves. \u201cOne side is filled with meat and sage, and the other side is filled with fruit. It\u2019s an entire meal. You start with the savory end, and . . .\u201d Her voice faded as she glanced up at Harry, who was clean and dressed and freshly shaven.</p><p>He looked the same as always, and yet intrinsically different. His eyes were clear and unshadowed, the green irises brighter than hawthorn leaves. Every hint of tension had vanished from his face. It seemed as if he had been replaced by a Harry from a much earlier time in his life, before he\u2019d mastered the art of hiding every thought and emotion. He was so devastating that Poppy felt hot flutters of attraction in her stomach, and her knees lost all their starch.</p><p>Harry glanced down at the oversized pastry with a crooked grin. \u201cWhich end do I start with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe only way to find out is to take a bite.\u201d</p><p>His hands went to her waist, and he turned her gently to face him. \u201cI think I\u2019ll start with you.\u201d</p><p>As his mouth lowered to hers, she yielded easily, her lips parting. He drew in the taste of her, delighting in her response. The casual kiss deepened, altered into something patient and deeply hungering . . . heat opening into more heat, a kiss with the layered merosity of exotic flowers. Eventually Harry lifted his mouth, his hands coming to her face as if he were cupping water to drink. He had a unique way of touching, she thought dazedly, his fingers gentle and artful, sensitive to nuance.</p><p>\u201cYour lips are swollen,\u201d he whispered, the tip of his thumb brushing the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Poppy pressed her cheek against one of his palms. \u201cWe\u2019ve had many kisses to make up for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than kisses,\u201d he said, and the look in those vivid eyes brought a heartbeat into her throat. \u201cAs a matter of fact\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEat, or you\u2019ll starve,\u201d she said, trying to push him into a chair. He was so much larger, so solid, that the idea of compelling him to do anything was laughable. But he yielded to the urging of her hands, and sat, and began to peel an egg.</p><p>After Harry had consumed an entire pastie, two eggs, an orange, and a mug of tea, they went for a walk. At Poppy\u2019s urging, he left off his coat and waistcoat, a state of undress that could have gotten him arrested in certain parts of London. He even left the top buttons of his shirt undone and rolled up his sleeves. Charmed by Poppy\u2019s eagerness, he took her hand and let her tug him outside.</p><p>They went across a field to a nearby wood, where a broad, leaf-carpeted path cut through the forest. The massive yews and furrowed oaks tangled their boughs in a dense roof, but the depth of shade was pierced by blades of sunlight. It was a place of abundant life, plants growing on plants. Pale green lichen frosted the oak branches, while tresses of woodbine dangled to the ground.</p><p>After Harry\u2019s ears had adjusted to the absence of city clamor, he became aware of new sounds . . . a rippling chorus of birdcalls, leaf rustlings, the burble of a nearby brook, and a rasp like a nail being drawn along the teeth of a comb.</p><p>\u201cCicadas,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cThis is the only place you\u2019ll see them in England. They\u2019re usually found only in the tropics. Only a male cicada makes that noise\u2014it\u2019s said to be a mating song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s not commenting on the weather?\u201d</p><p>Sending him a provocative sideways glance, Poppy murmured, \u201cWell, mating is rather a male preoccupation, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled. \u201cIf there\u2019s a more interesting subject,\u201d he said, \u201cI have yet to discover it.\u201d</p> <p>The air was sweet, spiced heavily with woodbine and sun-heated leaves and flowers he didn\u2019t recognize. As they went deeper into the wood, it seemed they had left the world far behind them.</p><p>\u201cI talked with Catherine,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>Harry glanced at her alertly.</p><p>\u201cShe told me why you came to England,\u201d Poppy continued. \u201cAnd she told me that she\u2019s your half sister.\u201d</p><p>Harry focused on the path before them. \u201cDoes the rest of the family know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly Amelia and Cam and I.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI would have thought she\u2019d prefer death over telling anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe impressed upon us the need for secrecy, but she wouldn\u2019t explain why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you might,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know I would never say or do anything to harm her.\u201d</p><p>Harry was quiet, turning over thoughts in his mind, reluctant to refuse Poppy anything. And yet he had made a promise to Catherine. \u201cThey\u2019re not my secrets to reveal, love. May I talk to Cat first, and tell her what I\u2019d like to explain to you?\u201d</p><p>Her hand tightened on his. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d A quizzical smile curved her lips. \u201cCat? That\u2019s what you call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you . . . is there fondness between you?\u201d</p><p>The hesitant question provoked a laugh as dry as the rustle of corn husks. \u201cI don\u2019t know, actually. Neither of us is exactly comfortable with affection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a bit more comfortable with it than you, I think.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at her warily, Harry saw that there was no censure on her face. \u201cI\u2019m trying to improve,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things Cam and I discussed last evening\u2014he said it\u2019s characteristic of Hathaway women, this need for demonstrations of affection.\u201d</p><p>Amused and fascinated, Poppy made a face. \u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s mood altered with quicksilver speed. He threw her a dazzling grin. \u201cHe compared it to working with Arabian horses . . . they\u2019re responsive, quick, but they need their freedom. You never master an Arabian . . . you become its companion.\u201d He paused. \u201cAt least, I think that\u2019s what he said. I was half dead from exhaustion, and we were drinking brandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like Cam.\u201d Poppy raised her gaze heavenward. \u201cAnd after dispensing this advice, he sent you to me, the horse.\u201d</p><p>Harry stopped and pulled her against him, nudging her braid aside to kiss her neck. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd what a nice ride it was.\u201d</p><p>She flushed and squirmed with a protesting laugh, but he persisted in kissing her, working his way up to her mouth. His lips were warm, beguiling, determined. But as soon as he gained access to her mouth, he gentled, his mouth soft against hers. He liked to tease, to seduce. Warmth swept through her, arousal flowing through her veins, prickling sweetly in hidden places.</p><p>\u201cI love kissing you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt was the worst punishment you could have devised, not letting me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a punishment,\u201d Poppy protested. \u201cIt\u2019s just that a kiss means something special to me. And after what you\u2019d done, I was afraid to be close to you.\u201d</p><p>All hint of amusement left Harry\u2019s expression. He smoothed her hair and drew the backs of his fingers softly along the side of her face. \u201cI won\u2019t betray you again. I know you have no reason to trust me, but in time I hope\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid now.\u201d</p><p>Harry was baffled by her words, and even more by the intensity of his response to them. An unfamiliar feeling welled up in him, a deep, overwhelming ardor. His voice sounded a bit strange to his own ears as he asked, \u201cHow can you trust me when you have no way of knowing if I\u2019m worthy of it?\u201d</p><p>The corners of her lips tilted upward. \u201cThat\u2019s what trust is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t help kissing her again, adoration and arousal pumping through him. He could barely feel the shape of her body through her skirts, and his hands shook with the urge to pull up the bunches of fabric, remove every obstruction between them. A quick glance along both directions of the path revealed that they were alone and unobserved. It would be so easy to lay her into the soft carpet of leaves and moss, push up her dress, and take her right there in the forest. He pulled her to the side of the path, his fingers clenching in a swath of her skirts.</p> <p>But he forced himself to stop, breathing hard with the effort to check his desire. He had to be careful with Poppy, considerate of her. She deserved better than to have her husband throwing himself on her in the woods.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d she murmured in confusion as he turned her to face away from him.</p><p>He held her from behind, his arms crossed around her front. \u201cSay something to distract me,\u201d he said, only half joking. He took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m a hairsbreadth away from ravishing you right here.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was silent for a moment. Either she was struck mute with horror, or she was considering the possibility. Evidently it was the latter, because she asked, \u201cIt can be done outside?\u201d</p><p>Despite his fierce arousal, Harry couldn\u2019t help smiling against her neck. \u201cLove, there\u2019s hardly any place it can\u2019t be done. Against trees or walls, in chairs or bathtubs, on staircases or tables . . . balconies, carriages\u2014\u201d He let out a quiet groan. \u201cDamn it, I\u2019ve got to stop this, or I won\u2019t be able to walk back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of those ways sound very comfortable,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like chairs. Chairs I can vouch for.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle rippled through her, causing her back to press against his chest.</p><p>They both waited until Harry had calmed himself sufficiently to let go of her. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthis has been a delightful walk. Why don\u2019t we go back, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re not even halfway done yet,\u201d she protested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry glanced from her expectant face to the long path that extended before them, and he sighed. They linked hands and resumed traversing the ground woven with sun and shadows.</p><p>After a minute, Poppy asked, \u201cDo you and Catherine visit each other, or correspond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly ever. We don\u2019t get on well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a subject that Harry liked to think about, much less discuss. And this business of having to talk freely with someone, withholding nothing . . . it was like being perpetually naked, except that Harry would have preferred being literally na**d in lieu of revealing his private thoughts and feelings. However, if that was the price of having Poppy, he\u2019d bloody well pay it.</p><p>\u201cAt the time I first met Cat,\u201d he said, \u201cshe was in a difficult situation. I did as much as possible to help her, but I wasn\u2019t kind about it. I\u2019ve never had much kindness to spare. I could have been better to her. I could have\u2014\u201d He gave an impatient shake of his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. I did make certain that she would be financially independent for the rest of her life. She doesn\u2019t have to work, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did she apply for a position with the Hathaways? I can\u2019t imagine why she would have wanted to subject herself to the hopeless task of making ladies of Beatrix and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine she wanted to be with a family. To know what it was like. And to keep from being lonely or bored.\u201d He stopped and gave her a questioning glance. \u201cWhy do you say it was a hopeless task? You\u2019re very much a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree failed London seasons,\u201d she pointed out.</p> <p>Harry made a scoffing sound. \u201cThat had nothing to do with being ladylike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe biggest obstacle was your intelligence. You don\u2019t bother to hide it. One of the things Cat never taught you was how to flatter a man\u2019s vanity\u2014because she doesn\u2019t have any damned idea of how to do it. And none of those idiots could tolerate the idea of having a wife who was smarter than himself. Second, you\u2019re beautiful, which meant they would always have to worry about you being the target of other men\u2019s attentions. On top of that, your family is . . . your family. Basically you were too much to manage, and they all knew they were better off finding dull, docile girls to marry. All except Bayning, who was so taken with you that the attraction eclipsed any other considerations. God knows I can\u2019t hold that against him.\u201d</p><p>Poppy gave him a wry glance. \u201cIf I\u2019m so forbiddingly intelligent and beautiful, then why did you want to marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not intimidated by your brains, your family, or your beauty. And most men are too afraid of me to look twice at my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have many enemies?\u201d she asked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cYes, thank God. They\u2019re not nearly as inconvenient as friends.\u201d</p><p>Although Harry was perfectly serious, Poppy seemed to find that highly amusing. After her laughter slowed, she stopped and turned to face him with her arms folded. \u201cYou need me, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He stopped before her, his head inclined over hers. \u201cI\u2019ve become aware of that.\u201d</p><p>The sounds of stonechats perched overhead filled the pause, their chirps sounding like pebbles being struck together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve something to ask you,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>Harry waited patiently, his gaze resting on her face.</p><p>\u201cMay we stay in Hampshire for a few days?\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned wary. \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s called a holiday. Haven\u2019t you ever gone on holiday before?\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read, walk, ride, spend a morning fishing or shooting, perhaps go calling on the neighbors . . . tour the local ruins, visit the shops in town . . .\u201d Poppy paused as she saw the lack of enthusiasm on his face. \u201c. . . Make love to your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he said promptly.</p><p>\u201cMay we stay a fortnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>Harry sighed. Eleven days away from the Rutledge. In close company with his in-laws. He was tempted to argue, but he wasn\u2019t fool enough to risk the ground he\u2019d gained with Poppy. He\u2019d come here with the expectation of a royal battle to get her back to London. But if Poppy would take him willingly into her bed, and then accompany him back with no fuss, it was worth a concession on his part.</p><p>Still . . . eleven days . . .</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll probably go mad after three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Poppy said cheerfully. \u201cNo one around here would notice.\u201d</p><p>To Mr. Jacob Valentine</p><p>The Rutledge Hotel</p><p>Embankment and Strand</p><p>London</p><p>Valentine,</p><p>I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to apprise you that Mrs. Rutledge and I have decided to remain in Hampshire until month\u2019s end.</p><p>In my absence, carry on as usual.</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>J.H. Rutledge</p><p>Jake looked up from the letter with jaw-slackening disbelief. Carry on as usual?</p><p>Nothing was usual about this.</p><p>\u201cWell, what does it say?\u201d Mrs. Pennywhistle prompted, while nearly everyone in the front office strained to hear.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not coming back until month\u2019s end,\u201d Jake said, dazed.</p><p>A strange, lopsided smile touched the housekeeper\u2019s lips. \u201cBless my soul.

The Hathaways were an extraordinary group of individuals, lively and quick-witted, with an instant collective willingness to try any ideas that came to them. They teased and laughed and squabbled and debated, but there was an innate kindness in the way they treated each other.</p><p>There was something almost magical about Ramsay House. It was a comfortable, well-run home, filled with sturdy furniture and thick carpets, and piles of books everywhere . . . but that didn\u2019t account for the extra something. One felt it immediately after crossing the front threshold, something as intangible but life-giving as sunlight. A something that had always escaped Harry.</p><p>Gradually he came to realize that it was love.</p><p>The second day after Harry\u2019s arrival in Hampshire, Leo toured him around the estate. They rode to visit some of the tenant farms, and Leo stopped to talk to various tenants and laborers. He exchanged informed comments with them about the weather, the soil, and the harvest, displaying a depth of knowledge that Harry would not have expected.</p> <p>In London, Leo played the part of disaffected rake to perfection. In the country, however, the mask of indifference dropped. It was clear that he cared about the families who lived and worked on the Ramsay estate, and he intended to make a success of it. He had designed a clever system of irrigation that brought water along stone channels they had dug from the nearby river, relieving many of the tenants of the chore of hauling water. And he was doing his utmost to bring modern methods to local farming, including convincing his tenants to plant a new variety of hybrid wheat developed in Brighton that produced higher yields and stronger straw.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re slow to accept change in these parts,\u201d Leo told Harry ruefully. \u201cMany of them still insist on using the sickle and scythe instead of the threshing machine.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve told them the nineteenth century is going to be over before they ever decide to take part in it.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Harry that the Hathaways were making a solid success of the estate not in spite of their lack of aristocratic heritage, but because of it. No traditions or habits had been passed on to them. There had been no one to protest \u201cbut this is how we\u2019ve always done it.\u201d As a result, they approached estate management as both a business and a scientific undertaking, because they knew no other way to proceed.</p><p>Leo showed Harry the estate timber yard, where the backbreaking work of cutting, hauling, and ad-sizing logs was all done by hand. Massive logs were carried on shoulders or with lug hooks, creating countless opportunities for injury.</p><p>After supper that evening, Harry sketched some plans for moving timber with a system of rollers, run planks, and dollies. The system could be constructed at a relatively low expense, and it would allow for faster production and greater safety for the estate laborers. Merripen and Leo were both immediately receptive to the idea.</p><p>\u201cIt was very kind of you to draw up those schemes,\u201d Poppy told Harry later, when they had gone to the caretaker\u2019s house for the night. \u201cMerripen was very appreciative.\u201d</p> <p>Harry shrugged casually, unfastening the back of her gown and helping to draw her arms from the sleeves. \u201cI merely pointed out a few obvious improvements they could make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings that are obvious to you,\u201d she said, \u201caren\u2019t necessarily obvious to the rest of us. It was very clever of you, Harry.\u201d Stepping out of the gown, Poppy turned to face him with a satisfied smile. \u201cI\u2019m very glad my family is getting the chance to know you. They\u2019re beginning to like you. You\u2019re being very charming, and not at all condescending, and you don\u2019t make a fuss about things like finding a hedgehog in your chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fool enough to compete with Medusa for chair space,\u201d he said, and she laughed. \u201cI like your family,\u201d he said, unhooking the front of her corset, gradually freeing her from the web of cloth and stays. \u201cSeeing you with them helps me to understand you better.\u201d</p><p>The corset made a soft thwack as he tossed it to the floor. Poppy stood before him in her chemise and drawers, flushing as he studied her intently.</p><p>An uncertain smile crossed her face. \u201cWhat do you understand about me?\u201d</p><p>Harry hooked a gentle finger beneath the strap of her chemise, easing it downward. \u201cThat it\u2019s your nature to form close attachments to the people around you.\u201d He moved his palm over the curve of her bared shoulder in a circling caress. \u201cThat you are sensitive, and devoted to those you love, and most of all . . . that you need to feel safe.\u201d He eased the other strap of her chemise down, and felt the shivers that chased through her body. He drew her against him, his arms closing around her, and she molded to him with a sigh.</p><p>After a while, he murmured softly into the pale, fragrant curve of her neck. \u201cI\u2019m going to make love to you all night, Poppy. And the first time, you\u2019re going to feel very safe. But the second time, I\u2019m going to be a little bit wicked . . . and you\u2019ll like that even more. And the third time\u2014\u201d he paused with a smile as he heard her breath catch. \u201cThe third time, I\u2019m going to do things that will mortify you when you remember them tomorrow.\u201d He kissed her gently. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll love that most of all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy couldn\u2019t quite fathom Harry\u2019s mood, devilish yet tender as he finished undressing her. He laid her back on the mattress with her legs dangling, and stood between them as he leisurely removed his shirt. As his gaze traveled over her, she blushed and tried to cover herself with her arms.</p><p>Flashing a grin, Harry bent over her, pulling her hands away. \u201cLove, if you only knew what pleasure it gives me to look at you . . .\u201d He kissed her lips, teasing them open, his tongue slipping inside the warm interior of her mouth. The hair on his chest brushed over the tips of her br**sts, a sweet and ceaseless stimulation that drew a moan from low in her throat.</p><p>His lips wandered along the arch of her throat to her br**sts. Capturing a nipple, he stroked with his tongue, making it taut and stingingly sensitive. At the same time, his hand went to her other breast, his thumb circling and prodding the peak.</p><p>She strained upward, her body trembling and flushed. His hands drifted over her in light paths, across her stomach, lower, down to the place where a sweet erotic ache had centered. Finding the humid, delicately layered flesh, he teased her with his thumbs, opened her, making her ready for him.</p><p>Her knees drew up, and she reached for him with an incoherent sound, trying to draw him over her. Instead, he sank to his knees and gripped her hips, and she felt his mouth on her.</p><p>She quivered beneath the gentle articulation of his tongue, every intricate movement provoking, tormenting, until her eyes fluttered closed and she began to breathe in wrenching sighs. His tongue entered her and lingered for an excruciating moment. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease, Harry.\u201d</p><p>She felt him stand, heard the rustle of trousers and linens being dropped. There was hot, gentle pressure at the entrance of her body, and she made a shuddering sound of relief. He pushed inside as deeply as she could accept him, a deliciously substantial invasion. She was stretched, utterly filled, and she worked her h*ps against him, trying to take even more. A slow rhythm began, his body pressing hers at just the right angle, driving the pitch of feeling higher with each luscious ingress.</p><p>Her eyes flew open as the accumulated sensation rolled up to her, relentless in its strength and velocity, and she saw his sweat-misted face above hers. He was watching her, savoring her pleasure, bending to take her helpless cries into his mouth.</p><p>When the last spasms had faded, and she was as limp as a discarded stocking, Poppy found herself cradled in Harry\u2019s arms. They reclined together on the bed, her soft limbs tangled with his harder, longer ones.</p><p>She stirred in drowsy surprise as she felt that he was still aroused. He kissed her and sat up, his hand playing in the loose fire of her hair.</p><p>Gently he guided her head to his lap. \u201cMake it wet,\u201d he whispered. Her mouth closed carefully over the pulsing head, slid as far down as she could, and lifted. Intrigued, she nuzzled the silken hardness, her tongue flicking out like a cat\u2019s.</p><p>Harry turned her so that she was positioned facedown on the mattress. Hoisting her h*ps upward, he covered her from behind, his fingers sliding between her thighs. She felt a leap of excitement, her body responding instantly to his touch.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he whispered into her hot ear, \u201cI\u2019m going to be wicked. And you\u2019ll let me do anything, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes . . .\u201d</p><p>Harry held her with firm pressure, cupping her as he pulled her against his solid weight. She felt him move her in an insinuating rocking motion, with his aroused flesh poised at the wet cove of her body. He entered her, but just barely, and each time she rocked backward, he let her have a little more. Murmuring his name, she pushed back more strongly, trying to impale herself fully. But he only laughed softly and kept her where he wanted her, maintaining the voluptuous, metrical pitch.</p><p>He was utterly in control, appropriating her flesh with dizzying skill, letting her writhe and gasp for long minutes. Dragging the length of her hair to one side, he kissed the back of her neck, his mouth strong and gnawing. Everything he did drove her pleasure higher, and he knew it, gloried in it. Poppy felt the oncoming rush of fulfillment, her senses preparing for the hot tumble of release, and only then did he take her fully, driving hard and deep into her center.</p><p>Harry held her until she stopped trembling, her body limp with satisfaction. And then he pressed her to her back and whispered one word into her ear.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>It was a long and searing night, filled with unthinkable intimacy. After the third time, they snuggled in the darkness with Poppy\u2019s head on Harry\u2019s shoulder. It was lovely to lie with someone this way, talking about anything and everything, their bodies relaxed in the aftermath of passion.</p><p>\u201cYou fascinate me in every way,\u201d Harry whispered, his hand playing gently in her hair. \u201cThere are mysteries in your soul that will take a lifetime to uncover . . . and I want to know every one of them.\u201d</p><p>No one had ever called her mysterious before. While Poppy didn\u2019t think of herself that way, she rather liked it. \u201cI\u2019m not all that mysterious, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d Smiling, he lifted her hand and pressed a kiss into the tender cup of her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman.\u201d</p><p>Poppy went for a walk with Beatrix the next afternoon, while the rest of the family dispersed on various errands: Win and Amelia went to visit an ailing friend in the village, Leo and Merripen met with a prospective new tenant, and Cam had gone to a horse auction in Southampton.</p> <p>Harry sat at a desk in the library with a detailed report from Jake Valentine. Relishing the peace and quiet\u2014rare in the Hathaway household\u2014he began to read. However, the sound of a floorboard creaking snagged his attention, and he looked toward the threshold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Catherine Marks was standing there, book in hand, her cheeks pink. \u201cForgive me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you. I meant to return a book, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Harry said at once, rising from his chair. \u201cYou\u2019re not interrupting anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a moment.\u201d She hurried to a bookshelf, replaced the volume, and paused to glance at him. Light from the window gleamed on her spectacles, obscuring her eyes.</p><p>\u201cStay in here if you like,\u201d Harry said, feeling unaccountably awkward.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you. It\u2019s a lovely day, and I thought I might walk through the gardens, or\u2014\u201d She stopped and shrugged uncomfortably.</p><p>God, how ill at ease they were with each other. Harry contemplated her for a moment, wondering what was troubling her. He had never known what to do with her, this unwanted half sister, what place in his life he could find for her. He had never wanted to care for Catherine, and yet she had always tugged at him, worried him, perplexed him.</p><p>\u201cMay I walk with you?\u201d he asked huskily.</p><p>She blinked in surprise. Her answer was long in coming. \u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>He went out with her to a small hedged garden, with heavy drifts of white and yellow daffodils all around. Squinting against the abundant sunshine, they walked along a graveled path.</p> <p>Catherine gave him an unfathomable glance, her eyes like opals in the daylight. \u201cI don\u2019t know you at all, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably know me as well as anyone,\u201d Harry said. \u201cExcept for Poppy, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cThe way you\u2019ve been this week . . . I would never have expected it of you. This affection you seem to have developed for Poppy\u2014I find it quite astonishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an act,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I can see that you\u2019re sincere. It\u2019s just that before the wedding, you said it didn\u2019t matter if Poppy\u2019s heart belonged to Mr. Bayning, as long as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I had the rest of her,\u201d Harry said, smiling in self-contempt. \u201cI was an arrogant swine. I\u2019m sorry, Cat.\u201d He paused. \u201cI understand now why you feel so protective of Poppy and Beatrix. Of all of them. They\u2019re the closest thing to a family you\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr you.\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable silence passed before Harry brought himself to admit, \u201cOr I.\u201d</p><p>They stopped at a bench set alongside the path, and Catherine seated herself. \u201cWill you?\u201d she asked, gesturing to the space beside her.</p><p>He obliged, lowering to the bench and leaning forward with his elbows braced on his knees.</p><p>They were quiet but oddly companionable, both of them wishing for some kind of affinity, not knowing quite how to achieve it.</p><p>Harry decided to start with honesty. Taking a deep breath, he said gruffly, \u201cI\u2019ve never been kind to you, Cat. Especially when you needed it most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would dispute that,\u201d she said, surprising him. \u201cYou rescued me from a very unpleasant situation, and you\u2019ve given me the means to live handsomely without having to find employment. And you never demanded anything in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owed that much to you.\u201d He stared at her, taking in the rich golden glitter of her hair, the small oval of her face, the porcelain fineness of her skin. A frown pulled at his brow. Averting his gaze, he reached up to rub the back of his neck. \u201cYou look too damned much like our mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Catherine whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t be sorry. You\u2019re beautiful, just as she was. More so. But sometimes it\u2019s difficult to see the resemblance, and not remember . . .\u201d He let out a taut sigh. \u201cWhen I found out about you, I resented you for having had so many more years with her than I\u2019d had. It was only later that I realized I was the fortunate one.\u201d</p><p>A bitter smile touched her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us could be accused of having had an excess of good fortune, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He responded with a humorless chuckle.</p><p>They continued to sit side by side, still and silent, close but not touching. The two of them had been raised not knowing how to give or receive love. The world had taught them lessons that would have to be unlearned. But sometimes life was unexpectedly generous, Harry mused. Poppy was proof of that.</p><p>\u201cThe Hathaways were a stroke of luck for me,\u201d Catherine said, as if she had read his thoughts. She removed her spectacles and cleaned them with the edge of her sleeve. \u201cBeing with them these past three years . . . it\u2019s given me hope. It has been a time of healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad of it,\u201d Harry said gently. \u201cYou deserve that, and more.\u201d He paused, searching for words. \u201cCat, I have something to ask you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy wants to know more about my past. What may I tell her, if anything, about the part when I found you?\u201d</p><p>Catherine replaced her spectacles and stared into a nearby blaze of daffodils. \u201cTell her everything,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cShe can be trusted with my secrets. And yours.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded, silently amazed by a statement he once could never have imagined her making. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I want to ask of you. A favor. I understand the reasons we can\u2019t acknowledge each other in public. But in private, from now on, I hope you\u2019ll do me the honor of . . . well, letting me act as your brother.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him with wide eyes, seeming too stunned to reply. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t have to tell the rest of the family until you\u2019re ready,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBut I would rather not hide our relationship when we\u2019re in private. You\u2019re my only family.\u201d</p><p>Catherine reached beneath her spectacles to wipe at an escaping tear.</p><p>A feeling of compassion and tenderness came over Harry, something he had never felt for her before. Reaching out, he drew her close and kissed her forehead gently. \u201cLet me be your big brother,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She watched in wonder as he went back to the house.</p> <p>For a few minutes afterward Catherine sat alone on the bench, listening to the drone of a bee, the high, sweet chirps of common swifts, and the softer, more melodious twitters of skylarks. She wondered at the change that had come over Harry. She was half afraid he was playing some kind of game with her, with all of them, except . . . it had to be real. The emotion on his face, the sincerity in his eyes, all of it was undeniable. But how could someone\u2019s character alter so greatly?</p><p>Perhaps, she mused, it wasn\u2019t so much that Harry was being altered as he was being revealed . . . layer by layer, the defenses coming off. Perhaps Harry was becoming\u2014or would become in time\u2014the man he had always been meant to be. Because he had finally found someone who mattered.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>The mail coach had arrived at Stony Cross, and a footman was dispatched to fetch a stack of letters and parcels addressed to Ramsay House. The footman brought the deliveries to the back of the house, where Win and Poppy lounged on furniture that had been brought out to the brick-paved terrace. The largest parcel was addressed to Harry.</p><p>\u201cMore reports from Mr. Valentine?\u201d Poppy asked, sipping sweet red wine as she curled next to Win on a chaise.</p> <p>\u201cIt would appear so,\u201d Harry said with a self-mocking grin. \u201cIt appears the hotel is managing brilliantly in my absence.

One could see that he was trying to be at ease with the idea of his wife carrying a child, but his concern for her practically radiated from every pore.</p><p>Harry took the other chair and opened his parcel. After reading the first few lines of the top page, he made a sound of discomfort and winced visibly. \u201cGood God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Poppy asked.</p> <p>\u201cOne of our regular guests\u2014Lord Pencarrow\u2014injured himself late last evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d Poppy\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cAnd he\u2019s such a nice old gentleman. What happened? Did he take a fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. He slid down the banister of the grand staircase, from the mezzanine level to the ground floor.\u201d Harry paused uncomfortably. \u201cHe made it all the way to the end of the balustrade\u2014where he crashed into the pineapple ornament on top of the newel post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would a man in his eighties do such a thing?\u201d Poppy asked in bewilderment.</p><p>Harry sent her a sardonic smile. \u201cI imagine he was in his cups.\u201d</p><p>Merripen was cringing. \u201cOne can only be glad his child-siring years are behind him.\u201d</p><p>Harry paused to read a few more lines. \u201cApparently a doctor was summoned, and in his opinion the damage is not permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any other news?\u201d Win asked hopefully. \u201cSomething a bit more cheerful?\u201d</p> <p>Obligingly Harry continued to read, this time out loud. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to report another unfortunate incident that occurred Friday evening at eleven o\u2019clock, involving\u2014\u201d He broke off, his gaze skimming swiftly down the page.</p><p>Before Harry managed to school his expression into impassiveness, Poppy saw that something was very wrong. He shook his head, not quite meeting her gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing of interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I see?\u201d Poppy asked gently, reaching for the page.</p><p>His fingers tightened on it. \u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d she insisted, tugging at the sheet of paper.</p><p>Win and Merripen were both quiet, exchanging a glance.</p><p>Settling back on the chaise, Poppy glanced over the letter. \u201c. . . involving Mr. Michael Bayning,\u201d she read aloud, \u201cwho appeared in the lobby without notice or warning, thoroughly inebriated and in a hostile temperament. He demanded to see you, Mr. Rutledge, and refused to accept that you were not in the hotel. To our alarm, he brandished a\u2014\u201d She stopped and took an extra breath, \u201ca revolver, and made threats against you. We tried to bring him to the front office to calm him in private. A scuffle ensued, and regrettably Mr. Bayning was able to fire a shot before I was able to disarm him. Thankfully no one was injured, although there were many anxious queries from hotel patrons afterward, and the office ceiling must be repaired. Mr. Lufton took a bad fright from the incident and experienced pains in his chest, but the doctor prescribed a day of bed rest and said he should be right as rain tomorrow. As for Mr. Bayning, he was returned home safely, and I took the initiative to reassure his father that no charges would be pressed, as the viscount seemed quite concerned about the possibility of scandal . . .\u201d</p><p>Poppy fell silent, feeling ill, shivering even though the sun was warm.</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Harry glanced sharply at her.</p><p>The carefree young man she had known would never have resorted to such sordid, irresponsible melodrama. Part of her ached for him, and part of her was appalled, and part was simply furious. Coming to her home\u2014for that was how she thought of the hotel\u2014making a scene, and worst of all, endangering people. He might have seriously injured someone, perhaps even killed someone. Dear God, there were children in the hotel\u2014hadn\u2019t Michael spared a thought for their safety?

She wished she could go to Michael right then and shout at him. And she wanted to shout at Harry as well, because no one could deny that the incident was a consequence of his perfidy.</p><p>Occupied with her roiling thoughts, she wasn\u2019t aware of how much time had passed before Harry broke the silence.</p><p>He spoke in the way she most hated: the amused, silky, callous tone of a man who didn\u2019t give a damn about anything.</p><p>\u201cHe ought to be more clever in his murder attempt. Done properly, he could make a wealthy widow of you, and then you\u2019d both have your happy ending.\u201d</p> <p>Harry knew instantly that he shouldn\u2019t have said it\u2014the comment was the kind of cold-blooded sarcasm he had always resorted to when he felt the need to defend himself. He regretted it even before he saw Merripen out of the periphery of his vision. The Rom was giving him a warning shake of his head and drawing a finger across his throat.</p><p>Poppy was red faced, her brows drawn in a scowl. \u201cWhat a dreadful thing to say!\u201d</p><p>Harry cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said brusquely. \u201cI was joking. It was in poor\u2014\u201d He ducked as something came flying at him. \u201cWhat the devil\u2014\u201d</p><p>She had thrown something at him, a cushion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a widow, I don\u2019t want Michael Bayning, and I don\u2019t want you to joke about such things, you tactless clodpole!\u201d</p> <p>As all three of them stared at her openmouthed, Poppy leapt up and stalked away, her hands drawn into fists.</p><p>Bewildered by the immediate force of her fury\u2014it was like being stung by a butterfly\u2014Harry stared after her dumbly. After a moment, he asked the first coherent thought that came to him. \u201cDid she just say she doesn\u2019t want Bayning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Win said, a smile hovering on her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what she said. Go after her, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Every cell in Harry\u2019s body longed to comply. Except that he had the feeling of standing on the edge of a cliff, with one ill-chosen word likely to send him over. He gave Poppy\u2019s sister a desperate glance. \u201cWhat should I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe honest with her about your feelings,\u201d Win suggested.</p><p>A frown settled on Harry\u2019s face as he considered that. \u201cWhat\u2019s my second option?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle this,\u201d Merripen told Win before she could reply. Standing, he slung a great arm across Harry\u2019s shoulders and walked him to the side of the terrace. Poppy\u2019s furious form could be seen in the distance. She was walking down the drive to the caretaker\u2019s house, her skirts and shoes kicking up tiny dust storms.</p><p>Merripen spoke in a low, not unsympathetic tone, as if compelled to guide a hapless fellow male away from danger. \u201cTake my advice, gadjo . . . never argue with a woman when she\u2019s in this state. Tell her you were wrong and you\u2019re sorry as hell. And promise never to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not exactly certain what I did,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. Apologize anyway.\u201d Merripen paused and added in whisper, \u201cAnd whenever your wife is angry . . . for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t try logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Win said from the chaise.</p><p>Harry caught up with Poppy by the time she was halfway to the caretaker\u2019s house. She didn\u2019t glance at him, only glared ahead with her jaw set.</p><p>\u201cYou think I drove him to it,\u201d Harry said quietly, keeping pace with her. \u201cYou think I ruined his life as well as yours.\u201d</p><p>That fueled Poppy\u2019s outrage until she wasn\u2019t certain whether she might cry or slap him. Blast him, he was going to drive her mad.</p> <p>She had been in love with a prince, and she had ended up in the arms of a villain, and it would be so much easier if she could continue to view everything in those simplistic terms. Except that her prince was not nearly as perfect as he had seemed . . . and her villain was a caring, passionate man.</p><p>It was finally becoming clear to her that love wasn\u2019t about finding someone perfect to marry. Love was about seeing through to the truth of a person, and accepting all their shades of light and dark. Love was an ability. And Harry had it in abundance, even if he wasn\u2019t ready to come to terms with it yet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t presume to tell me what I think,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong on both counts. Michael is responsible for his own behavior, which in this case was\u2014\u201d she paused to deliver a vicious kick to a stray pebble, \u201c\u2014revoltingly self-indulgent. Immature. I\u2019m sorely disappointed in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t blame him,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI would have done far worse, were I in his position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf that I have no doubt,\u201d Poppy said acidly.</p><p>He scowled but remained silent.</p><p>Approaching another pebble, Poppy kicked it with a vicious swipe of her foot. \u201cI hate it when you say cynical things,\u201d she burst out. \u201cThat stupid remark about making me a wealthy widow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Harry said quickly. \u201cThat was unfair, and wrong. I should have considered that you were distressed because you still care for him, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Poppy stopped dead in her tracks, staring at him with scornful astonishment. \u201cOh! How a man whom everyone considers so intelligent can be such an imbecile\u2014\u201d Shaking her head, she continued to storm along the drive.</p><p>Bewildered, Harry followed at her heels.</p><p>\u201cDoes it not occur to you,\u201d her words came winging over her shoulder like angry bats, \u201cthat I might not like the idea of someone making threats against your life? That I might be just the least little bit bothered by someone coming to our home waving a gun about with the intention of shooting you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took Harry a long time to answer. In fact, they had nearly reached the house by the time he replied, his voice thick and odd. \u201cYou\u2019re concerned for my safety? For . . . me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to be,\u201d she muttered, stomping to the front door. \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Poppy reached for the handle, but Harry stunned her by flinging it open, whisking her inside, and slamming it shut. Before she could even draw breath, he had pushed her back up against the door, a bit rough in his eagerness.</p><p>She had never seen him look quite this way, incredulous, anxious, yearning.</p><p>His body crowded hers, his breath falling in swift strikes against her cheek. She saw a visible pulse in the strong plane of his throat. \u201cPoppy . . . Are you . . .\u201d He was forced to pause, as if he were fumbling to speak in a foreign language.</p><p>Which he was, in a way.</p><p>Poppy knew what Harry wanted to ask, and yet she didn\u2019t want him to. He was forcing the issue\u2014it was too soon\u2014she wanted to beg him to be patient, for both their sakes.</p><p>He managed to get the words out. \u201cAre you starting to care for me, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly, but that didn\u2019t seem to put him off at all.</p><p>Harry leaned his face against hers, his lips parting against her cheek in a nuzzling half kiss. \u201cNot even a little?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot the slightest bit.\u201d</p><p>He pressed the side of his cheek to hers, his lips playing with the wisps of hair at her ear. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you say it?\u201d</p><p>He was so large and warm, and everything in her wanted to surrender to him. A fine trembling started inside her, radiating outward from her bones to her skin. \u201cBecause if I did, you wouldn\u2019t be able to run from me fast enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never run from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you would. You\u2019d turn distant and push me away, because you\u2019re not nearly ready to take such a risk yet.\u201d</p><p>Harry pressed the front of his body all along hers, his forearms braced on either side of her head. \u201cSay it,\u201d he urged, tender and predatory. \u201cI want to hear what it sounds like.\u201d</p><p>Poppy had never thought it was possible to be amused and aroused at the same time. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Slowly, her arms went around his lean waist.</p><p>If only Harry knew the extent of what she felt for him. The very second she judged that he was ready, the moment she was certain it wouldn\u2019t cause their marriage to lose ground, she would tell him how dearly she loved him. She could hardly wait.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you say it,\u201d Harry said, his sensuous mouth covering hers, his hands going to the fastenings of her bodice.</p><p>Poppy couldn\u2019t control a shiver of anticipation. No, he wouldn\u2019t . . . but for the next few hours, she would certainly enjoy letting him try.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>To the Hathaways\u2019 general surprise, Leo elected to return to London the same day as the Rutledges. His original intention had been to stay in Hampshire the remainder of the summer, but he had decided instead to take on a small commission to design a conservatory addition to a Mayfair mansion. Poppy wondered privately if his change of plan had anything to do with Miss Marks. She suspected they had quarreled, because it seemed they were going to great extremes to avoid each other now. Even more than usual.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go,\u201d Merripen had said in outrage when Leo told him he was heading back to London. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing to sow the turnip crop. There is much to be decided, including the composition of the manure, and how best to approach the harrowing and plowing, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMerripen,\u201d Leo had interrupted sarcastically, \u201cI know you consider my help to be invaluable in these matters, but I believe that somehow you\u2019ll all manage to drill turnip seed competently without my involvement. As for the manure composition, I can\u2019t help you there. I have a very democratic view of excrement\u2014it\u2019s all shit to me.\u201d</p><p>Merripen had responded with a volley of Romany that no one except Cam could understand. And Cam refused to translate a word of it, claiming there were no English equivalents and that was a good thing.</p><p>After making his farewells, Leo left for London in his carriage. Harry and Poppy were slower to depart, having a last cup of tea, a last lingering glimpse of the green summer-dressed estate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost surprised you\u2019re letting me take her,\u201d Harry said to Cam after handing his wife into the carriage.</p><p>\u201cOh, we voted this morning, and it was a unanimous decision,\u201d his brother-in-law replied in a matter-of-fact tone.</p><p>\u201cYou voted on my marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we decided you fit in with the family quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Harry said, just as Cam closed the carriage door.</p><p>After a pleasant and uneventful journey, the Rutledges arrived in London. To discerning outsiders, particularly the hotel employees, it was clear that Poppy and Harry had acquired the mysterious and intangible bond of two people who had made a promise to each other. They were a couple.</p><p>Although Poppy was happy to return to the Rutledge, she had a few private concerns about how her relationship with Harry would proceed\u2014if perhaps he might slip back into his former habits. To her reassurance, Harry had firmly set a new course, and he seemed to have no intention of deviating from it.</p><p>The differences in him were observed with gratified wonder by the hotel staff the first full day of his return. Poppy had brought back gifts, including jars of honey for the managers and everyone in the front office, a length of bobbin lace for Mrs. Pennywhistle, cured Hampshire hams and sides of smoked bacon for Chef Broussard and Chef Rupert and the kitchen staff, and for Jake Valentine, a sheep hide that had been tanned and polished with smooth stones until the material had been worked into butter-soft glove leather. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After delivering the presents, Poppy sat in the kitchen and chattered animatedly about her visit to Hampshire. \u201c. . . and we found a dozen truffles,\u201d she told Chef Broussard, \u201ceach one nearly as large as my fist. All at the roots of a beech tree, and barely a half inch beneath the soil. And guess how we discovered them? My sister\u2019s pet ferret! He ran over to them and started nibbling.\u201d</p><p>Broussard sighed dreamily. \u201cWhen I was a boy, I lived in P\u00e9rigord for a time. The truffles there would make one weep. So delicious and dear, they were usually only eaten by nobles and their kept women.\u201d He looked at Poppy expectantly. \u201cHow did you prepare them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe chopped some leeks and saut\u00e9ed them in butter and cream, and\u2014\u201d She paused as she noticed the staff in a sudden flurry of activity, scrubbing, chopping, stirring. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw that Harry had entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Mrs. Pennywhistle said, while she and Jake stood to face him.</p> <p>Harry motioned for them to stay seated. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said with a slight smile. \u201cForgive me for interrupting.\u201d He came to stand beside Poppy, who was perched on a stool. \u201cMrs. Rutledge,\u201d he murmured, \u201cI wonder if I might steal you away for just a few minutes? There\u2019s a . . .\u201d His voice faded as he stared into his wife\u2019s face. She had looked up at him with a flirting little grin that had apparently disrupted his train of thought.</p><p>And who could blame him? Jake Valentine thought, both amused and similarly mesmerized. Although Poppy Rutledge had always been a beautiful woman, there was an extra glow about her now, a new brilliance in her blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe carriage maker,\u201d Harry said, recollecting himself. \u201cThey\u2019ve just delivered your carriage. I hoped you might come look at it, and make certain everything is to your satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d love to.\u201d Poppy took another bite of her brioche, a warm puff of glazed bread touched with butter and jam. She held the last bit up to Harry\u2019s lips. \u201cHelp me finish?\u201d</p><p>They all watched in astonishment as Harry took the tidbit obligingly into his mouth. And, holding her wrist in his hand, he nipped at her fingertip to remove a little spot of jam. \u201cDelicious,\u201d he said, helping her from the stool. He glanced at the three of them. \u201cI\u2019ll return her shortly. And Valentine . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s come to my attention that you haven\u2019t gone on holiday in far too long. I want you to arrange something for yourself immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do on holiday,\u201d Jake protested, and Harry smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat, Valentine, is why you need one.\u201d</p><p>After Harry had escorted his wife from the kitchen, Jake looked at the others with a dumbfounded expression. \u201cHe\u2019s an entirely different man,\u201d he said dazedly.</p><p>Mrs. Pennywhistle smiled. \u201cNo, he\u2019ll always be Harry Rutledge. It\u2019s just that now . . . he\u2019s Harry Rutledge with a heart.\u201d</p> <p>As the hotel was a virtual clearinghouse of gossip, Poppy was privy to scandals and private disclosures concerning people from every part of London. To her dismay, there were persistent rumors about the continuing decline of Michael Bayning . . . his frequent public drunkenness, gambling, brawling, and all manner of behavior unbecoming to a man of his position. Some of the rumors were linked to Poppy, of course, and her precipitate wedding to Harry. It saddened Poppy profoundly to hear what a mess Michael was making of his life, and she wished there were something she could do about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the one subject I can\u2019t discuss with Harry,\u201d she told Leo, visiting his terrace one afternoon. \u201cIt puts him in a dreadful temper\u2014he gets very quiet and stern faced, and last night we actually quarreled about it.\u201d</p><p>Taking a cup of tea from her, Leo arched a sardonic brow at the information. \u201cSis, as much as I would prefer to take your side in all things . . . why should you want to discuss Michael Bayning with your husband? And what the devil is there to argue about? That chapter in your life is closed. Were I married\u2014and thank God I never will be\u2014I wouldn\u2019t welcome the subject of Bayning with any more enthusiasm than Harry apparently does.\u201d</p><p>Poppy frowned into her own cup of tea, slowly stirring a sugar lump into the steaming amber liquid. She waited until it had thoroughly dissolved before replying. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Harry took exception to a request I made. I said I wanted to visit Michael, and that perhaps I might be able to talk some sense into him.\u201d As she saw Leo\u2019s expression, she added defensively, \u201cOnly for a few minutes! A supervised visit. I even told Harry he was welcome to accompany me. But he forbade me in a very overbearing manner, without even letting me explain why I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have put you over his knee,\u201d Leo informed her. As her mouth fell open, he set his tea down, made her do the same, and took both her hands in his. His expression was a comical mixture of reproof and sympathy. \u201cDarling Poppy, you have a kind heart. And I\u2019ve no doubt that for you, visiting Bayning is a mission of mercy comparable to Beatrix rescuing a rabbit from a snare. But this is where it becomes clear that you are still woefully ignorant of men. Since it falls to me to explain to you . . . we\u2019re not nearly as civilized as you seem to think. In fact, we were much happier in the days when we could simply chase off a rival at spearpoint. Therefore, asking Harry to allow you\u2014by all accounts, the only person on earth he actually gives a damn about\u2014to visit Bayning and soothe his wounded feelings . . .\u201d Leo shook his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut Leo,\u201d Poppy protested, \u201cyou remember the days when you were doing the same things that Michael is doing. I would have thought you\u2019d have sympathy for him.\u201d</p><p>Letting go of her hands, Leo smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cThe circumstances were a bit different. I had to watch a girl I loved die in my arms. And yes, afterward I behaved very badly. Even worse than Bayning. But a man on that path can\u2019t be rescued, sweetheart. He has to follow it off a cliff. Perhaps Bayning will survive the fall, perhaps not. In either case . . . no, I have no sympathy for him.\u201d</p><p>Poppy picked up her tea and took a hot, bracing swallow. Presented with Leo\u2019s viewpoint, she felt uncertain and even a bit sheepish. \u201cI\u2019ll let the matter drop, then,\u201d she said. \u201cI may have been wrong to ask it of Harry. Perhaps I should apologize to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that,\u201d Leo said softly, \u201cis one of the things I\u2019ve always adored about you, sis. The willingness to reconsider, and even change your mind.\u201d</p> <p>After her visit to her brother had concluded, Poppy went to the jeweler\u2019s shop on Bond Street. She retrieved a gift that she\u2019d had made for Harry, and returned to the hotel.</p><p>Thankfully, she and Harry had planned to have supper sent up to their apartment that night. It would allow her the time and privacy she needed to discuss their argument of the previous evening. And she would apologize. In her desire to help Michael Bayning, she hadn\u2019t stopped to consider Harry\u2019s feelings, and she wanted very much to atone.</p><p>The situation reminded her of something her mother had often said about marriage: \u201cNever remember his mistakes, but always remember your own.\u201d</p><p>After taking a perfumed bath, Poppy donned a light blue dressing gown and brushed out her hair, leaving it loose in the way he liked.</p><p>Harry entered the apartment as the clock struck seven. He looked more like the Harry she remembered from the beginning of their marriage, his face grim and tired, his gaze wintry.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d she murmured, going to kiss him. Harry held still, not rebuffing her, but he was hardly warm or encouraging. \u201cI\u2019ll send for dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone for me, thank you. I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>Taken aback by his flat tone, Poppy regarded him with concern. \u201cDid something happen today? You look all in.\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged out of his coat and laid it on a chair. \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from a meeting at the War Office, where I told Sir Gerald and Mr. Kinloch that I\u2019ve decided not to work on the new gun design. They receive my decision as nothing short of treason. Kinloch even threatened to lock me in a room somewhere until I\u2019d come up with a set of drawings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Poppy grimaced in sympathy. \u201cThat must have been dreadful. Are you . . . are you disappointed that you won\u2019t be doing the work for them?\u201d</p><p>Harry shook his head. \u201cAs I told them, there are better things I could do for my fellow countrymen. Working on agricultural technology, for one thing. Putting food in a man\u2019s belly is a vast improvement over inventing a more efficient way to put a bullet in him.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy smiled. \u201cThat was well done of you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t return the smile, only leveled a cool, speculative stare at her. His head tilted a bit. \u201cWhere were you today?\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s pleasure dissolved as she understood.</p><p>He was suspicious of her.</p><p>He thought she had gone to visit Michael.</p><p>The injustice of that, and the hurt of being mistrusted, caused her face to stiffen. She answered in a brittle voice. \u201cI went out for an errand or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of errand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not say.\u201d</p> <p>Harry\u2019s face was hard and implacable. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not giving you a choice. You will tell me where you went and whom you saw.\u201d</p><p>Reddening in outrage, Poppy whirled away from him and clenched her fists. \u201cI don\u2019t have to account for every minute of my day, not even to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday you do.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cTell me, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>She laughed incredulously. \u201cSo you can verify my statements, and decide whether I\u2019m lying to you?\u201d</p><p>His silence was answer enough.</p><p>Hurt and furious, Poppy went to her reticule, which had been set on a small table, and rummaged in it. \u201cI went to visit Leo,\u201d she snapped without looking at him. \u201cHe\u2019ll vouch for me, and so will the driver. And afterward I went to Bond Street to pick up something I had bought for you. I had wanted to wait for an appropriate moment to give it to you, but apparently that\u2019s not possible now.\u201d</p><p>Extracting an object encased in a small velvet pouch, she resisted the temptation to throw it at him. \u201cHere\u2019s your proof,\u201d she muttered, pushing it into his hands. \u201cI knew you would never get one of these on your own.\u201d</p><p>Harry opened the pouch slowly, and let the object slide into his hand.</p><p>It was a pocket watch with a solid gold casing, exquisitely simple except for the engraved initials JHR on the lid.</p><p>There was a perplexing lack of reaction from Harry. His dark head was bent so that Poppy couldn\u2019t even see his face. His fingers closed around the watch, and he let out a long, deep breath.</p><p>Wondering if she had done the wrong thing, Poppy turned blindly to the bellpull. \u201cI hope you like it,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cI\u2019ll ring for dinner now. I\u2019m hungry, even if you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>All at once Harry seized her from behind, wrapping his arms around her, one hand still gripped around the watch. His entire body was trembling, powerful muscles threatening to crush her. His voice was low and remorseful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Poppy relaxed against him as he continued to hold her. She closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he said into the loose sheaf of her hair, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s just that the thought of you having any feelings for Bayning . . . it . . . doesn\u2019t bring out the best in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an understatement,\u201d Poppy said darkly. But she turned in his arms and pressed against him, her hand sliding up to the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cIt tortures me,\u201d he admitted gruffly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to care for any man but me. Even if I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s hurt faded as she reflected that the experience of being loved was still very new to Harry. The problem wasn\u2019t a lack of trust in her, it was a result of his own self-doubt. Harry would probably always be possessive where she was concerned.</p><p>\u201cJealous,\u201d she accused softly, pulling his head down to her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no need for it. The only feelings I have for Michael Bayning are pity and kindness.\u201d She brushed her lips against his ear. \u201cDid you see the engraving on the watch? No? . . . It\u2019s inside the lid. Look.\u201d</p><p>But Harry didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t do anything except hold her as if she were a lifeline. She suspected he was too overcome to do anything at the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a quote by Erasmus,\u201d she said helpfully. \u201cMy father\u2019s favorite monk, after Roger Bacon. The watch is inscribed,\u2018It is the chiefest point of happiness that a man is willing to be what he is.\u2019 \u201d At Harry\u2019s continued silence, she couldn\u2019t help throwing more words into the void. \u201cI want you to be happy, you exasperating man. I want you to understand that I love you for exactly what you are.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s breathing turned hard and rough. He held her in a grip that would have taken a hundred men to break. \u201cI love you, Poppy,\u201d he said raggedly. \u201cI love you so much that it\u2019s absolute hell.\u201d</p><p>She tried to suppress a smile. \u201cWhy is it hell?\u201d she asked sympathetically, stroking his nape.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have so much to lose now. But I\u2019m going to love you anyway, because there doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to stop doing it.\u201d He kissed her forehead, eyelids, cheeks. \u201cI have so much love for you, I could fill rooms with it. Buildings. You\u2019re surrounded by it wherever you go, you walk through it, breathe it . . . it\u2019s in your lungs, and under your tongue, and between your fingers and toes . . .\u201d His mouth moved passionately over hers, urging her lips apart.</p><p>It was a kiss to level mountains and shake stars from the sky. It was a kiss to make angels faint and demons weep . . . a passionate, demanding, soul-searing kiss that nearly knocked the earth off its axis.</p><p>Or at least that was how Poppy felt about it.</p><p>Harry swept her up in his arms and carried her to the bed. He lowered over her and smoothed the rich tumble of her hair. \u201cI never want to be apart from you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy an island and take you there. A ship will come once a month with supplies. The rest of the time it will be just the two of us, wearing leaves and eating exotic fruit and making love on the beach . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d start a produce export business and organize a local economy within a month,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>Harry groaned as he recognized the truth of it. \u201cGod. Why do you tolerate me?\u201d</p><p>Poppy grinned and slid her arms around his neck. \u201cI like the side benefits,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd really, it\u2019s only fair since you tolerate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d Harry said with heated earnestness. \u201cEverything about you, everything you do or say. And even if you have a little flaw here or there . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlaws?\u201d she asked in mock indignation.</p><p>\u201c. . . I love those best of all.\u201d</p><p>Harry undressed her, his efforts hindered by the fact that Poppy was trying to undress him at the same time. They rolled and struggled with their clothing, and despite the intensity of their mutual need, a few gasps of laughter escaped as they found themselves in a hopeless tangle of fabric and limbs. Finally, they both emerged na**d and panting.</p> <p>Harry hooked a hand beneath her knee, widening the spread of her thighs, and he took possession of her in a forceful plunge. Poppy cried out, quivering in surprise at the power of his rhythm. His body was elegant and strong, claiming her in demanding thrusts. Her br**sts were cupped in his hands, his mouth covering a taut peak, and he suckled her in time to the lunges of his hips.</p><p>A deep flush came over her, the hard slide of his flesh in hers offering exquisite relief and erotic torment. She moaned and struggled to match his rhythm as ripples of pleasure went through her, stronger and stronger until she couldn\u2019t move at all. And he drank in her sobs with his mouth, making love to her until she eventually quieted, her body replete with sensation.</p><p>Harry stared down at her intently, his face gleaming with perspiration, eyes tiger bright. Poppy wrapped her arms and legs around him, trying to absorb him, wanting him as close as physically possible. \u201cI love you, Harry,\u201d she said. The words made him catch his breath, shudders resounding through his body. \u201cI love you,\u201d she repeated, and he surged inside her, hard and deep, and found his release. She curled up against him afterward, while his hand played gently in her hair. They slept together, dreamed together, all barriers finally gone.</p><p>And the next day, Harry disappeared.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>For a man who revered schedules as much as Harry, being late was not only unusual, it was akin to atrocity. Therefore, when he didn\u2019t return to the hotel from an afternoon visit to his fencing club, Poppy was more than a little concerned. When three hours had passed and her husband still wasn\u2019t back, she rang for Jake Valentine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The assistant came at once, his expression perturbed, his brown hair in disarray as if he\u2019d been tugging on it distractedly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Valentine,\u201d Poppy said with a frown, \u201cdo you know anything about Mr. Rutledge\u2019s whereabouts at present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. The driver just returned without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, bewildered.</p> <p>\u201cThe driver waited at the usual time and place, and when Mr. Rutledge didn\u2019t appear after an hour, he went inside the club to make inquiries. A search was done. Apparently Mr. Rutledge was nowhere to be found on the premises. The master of the fencing club asked various members if they had seen Mr. Rutledge go off with someone, perhaps enter a carriage, or even mention his plans, but no one had seen or heard anything after Mr. Rutledge finished his practice.\u201d Valentine paused and drew the side of his fist over his mouth, a nervous gesture Poppy had never seen him make before. \u201cHe seems to have vanished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas this ever happened before?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Valentine shook his head.</p><p>They stared at each other in the mutual recognition that something was very wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back to the club and search again,\u201d Valentine said. \u201cSomeone had to have seen something.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy steeled herself to wait. Perhaps it was nothing, she told herself. Perhaps Harry had gone somewhere with an acquaintance, and he would return any moment. But she knew instinctively that something had happened to him. It seemed her blood had turned to ice water . . . she was shaky, numb, terrified. She paced around the apartments, and then she went downstairs to the front office, where the receptionist and concierge were similarly distracted.</p><p>Evening had settled deeply over London by the time Valentine finally returned. \u201cNot a trace of him anywhere,\u201d he said.</p><p>Poppy felt a chill of fear. \u201cWe must notify the police.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI already have. I once received instructions from Mr. Rutledge in case something like this ever occurred. I\u2019ve notified a Special Constable who works from the Bow Street office, and also a South London cracksman named William Edgar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCracksman? What is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThief. And from time to time he does a bit of smuggling. Mr. Edgar is familiar with every street and rookery in London.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy husband instructed you to contact a constable and a criminal?\u201d</p><p>Valentine looked a bit sheepish. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Poppy put her fingertips to her temples, trying to calm her racing thoughts. A painful sob rose in her throat before she could swallow it back down. She dragged a sleeve across her wet eyes. \u201cIf he\u2019s not found by morning,\u201d she said, taking the handkerchief he handed to her, \u201cI want to post a reward for any information that leads to his safe return.\u201d She blew her nose indelicately. \u201cFive thousand\u2014no, ten thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we should give a list to the police.\u201d</p><p>Valentine looked at her blankly. \u201cA list of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf all the people who might wish to do him harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Valentine muttered. \u201cMost of the time I can\u2019t tell the difference between his friends and his enemies. Some of his friends would love to kill him, and one or two of his enemies have actually named their children after him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think Mr. Bayning should be considered a suspect,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cI had thought of that,\u201d Valentine admitted. \u201cIn light of the recent threats he\u2019s made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the meeting at the War Office yesterday\u2014Harry said they were displeased with him, and he\u2014\u201d Her breath stopped. \u201cHe said something about Mr. Kinloch, that he wanted to lock Harry away somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go tell the Special Constable immediately,\u201d Valentine said. Seeing the way Poppy\u2019s eyes flooded and her mouth contorted, he added hastily, \u201cWe\u2019ll find him. I promise. And remember that whatever Mr. Rutledge is dealing with, he knows how to take care of himself.\u201d</p><p>Unable to reply, Poppy nodded and pressed the wadded-up handkerchief to her nose.</p><p>As soon as Valentine had departed, she spoke to the concierge in a tear-clotted voice. \u201cMr. Lufton, may I write a note at your desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, certainly, ma\u2019am!\u201d He arranged paper, ink, and a pen with a steel nib on the desk, and stood back respectfully as she began to write.</p><p>\u201cMr. Lufton, I want this taken to my brother, Lord Ramsay, immediately. He is going to help me search for Mr. Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, but . . . do you think that wise at this hour? I\u2019m sure Mr. Rutledge would not want you to compromise your safety by going out at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t, Mr. Lufton. But I can\u2019t wait here without doing something. I\u2019ll go mad.\u201d</p><p>To Poppy\u2019s vast relief, Leo came at once, his cravat askew and his waistcoat unbuttoned, as if he\u2019d dressed hastily. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked shortly. \u201cAnd what did you mean, \u2018Harry\u2019s gone missing?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Poppy described the situation as quickly as possible, and curled her fingers into his sleeve. \u201cLeo, I need you to take me somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She saw from her brother\u2019s face that he understood immediately. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d He let out a taut sigh. \u201cI had better start praying that Harry won\u2019t be found for a good long while. Because when he learns that I took you to see Michael Bayning, my life won\u2019t be worth a tin of oysters.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After questioning Michael\u2019s manservant as to his whereabouts, Leo and Poppy went to Marlow\u2019s, a club so exclusive that one could only belong if his grandfather and father had been counted among its former members. The ennobled crowd at Marlow\u2019s looked down on the rest of the populace\u2014including less-privileged bluebloods\u2014with undiluted disdain. Having always been curious to see the inside of the place, Leo was more than pleased to go there in search of Michael Bayning.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be allowed past the door,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cYou\u2019re precisely the kind of person they want to keep out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll merely tell them that Bayning is a suspect in a kidnapping plot, and if they don\u2019t let me look for him, I\u2019ll see that they\u2019re charged as accessories.\u201d</p><p>Poppy watched through the carriage window as Leo went up to the Marlow\u2019s classical white stone and stucco fa\u00e7ade. After a minute or two of conversation with the doorman, Leo went into the club.</p> <p>Folding her arms tightly, Poppy tried to warm herself. She felt cold from the inside out, ill with panic. Harry was somewhere in London, perhaps injured, and she couldn\u2019t reach him. She couldn\u2019t do anything for him. Remembering what Catherine had told her about Harry\u2019s childhood, that he had been locked in a room for two days with no one giving a thought to him, she nearly burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find you,\u201d she whispered, rocking a little in her seat. \u201cI\u2019ll be there soon. Just a little longer, Harry.\u201d</p><p>The carriage door was wrenched open with startling suddenness.</p><p>Leo stood there with Michael Bayning, who was shockingly ravaged by his recent habits of excess. His fine clothes and meticulously tied cravat only served to accentuate the bloat of his jaw and the ruddy web of broken capillaries on his cheeks.</p><p>Poppy stared at him blankly. \u201cMichael?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s halfway pickled,\u201d Leo told her, \u201cbut coherent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Rutledge,\u201d Michael said, his lip curling in a sneer. As he spoke, the scent of strong spirits wafted into the carriage. \u201cYour husband\u2019s gone missing, has he? It seems I\u2019m supposed to spout some kind of information about it. Problem is . . .\u201d He averted his face and suppressed a quiet belch. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I think you had something to do with his disappearance.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a distorted smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for the past four hours, and before that I was at my home. I\u2019m sorry to say I haven\u2019t arranged any underhanded plot to harm him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made no secret of your animosity,\u201d Leo pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019ve made threats against him. You even came to the hotel with a revolver. You\u2019re the most likely person to have been involved in his disappearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch as I\u2019d like to claim responsibility,\u201d Michael said, \u201cI can\u2019t. The satisfaction of killing him isn\u2019t worth being hanged for it.\u201d His bloodshot eyes focused on Poppy. \u201cHow do you know he hasn\u2019t decided to spend the evening with some lightskirt? He\u2019s probably tired of you now. Go home, Mrs. Rutledge, and pray that he doesn\u2019t come back. You\u2019re better off without the bastard.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy blinked as if she\u2019d been slapped.</p><p>Leo interceded coolly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be answering scores of questions about Harry Rutledge in the next day or two, Bayning. Everyone, including your friends, will be pointing fingers in your direction. By tomorrow morning, half of London will be looking for him. You could spare yourself a great deal of trouble by helping us resolve the matter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, I had nothing to do with it,\u201d Michael snapped. \u201cBut I hope to hell that he\u2019s found soon\u2014facedown in the Thames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Poppy cried in outrage. Both men glanced at her in surprise. \u201cThat is beneath you, Michael! Harry wronged both of us, it\u2019s true, but he has apologized and tried to make reparations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me, by God!\u201d</p><p>Poppy gave him an incredulous glance. \u201cYou want an apology from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He glared at her, and then a hoarse note of pleading entered his voice. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>She flushed with fury. \u201cThat will never be possible. And it never was. Your father wouldn\u2019t have consented to have me as his daughter-in-law, because he considered me beneath him. And the truth is that you did, too, or you would have managed everything far differently than you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a snob, Poppy. I\u2019m conventional. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head impatiently\u2014it was an argument she didn\u2019t want to waste precious time on. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve come to love my husband. I will never leave him. So for your sake as well as mine, stop making a spectacle and a nuisance of yourself, and go on with your life. You were meant for better things than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell said,\u201d Leo muttered, climbing into the carriage. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Poppy. We\u2019ll get nothing else out of him.\u201d</p><p>Michael grabbed the edge of the door before Leo could close it. \u201cWait,\u201d he said to Poppy. \u201cIf it turns out that something has happened to your husband . . . will you come to me?\u201d</p><p>She looked into his pleading face and shook her head, unable to believe he would ask such a thing. \u201cNo, Michael,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re too conventional to suit me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Leo closed the door in Michael Bayning\u2019s astonished face.</p><p>Poppy stared at her brother desperately. \u201cDo you think Michael had anything to do with Harry\u2019s disappearance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Leo reached up to signal the driver. \u201cHe\u2019s not in a condition to plot anything other than where he\u2019s going to find his next drink. I think he\u2019s essentially a decent lad, drowning in self-pity.\u201d Seeing her distraught expression, he took her hand and squeezed it comfortingly. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the hotel. Perhaps there\u2019ll be some word about Harry.\u201d</p><p>She was silent and bleak, her thoughts taking the shape of nightmares.</p> <p>As the carriage jounced along the street, Leo sought for a remark to distract her. \u201cThe interior of Marlow\u2019s wasn\u2019t nearly as pleasant as I\u2019d expected. Oh, there was quite bit of mahogany paneling and nice carpeting, but the air was difficult to breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Poppy asked glumly. \u201cWas it filled with cigar smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cSmugness.\u201d</p><p>By morning, half of London was indeed looking for Harry. Poppy had spent a sleepless night waiting for news of her husband, while Leo and Jake Valentine had been out searching gentlemen\u2019s clubs, taverns, and gaming halls. Although Poppy was frustrated by her own enforced inactivity, she knew that everything possible was being done. The cracksman, Mr. Edgar, had promised to use his network of thieves to find any possible scrap of information about Harry\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>Special Constable Hembrey, for his part, had been exceedingly busy. Sir Gerald at the War Office had confirmed that Edward Kinloch had threatened Harry during their meeting. Subsequently, Hembrey had procured a search warrant from one of the Bow Street magistrates, and had questioned Kinloch early in the morning. However, a thorough search of Kinloch\u2019s residence had revealed no trace of Harry.</p> <p>The Home Secretary, who was the acting head of the Metropolitan Police Force, had directed his Criminal Investigation Unit\u2014comprised of two inspectors and four sergeants\u2014to apply their skills to the case. They were all engaged in questioning various individuals, including employees at the fencing club and some of Edward Kinloch\u2019s servants.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if he\u2019s disappeared into thin air,\u201d Jake Valentine said wearily, lowering himself into a chair in the Rutledge apartment, taking a cup of tea from Poppy. He gave her a haggard glance. \u201cAre there any problems with the hotel? I haven\u2019t seen the managers\u2019 reports\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went over them this morning,\u201d Poppy said scratchily, understanding that Harry would want his business to continue as usual. \u201cIt gave me something to do. There are no problems with the hotel.\u201d She rubbed her face with both hands. \u201cNo problems,\u201d she repeated bleakly, \u201cexcept that Harry is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be found,\u201d Valentine said. \u201cSoon. There\u2019s no way he can not be found.\u201d</p><p>Their conversation was interrupted as Leo entered the apartment. \u201cDon\u2019t get comfortable, Valentine,\u201d he said. \u201cBow Street has just sent word that they have at least three men claiming to be Harry Rutledge, along with their \u2018rescuers.\u2019 It\u2019s assumed they\u2019re all impostors, but I thought we\u2019d go have a look at them in any case. Perhaps we\u2019ll find a chance to talk with Special Constable Hembrey, if he\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, too,\u201d Poppy said.</p> <p>Leo gave her a dark look. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ask to go if you knew what kind of riffraff parades through that office every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that you\u2019re not going without me.\u201d</p><p>Leo contemplated her for a moment, and sighed. \u201cFetch your cloak.\u201d</p><p>The Bow Street court was universally regarded as the foremost London magistrates\u2019 court, where the most publicized criminal cases were investigated and prosecuted. The Metropolitan Police Act had been passed more than twenty years earlier, resulting in the formation of what was still called the \u201cNew Police.\u201d</p><p>However, there still remained a few law enforcement establishments outside the Home Secretary\u2019s direct control, and Bow Street was one of them. Its mounted patrol and half-dozen Runners were answerable only to the Bow Street magistrates. Oddly, the Bow Street enforcement office had never been given a statutory basis for its authority. But that didn\u2019t seem to matter to anyone. When results were needed, one went to Bow Street.</p><p>The two buildings that comprised the court and office, nos. 3 and 4, were plain and unassuming, giving little hint as to the power that was wielded inside.</p><p>Poppy approached Bow Street with Leo and Valentine, her eyes widening as she saw throngs of people milling around the building and along the street. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to anyone,\u201d Leo told her, \u201cdon\u2019t stand close to anyone, and if you hear, smell, or see something offensive, don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.\u201d</p><p>As they entered no. 3, they were surrounded by the mingled smells of bodies, sweat, brass polish, and plaster. A narrow hallway led to various holding rooms, charge rooms, and offices. Every inch of the hallway was occupied with jostling bodies, the air thick with exclamations and complaints.</p> <p>\u201cHembrey,\u201d Jake Valentine called out, and a lean man with close-cropped gray hair turned toward him. The man possessed a long, narrow face and intelligent dark eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s the Special Constable,\u201d Valentine told Poppy as the man made his way toward them.</p><p>\u201cMr. Valentine,\u201d Hembrey said, \u201cI\u2019ve just arrived to discover this lunatic gathering.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Leo asked.</p><p>Hembrey\u2019s attention switched to him. \u201cMy lord, Mr. Rutledge\u2019s disappearance was reported in the Times this morning, along with the promise of reward money. And his physical description was given. With the result that every tall, dark-haired swindler in London will appear at Bow Street today. The same thing is occurring at Scotland Yard.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s jaw dropped as she glanced at the gathering in the hallway and realized that at least half of them were men who vaguely resembled her husband. \u201cThey\u2019re . . . they\u2019re all claiming to be Harry?\u201d she asked dazedly.</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so,\u201d Leo said. \u201cAccompanied by their heroic rescuers, who have their hands out for the reward money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome to my office,\u201d Special Constable Hembrey urged, leading them along the hallway. \u201cWe\u2019ll have more privacy there, and I\u2019ll apprise you of my latest information. Leads have been pouring in . . . people claiming to have seen Rutledge drugged and put aboard a ship to China, or robbed at some brothel, things of that nature . . .\u201d</p><p>Poppy and Valentine followed Leo and Hembrey. \u201cThis is abominable,\u201d she told Valentine in a low tone, glancing at the line of imposters. \u201cAll of them posturing and lying, hoping to profit from someone else\u2019s misfortune.\u201d</p><p>They were forced to pause as Hembrey tried to clear a path to the doorway of his office.</p><p>One of the black-haired men nearest Poppy bowed theatrically. \u201cHarry Rutledge, at your service. And who might you be, my fair creature?\u201d</p><p>Poppy glared at him. \u201cMrs. Rutledge,\u201d she said curtly.</p> <p>Immediately another man exclaimed, \u201cDarling!\u201d He held his arms out to Poppy, who shrank away and gave him an appalled glance.</p><p>\u201cIdiots,\u201d Hembrey muttered, and raised his voice. \u201cClerk! Find some place to put all these damned Rutledges so they don\u2019t crowd the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><p>They entered the office, and Hembrey closed the door firmly. \u201cA pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Rutledge. I assure you, we\u2019re doing everything possible to locate your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother, Lord Ramsay,\u201d she said, and Hembrey bowed respectfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the latest information?\u201d Leo asked.</p> <p>Hembrey went to pull out a chair for Poppy, speaking all the while. \u201cA stable boy in the mews behind the fencing club said that around the time of Mr. Rutledge\u2019s disappearance, he saw two men carrying a body through the alley out to a waiting carriage.\u201d</p><p>Poppy sat hard in the chair. \u201cA body?\u201d she whispered, cold sweat breaking out on her face, nausea rising.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he was only unconscious,\u201d Valentine told her hastily.</p><p>\u201cThe stableboy had a glimpse of the carriage,\u201d Hembrey continued, returning to his side of the desk. \u201cHe described it to us as black lacquer with a small pattern of rosemaled scrollwork across the boot. The description matches a brougham in the mews of Mr. Kinloch\u2019s Mayfair residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat next?\u201d Leo asked, his blue eyes hard.</p><p>\u201cI intend to bring him here for questioning. And we\u2019ll proceed by taking inventory of Mr. Kinloch\u2019s other properties\u2014his arms manufactory, realty he may own in town\u2014and obtain warrants to search them methodically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know for certain that Rutledge isn\u2019t being held in the Mayfair house?\u201d Leo asked.</p><p>\u201cI went over every inch of it personally. I can assure you that he is not there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs the warrant still applicable?\u201d Leo persisted.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can return to Kinloch\u2019s house for another search? Right now?\u201d</p><p>The Special Constable looked perplexed. \u201cYes, but why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to have a go at it, if I may.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of annoyance appeared in Hembrey\u2019s dark eyes. Clearly he regarded Leo\u2019s request as nothing more than a bit of self-important showmanship. \u201cMy lord, our previous search of the house and grounds was comprehensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt of that,\u201d Leo replied. \u201cBut I trained as an architect several years ago, and I\u2019ll be able to look at the place from a draftsman\u2019s perspective.\u201d</p><p>Jake Valentine spoke then. \u201cYou think there\u2019s a hidden room, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there is,\u201d Leo said steadily, \u201cI\u2019ll find it. And if not, at least we\u2019ll annoy the devil out of Kinloch, which should have some entertainment value.\u201d</p><p>Poppy held her breath as they waited for the Special Constable\u2019s reply.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Hembrey finally said. \u201cI can send you in with a constable while I bring Mr. Kinloch in for questioning. However, I will insist that you abide by our codes of practice during the execution of the search\u2014and the constable will make certain you are aware of those rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, have no fear,\u201d Leo replied gravely. \u201cI always follow the rules.\u201d</p><p>The Special Constable seemed rather unconvinced by the claim. \u201cIf you\u2019ll wait but a moment,\u201d he said, \u201cI will confer with one of the magistrates, and he will assign the constable to escort you.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he left the office, Poppy leapt up from her chair. \u201cLeo,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. You\u2019re going, too.\u201d</p><p>The Kinloch home was large and fashionably gloomy, the interiors done in dark crimson and green, the walls oak paneled. The cavernous entrance hall was paved with uncovered stone slabs that caused their footsteps to echo repeatedly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What Poppy found most distinctive and unnerving about Edward Kinloch\u2019s house, however, was that instead of adorning the rooms and hallways with traditional artwork, he had filled the place with an astonishingly vast array of game trophies. They were everywhere, dozens of pairs of glass eyes staring down at Poppy, Leo, Jake Valentine, and the constable assigned to accompany them. In the entrance hall alone there were heads from a ram, a rhino, two lions, a tiger, as well as a stag, elk, caribou, leopard, and zebra, and other species that were entirely unfamiliar to her.</p><p>Poppy hugged her arms around her middle as she turned a slow circle. \u201cI\u2019m glad Beatrix can\u2019t see this.\u201d</p><p>She felt Leo\u2019s hand settle comfortingly on her back.</p><p>\u201cApparently Mr. Kinloch enjoys sport hunting,\u201d Valentine commented, gazing at the ghastly assortment.</p> <p>\u201cLarge game hunting isn\u2019t a sport,\u201d Leo said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a sport when both sides are equally armed.\u201d</p><p>Poppy felt cold prickles of unease as she stared at the tiger\u2019s frozen snarl. \u201cHarry is here,\u201d she said.</p><p>Leo glanced at her. \u201cWhy are you so certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Kinloch likes to display his power. To dominate. And this house is where he brings all his trophies.\u201d She shot her brother a glance of barely suppressed panic. Her voice was very quiet. \u201cFind him, Leo.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a short nod. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk around the outside perimeter of the house.\u201d</p> <p>Jake Valentine touched Poppy\u2019s elbow and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go through the rooms on this floor and inspect the molding and paneling to see if there are discrepancies that would indicate a concealed door. And we\u2019ll also look behind the larger pieces of furniture, such as bookcases or wardrobes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd fireplaces,\u201d Poppy said, remembering the one at the hotel.</p><p>Valentine smiled briefly. \u201cYes.\u201d After conferring with the constable, he accompanied Poppy to the parlor.</p><p>They spent a half hour investigating every minute crack, edge, and surface elevation, running their hands over the walls, getting on their hands and knees, lifting edges of carpet.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask,\u201d came Valentine\u2019s muffled voice as he looked behind a settee, \u201cdid Lord Ramsay really study architecture, or was he more of a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDilettante?\u201d Poppy supplied, moving every object on the fireplace mantel. \u201cNo, he\u2019s quite accomplished, actually. He attended the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris for two years, and worked as a draftsman for Rowland Temple. My brother loves to play the part of featherbed aristocrat, but he\u2019s far more clever than he lets on.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually Leo came back inside. He went from room to room, pacing the distance from one wall to another, pausing to make notes. Poppy and Valentine continued to search diligently, progressing from the parlor to the entrance hall stairwell. With every minute that passed, Poppy\u2019s anxiety sharpened. From time to time a housemaid or footman passed, glancing at them curiously but remaining silent.</p><p>Surely one of them had to know something, Poppy thought in frustration. Why weren\u2019t they helping to find Harry? Did their misplaced loyalty to their master preclude any sense of human decency?</p><p>As a young housemaid wandered by with an armload of folded linens, Poppy lost her patience. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d she exploded, glaring at the girl.</p><p>The maid dropped the linens in surprise. Her eyes went as round as saucers. \u201cWh-where is what, ma\u2019am?\u201d she asked in a squeaky voice.</p><p>\u201cA hidden door. A secret room. There is a man being kept against his will somewhere in this house, and I want to know where he is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know noffing, ma\u2019am,\u201d the housemaid quavered, and burst into tears. Scooping up the fallen linens, she fled up the stairs.</p><p>Valentine spoke quietly, his brown eyes filled with understanding. \u201cThe servants have already been questioned,\u201d he said. \u201cEither they don\u2019t know, or they don\u2019t dare betray their employer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they keep their silence about something like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s little hope for a servant who is dismissed without references to find a job nowadays. It could mean devastation. Starvation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Poppy said, gritting her teeth. \u201cBut at the moment I don\u2019t care about anyone or anything save my husband\u2019s welfare. And I know he\u2019s here somewhere, and I\u2019m not leaving until he\u2019s found! I\u2019ll tear the house apart if I must\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d came Leo\u2019s voice as he strode into the entrance hall. He jerked his head purposefully in the direction of a hallway that branched off the main entrance. \u201cCome to the library. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Galvanized, they hurried after him, while the constable followed as well.</p><p>The library was a rectangular room filled with heavy mahogany furniture. Three of the walls were fitted with shelved alcoves and bookcases, all topped by a cornice that was continuous with the wall joinery. The area of oak flooring uncovered by carpet was scarred and mellow with age.</p><p>\u201cThis house,\u201d Leo said, going straight to the draped windows, \u201cis a classical Georgian, which means that every design feature in this half of the house is a perfect reflection of the other half. Any deviation is felt as a deep flaw. And according to the form of strict symmetrical arrangement, this room should have three windows on that wall, to match the corresponding room on the other side of the house. But obviously there are only two in here.\u201d Deftly he tied back the drapes to admit as much daylight as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Waving impatiently at a cloud of dust motes in the air, Leo went to the second window, fastening those drapes as well. \u201cSo I went outside and noticed that the brickwork pointing is different on the section of the wall where a third window should be. And if you pace out this room and the one beside it\u2014and compare the measurements with the exterior dimensions of the house\u2014it appears there\u2019s an eight- to ten-foot space between these rooms with no apparent access.\u201d</p><p>Poppy flew to the wall of bookcases, examining them desperately. \u201cIs there a door here? How do we find it?\u201d</p><p>Leo joined her, lowering to his haunches and staring at the floor. \u201cLook for fresh scuff marks. The floorboards are never level in these older houses. Or look for fibers caught in the seams between the cases. Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Poppy shouted, using her fist to bang on a bookcase frame. \u201cHarry!\u201d</p> <p>They were all still, listening intently for a response.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d the constable said, pointing to a small white crescent scuff on the floor. \u201cThis is a new mark. And if the bookcase swung out, it would correspond.\u201d</p><p>All four of them gathered around the bookcase. Leo pried, pushed, and pounded on the edge of the frame, but the unit remained firmly in place. He scowled. \u201cI know how to find the room, but I\u2019ll be damned if I know how to get inside.\u201d</p><p>Jake Valentine began to pull books from the shelves and toss them heedlessly to the floor. \u201cThe concealed doors we have at the hotel,\u201d he said, \u201care locked according to a pulley-and-dowel mechanism, with a wire running to a nearby object. When you tilt the object, the wire lifts the dowel and frees a doorstop wedge, and the door opens.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy grabbed books and tossed them aside as well. One of the volumes she found was stuck in place. \u201cThis one,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>Valentine slid his hand over the top of the book, found the wire, and pulled gently.</p><p>The entire bookcase swung open with stunning ease, revealing a locked door.</p><p>Leo pounded on the door with a heavy thump of his fist. \u201cRutledge?\u201d</p><p>They were all electrified by a distant, nearly inaudible reply, and the quiet vibration of the door being pounded from the other side.</p><p>A few openmouthed servants gathered at the library doorway, watching the proceedings.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in there,\u201d Poppy said, her heart thundering. \u201cCan you open the door, Leo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without a bloody key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Valentine said, shouldering his way to the door and pulling a small rolled cloth from his coat pocket. He extracted two thin metal implements, knelt beside the door, and set to work on the lock. Within thirty seconds, they heard a distinct clack as the tumblers shifted.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>Poppy sobbed in relief as Harry emerged, dressed in fencing whites that were gray with dust. Her husband was pale and dirt smudged, but remarkably composed considering the circumstances. Poppy launched herself at him, and he caught her and said her name hoarsely.</p><p>Squinting in the brightness of the room, Harry kept Poppy against him as he reached out to shake the other men\u2019s hands in turn. \u201cThank you. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to find me.\u201d His voice was ragged and rough, as if he\u2019d been shouting for some time. \u201cThe room is insulated with slag wool to muffle sound. Where\u2019s Kinloch?\u201d</p><p>The constable replied. \u201cHe\u2019s at the Bow Street Office, sir, being questioned. What do you say to accompanying us there and making a report, so we can detain him indefinitely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d Harry said feelingly.</p> <p>Ducking behind him, Leo ventured into the dark room.</p><p>\u201cQuite professional,\u201d the constable told Valentine, as he replaced the lock picks in his pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to commend you or arrest you. Where did you learn to do that?\u201d</p><p>Valentine sent a grin in Harry\u2019s direction. \u201cMy employer.\u201d</p><p>Leo emerged from the concealed room. \u201cLittle more than a desk, a chair, and a blanket,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cCommissioned you to do a bit of mechanical engineering, did he?\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded ruefully, reaching up to touch a tender spot on his skull. \u201cThe last thing I was aware of was something crashing down on my skull at the fencing club. I awoke here with Kinloch standing over me, ranting. I gathered the plan was to keep me locked away until I had developed a set of drawings that would result in a workable gun prototype.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after that,\u201d Valentine said darkly, \u201cwhen you were no longer useful . . . what did he intend to do with you then?\u201d</p><p>Harry smoothed his hand over Poppy\u2019s back as he felt her tremble. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you any idea whom his accomplices were?\u201d the constable asked.</p><p>Harry shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, sir,\u201d the constable vowed, \u201cwe\u2019ll have Kinloch in the Bow Street strong room within the hour, and we\u2019ll obtain the names of everyone involved in this wretched business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Poppy asked anxiously, lifting her head from Harry\u2019s chest. \u201cAre you well enough to go to Bow Street? Because if not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, love,\u201d he murmured, smoothing a stray wisp of hair back from her face. \u201cJust thirsty . . . and I wouldn\u2019t mind having some dinner when we return to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid for you,\u201d Poppy said, and her voice broke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry pulled her close with a comforting murmur, tucking her body into his, clasping her head against his shoulder.</p><p>In tacit agreement, the other men drew away to allow them a moment of privacy.</p><p>There was much to be said between them\u2014too much\u2014so Harry simply held her against him.

As he and Poppy left the police office, they were told that Edward Kinloch and two of his servants were already being held in the strong room, with Runners in pursuit of another, yet unnamed suspect. And every last one of the charlatans trying to claim Harry\u2019s identity had been banished from the building.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that today has made clear,\u201d Special Constable Hembrey quipped, \u201cit\u2019s that the world needs only one Harry Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>The hotel employees were overjoyed at Harry\u2019s return, crowding around him before he could go upstairs to his apartments. They displayed a level of affectionate familiarity that they once wouldn\u2019t have dared, shaking Harry\u2019s hand, patting his back and shoulders, exclaiming their relief over his safe return.</p><p>Harry seemed a bit bemused by the demonstrations, but he tolerated it all quite willingly. It was Poppy who finally put a stop to the happy uproar, saying firmly, \u201cMr. Rutledge needs food and rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a tray sent up at once,\u201d Mrs. Pennywhistle declared, dispersing the employees efficiently.</p><p>The Rutledges went to their private apartments, where Harry took a shower bath, shaved, and donned a dressing robe. He wolfed down a meal without even seeming to taste it, drained a glass of wine, and sat back in his chair looking exhausted but content.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he said, \u201cI love being home.\u201d</p><p>Poppy went to sit on his lap, curling her arms around his neck. \u201cIs that how you think of the hotel now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the hotel. Just wherever you are.\u201d He kissed her, his lips gentle at first, but heat rose swiftly between them. He became more demanding, almost savaging her mouth, and she responded with an ardent sweetness that set fire to his blood. His head lifted, his breathing uncontrolled, and his arms cradled her tightly against him. Beneath her hips, she felt the insistent pressure of his arousal.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d she said breathlessly, \u201cyou need sleep far more than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never need sleep more than this.\u201d He kissed her head, nuzzling into the glowing locks of her hair. His voice softened, deepened. \u201cI thought I\u2019d go mad if I had to spend another minute in that blasted room. I was worried about you. I sat there thinking that all I want in life is to spend as much time with you as possible. And then it occurred to me that you had visited this hotel for three seasons in a row\u2014three\u2014and I\u2019d never met you. All that time I wasted, when we could have been together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Harry . . . even if we had met and married three years ago, you\u2019d still say it wasn\u2019t enough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I can\u2019t think of a single day of my life that wouldn\u2019t have been improved with you in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d she whispered, her fingertips coming up to stroke his jaw, \u201cthat\u2019s lovely. Even more romantic than comparing me to watch parts.\u201d</p><p>Harry nipped at her finger. \u201cAre you mocking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Poppy said, smiling. \u201cI know how you feel about gears and mechanisms.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her easily, Harry brought her into the bedroom. \u201cAnd you know what I like to do with them,\u201d he said softly. \u201cTake them apart . . . and put them back together again. Shall I show you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . yes . . .\u201d</p> <p>And they put off sleep just a little longer.</p><p>Because people in love know that time should never be wasted.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>THREE DAYS LATER</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d Poppy said thoughtfully, tying the sash of her white dressing gown as she approached the breakfast table.</p><p>Harry stood and held a chair for her, stealing a kiss when she was seated. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you had an appointment this morning. There\u2019s nothing on the schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that kind of late. The other kind of late.\u201d Seeing his incomprehension, Poppy smiled. \u201cI\u2019m referring to a certain monthly occurrence . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harry stared at her fixedly, his expression unfathomable.</p><p>Poppy poured her tea and dropped a lump of sugar in it. \u201cIt\u2019s only two or three days past the usual time,\u201d she said, her voice deliberately casual, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never been late before.\u201d She lightened her tea with milk and sipped it cautiously. Glancing at her husband over the rim of the china cup, she tried to gauge his reaction to the information.</p><p>Harry swallowed and blinked, and stared at her. His color had heightened, making his eyes look unusually green. \u201cPoppy . . .\u201d He was forced to stop by the necessity of taking an extra breath. \u201cDo you think you could be expecting?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her excitement tempered with a flutter of nervousness. \u201cYes, I think it\u2019s possible. We won\u2019t know for certain until a bit more time has passed.\u201d Her smile turned uncertain as Harry remained silent. Perhaps it was too soon . . . perhaps he wasn\u2019t entirely receptive to the idea. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, trying to sound prosaic, \u201cit may take some time for you to become accustomed to the idea, and that\u2019s only natural\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d Poppy gasped as she was snatched off the chair and hauled into his lap. His arms went fast around her. \u201cYou want a baby, then?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind?\u201d Harry pressed his face against her chest, feverishly kissing her exposed skin, her shoulder, her throat. \u201cPoppy, there are no words to describe how much I want it.\u201d His head lifted, the depth of emotion in his eyes making her breath catch. \u201cFor most of my life, I thought I\u2019d always be alone. And now to have you . . . and a baby . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely certain yet,\u201d Poppy said, smiling as he scattered kisses over her face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make certain, then.\u201d Still holding her, Harry stood from the chair and began to carry her back into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the morning schedule?\u201d she protested.</p><p>And Harry Rutledge uttered three words he had never said in his life. \u201cDamn the schedule.\u201d</p><p>At that moment the door reverberated with a brisk knock. \u201cMr. Rutledge?\u201d came Jake Valentine\u2019s voice. \u201cI have the managers\u2019 reports\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Valentine,\u201d Harry replied, not pausing as he took Poppy to the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m occupied.\u201d</p> <p>The assistant\u2019s voice was muffled by the door. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Crimson from head to toe, Poppy said, \u201cHarry, really! Do you know what he must be thinking at this moment?\u201d</p><p>Lowering her to the bed, he tugged her dressing robe open. \u201cNo, tell me.\u201d</p><p>Poppy squirmed in protest, a helpless giggle escaping her as he began to kiss his way down her body. \u201cYou are the most wicked man . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry murmured in satisfaction.</p><p>They both knew she wouldn\u2019t have him any other way.</p> <p>LATER THAT DAY . . .</p><p>Leo\u2019s unexpected return to Hampshire had set Ramsay House into happy turmoil, maids hurrying to ready his usual room, a footman setting another place at the table. The family welcomed him warmly. Merripen poured glasses of excellent wine as they gathered in the parlor for a few minutes of conversation before dinner was served.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the commission for the conservatory?\u201d Amelia asked. \u201cDid you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>Leo shook his head. \u201cThe project is so small, I sketched something on the spot. They seemed pleased with it. I\u2019ll work out the details here, and send the final plans back to London. But never mind that. I have some news I think you\u2019ll find of interest . . .\u201d He proceeded to regale the family with the story of Harry\u2019s abduction and rescue, and Edward Kinloch\u2019s subsequent arrest. They reacted with expressions of amazement and concern, and praised Leo for his part in the affair.</p><p>\u201cHow is Poppy?\u201d Amelia asked. \u201cSo far this has certainly not been the calm, serene life she was hoping for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappier than I\u2019ve ever seen her,\u201d Leo replied. \u201cI think Poppy has reconciled herself to the idea that one can\u2019t avoid the storms and calamities of life, but one can at least find the right partner to face them with.\u201d</p><p>Cam smiled at that, holding his dark-haired son against his chest. \u201cWell said, phral.\u201d</p><p>Leo stood and set aside his wineglass. \u201cI\u2019ll go wash before the meal is served.\u201d Glancing around the room, he affected an expression of mild surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t see Marks. I hope she\u2019ll come down to supper\u2014I have need of a good argument.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe last time I saw her,\u201d Beatrix replied, \u201cshe was looking all around the house for her garters. Dodger stole every last one of them out of her dresser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBea,\u201d Win murmured, \u201cit\u2019s better not to mention the word \u2018garters\u2019 in mixed company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But I don\u2019t understand why. Everyone knows we wear them\u2014why do we have to pretend it\u2019s a secret?\u201d</p><p>As Win tried to explain tactfully, Leo grinned and went upstairs. Instead of heading to his own room, however, he went to the end of the hallway, turned to the right, and tapped on the door. Without waiting for an answer, he pushed his way in.</p><p>Catherine Marks whirled to face him, gasping. \u201cHow dare you come into my room without . . .\u201d her voice faded as Leo closed the door and approached her. Dampening her lips with the tip of her tongue, she backed away until she had come up against the edge of a small dressing table. Her hair fell in pale silk streamers over her shoulders, her eyes darkening to the blue gray of a turbulent ocean. As she stared at him, a flush rose in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d Slowly Leo braced his hands on the table, on either side of her. She shrank backward until no further movement was possible. The scent of her skin, mingled with bath soap and fresh garden blossoms, rose to his nostrils. The memory of sensation hovered around them, between them. As Leo saw the shiver that went through her, he felt a rush of unwanted heat, his blood turning to liquid fire.</p><p>Struggling for self-discipline, Leo took a deep, steadying breath.</p><p>\u201cCat . . . we have to talk about what happened.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
