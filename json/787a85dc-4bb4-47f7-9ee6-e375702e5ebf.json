My simple white dress shirt, teamed with my tailored pale gray suit jacket, and its matching pale gray pencil skirt, had seemed wholly appropriate when I\u2019d boarded the plane. But one second of breathing my beloved island air, and my outfit was all wrong. This was a business trip, so I hadn\u2019t even packed anything appropriate for the paradise of my childhood. I didn\u2019t even own anything like that anymore. The thought was demoralizing.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even a particularly hot day. A cool breeze wafted across my skin as I stepped outside. I shrugged out of my blazer anyway, unbuttoning an almost indecent amount of buttons at the collar of my shirt. But cleavage didn\u2019t feel wrong here. I was now in a place where my typical wardrobe was usually a very tiny bikini. Had I even packed one of those?</p><p>I had resolved to set up meetings as soon as I arrived here, and so had dressed accordingly, but my resolve blew away with the gentle Maui breeze. I took deep breaths, loving the smell of the island air, which was divine, even mixed with jet fumes.</p> <p>A car was already waiting for me at the curb, and a driver hustled out to take my sparse luggage. I towered over him in my red Jimmy Choo\u2019s. At five eleven, though, I would have towered over him even if I were wearing flats. \u201cMs. Middleton, how was your flight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I smiled at the familiar driver. He worked for my family\u2019s Maui resort. I quickly recalled his name. \u201cI\u2019m doing well, Thomas. How is island life these days?\u201d</p><p>He flashed a grin at me. He was close to my own age of twenty-six, with a slight build and a quick smile. \u201cStill can\u2019t tear myself away from this rock, so good. Bet you miss it.\u201d He gave me a sympathetic look. It was a look reserved for anyone crazy enough to leave this paradise behind for the mainland.</p><p>I sighed heavily. \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d I told him. My voice betrayed far more of my sorrow than I had intended. I mentally berated myself for being a downer at his crestfallen look.</p><p>He opened the car door for me, and I slipped in, sending him a reassuring look. \u201cSorry. I do miss it here, but it\u2019s not as bad as that.\u201d</p> <p>He was behind the wheel before he asked, \u201cTo the hotel, Ms. Middleton?\u201d</p><p>I started to say yes, but my heart took my mouth over suddenly. \u201cTo the Kalua shops.\u201d</p><p>He looked a little startled, but just nodded and started to drive.</p><p>The shops really weren\u2019t far from the hotel, I reassured myself. And I could pick up some island necessities for myself.</p><p>I rolled the window down as we drove. The wind quickly messed up my braid, and I pulled loose my wavy, streaky blonde hair in relief. It only hung to my mid-back now. When I had lived in paradise, it had hung all the way to my butt, with some streaks bleached nearly white by the sun. My skin was almost pale now, not sun-kissed, as I liked it. I\u2019d had to grow up when I left paradise, and I looked it nowadays. Years off my beloved rock had taken their toll.</p><p>Thomas dropped me off at the Kalua shops with some reluctance. I waved him off, asking him to have my luggage taken to my room at the hotel. I reassured him that I would call him if I needed a ride. I knew that I wouldn\u2019t. One of the Kaluas would give me a ride; I was sure. They were my second family. I spoke to Tutu and Mari every week, in one form or another.</p> <p>I had a death grip on my large handbag as I entered the surf shop. I wasn\u2019t brave enough to venture into the bar or the caf\u00e9 just yet. I was still taking in the changes in the shop when I heard a shrill shriek from behind the counter. I was being hugged by a short, shapely woman in a flash. I hugged her back tightly, feeling unexpected tears prick my eyes. I felt instantly guilty that I had even considered going to the hotel first. Someone had been missing me, after all. I ran a hand down her thick black hair, affectionate with her in a way that I could never be even with my own mother.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever come back,\u201d she whispered, pulling back. Her eyes were a brown so dark they looked black. They were lovely and mysterious. She was lovely and mysterious. She was in her mid-forties now, but you wouldn\u2019t know it by looking at her. She was shapely, taking care of her body meticulously, and her face was a golden brown that time hadn\u2019t yet managed to so much as line. Her face was a lovely combination of her mixed Japanese-Hawaiian heritage. Her lips were full, her nose small and pert, her eyes large and almond shaped. She was petite, but by no means slight. Not one part of her was thin, nor was it fat. She was just...shapely, down to her perfect ankles. She wore a half-shirt, and tiny shorts, just like I remembered, and she still worked them better than any twenty-year old I\u2019d ever met. She wore a white plumeria in her hair, as ever.</p><p>\u201cWe talk every week, Auntie. You can hardly say I don\u2019t keep in touch.\u201d</p><p>She just smiled at me, but it was a sad smile. \u201cI know, but it\u2019s not the same. When are you coming back home, Lana?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, feeling strangely adrift at the question. This was home, but I couldn\u2019t come back. It hurt to even think about it. \u201cWell, I\u2019m here for now. I came for business, but I realized that I didn\u2019t bring anything appropriate outside of work clothes.\u201d</p><p>She just smiled, eyeing me up. \u201cWell, you do look kind of hot in that, but yeah, you need to get your island back on. Go say hi to Tutu. I\u2019ve got you covered, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a grateful smile, moving to the door that joined Tutu\u2019s caf\u00e9 with the surf shop. Mari stopped me with a word. She rushed to me, putting a plumeria in my hair, just over my ear. I fingered it, smiling.</p><p>She sighed, as though in great relief, and fingered the identical flower over her own ear. \u201cMuch better. Go on.\u201d</p> <p>I stopped at the door, a sudden thought stopping me. \u201cIs Akira...?\u201d</p><p>She just gave me wide eyes. \u201cLast I heard, he was off at some business meeting.\u201d</p><p>I sighed in relief. I just wasn\u2019t prepared to see him yet. I nodded and opened the door.</p><p>Tutu gave me the same treatment, shrieking like a crazy woman and running to me like she was far younger than her years. She had to be in her sixties by now, I knew.</p><p>I hugged her back tightly. She was a tiny woman, her Japanese heritage showing much more strongly in her than her Hawaiian half, both in her body and face. She had pale skin, and pitch-black hair. I fingered it, and we touched the flowers in each other\u2019s hair with warm smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>I took a deep breath, because for some strange reason, I wanted to cry. I was brought out of my moment of weakness by a series of framed photos on the wall of the caf\u00e9. It was set up as a sort of collage of magazine covers and editorial pictures. I laughed at the thoroughness of it. My short, unimpressive modeling career was pretty well represented on that large expanse of wall. Tutu followed my gaze, smiling proudly. \u201cI tell everyone about how you grew up here.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, a little embarrassed. Modeling was something I\u2019d often said I\u2019d never do as a young teen. My mother had been an iconic model of the eighties, and I\u2019d known that, although I took after her looks strongly, I could never match her career. And I hadn\u2019t. The worst part of it was, as short as my modeling career had been, I\u2019d still suspected that every job I ever got was because of who my mother was, and not anything to do with my modeling \u2018talent\u2019.</p><p>But the pictures on the wall did look nice enough, I supposed. Some of them were high fashion, but even more were bikini shots. I had been a skinny kid, but gotten very voluptuous around the time I\u2019d also gotten awkwardly tall. It made me much more suited to swimsuit modeling, I had quickly found. A lot of designers absolutely despised boobs.</p><p>I had only modeled for one memorable year when I was just eighteen, before settling down to get a business degree, and then to work for the family business of owning and running a worldwide hotel chain. But I still got sighted by strangers from the modeling. I supposed I should have been flattered and not so embarrassed about the whole thing. I had apparently left some kind of impression.</p><p>\u201cAkira has become well-known for threatening anyone who says anything the slightest bit dirty about those bikini pictures. He threw a fit, at first, when I put them up, but I stood firm. I\u2019m proud of my Lana, I told him. Her unmatched modeling career will not be forgotten by me, I told him!\u201d</p><p>I had to laugh at her description of my short career. Even I didn\u2019t dare argue with her about defending me, though. She was a formidable, if tiny, woman. I stroked her hair affectionately. She still hadn\u2019t let go of me, and I didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>I stiffened as a familiar figure strode through the doors that adjoined the bar to the caf\u00e9. Tutu patted my back, but finally relinquished her impressively firm hold on me, moving to the woman who had just entered. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d she asked the other woman. It was downright rude, for Tutu.</p><p>Milena didn\u2019t answer her. Her shocked gaze was glued to mine. She was a tall woman, a few inches shorter than me, but still tall. She had a trim, toned figure, with large, gravity defying breasts that were shown off to perfection in an island half shirt, \u2018Kalua\u2019s Bar\u2019 stretched tight over that ample chest. Her skin was golden and perfect everywhere. She had a mixed heritage as well, though I didn\u2019t know the exact mix. But her genetics were stellar, wherever their origins. Her face was pretty, her pouty mouth positively sinful. I had always wanted to be her. She had everything I wanted. I hated her, as I always had.</p><p>I nodded at her politely. \u201cMilena. Long time, no see.\u201d It was the most civil thing I could manage to say to her.</p><p>She just huffed, not even trying to return the civility. I really didn\u2019t care. I hated her so much that I would have been a little stung if she didn\u2019t hate me back, at least a little. She didn\u2019t even stay to get whatever she had come for, just leaving with a whispered, \u201chaole,\u201d under her breath.</p><p>The word didn\u2019t offend me. Being raised on the island, I had heard it often enough, and long ago become immune to the insult.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still sweet as ever,\u201d I told Tutu with a forced smile.</p><p>She cackled. \u201cI still hate her. Thank god Akira never married the bitch.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped, just stopped, in my chest. I hadn\u2019t known that. No one had told me. Mari and Tutu were always so careful not to mention anything Akira related anymore. Last I had heard, about six years ago they had gotten engaged. I\u2019d asked them not to mention him anymore, after that. Oh, yeah, and I\u2019d cried for an entire week about it, not even getting out of bed. And when I had gotten out of bed, and become a productive human being again, I\u2019d still cried myself to sleep at night for at least a month. But I had slowly made myself get over it. Akira only ever saw you as a little sister, I had told myself. I was the one who had forced the issue, again and again, until I\u2019d ruined everything, and been cast out of paradise. To this day, it was still so painful that, even though I loved Akira with every fiber of my being, I still couldn\u2019t have even a friendship with him. I was too weak, and it just hurt so much.</p><p>Tutu smirked, pointing at the collage of my photos. \u201cMilena hates those pictures, if it makes you feel better. She threw a conniption for weeks after I put them up. She wouldn\u2019t even come into the caf\u00e9 for a long time. I wish to God that had lasted!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had to laugh as she threw a tiny fist into the air to emphasize her point. She was so damn cute, and ferocious, and if you knew her, a little terrifying. \u201cI missed you, Tutu.\u201d</p><p>She flashed me a triumphant grin. \u201cBut you\u2019re home now, so no need to miss me anymore.\u201d</p><p>I wished so badly that it was true. \u201cI\u2019m only visiting for a few days, unfortunately. I have some business at the hotel. After that, I might stay a few days, but then I need to go back to the mainland.\u201d</p><p>She clucked her tongue, wrinkling the cutest nose in the world at me. \u201cYou work too much. Don\u2019t be like your father, working your life away. You\u2019re rich. You can live anywhere you want. No one is living in your old family house, so move back in. See how easy it is? I just solved all of your problems. You\u2019re welcome. Now sit down. I\u2019m feeding you. You don\u2019t need to keep model-skinny anymore, so why are you?\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t help it; I just obeyed her, laughing. When Tutu said eat, you ate. That was how things worked around here.</p><p>Mari joined me just as Tutu brought the food out. I saw that it was enough food to feed all three of us, with all of our favorites. Mari and Tutu ate the spam musubi, and I ate the fried pork and rice. I scarfed it down in a hurry, making both women comment worriedly that I really was starving on the mainland. Tutu tried to get me seconds, until I insisted I was too stuffed.</p><p>We sat and talked for hours, until the caf\u00e9 started to pick up for the dinner crowd. Both women had staff to work both of their shops, but it was unnatural for either of them not to help when work needed to be done, so work they did.</p><p>I knew I needed to get back to my own work, but I still sat there for a while, drinking tea, and just feeling so at home. This was why I never visited. It was so hard to tear myself away.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>Mari brought me a bag stuffed full of island wear. I tried to give her my debit card to pay, but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it. We had a somewhat heated argument about it, before I finally caved. \u201cFine, but you will agree to a spa day at my hotel, my treat. Tutu has to come, too.\u201d</p><p>Mari beamed at me. \u201cOh, yes! We\u2019ll make a girls\u2019 day of it.\u201d</p><p>I felt positively warmed by the thought. Hours basking in their company. I couldn\u2019t wait. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange it. What\u2019re your days off?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at me. \u201cI\u2019m the boss, pretty girl. Whenever I want, is my day off. You make the appointment, and we will be there.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, the happiest I\u2019d been in...I couldn\u2019t even remember. Probably since I\u2019d left the island, I mused. Well, since a little before that...</p><p>\u201cI need a ride back to the hotel,\u201d I told Mari sheepishly. It was just too far to walk in four inch heels, and I\u2019d already wasted too much time.</p> <p>She fished her keys out, tossing them to me. I caught them awkwardly, with the overstuffed shopping bag in one hand, my large red handbag in the other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Lexus in the back lot. Auntie\u2019s been doing all right for herself, eh?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at the keys. \u201cYes. In every way. I\u2019ll have someone return it right away, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She just smiled and nodded, waving goodbye.</p><p>I left on heavy feet, though I had to grin as I looked down at the bag of goodies she had given me. The bag was so stuffed that some tiny bikini bottoms were in imminent danger of falling out. I was walking through the back parking lot, staring down at them, debating whether they would stay in the bag until I made it to the car, when I ran smack into what felt like a solid brick wall.</p><p>The sudden contact knocked the air out of my lungs, and my hands just let go of everything I\u2019d been holding in a spectacular arch, straight up in the air. I fell back with the motion, and would have fallen straight back, if huge, hard arms, hadn\u2019t caught me. The hands put me back on my feet even before my eyes could travel all the way up into painfully familiar, warm brown eyes. Those eyes were as shocked as my own.</p><p>I took a big step back, just studying the man I hadn\u2019t seen in over eight years. He was as gorgeous as ever, maybe even more so. His hair pulled back in an almost harsh style that brought out the hard, flawless lines of his face. Akira looked much like his sister, my dear Mari, but there wasn\u2019t a pretty thing about him. His mouth was full, true, but it had a tendency to look mean. He had a tendency to look mean. He always had, with his quintessentially Hawaiian features, and his massive, starkly muscular physique. He towered over me, and it made my stomach flutter, as it always had. He wore a devastating three piece suit, and I couldn\u2019t help it, I eyed him top to bottom, taking in every delectable detail of his tall, muscular length. He was a shrewd businessman at heart, but he had the look of a heavyweight boxer or a fit pro-wrestler, with his massive size. And I knew it was all muscle under his clothes. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of fat on his perfect body.</p><p>I was proud to see that I recovered more swiftly than he did at our chance meeting. He still just stared at me, total shock showing on his hard face. I bent down, and began to pick up my scattered bag of goodies.</p> <p>\u201cLana?\u201d he spoke finally, his voice hoarse.</p><p>I straightened, smiling at him. It was my best, falsely bright smile. \u201cAkira.\u201d</p><p>His arms raised, as though to embrace me, but dropped, probably at the shocked look on my face. I hadn\u2019t expected him to ever want to touch me again, for any reason.</p><p>Impulsively, I walked to him, throwing my arms around his neck for a hug. He wrapped strong arms around me instantly, and I closed my eyes, burrowing into his chest as though I were still a child. This felt like home. Home was a lie, I knew. But I let myself live the lie, for a few minutes, at least. I breathed him in. He smelled divine, like the ocean, and the island, and himself. The best smell in the world. I felt him stroking my hair, his cheek pressed to the top of my head. I don\u2019t think either of us had a clue what to say, so we stood like that for long minutes, just comforting each other.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he finally asked. Mortifyingly, the question brought tears to my eyes. Adrift, I thought. I\u2019m just adrift, banned from my home, and utterly rejected by the only man I\u2019ll ever love. I wanted to hate him for it, but I just couldn\u2019t. I had only ever known how to love him. Whole-heartedly. Too much so.</p><p>I swallowed hard, finally answering the innocent question. \u201cBusy. Busy with work, as usual. How are you?\u201d I finally pulled out of his arms, my tears mercifully dried.</p><p>I looked up into his eyes. They were troubled.</p><p>\u201cThe same, I guess. All of the businesses are prospering, so things are good. I didn\u2019t know you were in town. How long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got in this afternoon. I just finished visiting with Tutu and Auntie.\u201d As I spoke, Akira bent down, gathering up my things. I blushed when he handled some rogue lingerie. It was a tiny scrap of nothing that had nothing to do with island wear. I had no idea why Mari had added it to the bag. He paused when he saw it, then hurriedly shoved it into the bag. I didn\u2019t bend down to help him, strangely transfixed as he handled several of my new, tiny bikinis. It made my face flush, and my skin heat. His hands were so big, and the bikinis were so tiny. And I remembered those hands. Those wonderful, talented, perfect hands...</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re planning a trip to the beach.\u201d He grinned up at me. \u201cLet me know if you want company. We could go to the old spot and try to catch some waves.\u201d</p><p>I agreed before I could wise up and turn him down. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, handing me my purse, but carrying the over-stuffed bag for me. \u201cWe could go right now, if you\u2019re up for it. I just finished up for the day.\u201d</p><p>I knew I should say no, to preserve a little of my sanity, but I just couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cSounds great. I just need to change into one of those bikinis.\u201d</p><p>He was eyeing the keys in my hand, his brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cAuntie loaned me her car. I was going to have one of the hotel drivers bring it back for me,\u201d I explained.</p><p>He led me to a dark SUV instead, opening the passenger door for me, and putting my bag in the back. He turned on the car, cool air rushing out of the A/C vents immediately. I sat in the seat, and he came back to my door, crowding me a little. \u201cI\u2019ll go return her keys, since I can drive you.\u201d He touched the flower in my hair lightly, his eyes intense. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>He was gone for maybe a minute before I realized that I could just change while he was gone. I had changed into my swimsuit in his car countless times. Why should it be any different now? I climbed into the back seat, sliding out of my stilettos and then my tight skirt. I grabbed the first matching bikini pieces that I saw, slipping on the bottom before taking off my top. Because I was trying to hurry, my fingers fumbled with every button of my blouse.</p><p>I unsnapped my front-clasping bra, shrugging out of it. I realized, only after I was topless, that the bikini top was a tangled mess. I was still untangling the thing when Akira opened the driver\u2019s seat door.</p><p>He froze, just froze, staring at my naked breasts. They were heaving in agitation, my nipples hard from the car\u2019s blasting A/C.</p><p>I grimaced at him. \u201cSorry. I thought I\u2019d save us a trip and get my swimsuit on now,\u201d I said, expecting him to close his door and wait outside, to give me privacy. The windows were tinted dark enough that they did actually conceal most of the interior of the car.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t close the door. Instead, he sat, buckling his seat belt. And then he did something that absolutely stunned me. He reached up one of his big, dark hands, and adjusted his rearview mirror, blatantly watching me. It froze me in my tracks, and I was too surprised to move for long moments, my breasts quivering as my breaths grew jerky and uneven.</p><p>Finally, I bent back down to the stubborn bikini top, working on untangling the strings. But I couldn\u2019t focus on the task for more than a few seconds, my eyes flying back to Akira\u2019s as he watched me in the mirror, his heavy-lidded eyes very obviously on my breasts. I arched my back, showing them off to better advantage. I had been a professional poser at one time, I told myself, so why not use it to my benefit?</p><p>His jaw went a little slack, and I felt myself growing wet. To affect him like that, to make him want me, was the biggest turn on in the world to me. I had been kneeling on the seat to change, but I shifted my position, facing him, on my knees now on the seat. I leaned back, letting my arms rest along the seat, the movement thrusting my breasts forward provocatively. He sucked in a harsh breath, but didn\u2019t look away, didn\u2019t speak. I cupped both of my breasts in my hands, kneading them. They overflowed in my hands, and I pushed them together, stroking them up until my nipples just peeked out between my fingers. I pinched them, and Akira\u2019s head fell back against his headrest, his breathing audibly heavy now. Still, we didn\u2019t speak. And he never took his eyes off me.</p><p>I further surprised the both of us when I ran one hand lower, down my taut stomach, and between my legs. I parted my knees on the seat, giving him a perfect view as I plunged a hand into my bikini bottoms and fingered myself.</p><p>\u201cUntie them,\u201d Akira said, his voice sounding rusty. \u201cPlease. I want to see what your fingers are doing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled the little bows on each side of the string bikini, baring myself with a few simple motions. He groaned, and that made me weak. To affect him like that. It was all I had ever wanted. I ran my fingers over my sex, showing myself to him very clearly. I stroked my clitoris, then thrust a finger inside of my sex.</p><p>Abruptly, he closed his eyes, cursing. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Lana. Please, just get dressed. I was out of line. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, all of my hopes were dashed, and I just felt dirty and ugly, and inevitably, unwanted. I grabbed a different bikini, this one skin-toned, but not tangled. I put it on hurriedly, stepping out of the car, and into the front seat. I couldn\u2019t even look at him. \u201cI\u2019m dressed. Are we still going to the beach, or would you prefer to just drop me off?\u201d I asked, my voice weak.</p><p>I knew Akira had finally opened his eyes because he suddenly began to curse. \u201cJesus, Lana, you look naked in that suit. That thing is indecent.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced down at it, surprised by his words. The bikini was scant and skin-colored, but hardly indecent. I realized that he probably just didn\u2019t want to see so much of my skin, especially after my sordid little peep show. He\u2019d obviously seen enough. I felt my lip quiver at the realization. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll put a shirt on, and you can just drop me off at the hotel,\u201d I said in the most even tone I could manage, opening the door to get my things.</p><p>He stopped me by grabbing my wrist in his hard grip, pulling me back into the car.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That came out all wrong. The suit is fine. Let\u2019s just go to the beach, k?\u201d His voice was oh so gentle, and I realized that he must have seen my lip quiver at his rejection.</p><p>I looked firmly out the window. I doubted I could ever look him in the eye again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d I said. I knew I sounded like a sullen child.</p> <p>He made a little noise of sympathy in his throat, stroking my hair. \u201cOh, Lana,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI only ever seem to hurt you, no matter what I do. I want to take you to the beach. So let\u2019s go, k?\u201d</p><p>He spoke to me like I was a child with fragile feelings, and I was so pathetic that I soaked it up, knowing very acutely that even scraps were better than nothing. \u201cK.\u201d</p><p>He patted the top of my head. It was a \u2018good girl\u2019 pat, but I didn\u2019t protest. \u201cDo you mind if I stop by my place to change real quick? I don\u2019t have anything in the car, if you can believe it. Oh, and we need surfboards, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, surfboards,\u201d I said absently, just looking out the window, trying to keep my mind blank so I wouldn\u2019t do something stupid, like cry in front of him.</p><p>The house he pulled up to was drastically different from the last time I had seen it. It looked like it was a completely different house now, all modern architecture and sleek, reflective windows. And it was noticeably bigger. \u201cYou expanded, huh?\u201d</p><p>I felt him studying me, but I still didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve made quite a few changes, over the years. Come on in.\u201d He got out of the car as he spoke, coming around to my side and opening my door. I got out, looking at anything but him. He gripped my arm just above the elbow, pulling me firmly to his front door, then ushering me in. \u201cI\u2019ll be quick. Make yourself at home,\u201d he said, stroking a hand down my hair, then disappearing up the stairs.</p> <p>I walked through the main floor slowly, taking in all of the changes rather numbly. It had turned from a somewhat rundown beach house into an ultra-modern, sunlit infused haven. The color scheme was simple, with lots of white and pale gray and a few touches of bright color. A bright yellow vase on the mantle, and a colorful painting in the living area, just splashes of color here and there, all of the neutral bringing that color out more vividly. The whole space was open now, with only glass walls. But the windows were the most spectacular change, lining the walls now, letting in the light, for clear, clean views of the beach. Apparently, business had been good for Akira. I was glad.</p><p>Akira changed quickly, joining me near the window as I gazed at the ocean. He walked up behind me, and I still didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>He tugged on a lock of my hair gently. \u201cHey. Will you at least look at me?\u201d</p><p>I finally did, and was immediately sorry. He wore only a pair of black board shorts, of course. I could see the many thick black tattoos that dotted the front of his muscular shoulders. The tribal patterns traced down to his mid back, I knew. I loved those tattoos. His abs were as washboard hard as ever. I tried not to drool as I took in his perfect naked torso. I finally tore my eyes away from his golden skin to look into his troubled gaze. \u201cYour house looks amazing,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He just nodded, studying my face. \u201cI\u2019ve upset you. How can I make it better?\u201d he asked, his voice so serious and quiet.</p><p>I felt my face crumple, and he enfolded me in his arms. I buried my face in his chest, in the spot right between his muscular pectorals. I pressed my body full against him, wanting to stay wrapped in those arms forever. This was why I could never come back here. My feelings hadn\u2019t dimmed with time; they\u2019d merely been pushed back into a dark corner of my heart, ignored, as I was deprived of his intoxicating presence. But to him, to him, I was only a burden. A family friend with an inconvenient infatuation, I recalled, was how he\u2019d phrased it. Those had been his words to Milena at the time. And that had been the day after I\u2019d seduced him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d I said against his chest, not willing to pull away, even to speak.</p><p>He made that sympathetic little humming noise in his throat, kissing the top of my head softly. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m a bastard. I\u2019m sorry. And you\u2019re probably tired from the flight. Wanna take a nap? We can try the beach later, or even on another day.\u201d</p> <p>I made a sound of protest. \u201cI leave in two days.\u201d</p><p>I felt his chest expand on a deep breath. \u201cWow. I was hoping you\u2019d stay a bit longer. That\u2019s so short, after all of those years away. Don\u2019t you miss it here, just a little?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to sob like a baby. I wanted to hit him. It was such a cruel question, coming from him. But I just stayed flush against him as tears ran down my cheeks in an embarrassing flood.</p><p>His chest rumbled in distress as he felt my tears streaming down my face and then his chest. \u201cOh, baby, how you must hate me.\u201d</p><p>I sobbed at that, because I didn\u2019t. Because I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He picked me up, cradling me like the baby I was. He kissed my forehead as he carried me upstairs. My eyes were closed when he laid me on his bed. I wouldn\u2019t let go of him when he tried to straighten. He laughed, a sweet little rumble against my cheek. \u201cIs there a reason that you\u2019re hanging onto me like a monkey?\u201d he asked, amused.</p><p>\u201cCan you stay with me, for just a minute?\u201d</p><p>He made a soothing sound as he lay down beside me. I tried to cuddle closer, but saw that he\u2019d put a pillow between our lower regions. I shrank back, my shoulders hunched. He was wary even to touch me. And he should have been. I was an infatuated fool, just like he\u2019d said. I turned away from him, burying my face in his pillow. It smelled like him; I wanted to take it home. He threw an arm around me from behind, pulling my back against his chest, and my butt against the...pillow. He spoke against my ear. \u201cWe all missed you, you know. It hasn\u2019t been the same without you. Not even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated me,\u201d I said quietly, holding my breath to hear his answer.</p><p>He cursed, but stroked my hair, as though to soften the cursing. \u201cNever, Lana. Never. I was afraid of that. Am I the reason you\u2019ve stayed away for so long?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer, and he squeezed me tighter. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I just need a nap. I\u2019m out of my mind tired. I\u2019m not usually like this, I swear.\u201d</p><p>He sighed against me. \u201cYou take a nap. I\u2019ll make us some dinner, k?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer, just burrowed more deeply into his divinely smelling bed.</p><p>He kissed the top of my head before leaving me. He didn\u2019t hate me, I thought, as I drifted off to sleep. It was something.</p><p>I was wrapped in Akira\u2019s arms again when I awoke. There was no pillow now. My leg was hiked up high on his hip, our chests rubbing together with every breath. I glanced at his face. Still asleep. I moved against him very slightly, and found that not all of him was asleep. I moved again, and moaned. His erection was so hard and thick, straining at his shorts in a glorious display. I knew he was only responding to me because he was asleep, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter. I began to rub against him, panting as our chests rubbed together, and his hard cock rubbed against my sex. His hand caressed my hip, pulling me closer as he grunted in his sleep, eyes still closed.</p><p>My tiny bikini suddenly felt so oppressive, and I untied the top impatiently, rubbing my nipples against his chest. The hand on my hip moved up, kneading at the pliant flesh. I turned onto my back to give him better access. He stroked my full, sensitive breasts until I squirmed. I untied my bikini bottoms, guiding his hand lower, putting his fingers right on my sex. His talented fingers took over from there, rubbing and stroking until I was panting.</p><p>I glanced at his face. His eyes were still closed, but his face was flushed, his breath harsh. \u201cMmm, Lana,\u201d he murmured, his fingers plunging inside of me. His erection was pressed against my hip now, and I touched him, stroking him roughly over his shorts. \u201cMilena,\u201d he said, his voice sounding irritated. But still, the sound of her name on his lips froze me in my tracks. I tugged his busy hand out of me, extricating myself from him with regret. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing, and I had very nearly taken advantage of that fact. I curled into a ball, shrinking away from him. I felt him wake with a start a moment later. He hugged me from behind again, as though nothing had happened, and began to relax back into sleep.</p><p>He felt along my hip, and then, very lightly, felt the spot on my back, where my bikini should be tied. He cursed, and I felt him begin to search for the missing scraps of material. I rolled onto my back, throwing an arm over my eyes. He sucked in a breath as he looked at me. He shook my shoulder lightly. I parted my legs slightly, arching my back a little to give him a better view, my arm still covering my eyes stubbornly.</p><p>I felt him freeze, and I knew that he was staring at me. He didn\u2019t move for so long that I shifted again, parting my legs farther apart, wanting to see what he would do. Could he see how wet I was? The room was far from dark. From the light streaming in the window, I would have guessed that it was late afternoon.</p><p>I felt Akira move off the bed, and heard the sound of rustling clothing, then the unmistakable sound of flesh slapping against flesh.</p><p>He would rather jerk himself off than touch me, I thought, shocked and furious at the thought.</p><p>I lifted my arm from my eyes, unable to keep from looking. He was standing at the edge of the bed, gloriously naked, and gripping his huge erection in both hands. His jaw was clenched, his nostrils flared. He released himself as our eyes met, swallowing hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quietly. It was his favorite phrase lately. I hated it.</p><p>I ran my hands down my body, and his eyes followed them hungrily. \u201cIs it really so hard for you to touch me?\u201d I asked him quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed, moving closer to me slowly, as though afraid to scare me. \u201cYou were asleep, and naked. I must have stripped you in your sleep. That was so out of line of me, I kno\u2014\u201c His sentence broke off as I began to touch my sex, angling my body to give him a hell of a view. His fists clenched, but he crawled a little closer, watching my hands work.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you might have a vibrator, or maybe even a cock, that I could borrow?\u201d I asked him archly when he just continued to watch me.</p><p>His eyes flew to mine, and they were almost panicked. \u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want to take advantage of you. Again.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to scream, he was so exasperating. \u201cI was eighteen, Akira, fully legal. Quit acting like you were a predator. I seduced you, if you recall.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a stern look. \u201cI\u2019m ten years older, and you were barely legal, and a virgin. And your father trusted me to look after you, not to violate you. It was a bastard thing to do.\u201d</p><p>I writhed on the bed, stroking myself shamelessly when I spoke. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-six now. Can we get over it already?\u201d</p><p>I wanted him to crawl on top of me and bury himself deep, fucking me hard enough to make me forget that it was a pity fuck. He didn\u2019t do that. Instead, he grabbed my hand, bringing my wet fingers to his mouth, and sucking them clean. My jaw went slack. It was the sexiest thing I\u2019d ever seen in my life, his eyes closing in pleasure as he tasted me. He released my limp hand, then gripped my legs open, and buried his face there. He began to suck and lick and stroke, working me hard with his tongue and teeth before he started on me with thick fingers. A sound tore from my throat, my fingers and hands rubbing again and again over his thick hair. I clutched him to me, saying his name, again and again, as he brought me to climax.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>He perched his chin on my stomach, just above my pelvic bone, watching me come back down from the blissful orgasm. His eyes were gentle as he studied me. \u201cI could do that to you all day. Again?\u201d</p><p>I fought the sudden childish urge to yank his hair out. \u201cI\u2019m on the pill, and I\u2019m quite clean. Are you so repelled at the thought of just fucking me?\u201d I asked him, deliberately crude and goading. It was a new tactic, so maybe it would work.</p><p>He rose onto his elbows, giving me that stern, older brother look that he was so fond of. But he was still hard and quivering as he knelt on his knees between my open thighs. He opened my legs wider as he knelt there, staring down at me. \u201cI just want to be sure that this is what you want. I don\u2019t want to take ad\u2014\u201c</p><p>I interrupted that infuriating phrase of his by sitting up, gripping his hard cock in my hand. I stroked him hard, rolling until I could kneel down far enough to take him in my mouth. I sucked on him desperately, as though my life depended on it.</p><p>He tried to pull me away by the hair, but I was determined. He was moaning roughly, calling my name rather urgently, but I just kept stroking him firmly with my hand and working on him with my mouth.</p><p>\u201cBaby, get on your back. I\u2019m going to fuck you. Get on your fucking back,\u201d he nearly shouted.</p><p>It got my attention, and I fell back.</p><p>He followed me down, pinning me roughly and thrusting into me with one smooth motion. I wanted to cry, it felt so good. He began to move, his strokes long and slow. His dark eyes looked into mine with an intensity that I couldn\u2019t ignore. \u201cYou have the most amazing eyes in the world, Lana. I think I\u2019ve missed those eyes the most.\u201d My eyes were a deep blue that, depending on the lighting, looked almost violet. \u201cYou were this perfect, enchantingly beautiful girl that made the world brighter just by being in it, and you were ours. I can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am that I drove you away.\u201d As he finished speaking, he bent down to kiss me, his strokes getting faster, and harder. I moaned into his mouth, and he stroked a tongue into mine. I gave it a little bite, and he groaned, one of his hands pulling my thighs higher, and wider, and ramming into me, harder and harder. He pulled his mouth free, watching me intently as he snaked a hand down my body, rubbing my clit as he rode me. I came, and he followed me, shouting my name, every muscle in his body straining as he buried himself to the hilt, rubbing his orgasm out inside of me with sexy little thrusts that went on and on.</p><p>He rolled onto his back, throwing an arm over his eyes when he\u2019d recovered. \u201cFuck,\u201d he cursed.</p><p>I sat up, worried. Did he regret it, already? Couldn\u2019t I at least get one night of pleasure before it all came crashing down again?</p><p>I stood and walked, naked, to the window. It was huge, with a perfect view of the ocean. I leaned my head against it.</p><p>\u201cYou are gonna give some lucky bastards quite the show if you plaster your body to the window like that.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back at him, pressing a breast very deliberately against the glass. \u201cOops,\u201d I said, batting my eyelashes at him in a mock innocent pose. The beach was empty at the moment, so I wasn\u2019t worried about it.</p><p>He gave me an exasperated look. \u201cYou are as sassy as ever. Some things never change.\u201d</p><p>I arched my back, wiggling my bum at him, just a little bit. \u201cDo you need to spank me?\u201d</p> <p>I watched, in frozen fascination, as his semi-hard cock came to full attention again. He groaned, as though it were the most bothersome thing in the world.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t bothersome to me.</p><p>I leaned against the window, arching my back and parting my legs. I lay my cheek against the glass as I sent him what I hoped was a sultry look. \u201cWe already had sex. Why stop at once? The damage is done, right?\u201d</p><p>He was striding to me before I\u2019d finished taunting him. He grabbed my hips from behind, pressing hard against me, and working himself in, inch by hard inch. He went slowly at first, making sure that I could take all of him at that angle. After he\u2019d cleared my passage twice, he began a pounding rhythm that had me making desperate little sounds in my throat. My climax built fast. He grabbed my breasts, squeezing and kneading at them. \u201cI\u2019ve jerked myself off to your pictures more times than I can count,\u201d he whispered into my ear.</p><p>That did it. I came, gasping out his name.</p><p>He jerked into me a half a dozen more times before he reached his own climax, clutching at my breasts and biting my neck almost roughly. I loved the rawness of it.</p><p>He pulled me into bed with him after that, cuddling against me. I hadn\u2019t forgotten how sweet he could be. The memories still haunted me. Often.</p><p>\u201cDid you really masturbate to my pictures, or were you just saying that?\u201d I asked him, looking up to see his eyes.</p><p>He looked down at me, where I cuddled in my little spot on his chest, his expression baffled. \u201cWhy the hell would I just say that? It\u2019s perverted and nasty, not to mention embarrassing. I felt like I needed to get it off my chest. And it\u2019s not \u2018did\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018do\u2019. When I jerk off to a picture, I guarantee it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, loving the disgruntled look on his face. \u201cProve it. I haven\u2019t modeled in years. Where would you even get my picture?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a pointed look, pushing me gently from his chest. He rolled to the side of the bed, reaching underneath it to pull out a rather beat-up issue of Sports Illustrated. Sure enough, I was on the cover. \u201cExhibit A,\u201d he muttered. It was the most high profile modeling job I\u2019d ever done, my fifteen minutes of fame, posing in a tiny yellow bikini and straddling a surfboard on the coveted cover spot. I\u2019d walked away from the business after that job, feeling a strange but overwhelming need, at the time, to reconnect with my family, and the family business. Modeling just hadn\u2019t been for me, and I\u2019d burned out on it quickly.</p><p>I smiled at Akira. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t mind. You can use my pictures in any filthy way you want to, you pervert.\u201d</p><p>He flushed, and I laughed. I enjoyed tormenting him. I always had. For years and years, it had been my favorite hobby.</p><p>\u201cIt drives me crazy sometimes, thinking about how many other men are doing exactly the same thing.\u201d</p><p>I just shrugged, not really concerned about anyone else so much as him. He had always been the only one I cared about, the only one I saw or concerned myself with. It was the joke of my pathetic life that he didn\u2019t feel even remotely the same way about me.</p><p>\u201cWhat else? Is there an exhibit B? What other pictures do you have of me that you like to do filthy things to?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He glared, but walked to his computer. \u201cObserve. Exhibit B. See my browsing history?\u201d He clicked on it, and another bikini shot of me popped up. This one was more scandalous. It had been taken when I was surfing, some discarded shot from a photo shoot, maybe. But someone had leaked it. I was straddling the surfboard, looking intently at the waves, one of my nipples showing clearly due to a wardrobe malfunction.</p><p>I laughed. I hadn\u2019t even known that was out there. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made the mistake of reading the comments under it once. It was the angriest jerk-off session of my life.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, feeling positively giddy at the thought of him wanting me that much, enough to search me online to see a picture of me.</p><p>We were both still naked. Neither of us had even thought to cover up as we looked at the computer. He sat in his computer chair, just staring at me, dumbstruck. His gaze ran up and down my body hungrily, but he was still so hesitant to touch me. My hands skimmed along my naked torso. \u201cWhich do you prefer, the photo-shopped pictures, or the real thing?\u201d I asked, cupping my breasts as I finished.</p><p>He swallowed hard, looking up into my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s like you have no clue how far out of my league you are. Guys like me don\u2019t get girls like you. You know that, right? You\u2019re a filthy rich supermodel, who also happens to be the daughter of my mentor, the man I respect more than anyone else in the world. I\u2019ve never even met my own father; I\u2019ve had my share of run-ins with the law, on several occasions, in fact, when I was a stupid, violent teenager. I still struggle to keep my fists to myself with the wrong provocation. I almost punched a guy in the bar just last week for talking about those damned pictures my mom won\u2019t take down. I\u2019m not good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>I just listened to him as he dissed himself, wanting to punch him, but wanting to hear where he was going with his tirade even more.</p><p>I sat on his lap, or rather, I straddled him, naked. It was a mistake. He closed up like a clam after that, looking at my body, his eyes so hungry and tender.</p><p>It undid me, such a harsh looking man with such tender eyes for me. When I was certain he didn\u2019t have any more to say, I leaned in and began to kiss him, a hungry, passionate kiss. I wrapped my arms around his neck, rubbing against him like a cat. I assumed he couldn\u2019t go for another round, but I just wanted that raw, naked contact with him. I was more than delighted when I felt him growing hard again against me. I shifted against him, instinctively trying to impale myself on the stiffening length.</p><p>He pulled back with a rough groan. \u201cI\u2019m not fucking you again until I\u2019ve at least fed you. I\u2019ll feel like a complete jerk if you pass out from hunger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter,\u201d I murmured, rubbing against him.</p><p>He let me, watching me as though mesmerized.</p><p>\u201cJust pretend I\u2019m a picture of me, and that my vagina is your hand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He spanked my ass hard for that one. He even threw me over his shoulder, standing and striding from the room as he did so. I loved that he was so big that it was no effort for him to carry me around like that. \u201cFine, fine,\u201d I said between giggles. \u201cMy mouth can be your hand.\u201d</p><p>He swatted me several more times as he carried me down the stairs. He tossed me onto his soft, white leather sofa, and I saw that he was grinning. That smile was all it took to flood me with the years of memories that had made me fall so helplessly for him.</p><p>Memories of this hard, mean-looking man who didn\u2019t have a soft bone in his hard-muscled body, but who could always muster up the softest, sweetest smile, reserved just for me. I had been a willful, spoiled, stubborn child, dogging his every step, insisting that he take me to the beach during his precious free time.</p><p>He had patiently taught me to surf, spending countless hours in the ocean with me as I learned. It had been a slow process. I hadn\u2019t been a quick learner at all, but I had been determined. And if anyone so much as looked wrong at the little white girl who couldn\u2019t surf for shit, but still took up a precious spot at one of the best surf spots, Akira was more than happy to set them straight. He had been scary when he got protective. He was always ready for a fight. But I had never been scared. I had adored that he was only a softy for me. No one else could make his eyes go soft like I could, and I had been paying attention.</p> <p>Even his long-time, on-again off-again girlfriend didn\u2019t get the tender looks that he bestowed on me. And when I would finally catch on, picking up whatever thing I got into my head that week for him to teach me, he would pat me on the head, give me that smile that I craved, and say softly, \u201cGood job, Lana. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>My mind swung back to the present when he spoke, walking into his kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have the old, infuriating Lana back. I missed my little giggling vixen. Don\u2019t move. We can eat right here.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled up, disregarding his order completely. \u201cUm, eat on a white sofa? Are you crazy? And I\u2019m filthy. You really shouldn\u2019t set me on anything clean right now.\u201d I followed him into the kitchen, pressing against his back as he dug through the fridge. \u201cI\u2019m so full of your cum right now that it\u2019s dripping down my leg,\u201d I whispered in his ear, wanting to get a reaction. I got one.</p><p>He had me on my back on his table between one breath and the next. He was spreading my legs, studying me for evidence of what I\u2019d said. It was there. \u201cOne more time,\u201d he told me, his voice a sexy rasp. \u201cThen we eat, and shower.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I gasped. He put my ankles on his shoulders and plunged in with a groan, working in and out of me very slowly at first, testing my soreness with a few concerned questions. He was rubbing my clit as he asked them, and I sent him a passion-infused glare. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I told him, and he thrust much harder. \u201cMore than fine. I\u2019m getting my brains fucked out by the hottest man on the planet.\u201d</p><p>He liked that assessment, his breath getting faster, his thrusts harder and heavier as he got closer to his climax. He rubbed a finger on my clit almost frantically, trying to catch me up to him.</p><p>I was there the whole time, coming when he did, watching his warm brown eyes the entire time.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move after we\u2019d finished, just stayed buried deep, smiling down at me. He stroked a hand along my torso, caressing softly.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, Lana. Fuck, you\u2019re as tight as you were when I took your virginity. Fucking unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just so big, I\u2019m not sure you could tell the difference,\u201d I told him. He squeezed my breast hard for that one. \u201cI love having you inside of me, love your hands on me. You jerk off to my picture? I get off to the memory of our first time together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, well, well, isn\u2019t that cute?\u201d Milena drawled from the open front door. No other voice in the world could have been more unwelcome in that moment.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>We were clearly visible from her vantage point, in about the most vulnerable position imaginable. She glared at Akira, but when she swung her hate-filled eyes to me, I knew that I was the real object of her fury.</p><p>\u201cI always knew it,\u201d she screeched. \u201cYou lying asshole! I always knew that you\u2019d slept with her.\u201d She pointed a finger at me. \u201cI\u2019m going to mess up your face, you stupid whore. I\u2019m going to put your skinny ass in the hospital for this.\u201d</p><p>Akira had to slip out of me noisily to walk to the deranged woman. \u201cYou need to calm the fuck down, Milena. Lana, please get dressed and wait outside. Your clothes are by the door.\u201d</p><p>I did as he said, the entire situation suddenly coming into focus for me. I grabbed the first island dress I saw, shrugging into it, grabbed my handbag, and rushed out the front door. I didn\u2019t wait outside, though. I just started walking, in no direction in particular, my mind racing.</p><p>Oh, god, are those two still together? I felt ill at the thought.</p><p>But he\u2019d gone to comfort her and just kicked me out, like I was trash. Or the other woman, whom his girlfriend had just caught him fucking.</p> <p>I barely made it to some nearby bushes before I emptied out the contents of my stomach, the thought made me so sick.</p><p>I had just assumed, because the engagement had been called off, that they weren\u2019t together anymore. But she apparently had a key to his house, and he\u2019d so obviously been distressed that she\u2019d found us together. I\u2019d seen his face. It had been downright panicked as he\u2019d told me to wait outside.</p><p>I wandered off the small road, walking rather aimlessly, pointed towards the beach.</p><p>How many times and how many ways, could my heart be broken by that man?</p><p>He just didn\u2019t feel for me the way I felt for him, and he never would. It didn\u2019t work that way, I knew.</p><p>I had tried to be interested in other men after I\u2019d left for the mainland. In college, and even in my short modeling career, I had dated, even tried to hook up, but I wasn\u2019t interested in other men. It just wasn\u2019t in me to love or even want anyone that wasn\u2019t Akira. I couldn\u2019t force myself to have those kinds of feelings, just like he couldn\u2019t force himself to love me the way I longed for. It was a hard lesson that I\u2019d thought I\u2019d learned years ago.</p><p>Yet here I was again, heartbroken as though I\u2019d let myself hope again for his unattainable love. And there was always Milena, somewhere in the picture. She must be the one that he adored, the only one he could really see. I could understand that kind of devotion, but that didn\u2019t make it hurt any less. It hurt more, to be the seductress who had tempted him so shamelessly from the one he obviously loved. I hated that the most, that I might be the other woman. I didn\u2019t want to be that, not ever, not even for Akira.</p><p>I had been walking in the general direction of the beach, through a rough field, when I tripped\u2014in a hole, I noted, dazed.</p><p>I saw that my bare foot was bleeding, as well. I studied it closely, surprised to note that it wasn\u2019t one cut that had made it bleed, but many. And my other foot was bleeding, as well, lots of little tiny cuts and scrapes lining the bottom of both feet. I must have passed through some stickers without even feeling it. I still didn\u2019t feel it, in fact, so I just shrugged it off, and stood back up, continuing on to the beach. My left ankle was a little weak from the fall, so I had to favor my right strongly to keep walking. I didn\u2019t let up though, only stopping when I\u2019d finally reached the beach. I had walked far, I noted. I couldn\u2019t even see Akira\u2019s house anymore from this beach.</p><p>I sank into the sand, curling into a sad little ball, like I had when I was upset as a child. Akira had always been there to comfort me, then. And he\u2019d often been the only one who could, the only one I\u2019d wanted to see, if I was upset or sad. But I\u2019d learned to do without him for my entire adult life. It had been a sad life. I\u2019d been so lonely, though I kept endlessly busy with work and family obligations.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even tried to date in recent years, which seemed to be for the best. For me, at least. I didn\u2019t care to even try to become interested in men, much to my parents\u2019 dismay. They were desperate for grandchildren at this point in their lives, and my older brother and I seemed to be hopeless in that department. My brother was a shameless playboy. And I was a hopeless spinster, I was sure, from their exasperated point of view.</p><p>I fought it for a while, trying to keep myself a little numb, but eventually I just broke, sobbing softly into my hands. No matter how I looked at it, my future just looked so...empty, without Akira in it. I was so sick of feeling empty. And a few brief moments being full again only made me feel it more acutely.</p><p>I was a little stunned to see that it was fully dark as I lifted my wet hands from my tear-streaked face. I didn\u2019t have to look around again to know that I was utterly lost. I was too exhausted to care about my predicament, though. I curled back into my little ball, and fell into an exhausted sleep.</p><p>The sun was directly above me when I opened my sleepy eyes, immediately flinching back from the harsh light. It was several minutes before I mustered up the energy to rise to my feet. My whole body ached, my feet and ankle hurting with every step I took along the sandy beach. I couldn\u2019t believe that I had slept for so long. It had to be at least noon, going by the sun. I dug my phone out of my purse, not at all surprised to see that the battery had died.</p><p>I walked for maybe twenty minutes when I spotted some people on the beach. I hobbled to the family of three slowly but purposefully.</p><p>The mother, a heavy-set white woman, noticed me first, giving me a wide-eyed, surprised look. She elbowed her husband, pointing at me. I must have been a sight, by the concerned way they rushed to me, carrying their small child with them. I thought it was very nice, how concerned they were for an absolute stranger.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d the woman asked, kind concern in every line of her face. I really didn\u2019t want to know how bad I must look at the moment, to elicit such a response. I just nodded, though I was far from all right. After being so sick the day before, and then laying in the hot sun for the duration of the morning, unprotected in the sand, I felt close to passing out.</p><p>I had to clear my dry throat several times before I could speak. \u201cDo you have a phone that I could use? And could you tell me where I am?\u201d I asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p>The worried couple was beyond helpful, rushing to give me their cell phone, and giving me very detailed directions to this spot of beach.</p><p>I called the hotel, directing the staff to send a driver to pick me up. Even the receptionist on the phone sounded worried. I supposed that I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, since my luggage had arrived at the hotel a full day ago, and I had been conspicuously absent. I hoped that no one had contacted my father. He would worry needlessly. My mother would likely just shrug it all off, saying that I was a grown-up who could take care of myself.</p><p>The hotel car arrived very promptly, the couple hovering near me in concern all the while. I gave them my card. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t hesitate to call me, if you ever wish to stay at any of the Middleton hotels. You were a lifesaver for me today, and I would be happy to return the favor. I can arrange for comp rooms for you any time you need. Thank you,\u201d I told them, my voice stiff and formal. I didn\u2019t want to be so stiff with the nice couple, but it came out that way as all of my usual social graces were lost under the effort of simply trying not to pass out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They eyed my card, seeming pleased with the offer. I sincerely hoped they took me up on it. I preferred, always, to repay my debts.</p><p>The driver from the day before, Thomas, picked me up. He was stunned speechless at the sight of me, opening the door for me without a word. \u201cMs. Middleton, can I take you to a hospital? You look unwell, if you don\u2019t mind my saying so.\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head stiffly. \u201cThank you, no. Please just drive me to the hotel. I\u2019m quite fine.\u201d My tone was colder than I\u2019d intended, but again, the effort to keep myself composed had robbed me of all social graces.</p><p>We weren\u2019t far from the hotel, arriving there in short minutes. Thomas held the car door open for me, his eyes concerned. \u201cCan I help you, Ms. Middleton?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I straightened as I stepped out of the car. \u201cI just need my room key and number. That will be all, thank you.\u201d</p><p>It took an eternity for me to actually get to my room, my progress slow but determined. I leaned against the closed door, my eyes shutting in relief. First, a bath, I decided. I needed to eat, and to sleep, but I needed to be clean more than anything else just then.</p><p>I got in the large tub even as it filled with water. I didn\u2019t turn off the scorching flow until it was filled to the brim. I drifted off almost instantly.</p><p>The water was cold when I awoke, startled out of sleep by...something. I didn\u2019t know what, but I thought that it had been a noise. Only silence greeted me. I got stiffly out of the cold bath, resolving to get some actual work done.</p><p>I dressed in a cream-colored pencil skirt, paired with one of my countless white dress shirts. I tucked the shirt in, wanting to feel normal again, back in my business attire, and my business state of mind. I slipped on some electric blue Minolo stiletto\u2019s, veering as far as I could from the barefoot urchin I\u2019d turned into after just a day back home. My feet were already killing me, so I figured why not give them a good reason to hurt? Cute shoes were a good reason.</p> <p>I braided my hair back as tightly as my curls would go in the humid climate. I even made an attempt at makeup, though it was minimal.</p><p>A glance in the mirror told me that I looked infinitely better, my pink cheeks the only visible evidence of the rough day I\u2019d had.</p><p>I made slow but sure progress to the hotel\u2019s large offices, going into the spacious, well-appointed office that was reserved for use only by the Middleton family. I was aware of the startled glances I received as I walked, smoothly but slowly, past the office workers. I nodded politely to several faces that I recognized, but no one stopped my progress\u2014thank God.</p><p>My desk was already covered in papers that needed either my approval or my signature, or both. I sat down heavily, getting to work. I was grateful for the distraction.</p><p>I worked for a good ten minutes without interruption. I thought it was unusual. Normally, when I visited one of the properties, I was practically mobbed with various local ideas and concerns. I didn\u2019t dwell on it long though, too grateful to just be left alone to work. Ten minutes was all I got, though.</p><p>A startled hand flew to my chest as a large figure burst through my door. An agitated Akira stood panting in front of me, his eyes running over me, his face wild and almost...scared.</p> <p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>He lowered himself into the chair in front of my desk, his worried eyes never leaving me. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, his voice harsh. He was dressed in slacks and an uncharacteristically wrinkled white dress shirt. It brought attention to his beautiful brown skin.</p><p>I sighed, biting my lower lip so that it wouldn\u2019t quiver at the sight of him. I looked down as I answered, signing the paper I\u2019d been studying. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>He cursed. I didn\u2019t look up. \u201cThomas called me. He said he\u2019d picked you up from the beach, and that you looked as though you\u2019d been attacked. What on earth happened? I\u2019ve been looking for you ever since you disappeared from my house yesterday. I spent the night searching the beach for you. I had half of the island looking for you.\u201d</p><p>My gaze shot back to him at that, my eyes wide with shock. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to worry anyone. As you can see, I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, and I saw his temper rising by the way his muscles tensed up, his fists clenching. I watched that tension build in him with no small amount of fascination. His anger had never scared me, but it always got my attention.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he said, his teeth clenched.</p><p>I flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, ok? But I\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p> <p>He just leaned forward, giving me his, \u2018I\u2019m not backing down\u2019 look.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI went for a walk, barefoot, and scraped up my feet, then fell in a hole. It got dark, and I was lost, so I slept on the beach. In the morning, I found my way back. Nothing exciting, see?\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in his hands as I spoke, rubbing his temples. \u201cYou slept all night on the beach, by yourself? Do you have any idea how unsafe that is?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to pull out my hair; he was so frustrating. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to sleep on the beach. Like I told you, I got lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you take off like that? I told you to wait outside.\u201d He didn\u2019t look up at me as he spoke, still rubbing his temples, but I could tell from his voice just how angry he was.</p><p>His words made me angry, as well. \u201cDid you think that I was just going to wait patiently for you outside while you made up with your girlfriend?\u201d I asked, trying to make my voice sound steady, instead of hurt.</p><p>His head snapped up at that, his eyes wild and baffled. \u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>I waved off his comment. \u201cWhatever it is you call her, I didn\u2019t want to wait on standby while you went through your usual makeup/breakup routine with her.\u201d I stood up and took a step, intending to walk out of the room. I needed to escape to the restroom, or anywhere, really. I just needed to get out of his sight before I burst into tears.</p><p>The abuse I\u2019d inflicted on my starved body in the last twenty-four hours presented itself at that moment, when I stood so fast that my vision went fuzzy. I swayed on my feet for an endless moment right before I collapsed into a dead faint.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have been out for long. I was cradled in his arms when I came to, and we were still in the hotel, though Akira was striding out the door even as I roused.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked him in a weak voice.</p><p>He glanced down at me, his hard face showing relief that I was awake. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>I shifted in his arms, trying to get down. He just squeezed me tighter. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go to the hospital. I probably just fainted from hunger,\u201d I told him, flushing. I felt like a particularly irresponsible child at the confession.</p><p>He blanched at my words, turning around to stride back into the hotel, heading straight into the promenade that led to the large selection of restaurants that the resort hosted. His face was hard and bleak, his mouth turned down in a stark frown, as he studied me. \u201cWhen did you last eat?\u201d he asked in a gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cI ate at Tutu\u2019s yesterday, right before I ran into you. But I was...sick, right after I left your house, so I\u2019m not sure if that counts.\u201d</p><p>His lower lip trembled a little, as though with strong emotion. I blinked up at him, wondering if I was seeing things. I was exhausted, dehydrated, and starving, so it wasn\u2019t much of a stretch to think that I might be having hallucinations.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll order some food, and just eat it in my office. I need to get some things done, so I can set up the meetings that I came here for, before I head back to the mainland. You can put me down. I\u2019m okay now.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me tighter. \u201cJust shut up, Lana.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open in shock. Never in my life had he told me to shut up. It was so out of character for him that I actually obeyed.</p><p>He carried me into the first restaurant we came to. The staff recognized both of us on sight, and ushered Akira to a secluded table. He ordered as he walked. \u201cShe needs to eat immediately, so just bring us whatever is available right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the hostess said, striding away to comply.</p><p>He tried to set me in my own chair, but my arms just wrapped around his neck of their own volition.</p><p>He sighed, then sat. I sat up, turning until my back was against his chest, my head laid back against his shoulder. It felt so good, in spite of everything, just to be held in his massive arms. His arms had relaxed as I shifted on his lap, and I pulled them tightly around me again. He made a little humming noise, his cheek just touching the top of my head, and tightened those arms just how I wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the death of me, baby,\u201d he murmured against my hair. \u201cJust what am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gone soon enough. So nothing, I suppose,\u201d I said, feeling despondent at the thought.</p><p>His arms squeezed me. \u201cTell me about this mainland life you seem to need. Is it so much better for you, living in California?\u201d His voice was very serious, as though he expected a very thorough answer.</p><p>Again, I thought it was unmercifully cruel for him to ask me that. I mulled over the question, feeling all of my old wounds as though they were fresh. \u201cCalifornia? Is that where you think I live?\u201d I asked, baffled by that. My parents lived there, and I traveled there frequently for work, but by no stretch of the imagination did I live there.</p><p>He gave me a little shake. \u201cYour father and brother both told me that was where your residence was, when I asked them about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked them about me?\u201d</p><p>He tugged on a lock of my hair, hard. \u201cOww!\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cOf course I ask them about you. You don\u2019t talk to me. How else could I check up on you?\u201d His tone was chiding, and I detected a genuine hurt in it as well. I was surprised into silence by the realization. Had he expected me to call him?</p><p>After all of the ways I had embarrassed the both of us, seducing him with absolutely no shame, and then professing my undying love for him afterward. He couldn\u2019t have been more clear about the fact that he could not return my feelings, and I had been mortified and devastated. He had felt guilty, and been embarrassed by the whole sordid thing. The thought had never even occurred to me that he would ever want anything to do with me again.</p><p>\u201cSo where do you live, then?\u201d he asked after a long silence.</p><p>\u201cI live...nowhere. I travel all the time. I work all the time. I stay on a lot of the resort properties, because it\u2019s just easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have the flight gene, like your mother? You just like to stay on the move?\u201d he asked, his tone probing. He wasn\u2019t trying to hurt me, I knew. He honestly thought that it was my choice to have no home.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s bearable, sometimes, I suppose. But who gets to do what they want? That\u2019s what growing up is all about, right? Giving up the things that you really want.\u201d</p><p>He made that sympathetic sound in his throat that always made my throat thicken with unwanted tears. \u201cOh, Lana, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It was such a comfort to me through the years, thinking that, though we were missing you, at least you were living a life that made you happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t answer. I couldn\u2019t. My mind was reeling. Was he trying to break my heart all over again? He had a knack for finding new and surprising ways to do it. Not only had I been miserable without his love, now I had to feel guilt that he was sad without my friendship.</p><p>\u201cI would have called you if I knew that you wanted to talk to me,\u201d I told him. I realized, with a burst of bravado, that I wanted to stay in contact with him, wanted to be friends again, no matter how much it broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lana.\u201d His voice was an anguished whisper against my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking my heart, baby. How I must have hurt you, to have you thinking that I didn\u2019t want contact for all of these years. How could you ever think that?\u201d</p><p>Our food arrived, the waitress nodding politely, but retreating quickly. We had to be an uncomfortable sight, me cuddled on his lap with tears in my eyes. It was two heaping plates of sausage and peppers rustica, with liberal portions of thick-crusted bread on the side.</p> <p>\u201cYou never called me, either,\u201d I told him quietly.</p><p>He began to prepare a small bite for me, holding it up to my mouth, feeding me like a child. \u201cI was the bastard who violated you, and then embarrassed you. And I know you overheard that unfortunate conversation I had with Milena. You had a good reason to hate me, so I did the only decent thing I could, and waited for you to contact me again when you were ready. I hated my birthdays every year after you left, because I always thought you\u2019d call me. You used to make such a fuss over my birthdays, and some part of me just always hoped you\u2019d soften towards me a little on that day. But I was so disappointed every time, even though I had no right to expect you to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>I was crying silently by the time he finished speaking, tears running liberally down my cheeks. I had hated his birthdays too, after I left. I had hated mine, as well. I always took a few days off for both of the dates, needing to be alone for the dark depression that always seemed to overtake me then.</p><p>Akira tore off a tiny piece of bread, holding it up to my mouth. I took the bite and chewed it, making myself eat, even though my appetite was nonexistent just then.</p><p>\u201cI could never hate you, Akira. I could never even stay mad at you for more than a day, if you recall. Even when I tried very hard to.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed my head, feeding me a tiny bite of sausage. \u201cIt warms my heart to hear that, Lana.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>He fed me nearly half of the oversized plate before I cried uncle, and he let up on hand feeding me. He began to polish off the rest. I tried to move to the other chair so he could get better access to the food. The man had an unbelievable appetite. He always had. I wasn\u2019t about to get between him and his meal.</p><p>But his arm just tightened around my waist, holding me to him while he polished off everything left on the table with astonishing speed. He left no crust of bread uneaten.</p><p>I was giggling by the time he ate the last scrap of bread, dragging it around one of the plates, getting every last bit of pasta sauce. \u201cI see you still eat a ridiculous amount of food.\u201d</p><p>He just grunted, tugging softly on a lock of my hair. \u201cI\u2019m three times the size of most people. Why shouldn\u2019t I eat accordingly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm, that\u2019s true. You wouldn\u2019t want that perfect bod to get scrawny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d he asked, a smile in his voice.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been, but his smile made me smile, and I suddenly did want to tease him. He had always been the best one to tease. Mari, Tutu, my brother Camden, and I had made a game out of it, and I\u2019d always wanted to be the first one to make his mean face crack into a smile. And I usually had. \u201cOf course not. Anything less than four thousand calories a day and you\u2019d lose your position on the Swole Patrol. How embarrassing that would be for you.\u201d</p><p>He tickled me until I giggled helplessly. I saw heads turning to watch us out of the corner of my eye as we made a spectacle of ourselves. I couldn\u2019t summon up the will to care if we were making a scene. This felt like old times, happy times, and I was determined to savor it.</p><p>\u201cAre you up for a trip to the beach?\u201d he asked me suddenly, his tone serious. \u201cWe\u2019ll surf another day, when you\u2019re feeling better. I just want to watch the ocean with you.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, knowing I should stay at the hotel and work. And I should have been wary of the beach, considering the night I\u2019d had, but I just couldn\u2019t turn down the chance to spend time with him. I\u2019d never had that ability. And there was nothing in the world I\u2019d rather do, than watch the ocean with Akira. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>We thanked the restaurant staff and left. I was walking on my own at that point, but Akira quickly took my arm hostage as we walked to his car.</p><p>Curiously, my hair came loose as we walked, and I glanced behind my shoulder, wondering how it had happened. I sent Akira a suspicious glare. He gave me a toothy white grin, holding up my hair tie without remorse. I elbowed him in the stomach. I thought it hurt my elbow more than it hurt his stomach, but he still threw me over his shoulder for the jab, smacking me soundly on the ass.</p> <p>We were still in the hotel for that little spectacle, and I still couldn\u2019t bring myself to care, cursing him colorfully as I swatted at his back. He threw his head back and laughed at all of the things I came up with to call him. He brought my tirade to an abrupt end as I resorted to calling his mother nasty names. \u201cI\u2019m telling Tutu,\u201d he said quietly, a smile still strong in his voice. It shut me up, though. It wasn\u2019t smart to mess with Tutu. If you started a fight with Tutu, you lost. It was a well-known fact to the locals.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. If you promise to go surfing with me in the morning, I won\u2019t tell Tutu what you called her.\u201d</p><p>He dangled me farther down on his back as he spoke, tormenting me just because he could. It brought me into reach of his ass, so I didn\u2019t mind, smacking it as hard as I could. It hurt my palm, and he just spanked me right back. I spanked him again, softer this time, studying that perfect ass. I was convinced he had the best ass in the world. No one could convince me otherwise. It was perfectly shaped, and, well, perky. He had a perfectly rounded, perky butt. I squeezed it with both hands, and he pulled me higher, squeezing my own ass with one of his hands, in revenge.</p><p>\u201cDeal. I\u2019m not stupid enough to mess with Tutu. Now, put me down!\u201d</p><p>He just laughed again. It was an evil sound.</p><p>\u201cAt least let me squeeze your butt some more, if you won\u2019t put me down,\u201d I teased.</p><p>He set me down then, but I saw that it was because we\u2019d reached his car. He opened the door for me, and I bounced inside, feeling happier than I had in so long...</p><p>I cursed suddenly as I realized I\u2019d forgotten my purse. It was still back in the office. I told Akira so.</p><p>He just shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll have one of my cousins bring it by when they get off work.\u201d Akira had about a million cousins, and many of them worked for our resort. I\u2019d almost forgotten that, for some odd reason. I had been too long from the island.</p><p>Akira was quiet in the car, just shooting me occasional, concerned glances.</p><p>We had been driving for about ten minutes when I realized that we weren\u2019t headed to his house.</p><p>\u201cWhat beach are we going to?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He sent me a small, happy smile. \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take me long to guess, since I remembered the island well, and I couldn\u2019t help but see exactly where he was going. \u201cOh, we can\u2019t, Akira. I don\u2019t even know if anyone\u2019s been taking care of the house. The yard is probably so overgrown that we won\u2019t even be able to navigate through it to get to the water.\u201d</p><p>His smile got bigger and wider, flashing me straight white teeth. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking care of it. It\u2019s as beautiful as ever.\u201d</p><p>I studied him, not sure what to think. \u201cHas my father been making you? You know you don\u2019t have to do everything he asks.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, he never asked me to. I\u2019ve just been doing it. I enjoy it, and I have cleaners come in every week to do the cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing that this whole time?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taking a deep breath. \u201cEver since you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I enjoy it. But also, I guess it was always just wishful thinking. I never wanted to lose hope that you would come back, and when you did, I wanted your little slice of paradise to stay just how you remembered it.\u201d</p><p>I had to look away, touched to the point of tears by his actions.</p><p>He gripped my hand in his. It was so warm, and I clutched it tight.</p><p>We arrived at the long, private drive that led to my family\u2019s island estate. I\u2019d known that I missed the place, but as we approached the house, it was driven home to me just how much. As a kid, I\u2019d thought I\u2019d be living here forever. If anyone would have suggested otherwise, I\u2019d have been baffled, and possibly burst into tears. This was home. This island and this house.</p><p>The house was a colossal, modern villa, with pale stone built into clean lines, and huge windows showcasing the glory of the nature surrounding it.</p><p>We went through the house to get to the backyard. We didn\u2019t linger in the house long, but everything looked to be how I\u2019d left it. It even smelled of plumerias, as I remembered.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, hold up,\u201d Akira said as I pushed the button that opened a huge panel at the back of the house up to the elements.</p><p>I glanced back at him. He held up a tiny island dress, bikini, and flip-flops that he had clutched in one hand. I\u2019d seen him ruffling through the back of his SUV when we\u2019d arrived, but I hadn\u2019t seen what he was grabbing.</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cThanks.\u201d I grabbed them from him, heading past him to the nearest room to change in.</p><p>He grabbed my arm, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s just the two of us, Lana. Do you really need privacy?\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows at his about-face. Taking his question as a challenge, I stepped out of my shoes, unzipping my skirt to let it drop around my ankles. I unbuttoned my shirt, and had my bra unclasped before he could do more than stare. I\u2019d never been shy with my body. Growing up on the island, spending every day in a bikini, it had never even occurred me to cover up. And frankly, I knew his reaction to my stripping would be gratifying. I was not disappointed. His jaw dropped as I got out of my clothes in record time.</p><p>I got dressed nearly as quickly, slipping on the bikini, shrugging into the dress, and slipping into the flip-flops while he just watched me, looking hot and flustered, which was how I liked him best of all.</p><p>I gave him a radiant smile. \u201cReady.\u201d I grabbed his hand, tugging him with me outside. He didn\u2019t resist.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even pause at the pool, going directly for the long trail that led into the lush green forest and to our private beach.</p><p>Akira stopped me at the forest line, reaching to pluck a white plumeria from one of many trees that dotted our property. He smiled as he tucked into my left ear, then started walking again.</p><p>\u201cWrong side,\u201d I told him, feeling silly. Of course he knew that a plumeria over the left ear meant I was taken, and one on the right meant I was looking. Mari had been the one to teach me, years ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>I felt my heart turn over in my chest with a fearful kind of hope. \u201cOh?\u201d I asked in a weak voice. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><p>He sent me a suspiciously innocent look. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not looking for a man, are you? A flower on the right side means you want every interested guy to hit on you.\u201d</p><p>I supposed he had a point, since that was the last thing I wanted. I fingered the flower as we made our way from the small patch of lush forest that led to the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s as beautiful as I remember,\u201d I told him, taking in the enchanted green serenity around me.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>The black sand beach was just as I\u2019d remembered it, too. And the ocean. Oh, the ocean. I\u2019d always had such a fascination with that endless expanse of blue, and I always found it to be the most beautiful right at sunset, which was fast approaching.</p><p>Akira sat in the sand, pulling me between his spread legs without a word. I leaned back against his chest, thinking that this was my own perfect little slice of paradise.</p><p>\u201cI think I could stay like this forever, with you,\u201d I told him quietly.</p><p>He pressed a cheek against my hair, wrapping his arms around my shoulders. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you, then? Give me one good reason why you can\u2019t stay on this rock?\u201d</p> <p>My breath grew ragged, and I couldn\u2019t seem to find the breath to speak. I\u2019d been so brave when I was younger, declaring my feelings with no hesitation or reservation whatsoever. It seemed as though I\u2019d just used it all up back then, with none of it left for the grown-up me. It made me sad, but I still couldn\u2019t seem to ask him the questions I wanted to. Could I just stay here? Was it a terrible idea, or a brilliant one? I couldn\u2019t live my life based on whether or not Akira could love me like I did him. I knew that was not way to live. But could I live here, and see him every day, and be able to endure the longing, if we weren\u2019t together?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it,\u201d I told him quietly, watching the sky turn brilliant with the sunset.</p><p>He nuzzled his face into my neck, placing a soft kiss there. \u201cYou do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stay?\u201d I asked him, holding my breath to hear his answer.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cI want that.\u201d He cleared his throat.</p><p>We were both silent for a long time, watching the sky turn colors in a glorious display that had never failed to move me.</p> <p>\u201cThis place has the most beautiful sunset in the world,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes. The beach for sunset, and Haleakala for sunrise. Guess where we\u2019re going in the morning?\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to give him an amused smile. \u201cYou really want to wake up at four a.m. to catch the sunrise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like three, and yes, we\u2019re going. It\u2019s been years since either of us has seen a Haleakala sunrise, and I think it\u2019s fitting that we go together.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled my back into his chest, feeling a wave of contentment wash over me. Even if the world ended tomorrow, I thought I could be okay with it, after having watched this perfect sunset, and after, a perfect sunrise with the love of my life.</p><p>It only took one small stroke of his thumb against my collarbone to change the mood from sweet to hot in an instant.</p><p>He kissed just the perfect spot on my neck, his hands finding and kneading at my breasts with just the right pressure. I moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to ride me reverse cowgirl,\u201d he murmured into my ear. \u201cSo you can watch the sunset while I make you come. You will never forget this ride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSex on the beach? Isn\u2019t that messy?\u201d I asked ruefully, but I was so game. \u201cWe\u2019ll get sand in our unmentionables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. It won\u2019t be so bad if you\u2019re on top, but it will probably be messy, and God only knows where we\u2019ll be finding sand later. Do you mind?\u201d As he spoke, he was shifting me against him, lifting me higher so that he could slide his hips under me, parting my legs to straddle him.</p><p>I was already untying my bikini bottoms as he opened his slacks, freeing himself. \u201cI do not. I can\u2019t believe you wore a dress shirt and slacks to the beach, Akira.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, but I heard a harsh gasp behind me as I lined myself up over his stiff length. I was already wet, desire only taking the briefest thought for me when it came to Akira.</p><p>I circled my hips, wetting his tip.</p><p>He groaned loudly.</p><p>I worked him into me slowly. I had no choice with his size and the angle. He was so thick that I held my breath as I worked the last few inches inside of me. I sucked in a rough breath when I was finally seated to the hilt, stuffed full of him.</p><p>I just stayed like that for a while, adjusting to the size and the angle, which felt even more wonderful with every breath I took, and watched the sunset.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the sunset in this position,\u201d I gasped at him.</p><p>His hands stroked my hips, kneading at my flesh. \u201cI\u2019m not missing anything, baby,\u201d he rasped. \u201cMost beautiful view I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered at his words, and began to move, pushing on my knees to lift up and forward, then down and back to reseat myself. We both cried out loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, Akira. You\u2019re so big, but it feels so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight, Baby. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll last, but I want to stay inside of you for days.\u201d</p><p>I whimpered, lifting up again, the delicious slide of him dragging along every sensitive nerve inside of me. \u201cI won\u2019t last days, Akira. I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ll last minutes like this.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cGood. Me too. I intend to spend as much time inside of you as possible, and I have no problem trying until we get it right.\u201d</p><p>I ground back down onto him, then dragged up again, my movements getting faster.</p><p>He gripped my hips tighter, moving his hips to take over the movements. I was fine with that, since he built us into just the right rhythm, pounding into me.</p><p>My head fell back, but I kept my eyes open on the brilliant sky as I came, shivers of ecstasy rocking my body as the sky continued to give me the show of a lifetime. I cried out his name hoarsely, unable to even try to keep it in.</p><p>He shouted my name, bottoming out inside of me with one last hard slam, his hard hands on my hips all that kept me upright.</p><p>It took long minutes for us both to recover. We covered the essentials and settled back into watching the sky and the ocean again.</p><p>I sighed contentedly as the last brilliant streaks of gold faded from the sky.</p><p>It was a perfect night, very little of it spent sleeping. I thought that Akira had elicited every last orgasm inside of me by the time I drifted into a deep, but short, sleep.</p><p>He was waking me again way too soon.</p><p>\u201cNo. Humans need to rest, Akira.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Lana. You just need to bundle up and get into the car. I\u2019ll do all the driving, and you can sleep until we reach the top of Haleakala.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said grumpily, sitting up. We\u2019d ended up sleeping in my old bedroom, and I raided the closet for jeans and a sweatshirt.</p><p>We were in the car and driving within fifteen minutes, and I leaned my chair back, promptly falling back to sleep.</p><p>I grumbled when he woke me again, calling him a few nasty names as I woke up what seemed like an instant later.</p><p>Of course, I had to take it all back as I watched the sun rising in what I was convinced was the most beautiful sunrise in the world. Streaks of gold painted the clouds that hovered just below us. Cradled in Akira\u2019s arms, I knew that this was the closest to paradise I\u2019d ever been.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go hang out at the bar,\u201d he murmured into my ear later that afternoon. We\u2019d spent the morning surfing. The saltwater had stung the crap out of my feet at first, but I hadn\u2019t made a peep. I wouldn\u2019t miss out on a day of surfing with Akira for any amount of discomfort.</p><p>I stiffened, because Milena worked there. He seemed to read my thoughts. \u201cMilena is taking some time off. She\u2019s been too unstable lately to even work.\u201d</p><p>I agreed easily enough. I\u2019d never pass up on a chance to see Tutu and Mari.</p><p>We reached the stretch of Kalua shops quickly, sharing a companionable silence in the car. Akira opened the door for me before I\u2019d even unbuckled my seat belt. He had always been like that, always the gentleman for me; even when I was ten, when he\u2019d called me a \u2018little lady\u2019, as he opened it with a flourish. I had secretly loved the title.</p><p>The bar was already crowded, even though it was early afternoon. I realized that it was Friday. This place had always been hopping on Friday night. Two spaces at the full bar magically opened up when a few locals saw that Akira wanted us to sit there. He nodded at them respectfully. They nodded back, not having to explain. It was a fact that Akira Kalua got and gave respect in these parts. No words needed to be exchanged.</p><p>He ordered a beer, looking at me when the bartender asked what for the lady. I smiled at the friendly man, not recognizing him at all. It didn\u2019t mean that he was new, I supposed. It just meant that he wasn\u2019t more than eight years into the job. There was a time when I would have known everyone here. Even as an underage teenager, I\u2019d practically lived here. He was a local. He had a slight build and friendly brown eyes. He was the opposite of Akira looks-wise, looking harmless with his nice smile. \u201cJust water, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Akira gave me a disgusted look, his mean upper lip curling at me. \u201cThat\u2019s borin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cWhat? Are you disappointed that I won\u2019t be getting drunk and letting you take advantage of me?\u201d</p><p>It was a score. He almost blushed at the comment. I leaned forward to whisper in his ear. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t have to be drunk for that. You can search me on the internet anytime you like, and have your way with your filthy palm.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed me, tickling me unmercifully for the taunt. There were tears running down my face before he let me loose, a grin on his face.</p><p>I knew without having to look around that we had the attention of the bar crowd. I didn\u2019t care. I smiled back at him, a happy twinkle in my eye that had been absent for at least eight years. \u201cI know, when you torture me that much, that I hit a nerve.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling at me unreservedly, a smile that was rare and that I treasured. His eyes were soft, and he just looked...happy. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said, pulling me against him and kissing the top of my head.</p><p>We separated quickly from the embrace, both suddenly self-conscious. I resumed my own seat, taking a drink of my water.</p><p>He clucked his tongue at me. \u201cAt least get a soda or somethin\u2019. That is just a sad thing to drink at a bar.\u201d</p><p>I just shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t like soda. I guess I wouldn\u2019t mind tea.\u201d</p><p>He rose, kissing the top of my head again, as though he couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Tutu has the best tea next door. You still take it plain?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my eyes following his every move as he strode across the room. A few familiar locals stopped to greet me, as though they\u2019d been intimidated to approach when Akira was there.</p><p>I smiled and chatted with them, catching up a bit.</p><p>When Akira returned, he brought my tea, and Tutu. They were a sight, mother and son, one so massive, the other the definition of petite. It always made me smile, because the tiny one called the shots. Akira was a respectful, dutiful son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was all smiles, in a doozy of a mood, at her most benevolent. It made all of us a little wary. You had to worry a bit, when Tutu was that happy. She hugged me, a seat magically vacating itself so she could sit beside me. She gave Akira a pointed look. \u201cWell? What are you waiting for? Go work the caf\u00e9. I need to talk to my granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a borderline unfriendly look, but sure enough, he obeyed.</p><p>Tutu turned her regard to me, and I was almost scared at her intense expression.</p><p>Tutu hadn\u2019t liked me at first, when I began to dog Akira\u2019s heels as a child. She\u2019d called me a haole, and ignored me. I hadn\u2019t gone away, so eventually, she had started to talk to me. At first, I\u2019d just gotten lectures about how Maui should belong to the locals again, and how men like my father were the problem. She had scared me as a child, so I hadn\u2019t argued with her, not even to defend my dad. I had just nodded solemnly, as though I understood what she was saying well enough to agree. I hadn\u2019t, but she had taken my agreement as respect. And so our special bond began. I grew on her over the years with my earnest perseverance. She respected my persistence, and my audacity, and I respected her. I had desperately wanted her approval.</p> <p>I was around ten when I began to tell anyone who would listen that I was going to marry Akira when I grew up. Tutu hadn\u2019t liked that. She had been mad at me whenever I worked up the nerve to repeat it to her. But I\u2019d respected her, so I had wanted her to know my intent. She had finally berated me so soundly for it that I had run to Akira, crying. I had explained it to him, and he had been sympathetic, taking me back to the formidable woman so that we could make up.</p><p>Tutu had patted my head affectionately then. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Lana. You\u2019re not a local; you can\u2019t help that. Akira needs to marry a local girl. It\u2019s our way.\u201d</p><p>I had been crying, but I had stood my ground, anyway. \u201cBut I want to be in your family!\u201d I had told her in an angry little voice.</p><p>She had studied me with a little smile. She was a diabolical woman, so even that smile had been a little scary to a ten-year old. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. I don\u2019t have any grandkids, because of my worthless children.\u201d She had paused there to send Akira a long, malevolent glare. He\u2019d smirked, unaffected. \u201cBut you are a lovely child. I\u2019ve never seen a little girl more beautiful than you. Your purple eyes make me think you might have magic, which is very good. And you\u2019re smart. And you\u2019re a stubborn little thing. And I like your backbone. And I think you\u2019re just ornery enough to be a Kalua. So, you may have the distinct honor of calling me Tutu. It means grandma.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d looked at Akira, wanting him to approve. He\u2019d smiled warmly at me, and I was ecstatic. I knew it was the biggest accomplishment of my young life, being the first to call her Tutu.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re family now. Perhaps Akira will be less worthless and stupid when you\u2019re finally a grown-up.\u201d I looked at Akira as she spoke.</p><p>His nose had just wrinkled at her, his only answer. The look said \u2018Not happening\u2019.</p><p>Tutu had continued, thankfully ignoring the look. \u201cAnd since you\u2019re family now, and therefore a local, I will approve of the marriage.\u201d</p><p>I had been on cloud nine for ages after being added to my favorite family. Akira and Mari had turned it into a bit of a joke, and took to calling her Tutu, as well. They said that since she wanted grandkids so badly, that everyone should just call her Tutu, since neither of them planned to ever get married. Soon, all of the locals took up the habit of calling her Tutu, and she had taken to the title as though that was what she had wanted all along.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Tutu brought me back to the present by leaning forward to press her nose and forehead against mine. It was an affectionate gesture, one you would give a granddaughter. I smiled at her fondly as she pulled back to study me. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m old and stubborn, and I decided a long time ago that I\u2019m too old to have to change my mind about anything. I get to be set in my ways now. It\u2019s the law. But I have decided to change my mind about one thing. I wasn\u2019t wrong about it. I\u2019ve just changed my mind. Your haole dad is not the problem with Maui.\u201d</p> <p>I raised my brows at her, wondering where this was going. I had always suspected that she was secretly grateful to my dad for being a mentor to Akira, but she would never admit it. Or so I had thought.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t the problem, because he had you. And if you have Akira\u2019s babies, lots of them preferably, then they will inherit back some of our land for us. So you see, your dad is only some of the problem with Maui.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her weakly, uncomfortable talking with her about anything to do with Akira, now that I was grown. It was obvious that my promise to marry him would not be kept, at this point.</p><p>She just patted me on the shoulder and stood. \u201cI just needed to get that off my chest. I might die tomorrow, so you should listen to me. I might haunt you forever if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>That one made me laugh, my discomfort passing. I had heard that famous Tutu quote many a time. It was one of my favorites. Even as a child, when the thought of being haunted had been kind of scary, I had still felt a little comforted by the notion of Tutu staying near me forever.</p><p>Akira was grimacing as he re-joined me. He studied me. \u201cTutu was giving me the most evil cackle when she sent me back in. You okay? What crazy thing did she say to you?\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head, smiling. \u201cJust some Tutu wisdom. She\u2019s in rare form today. She even threw her, \u2018I might die tomorrow, I\u2019ll haunt you forever,\u2019 line at me. Cantankerous as ever.\u201d</p><p>That made him laugh. I touched the dimple in his cheek as he did so. I couldn\u2019t seem to help it, my hand had a mind of its own. And his eyes got so soft when I did that. He shocked me by pulling me snugly into his arms, placing a sweet kiss on top of my head. When he didn\u2019t immediately release me, I just went with his affectionate mood, throwing both of my arms around his neck, and burrowing my face into my favorite spot on his chest. I knew the bar crowd was staring at us. Akira was not exactly known for being a demonstrative, affectionate man. Just the opposite, in fact. But he had always been different for me. Everyone had probably just forgotten that. I had been gone a long time.</p> <p>He was in a kind mood, and so let me stay like that for a long time, my cheek on his chest, his hand stroking over my hair. I felt him playing with the streaky waves. He even brought a lock to his lips at one point. I wanted to stay like that forever, crowded bar or not. I felt cherished like that.</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak for a long time. I didn\u2019t even consider it. I didn\u2019t want to risk breaking the spell. He took long drinks of his beer, but never relinquished his hold on me, and didn\u2019t push me away. I wasn\u2019t planning to move an inch if he didn\u2019t make me.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get you more tea?\u201d Akira murmured, his mouth close to my ear as he spoke.</p><p>I made a non-committal noise into his shirt. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>His hands stroked my back. \u201cI need to go tell Mari that you\u2019re here, anyway. She\u2019ll never forgive me if you come here to hang out and she doesn\u2019t even know about it. I\u2019ll be right back, k?\u201d He set me away from him as he spoke, and I sat back down in my chair, already missing that warm embrace. He kissed my head before he left.</p><p>Milena must have had someone on the watch-out for him to leave, because just seconds after he\u2019d left the bar, she was taking his seat beside me. She glared at me malevolently. I recognized that she was beautiful. But I had never understood why Akira was with her, other than that. He could have had anyone. And she was rude and mean, and overly aggressive. I had never understood their relationship, but I\u2019d always hated it.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re special to him, but you\u2019re not. You\u2019re nothing but his little puppy,\u201d she said in a vicious voice.</p><p>I just sighed at her weak attack. Really, she could have done better. It wasn\u2019t hard to hurt my feelings where Akira was concerned, but she had somehow managed to miss a very large target.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a point? He says you\u2019re not his girlfriend anymore,\u201d I said, wanting to hear her take on that.</p><p>She flushed. \u201cNot now, I\u2019m not. But he was mine for years, haole. How long did you get him for? A night or two? Just think of how good those nights were, and then think of a thousand nights like that. That\u2019s what I got from him. You got nothing. You are nothing. And yet you have the nerve to disrespect me.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows at her. \u201cHow so? I think I do a pretty good job of staying out of your way, which is what you clearly prefer.\u201d</p><p>I saw her getting visibly more agitated at my words. That hadn\u2019t been my intention. I wasn\u2019t trying to make her mad. I just wanted her to go away.</p><p>She pointed a red tipped finger at me. \u201cYou fucked him when he was my man, back when you were eighteen. I heard you talking about it, so you can\u2019t even deny it.\u201d</p><p>I froze at that accusation, because it actually hurt. \u201cYou were broken up at the time,\u201d I told her, lifting my chin.</p><p>That sharp nail poked me in the chest, hard. It stung. Her voice was a near-shout when she responded, \u201cThat breakup was his idea, and I didn\u2019t agree to it! And, since we got back together a few months later, that breakup didn\u2019t even count. So you fucked my man!\u201d As she spoke, her nail jabbed hard into my chest several times to emphasize her point.</p><p>My eyes widened. So they had been broken up when he\u2019d made love to me the first time. I hadn\u2019t been sure of that, after overhearing a conversation they\u2019d had the day after he\u2019d been with me. The idea that he\u2019d lied to me about something like that had haunted me for years. I was so relieved to find that he really hadn\u2019t lied.</p><p>I just looked at her steadily, determined to pretend her sharp pokes didn\u2019t sting like a bitch. \u201cDo you have any idea how crazy you sound right now? If someone breaks up with you, that is called being broken up. You don\u2019t have to agree to it for it to count.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and I saw the moment her crazy switch snapped on, her eyes going wild, her fingernails flying at my face.</p><p>I\u2019d never been in a fight before, but I\u2019d seen quite a few of them, and I\u2019d always looked down on the girls that used their nails, or went for the hair. I had always told myself that if I ever had to fight somebody, I\u2019d use my fists, goddammit.</p><p>It was pure instinct that had me slapping my hand to her forehead before those mean nails could reach my face. I was taller, so my reach was better. It was that simple. But it hurt like crazy when she started scratching at my arm like a wild animal. I fisted my free hand, almost excited to try my first real punch on somebody. Especially since that someone was Milena. I swung at her face, since her cheek was practically asking me to. It was pointing right at me.</p><p>It didn\u2019t knock her out cold, unfortunately, as I\u2019d been sort of fantasizing it would. It didn\u2019t really even slow her down. I made solid enough contact that it hurt my hand, but it only seemed to piss her off more, if that was possible.</p><p>She finally got ahold of my hair, in spite of my better reach. She yanked a hunk out, hard, calling me every nasty name in the book. I had a few choice words for her as well, the most prevalent one starting with a C. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I punched her again, in the head that time. Oww. That one definitely hurt my hand more than it hurt her head. I quickly resorted to hair pulling, my punching skills sorely lacking.</p><p>I gripped the top of her hair, trying to ignore what she was doing to my arm, even though it hurt like hell. I had a sudden spark of inspiration. My fists were a no go, but my knee might be hard enough to do some damage. I bent my injured elbow, pulling her a little closer, and raising my knee up into her stomach with the same motion.</p><p>Score! I thought. It knocked the breath out of her, and I did it again, just because my arm was wet with blood from her evil claws, and it still hurt like a motherfucker.</p><p>I was getting ready to knee her again when she was torn away from me. I met Akira\u2019s frantic eyes as he grasped her around the middle, pulling her away from me. His eyes ran over me, widening when he saw the bloody scratches that covered my arm. He cursed as he pulled her farther from me.</p> <p>Big arms wrapped around me from behind. I realized that it was some man who thought I was going to try to attack Milena even after she\u2019d been pulled off me. I hadn\u2019t even considered the idea. I saw Akira\u2019s eyes as the man put hands on me. It was a scary sight. They went from frantic, straight to bat-shit crazy, his own crazy switch snapping on. Akira was about to blow. He spared one of the arms holding a furiously struggling Milena to point it at the man directly behind me. \u201cGet your fucking hands off her!\u201d he barked at him. The man released me instantly.</p><p>Akira eyed the crowded bar, his look a warning. \u201cIf anyone else lays so much as a fucking finger on her, I\u2019m going to jail tonight!\u201d Akira shouted to the room at-large before pulling his psycho ex out the door.</p><p>Akira came back inside less than five minutes later, looking positively volatile. His eyes were still wild as he approached me.</p><p>I was sitting in my same chair by the bar, Mari and Tutu hovering over me, carefully rolling up the sleeve of my scratched-up arm to see how bad it was. Other than a missing hunk of hair, it was the only part of my body she had managed to reach. I was kind of proud of the fact. So were Mari and Tutu, going by their excited chatter.</p><p>\u201cMilena\u2019s been in lots of fights, but I\u2019d say you won, pretty girl,\u201d Mari was saying, more concerned with establishing my victory than with the actual fight. I couldn\u2019t help but smile at her enthusiasm.</p> <p>Tutu nodded sagely. \u201cI always knew it,\u201d she said, as though she had predicted the whole thing and knew exactly how it would turn out. It was typical Tutu.</p><p>Mari and I shared an amused look.</p><p>Akira\u2019s first good look at the deep gouges in my arm had him turning away. He strode to the nearest wall, pulled back his arm, and punched a hole in it. It was a very impressive display of both his rage and his strength. I wanted to tease him about it, but knew that it was too soon to try joking with him like that.</p><p>His eyes were less wild but just as agonized when he approached me again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d He squeezed in to embrace me, completely ignoring his mother and sister, who were both cursing him for taking their spots.</p><p>He kissed the top of my head. \u201cCome on, Lana. You need to have those cleaned up at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>I let him pull me gently to my feet by my good hand. Mari and Tutu shouted advice at him as he pulled me to the door.</p> <p>\u201cGet back to work,\u201d he shouted back, ushering me outside.</p><p>He was very quiet in the car, using one hand to drive, the other one warmly gripping my knee. The touch was meant to be comforting, but it was still an instant turn-on for me. I used the hand of my uninjured arm to inch the loose skirt of my sundress up my legs, parting them as I did so. Akira shot me a stern look, but didn\u2019t fight me when I slid his hand higher, onto my inner thigh. I worked the material of my dress high, until I was exposed enough to shove his hand just where I wanted it.</p><p>He stroked me with a soft touch, though his eyes were still hard as he gave me a censorious look. \u201cYou are incorrigible,\u201d he told me, plunging a thick finger inside of me. He stopped the divine motion almost immediately, since we were already pulling into the hospital parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI won the fight,\u201d I told him proudly as he pulled me out of the car by my good hand. I wanted him to know that, in case he hadn\u2019t noticed when he was breaking it up.</p><p>He glared at me. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been fighting in the first place,\u201d he told me with his best lecturing tone.</p><p>I glared back. \u201cYou think I started that? I was just defending myself. Your ex is a psycho, but I still won.\u201d</p><p>His face tightened harshly enough that I felt it pull at the strings on my heart. I could see, just from his face, that he was blaming himself for the whole sordid fiasco. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have left your side. I was so sure she wouldn\u2019t show. I warned her that if she came to the bar while you were in town, or laid so much as a finger on you, that she\u2019d lose her job. I thought surely that would be enough to keep her from trying to harm you, but she either didn\u2019t believe me, or just didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>I was shocked. \u201cSo you fired her?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, his face hard. \u201cAnd you need to press charges. She needs to know that she can\u2019t touch you.\u201d</p><p>I mulled it over. Our fight had been unwelcome, and my arm hurt like hell, but Milena losing her job over it seemed like enough of a punishment, to me. \u201cI\u2019m not going to. If you fired her, I think that\u2019s enough of a punishment.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to argue with me, but he stayed silent, pulling me to the hospital entrance. \u201cI still hate her guts, though,\u201d I continued. \u201cI\u2019m so jealous of her that I can barely stand it.\u201d</p><p>He looked genuinely surprised by my confession. I couldn\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d be surprised by it. \u201cWhy on earth would you be jealous of her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe told me she\u2019d had a thousand nights with you, and I only got two. One and a half, rather. I hate her guts for that. And knowing you two, you\u2019ll probably reconcile again in a week.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a very annoyed look as he opened the door for me. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, Lana. We\u2019ve been broken up for years. Though I guess you wouldn\u2019t know it by how she still acts. I can\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t get over it. We were never good for each other, and over the years, we only got worse. She resented me for what I couldn\u2019t feel for her, and if I\u2019m brutally honest, I only stayed with her for so long because I thought that I didn\u2019t deserve better. I ended it years ago, though, when I realized that I\u2019d much rather be alone than with someone who brought out the worst in me. Milena is a bitter woman who can\u2019t grow up enough to let go of the past. The very distant past, at that. You have nothing to be jealous of.\u201d</p><p>I mulled that one over. She wasn\u2019t the only woman who couldn\u2019t let go of the very distant past. His assessment wounded me, because even though he\u2019d been referring to Milena, I knew that I was no different. I wanted to let go, but I didn\u2019t seem to have that ability. I wished to God that I did. Unwillingly, my mind wandered back to the past.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>8 years ago</p><p>When Akira had asked me what I wanted him to get me for my eighteenth birthday, I hadn\u2019t even had to think about it. I wanted him. Though I was smarter than to tell him that. Instead, I had asked him to spend the day with me. He agreed without hesitation, though he stubbornly insisted that I couldn\u2019t call it a date.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t had to ask me how I wanted to spend the morning. That one was a no-brainer. We spent it in the ocean, catching waves for endless hours. I had straddled my board a lot, practicing provocative poses, trying to tempt him, as I had taken to doing a lot recently. But today, it was different. I was a grown-up today, and there was no reason for Akira not to touch me now.</p><p>I arched my back when he looked at me, thrusting my full breasts forward in my tiny lavender bikini. It was literally the tiniest one I could find, barely covering the essentials. He gave me his stern, \u2018knock it off\u2019 look, and went back to studying the waves.</p><p>When he\u2019d seen me walk out wearing the minuscule suit, he\u2019d just raised his brows and said, \u201cI guess you want to watch me get into some fights on your birthday.\u201d His tone had been dark, his face forbidding, but I had beamed at him, taking it as a good sign.</p><p>He watched the waves for a good ten minutes after he\u2019d given me \u2018the look\u2019, then finally, I\u2019d resorted to drastic measures. I had gone to great lengths to assure that I didn\u2019t have a tan line for tonight, wanting my body to look perfect for him. I\u2019d been tanning naked in my back yard, so the feeling of the soft breeze on my bare chest was not all that foreign to me as I untied the top of my suit, letting it fall down to my waist. I studied the waves, as Akira did, pretending not to notice the slip.</p><p>I felt my breasts tighten the second that he saw what had happened. He started cursing. \u201cLana, your top!\u201d he snapped at me.</p><p>I looked down at my chest, acting baffled, as though I couldn\u2019t imagine what could have happened to it. He was still cursing as he straddled his own board, paddling over to me to fix it himself, since I was being too slow about it. I glanced around as he covered my breasts with the tiny triangles of material. I tried to look worried. \u201cDo you think anyone saw?\u201d</p><p>He glanced around, his face thunderous, ready to stare down, or possibly pound, any poor fool he caught looking. But there was no one. We were virtually alone, all of the other surfers far enough away that they couldn\u2019t have gotten a good look.</p><p>\u201cWill you tie it for me, Akira? I guess I didn\u2019t tie it tightly enough.\u201d</p><p>He tied it at my neck without a word. The triangles didn\u2019t fall into place on their own though, so I was still exposed. I made no move to cover up, so he did that too, moving the thin material over my hard nipples, cursing all the while.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother with the trick again. It obviously hadn\u2019t worked, so the rest of the morning was spent surfing and basking. I spent most of it watching Akira. He was so magnificent that I could have watched him forever.</p><p>We didn\u2019t get back to his house until mid-afternoon. I used his tiny downstairs shower to wash off all of the sand and salt and sea, and Akira used his master bath upstairs to do the same. I had toyed with the idea of slipping into his shower with him and seducing him there, but decided against it. It didn\u2019t seem fair to sneak in on him like that.</p><p>He was lounging on his back on his lived-in sofa when I re-emerged from the bathroom. He was wearing some soft athletic shorts, black with a white stripe down the side, and nothing else, his glorious chest bare. He didn\u2019t glance up at me as I came to see what he was watching on TV. That was fortunate, since I might have lost my nerve if he had looked at what I was wearing, right at first.</p><p>I was wearing a micro-mini pleated red plaid skirt, and a small, short sleeved, white button down shirt with it. It was a naughty schoolgirl look that I had seen Milena wear a few times, and so figured Akira must like the look. Mine had a few extra naughty modifications, like no panties or bra, and all of the buttons undone on my top. It gaped open, exposing my full, tan breasts with their tiny, coral-colored nipples.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wanna do now, birthday girl?\u201d Akira asked without looking up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I bit my lip, deciding to go for it with gusto. I was straddling his prone figure before he could blink, lining my panty-less sex along his soft shorts.</p><p>His eyes flew open wide in shock, staring at my exposed breasts as though he didn\u2019t have a clue what they were. I was unbelievably gratified when I felt him growing hard against me. Instinctively, I started to rub myself against him, finding the material of his shorts to be soft against my bare skin.</p><p>I was a virgin. In fact, I\u2019d never even kissed a guy, since Akira wouldn\u2019t kiss me. But I had a filthy mind and a filthy mouth, and I\u2019d learned all I\u2019d thought there was to know on the internet. It was one of my favorite pastimes lately, finding some new and shocking thing on the internet, then using it to shock Akira. His face turned purple sometimes, when I disturbed him enough with my latest findings. I would get a thirty-minute lecture after that, but it was always worth it. I\u2019d always liked even his sternest lectures.</p><p>I moaned as he just kept growing against me. I could tell he was big, even without looking. He felt massive and hard as a rock as I moved my sex against him, arching my back to rub him on a spot that felt particularly divine. He just watched me, looking like a deer in headlights. I reached into the elastic waistband of his shorts, gripping him with my hand, and he gasped. I made a little sound of pleasure in my throat. I loved the feel of him so much. He was so hard, but the skin on his cock was so smooth, like velvet. I shoved his shorts down, using my hand to rub his now bare erection along my slick passage.</p><p>That got a reaction, and he sat up, pushing me off his lap. I sprawled out on the floor, a little stunned. It had knocked the wind out of me. Akira cursed, then apologized, but made no move to help me up. He looked like he was almost afraid of me. He sat watching me, his elbows on his knees now, shorts again covering his magnificent erection.</p><p>I propped myself up on my elbows, my breasts jutting forward. I drew up my knees, parting them a little so that he could see my sex clearly. \u201cI know what I want for my birthday now,\u201d I told him. I began to touch my sex as I spoke, looking down at the wet folds as I did so.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, obviously reading my intent. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that, Lana. It\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>I pouted at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even let me finish. Don\u2019t you want to hear what I was going to say?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his jaw clenched. Stubborn man.</p><p>I looked down again at myself as I pushed a finger inside. \u201cDo you think my pussy is pretty, Akira?\u201d I asked, wanting to shock him and turn him on with the crude language. \u201cI know men are supposed to love them, but I don\u2019t think mine\u2019s very cute. Do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>His face looked in danger of turning purple, but he couldn\u2019t seem to look away from what I was doing with my hand.</p><p>I stood, shrugging out of my shirt. It hadn\u2019t been covering anything anyway. \u201cI was going to say, before you rudely interrupted me, that I wanted you to kiss me. Just a kiss. I want you to be my first.\u201d</p><p>I approached him as I spoke, and he sat up straight to watch me. I walked until I bumped into his chest, my legs straddling one of his. My breasts were dangerously close to his face. I brushed them against him, once, twice. \u201cWill you be my first kiss, Akira?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. I straddled his legs, my knees digging into his soft couch. I tightened them on his hips as I leaned forward to kiss him.</p><p>I grabbed his hair as I did so, and he didn\u2019t stop me, still frozen in place. I rubbed against him like a kitten, groaning, and he finally reacted, gripping my hair and kissing me back. He tasted divine, and his mean lips were so soft against mine. I felt such an aching emptiness at my core, and I wanted so badly for him to be inside of me, to fill that emptiness. I rubbed my sex against his hard length until we both moaned.</p><p>The kiss went on and on, and I was more than ready for the next step when I finally pulled back. \u201cThank you,\u201d I told him, panting. \u201cThat was exactly how I dreamed my first kiss would be. Now I want you to make love to me.\u201d As I spoke, I brought his hands up to my aching breasts, and he kneaded at the pliant flesh, his eyes intense. I loved watching his dark hands against my skin, the contrast so beautiful to me.</p><p>Abruptly, his hands left me, and he pushed me back up to my feet with hard hands on my hips. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this, Lana. This is wrong,\u201d he told me, his voice harsh and labored.</p><p>I propped my foot up beside his hip, giving him a hell of a view in my micro-mini skirt. I gripped one of his hands, slipping it between my legs to touch me. He didn\u2019t resist me, immediately beginning to touch me just how I craved, his fingers skillful in their soft exploration. \u201cI\u2019m eighteen today, Akira. There\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t take me now.\u201d</p><p>He had a hard finger pushed inside of me, just the tip, as he spoke in a breathless voice. \u201cThere are a million reasons, the first of which is that you deserve better than me, Lana. You\u2019re made of too fine of stuff for the likes of me. And I respect your father. He\u2019s trusted me to spend countless hours with you, over the years. I\u2019m positive that he wouldn\u2019t approve of me doing this with you.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, I wiggled against his big finger, ignoring all of those reasons out of hand. They were ridiculous, to me. I was an adult today, and I would do what I wanted. I pushed down on his finger, and he worked it deeper, groaning as he did so. \u201cYou\u2019re too tight, Lana. I would hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his shorts down, exposing his engorged member. \u201cLook at it, Lana. I\u2019m too big to take a virgin. Especially a tiny little thing like you.\u201d</p><p>I thought his description of me was ludicrous. I was thin, but saw myself as tall and gawky, by no means tiny. But I did kind of like him thinking of me that way.</p><p>Despite all of his protests, he was still working that wonderful finger into me, deeper and deeper, until he reached a barrier. He tested it, rather thoroughly, before he seemed to understand what it was. He cursed fluently, but didn\u2019t remove that thick finger. \u201cThat\u2019s your fucking hymen,\u201d he said, his eyelids heavy.</p> <p>I leaned my breasts into his face, rubbing a hard nipple against those soft, mean lips. He took it into his mouth, sucking on it with a sexy groan. \u201cPleasure me, Akira. Please. I want you to make me come. You can do it with just your fingers and your mouth, right? Would that gross you out, to use your mouth on my pussy? Do you think it\u2019s ugly?\u201d</p><p>He made a hot little noise of protest, his finger moving inside of me, working in and out of me in tiny little strokes. \u201cNo, baby, your pussy is so fucking pretty. I would love to get my mouth on you. It\u2019s the prettiest fucking thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to giggle at the ridiculous thing I\u2019d gotten him to say, but my breath caught in my throat. I still loved to tease him, even while we were doing this.</p><p>I gripped his hair as he suckled at my breasts. \u201cWhat about my breasts? Do you think my breasts are pretty?\u201d</p><p>He moaned. \u201cBaby, every inch of you is impossibly gorgeous, and I know you know it, you little minx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know it unless you tell me, Akira. I\u2019ve only ever cared what you think. I don\u2019t care about anybody else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re beautiful, Lana. Painfully so.\u201d He stroked me with that finger, bringing his other hand to my sex and rubbing circles on just the perfect little spot. So that\u2019s my clit, I thought as my gaze started to go fuzzy with the pleasure of it. His fingers were doing just the perfect things, and he brought me to the sweetest climax. I panted his name softly.</p><p>He had me on my back on the couch, his face buried between my legs before I even knew his intent. I nearly screamed in shock at the pleasure of it. He licked and sucked and used those wonderful hands to bring me to another mind-blowing orgasm.</p><p>After that, he worked on me slowly, kissing and licking and stroking all over my body, finally coming up to my mouth for a long kiss. I groaned as I tasted myself in his mouth. \u201cI need you inside of me, Akira,\u201d I said, when he finally pulled back.</p><p>He shook his head, his mouth tight, his eyes pained. \u201cI\u2019m a bastard for doing this much, Lana. I don\u2019t deserve to lay even a finger on your perfect skin.\u201d</p><p>I reached down, gripping his impressive length and working him free of of his shorts. Our eyes were locked as I spoke. \u201cI\u2019m eighteen, and I\u2019m determined that I don\u2019t want to be a virgin anymore. I went on the pill two months ago. Would you rather it be you to take my virginity, or do you want me to give it to some jerk I meet at college? Maybe I\u2019ll give it up at a frat party. Would you prefer that, or would you rather bury this beautiful cock inside of me tonight. I\u2019ll let you pick.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, and I knew instantly which option he\u2019d chosen. He held my thighs wide apart with his hands, lining himself up at my entrance, his eyes intense and hungry. \u201cLast chance to change your mind, Lana,\u201d he said on a gasp.</p><p>I reached down to stroke him, trying to tug him inside of me. He began to push in with a harsh groan. He worked himself in agonizingly slowly, inch by hard inch, feeding that magnificent length into me with his hand. He stopped when he\u2019d reached that barrier. His breathing was ragged. \u201cThis is going to hurt. I\u2019m sorry; it\u2019s unavoidable. I need to rip this barrier. It will only hurt like this the first time, okay?\u201d</p><p>I just nodded, wanting him deeper inside of me, no matter the pain. He propped himself on both elbows above me, tensing his entire body in preparation. He thrust in hard, sinking to the hilt with the force. He shuddered as he paused inside of me, waiting for me to get used to the fullness. It had hurt a lot, but it still felt good, too. I was so achy and needy for him, and had wanted this for so long, that the pain seemed like a little thing when compared to the joy I felt at finally having him inside of me. He brought a hand between us, circling my clit with his thumb. I began to writhe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking tight that I\u2019m going to embarrass myself, baby. I want you with me when I come,\u201d he whispered. His sexy words, combined with all of the wonderful things he was doing to me, made me pant with my building orgasm.</p><p>He began to thrust, big, heavy thrusts that went on and on, his finger still working on me. He kept going until I began to clench around him with another glorious orgasm. \u201cYes,\u201d he grunted as he began to shudder and come himself. \u201cOh, yes, Lana.\u201d</p><p>After we\u2019d recovered, he carried me up to his bed, tending to me and holding me. We spent the night together, and it was the best night of my life. He made love to me, over and over again, worshipping my body with his. The spell wasn\u2019t broken until morning, when he was thrusting inside of me yet again. He had used me so thoroughly that I was deliciously sore, each movement reminding me of how much he\u2019d enjoyed my body. He brought me to climax first, before he let himself go.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Akira,\u201d I said to him as he lay on top of me when we\u2019d finished. My voice was quiet, but sure. \u201cI always have, and I always will. I want to be with you forever. I don\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened at my words, immediately taking his weight off me and sitting up on the side of the bed, his back to me, his legs on the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible, Lana,\u201d he said, his tone very final. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart stopped in my chest, my mind racing. \u201cYou said you and Milena had broken up,\u201d I said, my voice sounding accusatory.</p><p>He turned to look at me, his features anguished and severe. \u201cWe are. This has nothing to do with Milena. This has to do with you. You have the world at your feet. And you\u2019re still so young. You can\u2019t possibly know what you want, at your age. You need to go to college. You need to go experience life and see the world. You\u2019re unbearably beautiful, and smart, and your family\u2019s wealth means that the sky is the limit for you. You have an amazing life ahead of you, and I would never dream of being the thing that stood in your way. This can\u2019t be anything more than what it was, Lana. It was an incredible night, you were incredible, but I won\u2019t tie you to this rock. I\u2019m not that selfish.\u201d</p><p>His tone was kind, even tender, but all I heard was a rejection. In just a few short minutes, he had stomped all of my dreams of a happy life into dust.</p><p>I was a little numb that morning as I showered, dressed, and left his house. He hovered over me, studying me with worried eyes as I prepared to leave.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay, Lana?\u201d he asked, his voice concerned. But he didn\u2019t touch me, not once. He didn\u2019t correct his clear rejection, or take it back. And he never even came close to saying that he loved me, too.</p><p>I left his house with a broken heart.</p><p>I galvanized myself into professing myself to him one more time, going to his bar that afternoon. I would hate myself if I didn\u2019t give it my best shot. I couldn\u2019t just give up on the thing that I\u2019d always wanted.</p><p>I never even got a chance to speak to him again. I was told by the bartender that he was in his office. I went to the employees only section of the bar without asking. No one paid me any mind. They were all used to me doing as I pleased, since I had dogged Akira\u2019s every step for years now, going wherever I wanted whenever I pleased.</p><p>I nearly barged into his office before I heard the voices nearly shouting inside. The door was open just a crack, and I peeked inside. Milena was pressed against Akira, his hand in her hair. They were embracing, though they were talking, not kissing, as it at first appeared. It was still a clear embrace, though.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. I saw that little piece of jailbait leaving your house this morning! I\u2019ll kill her!\u201d Milena was saying to him, her voice low and mean.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone, Milena. It isn\u2019t what it looked like. Lana is just a family friend with an inconvenient infatuation. Just leave her alone, k?\u201d His voice was earnest and pleading.</p><p>I backed away from the doorway, my hand flying to my chest. He\u2019s still involved with Milena, I realized in horror. I had shamelessly seduced him, not taking no for an answer, but he hadn\u2019t wanted me. He was clearly concerned that he might lose the one that he really cared about, going by the earnest note in his voice. If he did lose her, it would be my fault. He must hate me, I realized, so disgusted with myself that I wanted to be sick. I was just a family friend with an inconvenient infatuation, he\u2019d said. I walked away on leaden feet, feeling sick down to my soul.</p><p>I flew off the island that night. I didn\u2019t return for eight long, desolate years.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>The staff at the hospital recognized us both on sight. My family was well known on the island, and Akira was, well, Akira. He was a local legend. We got the local treatment, a nurse taking me back immediately and cleaning off my cuts in short order, Akira hovering at my back the entire time.</p> <p>\u201cShe got you good,\u201d the nurse said as she checked over the cuts very carefully. She was a local, a short, heavy-set woman with a friendly face and a long black braid running down her back. \u201cBut it\u2019ll heal up in a few days. You don\u2019t need stitches or nothin\u2019.\u201d She grinned suddenly. \u201cWord is you won. Good job. Milena beat up my cousin a few months ago, and for no good reason. I hate that crazy bitch.\u201d Word traveled fast on the island, apparently.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it. I grinned back proudly. \u201cI tried not to resort to fighting like a girl, but you gotta do what you gotta do.\u201d Akira tugged on a lock of my hair. It was a reprimand, I knew.</p><p>The woman threw back her head and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one.\u201d</p><p>We were in and out of the hospital within a half an hour, thanks to the local treatment. \u201cJust be sure to avoid any sitting water, and the ocean of course, until those cuts close up good,\u201d the nurse instructed.</p><p>That killed my good mood. I had wanted so badly to go surfing again in the morning.</p><p>I was sullen as Akira pulled me by the hand out of the hospital and to his car.</p><p>\u201cCan we go to your house?\u201d I asked him as he pulled out of the parking lot. I was a little worried that he would drop me off at the resort.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at me as he grimaced. \u201cTutu and Mari will torture me for at least a month if we don\u2019t swing back by the shops and show them that your arm got patched up fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then can we can go to your house?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He sent me a searching look. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said.</p><p>I felt a wave of relief. I had been worried that, after the drama-filled night, he wouldn\u2019t want to spend any more time with me.</p><p>I considered what to do the next day, since we couldn\u2019t go in the ocean. I sighed heavily. \u201cI guess I need to work all day tomorrow. Since I can\u2019t surf, and I\u2019m already hopelessly behind on my schedule. I\u2019ll need to start really early, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, his eyes almost sad. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t. Spend the day with me,\u201d he said. It was a simple request, uttered in his gentlest tone, and nothing on earth could have made me refuse him.</p><p>\u201cI never could say no to you,\u201d I told him, revealing my vulnerability. It wasn\u2019t as though I\u2019d ever been able to hide it.</p><p>He gave me a wicked grin at that. \u201cI\u2019ll be taking advantage of that. You might regret telling me that.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, my chest hurting a little. \u201cNever. I\u2019d be happy if you wanted anything from me, anything at all. It\u2019s always been that way, Akira. You must know that there\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do just to make you smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lana,\u201d Akira said, stroking a hand over my hair, his eyes sorrowful. I wondered if he looked so sad because my heart was in my eyes, and in my voice, and he felt bad that he could never return those kinds of feelings, not for me.</p><p>We were silent for the last few minutes of the drive, both of us lost in our own thoughts.</p><p>He opened my door, holding out a hand to help me out. He had me pinned to the side of the car in a flash, his mouth on mine in a hard, passionate kiss. He didn\u2019t pull back for long minutes. I pressed up against him, snaking my arms around his back to squeeze his butt. He jumped a little, but didn\u2019t stop me, so I took full advantage, gripping him to me, and caressing that perfect butt at my leisure.</p><p>When he finally ended the kiss, I protested. He just kissed the top of my head, pulling me towards the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dying to kiss you all afternoon,\u201d he told me.</p><p>I was both floored and thrilled by his words.</p><p>Only the bar remained open, so Mari and Tutu had taken up residence there, since their own establishments were closed for the night.</p><p>Mari started humming the theme to Rocky loudly when we walked in the door. Tutu joined in, showing the room her impressive shadow boxing techniques in accompaniment. Their little show of support had me laughing until tears ran down my face. They had the entire room joining in, even eliciting a rare, loud, carefree laugh from Akira.</p><p>Tutu and Mari were in such rare form that we ended up sitting at the bar and talking with them for four hours, catching up and joking and just talking like we used to. It was like old times, and I had missed old times.</p><p>Akira sat in a barstool beside his female relatives, but when I went to take the seat beside him, he\u2019d just pulled me tight against him. I stayed in his arms for the joy-filled evening, soaking him in as I leaned against him, his arms tight around me. When it became clear that we weren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon, he stood, tugging me into the chair, but resuming a similar hold on me from behind, but with him standing. He was affectionate and cuddly, stroking my hair, and bending down to kiss the top of my head often. His actions seemed to make Tutu and Mari giddy with excitement. They kept elbowing each other, huge smiles on their faces every time he kissed my head. He didn\u2019t seem to care what they had assumed by the way he was acting, so I didn\u2019t let it trouble me either. If he wanted to touch me, I wanted to be touched.</p><p>Tutu was well into her cups when she began to get truly outrageous. She pointed an accusatory finger at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you on the pill?\u201d she asked, her tone low and mean.</p><p>I nodded, laughing as she clutched at her heart, shuddering. \u201cThat will make you barren. It\u2019s a fact. Get off those pills immediately. It might already be too late. Let me see your purse.\u201d</p><p>Someone from the resort had delivered my red handbag, and I\u2019d stashed it under the stool, but I shook my head.</p><p>The bag was at my feet, and she dove for it, bouncing back spryly when she had a good grip on it. I just laughed, wondering what she was doing. She dug through it, fishing out my packet of birth control pills almost immediately. My eyes widened. What was she up to now?</p><p>\u201cUm, I need those, Tutu. What on earth are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head stubbornly, pursed her lips, and took off for the bathroom, running like she was sixteen instead of sixty. I turned in Akira\u2019s arms, giving him a baffled look. \u201cAkira, that was my birth control. This is bad.\u201d</p><p>He just shrugged, looking way too unconcerned about the whole thing. I got up with a sigh, intending to follow crazy Tutu.</p><p>Mari sent me a strange look, as though she thought I was crazy, and Akira pushed me back into the stool, wrapping those massive arms around me tightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be alone with Tutu in a small space when she\u2019s in a mood like this, Lana. Trust me. The pills can be replaced.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, supposing he was right.</p><p>Tutu returned shortly, rubbing her hands together and cackling as she stepped out of the bathroom, the pills obviously absent.</p><p>\u201cHas she gotten even crazier?\u201d I asked her children, my tone idle.</p><p>They both just made noises of noncommittal.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me later, since I\u2019m feeling generous,\u201d was the first thing she said as she rejoined us.</p><p>I snorted loudly.</p><p>She rubbed her hands together. \u201cMari and I will plan the wedding. It will be outside, and the weather will be perfect.\u201d Her tone implied that she had some control over that.</p><p>I turned and gave Akira a pointed look. \u201cYou want to set her straight? Don\u2019t you think this is a bit much?\u201d I asked him quietly.</p><p>He just shrugged, smirking. \u201cWhy bother? Let her have her fun.\u201d</p><p>I thought it might be time to leave, since the place had officially turned into crazy town. I told Mari as much.</p><p>She just gave me an arch look. \u201cAnd how crazy are you, pretty girl, that you didn\u2019t know it\u2019s been crazy town all along?\u201d</p><p>That made me laugh, and lightened the mood, the conversation, too.</p><p>I was shocked when I checked the time and saw that it was nearly two a.m. \u201cHow late do you guys normally stay up? It is way past my bedtime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s Friday night?\u201d Tutu asked. \u201cI won\u2019t leave until they kick me out.\u201d</p><p>Mari gave me a level stare. \u201cShe\u2019s not joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay goodnight to Lana. I\u2019m taking her home,\u201d Akira said, hearing my comments. Both women protested, but hugged me goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set up a spa day for the day after tomorrow. Does that sound good?\u201d I asked them. They both nodded enthusiastically.</p> <p>I heard Tutu\u2019s last comment as we were walking out the door. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep her in bed all day tomorrow.\u201d She had projected her voice loudly, as though telling the entire bar.</p><p>I was still laughing as Akira pulled me to his car.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>He was serious on the drive to his house. \u201cYou need to be careful of Milena. It\u2019s hard to know what she\u2019s capable of. You got the better of her that time, but she is usually a better fighter than that. I\u2019ve seen it. I think she was just so mad that she forgot how to fight. If you see her out in public, you need to walk away. I don\u2019t want you getting hurt. She\u2019ll have twice as much to prove now.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone soon enough. I doubt I\u2019ll run into her.\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a hooded glance out of the corner of his eye, his gaze returning quickly to the road. \u201cAre you so anxious to leave us again?\u201d he asked, his voice very quiet.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer, stewing for a while. I decided I didn\u2019t owe him an answer. Not for a question like that.</p><p>His hand went to the back of my head, gripping my hair tightly. I sent him a surprised glance, but his face was closed off, his eyes on the road as he pulled left onto the private drive that led to his house.</p><p>He started kissing me as soon as he opened my door, pushing me against the side of his car. He yanked up my skirt, lifting me against him. I wrapped my legs around his waist, and he groaned. It was a sound of approval from deep in his throat.</p><p>He used the weight of his hips to push me high against the car, and used both hands to pull the top of my dress down. He dragged his heavy arousal against me all the while, making me moan. We were in his driveway, in full view of his neighbors, if they cared to look, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care, not even a little. Even it if had been broad daylight out instead of two-thirty in the morning, I doubted I would have turned him down. I had always been his for the taking. Anytime, anywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou said you could never tell me no,\u201d he said roughly, unclasping the front closure of my bra.</p> <p>My only response was a moan as he kneaded at the heavy globes. He shrugged out of his own dress shirt, ripping more buttons than he ended up unbuttoning in his hurry. He shifted me away from the car, melding our bare chests together.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean it, when you said that?\u201d</p><p>I felt his hand working below me, and then his bared erection was pressing against me. He shifted aside the tiny scrap of lace that served as his only barrier, poising himself at my entrance in a flash. He worked into me with his hands on my hips, my passage already slick enough to ease his progress. He buried himself to the hilt, but didn\u2019t begin to thrust right away, instead holding himself there, so impossibly deep inside of me.</p><p>He used both of his arms to hug me securely against him as he began to walk, moving to his front door now that he\u2019d buried himself inside of me.</p><p>I was lost, each step sending excruciating waves of pleasure straight to my core. My thighs were wrapped tightly around his hips. When he used one hand to unlock his front door, I rubbed against him, dragging my nipples against his chest, my sex clenching him as I wiggled against him. He moaned, ramming into me hard with the same motion he used to shut the front door behind us. He pulled out of me with excruciating slowness, ramming back in much harder and faster, then pulling out slowly again, dragging his thick cock against all of the right spots.</p><p>\u201cFaster, Akira, I want you to fuck me hard and fast,\u201d I told him on a ragged breath. I wanted to drive him crazy. It worked.</p><p>He grabbed my hips and rocked into me. He pounded me against the closed door like his life depended on it, my nails raking his back as I screamed his name. It was almost painful, with his huge girth, but I still loved it.</p><p>\u201cThis is paradise. You took my paradise with you when you left, Lana,\u201d he rasped into my ear. The words drove me over the edge, and I shouted his name as I came. He followed, burying his face into my neck as he shuddered against me.</p> <p>He surprised me by biting my neck as the shudders eased. I yelped in surprise. \u201cI\u2019m going to wring so many orgasms out of you that you\u2019ll be too exhausted to even think about leaving this rock,\u201d he growled into my ear.</p><p>I laughed, feeling almost drunk from the aftershocks of the powerful orgasm. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to try,\u201d I murmured back.</p><p>He pulled out of me slowly, making us both groan in the process. He shifted me around until I was cradled against his chest. His look was a warning. \u201cBaby, I won\u2019t be trying. I\u2019ll be doing.\u201d</p><p>I made a contented little noise, burrowing my face into his chest. He stroked my hair, the tender gesture belying the mean look on his face.</p><p>He laid me on his bed, pulling my clothes off with swift, economical motions. I just lay where he left me, feeling a little boneless as he disappeared into his bathroom. I heard a bath running and a moment later, he was back striding towards me, completely nude. I drank in the sight of his perfect body as he moved.</p><p>I sighed a little dreamily. \u201cYou\u2019re magnificent,\u201d I told him. It was a fact.</p><p>He smirked at me, bending to pick me up. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking,\u201d he said with a grunt, flipping me onto his shoulder. He squeezed my butt as he carried me into the bathroom. He was much gentler as he lowered me into the scorching hot water. He turned back to grab something on the counter, and I got a full, unencumbered view of his perky butt. I made an appreciative little, \u201cMmmmm,\u201d at the sight.</p><p>He threw a grin over his shoulder. \u201cYou always were obsessed with my butt. I couldn\u2019t go out in public without being stalked when you were in high school. You did love to talk about my ass. Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is for a grown man to get his ass ogled by high school girls every time he goes out in public?\u201d</p><p>I laughed until tears streamed down my cheeks, because it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration, and I had simply adored tormenting him with my little schemes back then. The old memories warmed me. I had made a point to tell just about anyone who would listen just how unparalleled his ass was, and my high school friends had been paying attention. All of our eyes had followed Akira whenever we had been lucky enough to catch a glimpse of him coming or going.</p><p>He joined me in the steaming water, and we washed each other with lingering touches. I straddled him so I could wash his thick hair. He kissed me, and I could feel him growing hard against me.</p><p>I shifted, trying to work him inside of me, but he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cI want you in bed,\u201d he told me, rising.</p><p>We dried off, and he tugged me to the bed, pushing me onto my back, and moving over me. He brought our faces close together.</p><p>He watched me, his expression almost wary. We stared at each other for a long time before he cupped my face in his big hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave us again, Lana,\u201d he whispered roughly. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me. Stay. Please.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, not understanding, not even letting myself hope that he meant what I longed for him to. \u201cWhy, Akira?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was wrong. I thought I was doing the right thing when I told you to leave the first time, but I was so wrong. I thought you\u2019d see the world and that your infatuation with me would evaporate. I thought you were too young and inexperienced to see that. But you were right. I was the one that was blind. I loved you then. I adored the ground you walked on, and nothing has changed. I knew I wouldn\u2019t stop loving you, but I was wrong to doubt you, wrong to think that your feelings would change. I\u2019ve been consoling myself for so long with the idea that even if I was miserable without you, at least you were happy out there somewhere. And now that I know that\u2019s not the case, I can\u2019t bear the thought of you leaving me again.\u201d</p><p>My heart twisted painfully in my chest. It was hard to imagine that something I had wanted for so long would just suddenly appear before me. It felt surreal, and I just stared at him dumbly for a few long moments.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the things you said to Milena back then? About me being a family friend with an inconvenient infatuation? Why would you say that if it wasn\u2019t true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way I could think of to manage her. We were broken up, and she was threatening to hurt you. I knew her threats weren\u2019t idle. I\u2019ve seen her do some pretty awful things, and I couldn\u2019t think of another way to stop her from hurting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d forgotten me,\u201d he continued, \u201cuntil some of your friends stopped by to see me. James and Bianca painted a different picture for me, and when I realized that you hadn\u2019t forgotten about me, I contacted your father. He didn\u2019t know that I intended to get you to stay when I talked him into getting you to come to Maui. In fact, I feel like a bastard for manipulating him, knowing that he probably won\u2019t be pleased to know that you and I are...\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Akira had never understood how highly my father regarded him. He was like another son to my father, but Akira had always been too blind to see it.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lana, and I want you to stay. You said you could never say no to me, and I intend to hold you to that. Marry me.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t made it a question, as though he just couldn\u2019t quite do it, and that made me smile even through my tears.</p><p>He wiped the tears away as I nodded tremulously. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, my heart filling with joy. I hadn\u2019t been lying. I was literally incapable of telling him no.</p><p>He smiled, moving against me, and the relief in his face let me know just how much he\u2019d feared my refusal.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said breathlessly, as he pushed himself inside of me.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he murmured roughly, \u201cbecause I\u2019m keeping you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning our wedding, not Tutu and Mari,\u201d I told him some time later.</p><p>He was folded against my back, his hand stroking my hip idly, while we caught up.</p><p>He kissed the side of my head. \u201cIt\u2019s cute that you think that. Let me know how it works out for you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I can go toe to toe with your mother and win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just see about that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>In the end, it was a compromise. Tutu wanted to plan the wedding in two weeks. I wanted two months. We settled on one. I wanted a smaller ceremony, with family and our closest friends. Tutu thought it was completely rude not to invite the entire island. She was closer to winning that one than I was, though I insisted on a ceremony on the beach at my family\u2019s villa, and I got my way there.</p><p>I made my dear friend Bianca fly in a week before the wedding. Since she\u2019d retired from being a flight attendant to be a painter full-time, we\u2019d taken to calling each other nearly every day. I\u2019d been helping her plan her own wedding, and I thought that it was only fair that she become equally involved in my own special day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>James, her ridiculously possessive fianc\u00e9, couldn\u2019t join her for several days, and I picked her up myself from the airport for some one-on-one girl time. Well, as one-on-one as we could get, since she had a full-time bodyguard that tried to follow her everywhere. Considering that she\u2019d been shot just a few months ago, I couldn\u2019t completely blame her crazy future husband for going to such lengths. Two men had died in the attack, and she, her bestie, and her bodyguard had all been shot. I had heard about the whole thing after the fact, when she was in the hospital. I thought of how worried I\u2019d been when I heard about the tragic incident. They\u2019d known she would live by the time I learned of the attack, but I\u2019d rushed to her side, completely distraught. I couldn\u2019t even imagine how James must have felt.</p><p>We hugged. She tried to pull away first, but I held on tight. \u201cThank you so much for coming,\u201d I said into her good ear. \u201cI know it must have been a fight. Is James still having a hard time letting you out of his sight?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and I pulled back to look at her. Her hair nearly covered the quarter-sized, pink scar back near her jaw. It still made me want to cry every time I saw it. Not because it looked that bad, but because I\u2019d heard the story of how it had happened, and the thought that we had come so close to losing her was still a tender wound for me.</p><p>The scar got to me, but Bianca seemed completely over it. She didn\u2019t try to hide it, or show it off. It was as though she\u2019d already forgotten about it. Even the hearing aid that she\u2019d had to adopt didn\u2019t seem to affect her, and I\u2019d only heard her complain one time about the fact that she hadn\u2019t been able to eat solid food for over a month after the attack.</p> <p>I\u2019d made a comment once about the fact that a traumatizing incident that would have defeated most people seemed to have barely affected her.</p><p>\u201cWe were so lucky that it\u2019s hard to sweat the small stuff anymore,\u201d she\u2019d responded with her little shrug. She was just like that, weathering storms in that quiet way of hers. She fascinated and impressed me in so many ways, because she was both one of the most soft-spoken, and one of the strongest women that I\u2019d ever met.</p><p>\u201cJackie tried to come with me,\u201d she told me, as we walked to my car. \u201cI had to put my foot down. I wanted some time with just the two of us, but I guarantee she\u2019ll be here within two days.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. I could tell by her tone that Jackie was growing on her. \u201cAnd how many days do you think James and Stephan will stay away?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, taking the question more seriously than I\u2019d intended. \u201cI predict they\u2019ll come together, and if they don\u2019t show up by tomorrow, I\u2019ll be surprised. I actually think that Stephan will be the one to egg James on, because James is afraid he\u2019s been too smothering since the attack, and Stephan would never think of it that way. The only girls\u2019 time we\u2019re guaranteed is today, most likely, so what should we do before my boys crash the party?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed at her matter-of-fact tone. She didn\u2019t sound a bit put-out about it, either, which was good, because I couldn\u2019t imagine James becoming less possessive of her time in the near or distant future.</p><p>\u201cWell, we need to stop by for a last dress fitting. It shouldn\u2019t take too long, so how about an afternoon at the spa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d she said easily.</p><p>We met Mari at the bridal shop. She was my maid-of-honor, and Bianca was a bridesmaid, but it was the first time the two of them had met. I was relieved but unsurprised when they got along right off the bat. Neither were the type to cause drama.</p><p>I tried on my short silk wedding dress, pleased with the fit. It was a simple design, and perfect for the beach. I couldn\u2019t have been happier with how it had turned out. It hugged my curves in a flattering way, showing my legs off to advantage.</p><p>Mari and Bianca tried on their light blue silk dresses. They were designed very similarly to my wedding dress, and both of the stunning women were suited to the look, if in very different ways.</p> <p>\u201cHave the other bridesmaids pay me a visit as soon as they get into town,\u201d the dressmaker told me as we left. The fitting hadn\u2019t taken more than a half an hour. \u201cThe sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>I nodded that I would. Sophia and Jackie weren\u2019t due in town for three more days, but I would pass the message along.</p><p>We spent a long, lazy afternoon at the spa, Mari joining us as we caught up on every little thing. Tutu showed up within an hour of our arrival, and Bianca and I good-naturedly gave up on a day of one-on-one time. There was plenty of time for that later, when we weren\u2019t in the midst of wedding madness.</p><p>I could tell right away that Tutu liked Bianca, but that she liked messing with her, too.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t another tall blonde woman that\u2019s here to steal our local men, are you?\u201d Tutu asked Bianca with a glare, as we had our toes done. \u201cAround here, we smack the nerve right out of white girls for doing that.\u201d</p><p>Bianca wasn\u2019t intimidated, as Tutu had been expecting. Instead, she threw her head back and laughed. She pointed at Tutu, still smiling. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all about you, Tutu. Lana warned me that you might call me a haole and give me a hard time. I\u2019m ready for you. But you don\u2019t have to worry about me stealing any men. I\u2019m engaged, and he\u2019s not a local, though when you get a look at him, you\u2019ll still probably want to smack me.\u201d</p><p>Tutu grinned back at her. \u201cYou\u2019re another sassy blonde girl. I like that.\u201d</p><p>I was relieved. When Tutu decided to dislike somebody, things got a little too interesting. I could only hope that she wouldn\u2019t take exception to any of my other bridesmaids.</p> <p>Bianca was staying with me at my family estate, since it was the location of the wedding, and there was plenty of room for all of the mainland bridesmaids and groomsmen. Akira and I hadn\u2019t even considered the idea of sleeping separately until the wedding, so he was staying there with me, as well.</p><p>He met us the second we all came, laughing, through the front door of the villa. He was smiling. I quickly saw why as two men appeared behind him.</p><p>Stephan didn\u2019t hesitate, striding forward with a smile to embrace a startled Bianca, and then me. He politely introduced himself to Mari and Tutu while I glanced at James, who was still hanging back, studying Bianca with a wary look. I glanced at her.</p><p>She looked a little surprised, but not unhappy, that she\u2019d been followed.</p><p>As though he couldn\u2019t help himself, James moved to her, crushing her against him as he said something into her ear that had her blushing profusely as he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you, Lana?\u201d James asked, looking towards me with a grin.</p><p>I grinned back, knowing the part he\u2019d played in my own personal bliss. \u201cAs well as you could expect, considering that I have the best friends in the world.\u201d</p><p>Jackie and Camden, and Parker and Sophia all showed up two days later, my parents a day after that. Watching my father with Akira did something very good for my soul, especially with everything on the table as it now was.</p><p>My father greeted Akira before he even gave me, his favorite little girl, so much as a glance. I didn\u2019t feel slighted, and I wasn\u2019t the least bit worried about his approval. He, like me, had only ever seen the good in Akira.</p><p>The two men embraced, and I saw that my father said something into Akira\u2019s ear that had the huge man looking suspiciously watery eyed.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t heard my father\u2019s words, but I did hear Akira\u2019s clear, quiet response. \u201cThank you, sir. That means the world to me.\u201d</p><p>My dad was in his fifties, but still a very handsome man. Camden and I both took after our mother in looks, but I thought that we\u2019d both have been fine taking after him, too. Our dad was tall and elegantly built, with silver hair and warm brown eyes that at that moment somehow reminded me of Akira. He had the warmest, most enchanting smile, and it enchanted me more than ever when he turned it on Akira.</p><p>\u201cCall me Dad,\u201d I heard him say quietly to Akira, and I just about lost it. I had to fight not to burst into sappy tears, at the dumbfounded, grateful look on Akira\u2019s face.</p><p>I asked Akira later what my father had said into his ear. He clenched his jaw, and I could see that he had to struggle not to get choked up at just the memory.</p><p>\u201cHe told me, \u2018About damn time, son.\u2019 I didn\u2019t expect him to approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I told him, giving him a tight hug. \u201cWhich is silly. He thinks the world of you, you know. He always has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel worthy. Of either of you.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed him tighter. \u201cWell, you\u2019re just going to have to get over that. We\u2019re all family now. All we can hope is that Tutu doesn\u2019t try to box my dad\u2019s ears at the wedding.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t really worried about that possibility, but if I was just a touch worried, I needn\u2019t have been. When Tutu and my father finally met again, face to face, they embraced for so long, whispering into each other\u2019s ears, that my ravishingly beautiful mother had begun to shoot them some rather disgruntled looks. That was ridiculous, of course, because when they pulled back I saw the tears in Tutu\u2019s eyes. After all these years, she had finally thanked him for all he had done to mentor her son. I could tell by the look on my dad\u2019s face that it had been worth the wait.</p><p>As Tutu had predicted, the day of the wedding dawned sunny and picture perfect, and she took full credit for it.</p><p>Tutu wore light blue to match the bridesmaids for pictures, and she fussed over me as I dressed for the beach ceremony. I couldn\u2019t help taunting her a little as she worked on straightening the lei around my neck, her lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cI told you so, Tutu,\u201d I told her quietly, with a smug little grin. It felt smug, but a happy kind of smug.</p><p>Her eyes shot up to mine, one sassy brow shooting straight for the sky. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you years ago that I would marry Akira, and you told me it would never happen.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cSilly girl. This was all my idea, the whole time. I was using reverse psychology on you, and you fell for it. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I laughed so hard that I had to have my eye makeup redone.</p><p>We had a short ceremony on the beach at sunset, with less than a hundred guests in attendance. We watched each other as we said our vows. Akira\u2019s face was stoic, but I could see the strong emotion in his eyes, and I was certain that he could read the adoration in mine.</p><p>I\u2019d spent a little time regretting all of the years we could have been together, if I had just been brave enough to come back sooner, or if he had just been bold enough to contact me, but I felt at peace even with that, as I looked with clarity at the good years ahead of us. I knew that we would never take each other for granted, or fail to appreciate what we had. Our time apart had been painful, but it had forever assured us of that.</p><p>Akira gave me the biggest grin as we were announced man and wife. He looked breathtaking, his hair pulled back to show off his starkly handsome face, dressed in white, with a maile lei draped over his strong shoulders.</p><p>We had only invited about one hundred close friends and family to the beach ceremony, but the reception/wild party was a whole different story. There was only a short list of people on the island that weren\u2019t invited. The family estate was opened up and equipped for a hell of a party. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a completely uncharacteristic move for me, I made no attempts to be a good hostess. I didn\u2019t greet all the guests, and I didn\u2019t make the rounds to mingle, or to share my time. I left that to...whoever. I knew my mother, father, my devilish brother, Camden, or hell, even Jackie, could take over those duties. This was supposed to be my day, and so I took that literally, doing the only thing I wanted to do. Akira and I danced, for hours and hours. We completely monopolized each other, stopping occasionally to chat and catch up with friends and family, but my goal was to spend as much of the magical night in Akira\u2019s arms, and I thought I succeeded admirably.</p><p>We weren\u2019t the only love-struck couple I caught mooning over each other that night. James and Bianca did much the same, dancing and sharing positively indecent looks for most of the night.</p><p>The party lasted into the next day, and we were dancing barefoot on the beach, out of sight from our guests, as streaks of dawn light began to color the sky.</p><p>Music from the party drifted to us. We were far enough away that we only caught bits and pieces of it, barely enough to keep rhythm.</p> <p>Akira sprawled out on the sand at my feet suddenly, smiling up at me, as happy and carefree as I\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cHave you heard of the Hawaiian custom of wedding night beach sex?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a rueful smile. I was long past the days of falling for all of the local custom shenanigans. Generally, any sentence that began with, \u2018Have you heard of the Hawaiian custom?\u2019 ended with a prank.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. And it\u2019s past the wedding night. I\u2019d say it\u2019s officially morning now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I meant. Wedding morning beach sex. It\u2019s a well-known fact in these parts that if you have wedding morning beach sex you\u2019ll both live to be a hundred, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, yesterday was our wedding morning. Today is the next morning.\u201d I broke off, giggling, as he tickled me until I fell on top of him.</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re missing my point,\u201d he told me with a grin, still tickling me mercilessly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d I gasped, trying in vain to tickle him back.</p><p>\u201cWe need to make love on this beach right now if we want to grow really, really old together.\u201d He let up tickling my waist, burying his hands in my hair to kiss me. I was straddling him by the end of that long kiss.</p><p>I pulled back to smile into his eyes. \u201cWell, as long as it\u2019s really, really old,\u201d I murmured, resealing my lips over his. </p> </body></html>"]
