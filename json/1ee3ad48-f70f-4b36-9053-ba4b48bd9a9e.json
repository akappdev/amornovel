The winds picked up force, and Tessa Anderson\u2019s adrenaline surged again as she snapped the last of the photos for the magazine. The summer drought had continued on through the fall and winter, leaving the California forests desert-dry, and now either a careless camper or an arsonist had turned the woods into a fiery inferno.</p><p>What in the world was she doing risking her life to photograph this disaster?</p><p>Coughing, her eyes filled with smoke, she reminded herself she needed the money to help defend her brother. Then in the haze, the silhouette of a wolf appeared\u2014gray, like the smoke, a phantom. watching her. stalking her? Wild animals knew better than to linger with danger threatening. Only a human would be dumb enough to stay put.</p> <p>His uncharacteristic actions made her back toward her vehicle. Having been fascinated with wolves all her life, she knew his behavior wasn\u2019t natural.</p><p>A tremor stole up her spine. He looked just like one she\u2019d seen before. The one who\u2019d attacked before.</p><p>Snapping a picture of the wolf, she bumped against the passenger\u2019s side of her Escort. As soon as she fumbled for the door handle, he crouched, readying to spring like a coiled snake.</p><p>Heart thundering, she jerked her door open and jumped inside. Before she could shut the door, the wolf\u2019s hulking body slammed against it, knocking it closed. She jumped back.</p><p>Snarling, he bared his wicked canines. She scrambled over the console and twisted the keys in the ignition, her skin prickling with panic. Tires spun on gravel as she whirled the car around and headed for the main highway.</p> <p>A half mile later, she came across a home in the direct path of the fire. An SUV was parked in the driveway. Its trunk lid was open and the back filled with boxes. Reassured that the occupants were leaving, she tore on past.</p><p>Her main concern now was returning to her brother\u2019s trial and praying he would be found not guilty.</p><p>Hunter Greymere shoved four more suitcases in the SUV while his twin sister rushed out of the house with another box of dishes, her face and clothes covered in soot.</p><p>The air was so thick with smoke, Hunter choked, fighting to draw in a breath of fresh oxygen. \u201cMeara, enough! Get in the vehicle. We leave now!\u201d</p><p>Black plumes of smoke spiraling upward indicated fire had claimed another of his pack member\u2019s homes and was growing ever closer to his own. Ash rained down like a light gray snow flurry. the smoke blocked out the sun, but the flames lit the sky with an eerie orange glow.</p><p>Meara shook her head and dashed for the house. \u201cWe have to get the safe.\u201d</p> <p>Seizing her arm, Hunter pushed her toward the vehicle. \u201cGet in the SUV! I\u2019ll grab the safe.\u201d</p><p>The look of mutiny on her face meant she would disobey him. He didn\u2019t have time to make her listen. Running in a crouch so he could breathe, he grabbed the steel box from his bedroom closet and carried it through the hazy living room. He crashed into Meara, stooping low, her arms filled with another box.</p><p>\u201cOut, now!\u201d he growled.</p><p>The blaze crackled, incinerating the old forest and homes in its path. The emerald green woods, already rusty with trees that had died from insect infestations and drought would soon be blackened. And the home they had lived in for two hundred years would vanish in a roaring ball of fire. No time for regret now.</p><p>The super-heated gases singed Hunter\u2019s throat and lungs, and he chided himself for staying as long as they had. After climbing into the vehicle, he turned the fan on high, but the car was already so filled with smoke, his eyes and throat burned. Meara\u2019s amber eyes glistened with tears as she covered her mouth and nose with a wet towel.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be all right, Meara.\u201d Hunter gunned the accelerator and sped toward the highway that would take them to Oregon, nearly hitting a Ford Escape in the fog-like smoke in front of them. The driver apparently had the same notion, but was not driving fast enough for Hunter\u2019s liking.</p><p>\u201cHell, who is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOregon plates. Some idiot human camping out here? Who knows.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA woman? By herself?\u201d</p><p>He peered harder into the smoke and made out a crown of flame red hair cascading over her shoulders. Intrigued, he wondered if her face was as enchanting as the waterfall of red curls. But then he scowled. She shouldn\u2019t have been here in the first place.</p><p>He followed her as she hightailed it out of his territory in an attempt to keep ahead of the eye of the firestorm, and him. And for an instant, he felt like a predator stalking his prey. \u201cAt least we got all our people out.\u201d</p><p>Meara didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>She didn\u2019t adjust well to change. Moving from the Scottish Highlands over two hundred years ago to the untamed California wilderness hadn\u2019t set well with her. But change was inevitable for the lupus garous. Meara had been lucky they hadn\u2019t had to move as much over the years as many of their kind, hiding the fact that once they reached eighteen, they aged only a year for every thirty.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked, staring out the window at the vast ancient pines that would soon suffer the fate of their steadfast companions.</p><p>\u201cTo Oregon. Uncle Basil called earlier this morning while you were helping others pack. He\u2019s retiring to Florida. The cabins on the Oregon coast are ours now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorida? Are there any of our kind there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal red wolves on St. Vincent Island off the Panhandle of Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal red wolves?\u201d Meara snorted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he liked mixing it up with red wolves, period. But real wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he found a pack of gray lupus garous near the Everglades.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSo what\u2019s he going to hunt there? Alligators?\u201d She let out her breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to move to the Oregon seacoast.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t respond. It didn\u2019t matter where they went. Unless it was back to their home in the woods, she wouldn\u2019t be happy. Not until she had time to settle in. Hopefully, it wouldn\u2019t take as long as the last time.</p><p>Hunter finished his shower at Uncle Basil\u2019s home, nestled in the woods overlooking the rugged Oregon seacoast, but couldn\u2019t get the smell of smoke out of his nostrils, and his eyes and lungs still burned. Nothing had gone as he\u2019d planned. Not only was Meara refusing to speak with him\u2014as he expected\u2014but his people had mutinied as well.</p><p>As soon as he joined his uncle in the living room, he realized the day wasn\u2019t going to get any better. Not the way his uncle gave him a warning look.</p><p>Once Hunter assured himself Meara couldn\u2019t hear them from the laundry room, he settled on the leather couch. \u201cSo what didn\u2019t you tell me when you offered this territory for my pack?\u201d</p><p>Uncle Basil sat on his suede recliner, looking like he had aged ten years since the last time Hunter had seen him, his hair grayer, longer, his beard shaggier, his amber eyes tired. Which meant his uncle must have had some real trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem you\u2019ll have to deal with. One of your neighbors has been taking pictures in our woods. It wouldn\u2019t do for her to catch you shapeshifting. I tried to buy her out, but she won\u2019t budge. First her grandparents, and now she and her brother live in the house about twelve miles south of us on the coast. You\u2019ll need to make her understand she can\u2019t trespass on our land any longer. Of course, if your pack doesn\u2019t return from where they\u2019ve scattered, it\u2019ll be just you and Meara enjoying the area in your fur coats. But when you lease the cabins to other grays, the risk will become greater. Up until recently, the place has been a safe haven for them, but this woman...\u201d Uncle Basil shook his head.</p><p>Hunter knew damn well his uncle normally wouldn\u2019t hesitate to eliminate her if she could expose their kind for what they truly were. \u201cYou mean, the woman will be at risk.\u201d When Uncle Basil didn\u2019t say anything in response, Hunter swore under his breath. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t do it, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re retiring?\u201d</p><p>His uncle avoided looking at him.</p><p>Hell, as if Hunter didn\u2019t have enough troubles to contend with. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll take care of it. Are you going to have supper with us before you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already ate. Got a ticket on the next flight. I left a couple of salmon steaks out for you. Place is stocked with food so you won\u2019t have to shop for a while.\u201d Uncle Basil stretched his six-foot-two frame. \u201cLooking forward to sunshine warming these old bones. Hips are bothering me something fierce. Figure the cold dampness might have something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Then he leaned forward. \u201cYour mother and father would have been proud the way you\u2019ve managed to keep the pack safe all these years. Your people will return. Give them time. Just be sure and take care of the woman. Her brother most likely is going to prison for murder, but the woman\u2019s still a threat, unless she decides to move. Tessa Anderson\u2019s the name. Take care of it. And soon.\u201d</p><p>He stood and gave Hunter a fatherly embrace, then said his good-byes to Meara. Hunter waved as his uncle left in his old pickup, wondering why he hated to buy new vehicles as much as Meara hated to change where she lived.</p><p>Hunter walked to the picture window overlooking the Pacific Ocean and stared out at the gray day, the cold, fog, moisture\u2014in stark contrast to the dry, burning heat and smoke of their abandoned home. Regret and relief warred with his emotions.</p><p>Meara slipped up next to him. \u201cI don\u2019t like being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Knowing full well she wouldn\u2019t appreciate any attempt to console her, he headed into the kitchen and tossed the salmon steaks into a frying pan. He was determined to enjoy their newly acquired cabins, even if his sister didn\u2019t like it. Not that they\u2019d had much choice. Settling with the insurance company would take forever and most of their savings were tied up in mutual funds.</p><p>\u201cIt reeks of fish here. How Uncle Basil could have ever stood it... I didn\u2019t remember why I hated this place whenever we visited. But that was it. The strong odor of fish and rotting seaweed.\u201d She opened a kitchen cabinet door, peered in, and then slammed it closed, rattling a couple of others. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEventually, you won\u2019t even notice it.\u201d</p><p>She opened another cabinet door and pulled out a can of spinach. \u201cI want a mate! How am I going to find one way out here? You\u2019ve made sure there are no other lupus garous in a four-hundred mile stretch of land.\u201d</p><p>So that was some of the trouble. Not that he\u2019d had much luck finding her a mate in California either because she\u2019d been so choosy.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration. Besides, when we rent the cabins, the grays will come from all over the country and you can find a mate.\u201d</p><p>He hoped. Never having discussed Uncle Basil\u2019s clientele with him, he assumed his uncle advertised on the Internet and in magazines that would help draw a crowd from all over. All Hunter had to do was tweak the ad to let alpha male leaders who were without a mate know his sister needed one.</p><p>Hunter flipped the steaks, seared them for a minute, and then tossed them on the rose china that had been passed down two generations. \u201cWhat did you want us to do? The arsonists destroyed the forests and moving north to Oregon was the best thing we could manage.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply and he sighed. \u201cSo, five members of our pack moved into the vineyards in southern California. What kind of a life would that be? We\u2019re used to hunting in woods during our nighttime excursions. No other lupus garous live in the area, so no worry about encroaching on another pack\u2019s territorial rights. Besides, Uncle Basil decided it was time to retire and was glad to gift us the land and cabins. It couldn\u2019t be more perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s this really about? Uncle Basil never once mentioned he wanted to quit the business,\u201d Meara said.</p> <p>\u201cWe were happy in California. He knew unless something like this happened we wouldn\u2019t have moved a foot out of there.\u201d</p><p>She peered out the window. Her spine straightened and her mouth dropped. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She flipped her long, dark hair over her shoulders and headed outside.</p><p>He strode to the window and looked out.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>It was the woman. Had to be. Tessa Anderson, the photographer. Petite, swallowed up in a white parka, she trudged toward their house with a camera strap slung around her neck. The camera bounced between her full breasts, which were accentuated by the snug fit of her pale blue turtleneck. Her jeans outlined curvy legs, and suddenly he had the most lascivious thought, wondering what was wrong with him at a moment like this, to be envisioning this woman naked with her long legs wrapped tightly around him.</p><p>A pink ski cap hid her hair, but her brows were red, her green eyes sparkled with fire, and her cheeks and pert nose were rosy from the cold. Full, sensual lips shimmered with pink gloss that begged for a man\u2019s caress. Her eyes garnered his attention again. Expressive, vibrant, full of life, yet a subtle sadness marred them.</p> <p>Why was she wandering the woods alone when the night would soon cast her into darkness? Why here? Unless she had made friends with Uncle Basil and had come to see him.</p><p>Hell. No wonder he couldn\u2019t get rid of her himself.</p><p>Meara quickly confronted her, and Hunter raised the window to overhear the conversation. Even though he planned on talking to Miss Anderson, it didn\u2019t hurt for Meara to tell the woman the error of her ways. At the very least, giving Meara some control over their lands would make her feel more at home here.</p><p>Meara raised her hand to the woman in her path. \u201cYou\u2019re trespassing.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes narrowed and her brows knit together in a tight little frown. \u201cUncle Basil said I could take pictures out this way during the winter because he didn\u2019t have any B&amp;B guests this time of year.\u201d</p><p>She had Uncle Basil\u2019s permission? What was the crafty old wolf up to?</p><p>\u201cUncle Basil?\u201d Meara asked, her voice rising.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he told me to call him.\u201d</p> <p>So, Uncle Basil had a relationship with the human female after all. Which wasn\u2019t like him.</p><p>\u201cWell, his real niece and nephew have taken up residence, and Uncle Basil has moved to Florida. The rules are different now. Find somewhere else to take your pictures. Don\u2019t come here again.\u201d</p><p>The woman glanced at the house. Looking to rescue Uncle Basil? Or maybe she hoped he\u2019d come out and save her from Hunter\u2019s sister?</p><p>Facing Meara, she offered her gloved hand. \u201cI\u2019m Tessa Anderson, a professional photographer. I live down the coast.\u201d</p><p>Meara folded her arms. \u201cThen you must have plenty of photo ops on your own land.\u201d</p><p>Tessa stiffened and Hunter could see now the woman wasn\u2019t going to be easily persuaded. Her jaw tightened and her eyes flickered with inflexible resolve.</p><p>\u201cEvery area along the seacoast is different. And it changes as the tides pummel the coastline. It varies with the seasons also.\u201d Tessa tilted her head to the side. \u201cUncle Basil never said anything about moving. He isn\u2019t ill, is he?\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head. He admired tenacious lupus garou women, but a human female like that could cause real problems. So why was he checking out her package again\u2014the way her turtleneck caressed her breasts, the camera strap pressing between the sensuous mounds, outlining them further, and lower to the jeans accentuating her long, curvy legs.</p><p>Lifting his nose, he took a deep breath. Because of the shifting breeze, despite the smell of pines and the sea air overwhelming all else, he caught a whiff of the woman\u2019s scent\u2014of peaches and... tequila and margarita mix?</p><p>His eyes widened a bit as he smelled something else, something that generated an age-old need\u2014a desire so strong that it could only mean her pheromones were triggering his craving. What the hell? She wasn\u2019t a lupus garou\u2014didn\u2019t have their distinctive scent, yet sexually, she served every bit as much a magnet for a male lupus garou.</p><p>His gaze fastened on her eyes, now narrowed a little, sharp and full of mistrust.</p><p>\u201cDid he always keep you posted on his plans?\u201d Meara asked Tessa, being her usual snarky self.</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to have dinner with him.\u201d Standing taller, Tessa considered the house again. \u201cDo you have a number where I can reach him? Or an address?\u201d</p><p>Dinner? Had Uncle Basil forgotten? Or conveniently avoided it, which would explain his warning\u2014although cryptic\u2014about Tessa before he left. Hunter let out his breath in exasperation.</p><p>Meara snorted. \u201cLeave, now, or I\u2019ll call the sheriff. Don\u2019t come back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, too.\u201d Tessa glanced once more at the house as if to say she wouldn\u2019t be thwarted from seeing Uncle Basil. Her breath mixed with the cold air in a puff of smoke, she lifted her chin a little, and then whipped around, and headed back into the woods.</p><p>The urge to hunt the minx filled Hunter with a craving so strong, he had to remind himself she was a threat to their existence. If she\u2019d been a lupus garou, that would be a different story. He would have shown just how interested he was and worn her down until she felt the same for him, if she didn\u2019t automatically. But a human like her was nothing more than tempting forbidden fruit\u2014one taste would never be enough. Best to buy her out and remove the menace from the area.</p><p>Meara stalked into the house, saw Hunter at the open window, and gave a half smile. Then she frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t you go getting friendly with that woman, too. Jeesh. I heard you and Uncle Basil talking about her. You know, the lower your voices go, the more I listen in.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo wonder Uncle Basil couldn\u2019t get rid of her. Sweet and innocent. Miss Red Riding Hood in a white parka.\u201d She raised a brow. \u201cAnd by the way, as petite as she is, her boobs are silicone\u2014have to be.\"</p><p>No way was the woman anything but the real thing, every bit of her, and he wanted to prove to himself they were in the worst way. Hunter shut the window. \u201cYou made Tessa Anderson suspicious. She thinks we\u2019ve buried Uncle Basil in the backyard. So now I\u2019ll have to take care of it.\u201d And he would, starting tonight.</p><p>\u201cHmpf. What about the rest of our pack?\u201d Her spine stiff, Meara stirred the spinach heating on the stove and refused to look at him.</p><p>\u201cThe seven who took off for Portland will return when they get tired of city life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they moved to greener pastures, and we\u2019re stuck in Timbuktu?\u201d Meara\u2019s amber eyes flashed with irritation, her lips turned down.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll rent only to lupus garous, like Uncle Basil did. We\u2019ll entice eligible alpha males to visit, and you\u2019ll put them under your spell.\u201d He failed to understand how she couldn\u2019t see the beauty of the area. If she would just take a run with him in the woods, work out some of her frustration, she would feel better. \u201cWe\u2019re not a city pack. The rest will tire of it before long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d She yanked out her chair and dropped into it, fixing him with another chilling look.</p><p>\u201cThey can join us here. Plenty of game for hunting on moonlit nights. Oregon has laws to protect wolves. We won\u2019t have any problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go to the city.\u201d She looked up from her salmon and although she kept her expression stern, her eyes glistened with tears.</p><p>Ah, hell. What really was the matter?</p><p>\u201cA red pack already resides in Portland.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth parted.</p><p>Hunter clarified, \u201cLeidolf is the pack leader. I met him last spring when you wouldn\u2019t come with me to see Uncle Basil. He seemed a nice enough lupus garou for a red. As nice as one can be when he\u2019s dealing with a gray pack leader, but he won\u2019t like it that some of our pack are encroaching on his city.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cFine. You\u2019re bigger than the reds. Push them out and we can start over there.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in his chair, he studied his sister\u2019s stubborn expression. She\u2019d always been so predictable, so agreeable. What was wrong with her now?</p><p>\u201cQuit looking at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind. I\u2019m in my first wolf\u2019s heat and I... want... a... mate! Damn it. Don\u2019t you ever feel the pull? No, of course not. You have one-night stands with human women who want the same thing and then you\u2019re satiated, for a time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he suspected her first wolf\u2019s heat wasn\u2019t the only thing making her so unreasonable. Damned if he could figure it out.</p><p>\u201cOf course I want a mate. Nevertheless, you know as well as I do the males outnumber the females in any given pack. If I can\u2019t find one of our kind...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll have to find my pleasure elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Not that he had been with a woman in a very long time, or was often with one. Running a pack took priority and searching for an eligible lupus garou female was impractical since he didn\u2019t have a sub-leader who could watch over his people in his absence. He couldn\u2019t even trust Meara for now.</p> <p>\u201cI miss Genevieve and the others,\u201d she said softly, avoiding looking at him.</p><p>So that was the problem. \u201cThey\u2019ll come back, Meara. Trust me in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I miss our home.\u201d She poked at her food, then she looked up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re right about one thing, dear brother. I should fetch a pretty important alpha male, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Important? Try more headstrong than his sister, or her mate would never have any say in their relationship.</p><p>Hunter gave her a small smile. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo find me one.\u201d Her gaze sharpened along with her voice. \u201cOr else I\u2019m joining the others.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s twin sister was his to protect until he could find a suitable mate for her. Meara was not going anywhere without him. The pack would return. Damn it. And he wasn\u2019t about to chase after them.</p><p>Already past midnight by the time his sister fell asleep, Hunter threw open the front door and took a whiff of the breeze. Winter, pine, the smell of the sea. Fish. And sea kelp. Time to mark his territory, indicating he was taking the area over from his uncle, and check out Tessa Anderson\u2019s place. Not only that, but running through the woods\u2014seeing them alive and green after the flames had devoured the California forests, leaving ashes in their wake\u2014he hoped it would settle his troubled thoughts. At a wolf\u2019s pace, he would reach Tessa\u2019s home in a couple of hours, less if he ran. Although he needed to leave his scent along the way.</p><p>Painlessly, he allowed the change to come over him, stretching his limbs, feeling the power fill his legs and body. His face elongated into a snout, his curved canines extending until they were deadly weapons that could crush bone, if he\u2019d felt in the mood for a hunt. A double coat of banded gray fur covered his skin, keeping out the bitter cold as he loped outside in his wolf form and headed into the forest, his black nails digging into the pine needle covered floor.</p><p>At once, he enjoyed the oneness he felt with the wild out-of-doors, instead of being an intruder on the land the way he felt when he was in his human form. Now, he was a predator, more in tune with the feral side of his nature.</p><p>Yet, he felt a trifle unsettled as he headed south on their property.</p> <p>Maybe Meara was right. Moving was harder than he\u2019d expected. Part of him enjoyed the newness of being here at his uncle\u2019s place a couple times a year, but part of him longed for his familiar hunting grounds.</p><p>Time to put aside regrets and concentrate on business.</p><p>While he was traversing the area for a few miles, the chilly, crisp air ruffled his fur, and the sound of the ocean crashed down below the rocky cliffs. The sweet fragrance of fir trees looming overhead mingled with the fishy odor of the ocean and the seaweed rotting on the beach, nearly masking the scent of a rabbit nearby. But then another smell came to his attention\u2014not a welcome odor, either.</p><p>He twisted his head to the south. Male gray lupus garous\u2014three of them\u2014their smell wafting in the air. And not any of his pack either. These three shouldn\u2019t be here.</p><p>Listening for any sounds of them, he paused. Nothing. Yet the adrenaline surged through his veins, preparing him for the confrontation.</p><p>He had marked his territory well, brushing his tail and face against tree trunks and branches. Even his toes pressed against the earth left his unique scent, showing beyond a doubt he had claimed it, as his Uncle Basil had before him. What gray would be fool enough to trespass on another\u2019s lands without permission in the dark of night?</p><p>Meara! In her wolf\u2019s heat, she must have caught their attention.</p><p>Hunter sprinted back toward the cabin. The closer he drew to his quiet home, the more his chest tightened. The grays had been here and could still be here. The transformation swift and painless, he quickly changed from wolf to human form and stood naked on the front porch where the door was still wide open. His blood burned so hot, the cold didn\u2019t touch him. \u201cMeara!\u201d</p> <p>The door to her bedroom was open. The smell of the three males lingered heavy in the air. A deathly silence pervaded the place.</p><p>Hunter stormed into Meara\u2019s bedroom. She was gone. His heart racing, he roared, \u201cMeara!\u201d</p><p>Her bedcovers were tossed aside, but it didn\u2019t look as though there had been a struggle. Bile rose in Hunter\u2019s throat. Had the grays forced her to leave with them, or had she gone willingly? He couldn\u2019t be sure, the way the wolf heat\u2014particularly the first one she\u2019d had to experience\u2014was making her so crazy.</p><p>Either way, they were dead men. Nothing less than a gray alpha male of his choosing would do for his sister. And no one would steal her away in the middle of the night without facing the devil over it.</p><p>His face extending into a wolf\u2019s snout and his torso and limbs changing as fur covered his body, he became a wolf once again and raced out of the cabin. He smelled the intruders\u2019 scent on the turbulent sea breeze and followed them as they headed south.</p><p>Once he found them, he would deal with them wolf to wolf, teaching them to take care when stealing a leader\u2019s sister.</p><p>Hunter\u2019s breath mixed with the air, an ice storm threatening.</p><p>Mile after mile he tracked the three of them and his sister. They were either so arrogant they didn\u2019t worry about him, or just too stupid to care. They left a trail a brand-new Cub Scout could follow\u2014broken branches and clumps of fur rubbed against trees; two even urinated a few times as if taunting him\u2014or maybe they had weak bladders.</p><p>He growled low.</p><p>When the sun illuminated the gray clouds, brightening the day just a little in the early morning hour, he sensed the wolves had marked this new territory for their own. Trespassing or not, he wouldn\u2019t allow them to stop him from freeing Meara and taking care of the menace.</p><p>Out of the mist, a blackened pine tree, like a soldier bitterly scarred, stood at the edge of a cliff that gave way to the ocean below. Like the forests devoured in flames they had recently escaped, except this silent soldier had been here for a very long time, the remaining forest again green.</p><p>Branches rustled west of Hunter, and he whipped around. Three hefty grays stared him down, their tails straight, the hair on their backs standing up. Hunter took a whiff of the breeze. They weren\u2019t the ones who had taken his sister. And there was no sign of her now. But the way the leader of this group crouched low and curled his lips back, exposing his teeth, Hunter had no choice. He wasn\u2019t backing down. If they were protecting the others who had taken his sister, they\u2019d pay, too.</p><p>Fresh adrenaline charged through his system, preparing him for battle as he growled low, stiffened his tail like a flag of warning, and rushed the biggest of the three wolves, his muzzle wrinkling as he bared his killer canines.</p><p>The Oregon temperature was thirty-one degrees, but the knowledge Tessa Anderson\u2019s brother might not go free made it feel colder still. On top of that? An ice storm was imminent.</p><p>Her back rigid enough to cause it to spasm with the building tension, she sat on the wooden bench in the courtroom, her fingernails biting into her palms. She clenched her teeth, fighting tears as she waited for the foreman to make the announcement.</p><p>She prayed she and Michael could return to their cabin on the coast and weather the storm like their grandparents had. Only this time, she feared her prayers would go unanswered.</p><p>The look Michael cast Tessa pleaded for her to save him from this nightmare. He appeared pale and gaunt in his black suit, the same one he\u2019d worn to his last art exhibit in Portland. How had their lives turned so upside down?</p><p>She, who had always gotten her younger brother out of scrapes since their parents had died five years ago, felt like an avalanche was crushing her heart. She\u2019d spent all her savings and some of their inheritance trying to prove his innocence and only wished the rumors that gold was buried on their property was true\u2014and that she could find it\u2014to use to help save her brother.</p><p>She let out her breath. Michael was innocent. Damn it.</p><p>God, please, oh please, find him not guilty. Set him free.</p><p>\u201cMichael Anderson, on the count of first-degree murder of Bethany Wade, the jury finds you guilty.\u201d</p><p>Barely audible, the words melded and faded. The breath she\u2019d been holding whooshed from Tessa\u2019s lungs, and her head grew fuzzy. The bright lights in the courthouse blinked out.</p><p>The next thing she knew, her head was resting in a stranger\u2019s lap and a man and woman were shaking her. \u201cMiss Anderson? Miss Anderson?\u201d</p><p>Her mind cleared and she looked around at a sea of concerned faces. Her heart began racing again. Guilty. The jury had found her brother guilty.</p><p>The police were escorting her brother from the room in handcuffs.</p><p>She hurried to mouth the words, \u201cI love you, Michael. I\u2019ll get you out.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes filled with tears, he gave her a slight nod.</p><p>He knew she would try. No matter what, she\u2019d exhaust every avenue before she let her brother rot in prison for the rest of his life for a crime he didn\u2019t commit.</p><p>A new lawyer, new evidence, appeals. Where could she find a good lawyer to start all over again?</p><p>Her heart encased in ice, she realized the only way to prove him innocent was to find the real murderer. Unfortunately, in the Oregon coastal community, the sheriff believed in only one suspect, Michael. Now that the jury found him guilty, no way was the sheriff\u2019s department going to look any further into the matter.</p><p>Her family\u2019s home, the townspeople, the community\u2014 all the things she held dear since her parents perished\u2014now meant nothing. No one she knew had sat with her to offer solace during any part of the trial. She felt betrayed, isolated from those who had been her friends. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stumbled to her feet. Her legs were like melted wax, but she clutched her purse and headed for the courtroom doors, her head held high. A weariness crept through her, as the adrenaline rush from her anticipation of the verdict fizzled into oblivion.</p><p>People quickly moved out of her way as if avoiding a communicable disease. Some of them watched her, their eyes narrowed in contempt, acting like she was the reason for the crime in their once secure and sleepy little community.</p><p>A tall, thin man observed her from the other side of the room. His dark brown hair curling about his shoulders, the angular planes of his narrow face, the way his shoulders stooped forward, made him seem somehow familiar. He shoved his hands in his pockets and glanced at the exit. But when his gaze zeroed in on her again, this time she caught his eye. He quickly looked away as if he couldn\u2019t decide what to do\u2014approach and offer condolences or scowl at her, too.</p> <p>Another of Bethany\u2019s relatives? He might have been. She\u2019d been dark-haired, too, and tall and willowy. Plus tons of her cousins from back east were here for the trial.</p><p>Bethany\u2019s parents hesitated at the entryway as if wanting to say something to Tessa, but then, maybe thinking better of it, Mr. Wade quickly escorted his teary-eyed wife outside.</p><p>Tessa blinked back her own tears. But as soon as she left the courthouse, a lone newspaper reporter targeted her with a photographer in tow.</p><p>She groaned inwardly. Rourke Thornburg. Once an on-again/off-again boyfriend in high school who had tried to renew their relationship after she\u2019d finished college and returned to the coast, now just an annoying waste of time.</p><p>As usual, his dark gray suit was impeccable and his manicured hair had not a strand out of place\u2014making him appear like a big-time-news-reporter wannabe. From the high-school paper to this\u2014his first big story in the coastal town\u2014other than reporting the weather, new storm rolling onto the coast, or crab season\u2019s arrival.</p> <p>She hurried down the courthouse steps and headed for her Ford Escape, hoping to avoid the inevitable.</p><p>Like a used car salesman with the deal of a lifetime, Rourke dove in front of Tessa. \u201cAny statements, Miss Anderson, now that the jury found your brother guilty of first-degree murder?\u201d</p><p>Taking a stand, she drew taller and looked Rourke squarely in the eye. \u201cMy brother is innocent. He loved Bethany. The murderer thinks he got away with the crime, but I won\u2019t give up until he or she has been brought to justice.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have said anything to the press. She knew it, but she couldn\u2019t stop the words.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the sheriff\u2019s department is guilty of a cover-up?\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her vision, she saw Sheriff Wellington watching her, his blue eyes hard as ice. \u201cI think the sheriff only saw Michael\u2019s involvement with Bethany, overlooking the possibility someone else was the killer. I wouldn\u2019t say it was intentional.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you propose to find the real killer, supposing Michael is innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the first to know.\u201d She squelched the tears, unable to offer anything close to the truth.</p><p>Rourke knew her better. However, she also realized he wouldn\u2019t let go of the story. So what would he do? Report on her progress, sensationalizing her failures to bring the true murderer to justice to make a name for himself? She could see the report now: Sister Seeks Killer to Free Her Brother. When Will She Recognize the Truth?</p><p>Rourke motioned to the cameraman to quit taking pictures and walked Tessa to her car, his hand supporting her elbow.</p><p>She wanted to jerk away from him, to show she wouldn\u2019t allow his attempt at placating her, but too many people were watching. For now, she had to be the proverbial pillar of strength for her brother. Anything less would show defeat.</p><p>\u201cI know how upsetting this has to be, as much as you care for your brother, but the jurors were right.\u201d</p><p>Without responding to Rourke\u2019s remark, she unlocked her car door and climbed in. But then she reconsidered. Maybe, just maybe, she could solicit his help. Who else did she have? Nobody.</p><p>\u201cIf you really want to be a reporter, you might investigate this case yourself. Look at the guys who dug into the Watergate mess and how much dirt they uncovered. No one else did. Ever think you could put your talents to good use?\u201d</p> <p>A spark of interest flickered in his gray eyes, but he was far from being convinced. Like everyone else, Rourke believed Michael was guilty of the crime. End of story.</p><p>He leaned against her door and sighed. \u201cAll right. Here\u2019s the deal. You and I can get together over dinner, and you can tell me what makes you believe Michael didn\u2019t do it, other than the fact he\u2019s your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you look into it, and when you discover some other leads, you give me a call. Then we\u2019ll do dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShrewd.\u201d Rourke offered a coy smile. \u201cNot one person could verify Bethany was seeing some other guy. Michael made up the whole story. No evidence points to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you don\u2019t bother looking for it. Gotta go, Rourke. Later.\u201d</p><p>Nearby, Sheriff Wellington gave her a warning look as if to say she had better not stir up any more trouble. Nevertheless, to prove her brother\u2019s innocence, she\u2019d do whatever it took.</p><p>Mist covered the winding coastal road on the long drive home, and although Tessa usually felt comforted by it, late this afternoon it seemed gloomy, warning of impending disaster. The last time she felt an overwhelming sense of doom, she had learned her parents had died in a car accident earlier on a day just like this one, her last year at high school. She shuddered, despite telling herself the disquieting feeling didn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>When she finally pulled into the curved driveway at her redwood home overlooking the rugged coastline, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something wasn\u2019t right. A winter-chilled breeze played music on her wind chimes as the contorted pines stretching next to her house stirred. She glanced at the gray clouds. As cold as it was, if it rained, it would turn to sleet or snow or a mixture of the two soon.</p><p>She climbed out of her car, shivered, and locked the doors. The place looked foreboding now that her brother was gone. Not the welcome refuge it had always been.</p><p>She hurried into the house, the air as chilly inside as it was out, and rushed to change in the bedroom.</p><p>After laying her wool coat on the cedar chest at the foot of the bed, she turned on the floor heater, and pulled off her black dress. Black as if she were in mourning. Which she was all over again. The house seemed so empty without her brother\u2019s presence, his laughter, the sound of his video games playing in the background as he fought another epic fantasy battle before he settled down to paint.</p><p>Now, except for the howling wind and the waves crashing on the beach down below the cliffs, everything was quiet. Too quiet in the isolated cottage. For the first time ever, she felt\u2014spooked.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any other way to explain the reason goose bumps rose and the hair stood on end on her arms.</p><p>She kicked off her pumps, slipped out of her panty hose, threw on a pair of heavy socks, black denims, and a turtleneck. If she didn\u2019t quit imagining all kinds of horrible scenarios, she would lock herself in the house until the storm passed. She wasn\u2019t normally a cowardly person, but she had never felt so alone before, like she\u2019d fallen into a parallel world where she had no family or friends. And now even her good friend Uncle Basil was gone. But she couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d leave so suddenly without a word. First chance she got, she was checking further into the matter.</p><p>An animal howled in the distance. A shudder stole down her back. A wolf. Had to be.</p><p>She peeked out the window, but didn\u2019t see anything except tree branches swaying briskly in the growing wind.</p><p>She wanted to believe it was just a dog. But she knew better. Wolves from Idaho\u2019s reserve had crossed the Snake River and were roaming the northeastern part of the state. Visitors to the Wallowa Mountains and the Eagle Cap Wilderness area had also reported sightings of wolves. She\u2019d even snapped a picture of one near La Grande and more recently, a hunter killed a wild wolf there. So why couldn\u2019t a wolf have made it to the Oregon coast?</p><p>Despite there not having been any sightings, she was certain a wolf had been roaming the area. Worse, she couldn\u2019t explain how she felt compelled to discover the truth, but on the other hand was afraid of learning any were living here. Neither her underlying fear of them or compulsion to seek them out made any sense to her. Except as she stalked them, she was sure they stalked her. Which was plain crazy. Or was it? She\u2019d had more than one experience like when she\u2019d been taking pictures of the California wildfire. A phantom gray watching her, waiting, an unnatural standoff between man and beast. And then the sudden unprovoked attacks.</p><p>She yanked on her snow boots. After slipping her favorite pink ski cap on her head, covering her hair, still pinned up in a bun, she threw on her parka and grabbed her gloves.</p><p>She had nothing to fear. Nothing\u2014except the fact someone had murdered Bethany Wade, her brother was going to prison for it, and the real murderer was on the loose.</p><p>But worse than that?</p><p>She had challenged him\u2014which would now be in the local newspaper, no less\u2014that she would uncover who he was and clear her brother\u2019s name.</p><p>She glanced at the bedside table where she kept her gun and took a deep breath. \u201cFirewood, or else you\u2019ll go without.\u201d</p><p>If an ice storm knocked out the electricity, she would be in a world of hurt. A quick walk on the beach to gather driftwood for a fire would have to suffice. She shouldn\u2019t have put it off so long, but all she had thought of lately was how to get her brother cleared of the charges. She needed a new lawyer. Someone who was a lot more determined. And a new private eye, someone who would find something that would help Michael, instead of just running up a bill.</p><p>After locking the back door\u2014although normally she wouldn\u2019t have bothered, but she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that someone was watching the place\u2014she traversed the narrow and steep path through the woods and boulders down to the small sandy beach below.</p><p>From one of the mills up north, lumber floating on the current piled up on the beach, littering it. No sense letting the wood go to waste. She shoved some over on its side and considered how wet it was. Very wet. All of it would take too long to dry. But if she didn\u2019t hurry and the rain began, it wouldn\u2019t matter what she gathered\u2014the wood would all be too wet to burn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She trudged through piles of seaweed\u2014hating the smell and unsightly mess it made as the storms churned it up on the beach\u2014and made her way around a cluster of boulders where she spied a stack of wood. Far enough from the tidewater, it would have had more time to dry.</p><p>Skirting around to the other side, she figured the timber would be the driest there. But what she saw next made her gasp and her heart nearly quit beating.</p><p>The body of a veritable Greek god lay naked on his stomach, his skin, slightly blue, stretched over tightly toned muscles, his dark, wet hair draped across his face, his eyes sealed shut.</p> <p>Not dead. Please, don\u2019t be dead.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>BEFORE TESS A REACHED THE MAN LYING DEATHLY STILL on the beach, certain he was dead, she thought one of his fingers twitched. Her heart went into overdrive.</p><p>Not dead. Ohmigod. He\u2019s alive. Maybe.</p><p>She rushed forward and pulled him onto his back. Big. Naked. Blue\u2014she reminded herself. And badly battered\u2014his face, body, limbs.</p> <p>She yanked off her glove and held his wrist. No pulse that she could feel, although her blood was running so fast, she figured it overrode feeling his pulse, if he had one. Not breathing, she didn\u2019t think, because her warm breath was turning into puffs of smoke in the chilly air and there was none escaping his parted lips, full and sensual, but purple.</p><p>\u201cHello? Hello? Can you hear me?\u201d She jerked her glove on, and then fumbled to remove her parka. Covering his torso with her heavy white coat, she tried to remember her CPR training. \u201cFifteen pumps to the chest. Breathe two times into his mouth. Then repeat. No, clear his passageway first.\u201d</p><p>With hands trembling, she crouched next to his head. His wet hair dragged the sandy beach, his eyelids sealed shut. She tilted his head back and made sure nothing obstructed his airway. Moving back to his torso, she pushed the coat lower to expose his chest\u2014muscled, sculpted, dark curly hair trailing down to her parka, speckled with sand, the best shape she\u2019d ever seen a man in close up\u2014which meant he was too hardy to die on her. She prayed.</p><p>She pressed her gloved hands together against his hard chest and began compressions. Counting under her breath, she hoped to God he didn\u2019t die on her. If the wind and cold weren\u2019t bad enough, sleet began sliding down in gray sheets, crackling and covering everything in a slick icy sheen, plastering her turtleneck and jeans against her frigid skin. She worked harder, faster.</p><p>The blood pounded in her ears, blocking the sound of the wind and sleet and waves.</p><p>\u201cFifteen!\u201d she shouted, and then moved closer to his head, yanked off her glove, and felt for any sign of a pulse in his neck.</p> <p>No pulse, or so faint she couldn\u2019t feel it. And no breath. He wasn\u2019t breathing.</p><p>Her heart in her throat, she pinched his nose shut and leaned down to cover his mouth with hers. Before she could blow air into his lungs, his eyes popped open. Amber, intense, feral. Her mouth gaped.</p><p>With a titan grasp, he grabbed her wrists, flipped her onto her back and straddled her, the parka wedged between them as the weight of his body restrained her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screeched, right before he kissed her\u2014 pressed his frozen lips against hers, his mouth firm, wanting, pressuring with uncontrollable need\u2014like a man used to dominating\u2014sending her senses reeling.</p><p>Instantly, the cold left her, his body heating every inch of her to the core, her heart pounding. And in that moment, she wanted him\u2014as insane as the notion was.</p><p>He lifted his mouth from hers and glowered at her for a second, his eyes smoky with desire. Speechless, she stared back at his chiseled face, the grim set of his lips, his dark silky hair curling down, dripping water on her cheeks. Then his fathomless, darkened eyes drifted closed and his tight grip loosened on her wrists.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted, right before he collapsed on top of her in a faint, his dead weight pinning her to the beach.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she yelled, her hands on his shoulders, shaking him. \u201cWake up!\u201d She couldn\u2019t budge the muscled hunk, but if she didn\u2019t revive him and get him to some place warm, he would die for sure. \u201cHey! Wake... up!\u201d She pushed and shoved, trying to roll him off her. But he was too heavy\u2014solid muscle and bone.</p> <p>\u201cGet... off... me!\u201d</p><p>He moaned and lifted his head, his glazed eyes staring at her, his beautiful white teeth clenched in a grimace, but he didn\u2019t seem to comprehend.</p><p>\u201cCan you move? I\u2019ll... I\u2019ll take you up to my house and call for help.\u201d</p><p>For the longest time\u2014although it probably was no more than a second or two, but with the way his heavy body pressed against hers, it seemed like an eternity\u2014he watched her.</p><p>Then he groaned and rolled off her onto his back. She hurried to recover him with the parka, yanked off her knit cap, and stretched it over his head. More heat was lost through the head than any other body part, she recalled hearing from a survival show. Odd the things that would come to mind in the middle of a crisis.</p><p>He observed her as the sleet continued to pelt them\u2014an expression without feeling, icy cold like the storm, a face devoid of fear, unlike the way hers probably looked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, listen... we\u2019re both going to catch our deaths here on the beach in this weather. We need to get you up to the house. Can you move?\u201d She pulled on her glove.</p><p>His gaze drifted to her soaking wet turtleneck. But otherwise he didn\u2019t move or speak. Tugging at him, she finally managed to help him sit. She slipped behind him, wrapped her arms around his chest with her body hugging his, braced with her knees, and tried to pull him up. She couldn\u2019t budge him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to help.\u201d Her voice exasperated\u2014not with him, but with herself\u2014her frosty breath curled around his ear.</p><p>He finally leaned forward, pressed his hands against the sand, pushed himself up, and moaned. The sound of his pain streaked through her like a warning. He was in bad shape and could still die if she didn\u2019t move fast enough, didn\u2019t do the right things.</p><p>As soon as he stood, he grabbed hold of her shoulder and swayed.</p><p>Her heart lurching, she seized his free arm. He leaned hard against her, ready to collapse, and a new thrill of panic swept her. If he pulled her down with him, she\u2019d be where she was before, trying to lift the veritable muscled mountain off the beach.</p><p>She hung her parka over his broad shoulders and wrapped her arm around his trim waist. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s not too far to climb.\u201d</p><p>Although it was, considering the injured man\u2019s shaky condition.</p><p>They stumbled up the rough path, and she glanced down at his poor feet, taking a beating on the icy rocks. Every step could be his last, she worried, while he clung to her as if his life depended on it.</p><p>Which it probably did.</p><p>When they reached the short path to her back door, she intended to rush him inside, call for help, get him warm\u2014not necessarily in that order\u2014but instead, she froze in place several feet away from the edge of the small brick patio.</p><p>The back door was standing wide open, the wind banging it against the house.</p><p>\u201cI locked it,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cI know I locked it.\u201d</p><p>Despite the overwhelming panic that filled her, she had to get the injured man into the protective shelter of the house. With trepidation, she walked him the rest of the way, and once inside, she led him through the kitchen. No sign of an intruder. But her spine remained stiff with tension.</p><p>The injured man lifted his nose and smelled. He tilted his head to the side as if he was listening for the same thing she was\u2014sounds of the housebreaker.</p><p>She hurried the man to the velour sofa where he collapsed in a ragged heap, his expression slightly dazed. She had to get him warmed up. But she had to make sure no danger could threaten them inside the house. Glancing toward the hall and the three bedrooms, she listened. No sound of anyone rummaging through any of the rooms.</p><p>Sleet continued to pour on the roof, the sound a loud roar, which could hide the presence of someone moving around inside. She grabbed the wool afghan at the end of the couch and covered the injured man\u2019s lap, the parka still draped across his shoulders and pink ski cap stretched tight on his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll turn on the heat and get some more blankets for you,\u201d she said to him, without taking her eyes off the hallway to the bedrooms.</p><p>First, she was calling 911 and getting a knife for protection. She patted his shoulder. \u201cStay here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for his response. Instead, she hastened to the kitchen, yanked open a drawer, and pulled out her largest carving knife, although it was about as dull as her butter knives. Too bad she couldn\u2019t get to her gun. With weapon in hand, she grabbed her phone, punched in 9\u20131\u20131, and lifted the receiver to her ear. No signal. She tried again. Same thing. Hell, what else could go wrong?</p><p>Shivering in her wet, icy clothes, she shut and locked the back door. When she turned, she gulped back a scream. The battered man was standing in her kitchen, looking even bigger, taller, nude again, and still blue. He moved as silently as the cat she had once shared the house with until it took off for parts unknown.</p><p>\u201cMy god, you need to rest on the couch and... and I\u2019ll turn the heat on and...\u201d</p><p>His indomitable gaze lowered to the knife in her hand.</p><p>Mouth dry, her heartbeat quickened. \u201cI... someone broke into my house. I think.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he stalked off, his step more sure, although he had to be in terrible pain, as bruised and beaten as he was. She followed him, her gaze shifting to his butt, firm, muscled perfection with every step he took. He glanced over his shoulder with a glower, but when he caught her checking out his derri\u00e8re, his mouth curved up a hint.</p><p>Her cheeks on fire, she raised her brows and stood taller.</p><p>Realizing he couldn\u2019t dissuade her from following him, he grunted and moved forward, checking out her brother\u2019s room first. The navy velvet curtains flopped in the breeze, framing the shattered window. She sucked in the chilled air and stared at the jagged window, now a gaping hole into the black void outside. A shudder shook her to the center of her being. He could return anytime. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She examined the carpet closer. No glass, which meant the intruder had broken it from the inside, not outside to get in. This further meant he must have entered through the back door and hadn\u2019t escaped that way like she was beginning to think.</p><p>The injured man crossed the floor to the window, peered into the dark, standing in the icy breeze as if he was made of pure marble and the cold couldn\u2019t touch him. Then he turned, shaking his head slightly.</p><p>Her gaze dropped from his furrowed brows, narrowed eyes, and the set of his grim mouth to his ruggedly sculpted abs, and then lower to the dark patch of curly hair at the apex of his sturdy thighs and his incredible... size.</p> <p>Her eyes shot up. He was injured, for heaven\u2019s sakes, and probably suffering from frostbite and a concussion. Yet, she swore lust clouded his eyes.</p><p>Ha! More likely the onset of pneumonia.</p><p>\u201cLet me, uhm, get you some of my brother\u2019s clothes.\u201d</p><p>She hurried into the closet, grabbed Michael\u2019s fleece-lined navy sweats and a pair of his sneakers, and exited. The man was gone. She glanced at the wind and sleet coming into the room, wetting the beige carpeting. Wishing she could tack something up in the meantime, she knew they didn\u2019t have a shred of canvas. Although even if she did, it wouldn\u2019t prevent the intruder from coming back in that way.</p><p>Clutching her brother\u2019s things to her chest with one arm, the knife readied in her free fist, she rushed into the hall and nearly collided with the naked man. A gasp slipped from her lips before she could hide her unsettled reaction.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt yourself with that.\u201d His words sounded husky and wearied. His colorless lips lifted slightly. \u201cOr me.\u201d</p><p>The way he said, \u201cOr me,\u201d sounded suspiciously like he didn\u2019t believe she could hurt him. As wired as she was, her hands trembled with the notion she might have accidentally stabbed him.</p><p>His icy hand touched hers, almost reverently. Was he worried she was scared to be unarmed? She was more fearful that she might have caused him further injury.</p><p>Despite how cold they both were, his flesh sent a volley of warmth sliding through her, his eyes never straying from hers. Heat, passion, and a knowing look as though he could read the way she was feeling showed in the glint of his amber eyes. And then he slipped the knife from her grasp, his fingers leaving hers and the cold returned.</p><p>He had to be chilled to the marrow of his bones. She was and she wasn\u2019t even nude in the icebox of a house, although wearing wet clothes had to come in a close second for making a body cold under these inhospitable conditions.</p><p>\u201cNo one in any of the rooms,\u201d he assured her, his voice cloaked in darkness, his gaze steady, penetrating.</p> <p>Something unspoken tied them together, although she couldn\u2019t sense what. The way he considered her as if she was important to him somehow\u2014not as his savior exactly, but more like his... captive, his prey.</p><p>Before her frozen mind made anything stranger of her reaction toward him, she shoved the sweats at his chest. \u201cHere, get dressed and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn on the heat?\u201d He cocked an arrogant brow, his lips neutral.</p><p>One of her medieval romance novels could have featured him as a brooding, striking\u2014albeit a bit battered\u2014hero. Or the villain. What did she know about him, after all?</p><p>\u201cI would have already,\u201d she said, storming back down the hall, \u201cif an intruder hadn\u2019t been in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe electricity isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, turned, and stared at him. It would be dark soon. And even colder. Hell, she hadn\u2019t even gotten one load of firewood from the beach yet.</p><p>Now, she was stuck in the middle of the ice storm with no electricity and no phone... with a total hunk of a stranger still standing in her hallway naked.</p> <p>The man slipped her brother\u2019s sweatpants on, but the corded muscles of his chest were exposed, his skin tan, no longer blue, but bruised and cut. He yanked the sweatshirt over his head. \u201cI checked the heater while you were getting the knife. Light switches, too. There\u2019s no electricity.\u201d He pulled on the pair of sneakers.</p><p>\u201cThen I need to gather wood for the fire.\u201d Tessa shuddered involuntarily, both from the cold and her wet clothes. But also from the fact she would have to trek back down the hill alone when the prowler might still be out there hidden in the woods, watching, waiting.</p><p>The injured man swept his hair back away from his chiseled face, the planes edged in marble. \u201cYou need to slip into something dry. I\u2019ll get the firewood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you... you were half dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heal quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her voice conveyed she wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>No one could heal that quickly\u2014probably trying to sound macho to appease her. She took a deep settling breath and watched him deposit the knife on the tiled kitchen counter with a clunk. His hands were big and rough. Not an artist\u2019s hands like her brother\u2019s, but strong enough to pin her to the beach, not allowing her an inch to struggle. An annoying sliver of eroticism stoked a fire deep inside her, just thinking about the way his body had pressed against hers. He\u2019d been delirious, for heaven\u2019s sakes, and didn\u2019t even realize what he had done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you, just in case you begin to feel badly. You probably suffered from a concussion and should go to the hospital. But the road will be too icy and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled the back door open.</p><p>\u201cWait! Let me get my parka, and I\u2019ll get Michael\u2019s field jacket for you.\u201d</p><p>She rushed into the living room, grabbed her coat from the couch, and pulled it over her wet clothes. The turtleneck and jeans clung to her skin like pieces of cloth soaked in ice water, and again she shivered. She would have changed clothes if he had given her a couple of minutes. But if they didn\u2019t get wood in a hurry, it would be soaking wet. Forget a warm fire then.</p><p>After retrieving her brother\u2019s jacket from the hall closet, she joined the stranger in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tessa Anderson, by the way, and you are?\u201d</p><p>His forehead wrinkled slightly and his jaw tightened. \u201cHunter\u2019s the name, although... I can\u2019t seem to remember anything else. My tumble in the ocean probably had something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember a last name?\u201d Her skin prickled with fresh unease. A naked stranger without a last name washed up on her beach and no way to get outside help in the event he was unsafe\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll come to me after a while.\u201d He threw on the jacket and headed outside.</p><p>\u201cWait! Gloves!\u201d</p><p>But he was already halfway down the trail. She grabbed a pair of her brother\u2019s fur-lined leather gloves from the hall closet and rushed after Hunter. As much as she didn\u2019t want to admit it, she was more afraid of staying alone in the unsecured house, than with chasing after a stranger. Even so, she sensed the driving power inside him, the danger inherent, something about him that made her think of\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cWait! Here are Michael\u2019s gloves!\u201d</p><p>Moving too fast on the icy ground, she slipped. Her heart tumbled and she threw her hands out to brace her fall on the rocky path. If Hunter hadn\u2019t leapt forward and caught her wrist, pulling her into his hard embrace, she would have landed on her face.</p><p>Heat suffused every pore, and the stranger showed more than a spark of interest. His gaze smoldered with passion as he looked into her eyes, lower... to her lips.</p><p>Her chest pressed against his, his heart beat as fast as hers, maybe faster, and for an instant, he didn\u2019t seem to want to let go, his arms holding her tight, lots closer and longer than necessary. More than that\u2014he acted like he wanted to kiss her again. Although she knew the first time had to have been a mistake\u2014a deliriously, delicious mistake. And for an instant, she envisioned the kiss. Possessive, demanding, and oh so hot. And she, too shocked to respond, but wondering if she had, how would he have reacted?</p><p>His gaze drew back to hers. His whiskey-colored eyes\u2014like the wolf\u2019s.</p><p>A strange awareness crept through her\u2014like she was looking into the eyes of a predator. But then he averted his attention and released her. \u201cThe path\u2019s icy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d As if she wasn\u2019t aware of the obvious. But that wasn\u2019t half as dangerous as what had just occurred between them.</p><p>So what had occurred between them?</p><p>Trying to keep up, she hurried down the path after him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know him. He didn\u2019t know her. Hell, he didn\u2019t even know himself. Yet there was something about him that was driving her crazy. Almost like animal magnetism. Which really was nuts. She didn\u2019t believe in primitive sexual attraction, although her brother had always teased her that she would know when she finally met the right man\u2014a sexual draw so compelling would exist between them, she wouldn\u2019t be able to resist.</p><p>That would be the day.</p><p>\u201cYou should have stayed behind.\u201d The stranger\u2019s gruff voice snapped her right out of her sexual fantasies.</p><p>He slipped Michael\u2019s gloves on and continued down the path to the woodpile where she had first found him.</p><p>A thank you would have sufficed, she grumbled silently to herself.</p><p>Even though he appeared to be all right now, his jaw tightened when he leaned down and lifted an armload of wood, and again when he straightened his back. As injured as he was, she wished he hadn\u2019t had to help. Gathering up as much timber as she would have in three trips, he returned to the path leading up to the house.</p><p>A little ways up the hill, he stopped, cast a glance over his shoulder, his dark brows pinched together, his eyes watchful while he waited for her.</p><p>She stumbled up the path with an armload of timber, miniscule compared to the load he was carrying.</p><p>He grumbled, \u201cI told you that you should have stayed in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, we need all the firewood we can get if we\u2019re going to be stuck here without electricity. Besides, I do this all the time without anyone\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>Although that had been the case only since her brother had been incarcerated. Otherwise, he had always been the one to get the firewood and do the other more manly chores around the place. At the thought she might not see him here again for a good long while, her eyes filled with tears and she sniffled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she wasn\u2019t going to sit in the house, worrying whether the stranger might reinjure himself on another trip to the beach or back alone. So he was stuck with her, whether he liked it or not. Besides, staying there and worrying about the intruder\u2019s return wasn\u2019t an option either.</p><p>He shook his head, yet the corners of his mouth turned slightly upward.</p><p>He walked the rest of the way to the house, moving slower this time, as if making sure she didn\u2019t slip again or fall too far behind. At least that\u2019s what she assumed. Unless he just hurt so much, walking was difficult.</p> <p>They headed inside and he set his firewood on the rack. Taking the wood from her arms, he stacked it with the rest. Then like a good Boy Scout, despite looking too roguish to be one, he set up a perfect fire. Slowly, the flames began to crackle and throw off a curl of heat.</p><p>Crouching in front of the fireplace, he frowned up at her, his darkening gaze drifting again to her turtleneck. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get into something dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She couldn\u2019t admit she was afraid to be by herself.</p><p>\u201cYour clothes are soaking wet. You\u2019re shivering. The house is freezing. You\u2019re not fine. Lock the bedroom door, if you\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her teeth. She wasn\u2019t afraid of the veritable god. Well, maybe a little. She yanked off her wet gloves and parka, tossed them on the coffee table so they\u2019d dry by the fire, and then returned to the bedroom and locked the door\u2014as a precaution. She tried the phone; still no dial tone. She glanced at her bedside table. The gun.</p> <p>She jerked the drawer open. Her heart skipped a beat. No gun.</p><p>Blind rage filled her. Feeling violated, she collapsed on the edge of the bed. If someone used the gun to commit a crime, the police would trace it straight to her. Not to mention she couldn\u2019t count on it for protection now.</p><p>How had the man known where to find it? What else had he taken? Nothing looked like it was out of place.</p><p>Focus\u2014get warm and dry before pneumonia sets in. Shaking violently from the cold, she stood, peeled off her wet clothes, and dumped them on the floor.</p><p>She shoved on a pair of emerald fleece sweats, matching heavy-duty socks, and her fur-lined boots. Feeling a little warmer, she hurried down the hall and dumped her wet clothes in the dryer, her thoughts centered on the naked man.</p><p>Did he really have amnesia? Or was it just a ploy to keep his identity a secret? He seemed so dangerous, maybe because he was so powerfully built. Her brother and the men she had dated were scrawny compared to this guy.</p> <p>She twisted the dryer dial to turn it on high. No response. Damn, no electricity.</p><p>Grumbling, she yanked her wet things out of the dryer and hung them in the shower to drip dry. But then a dark thought crossed her mind. What if the ice storm hadn\u2019t knocked out the electricity? What if the intruder had done something to it?</p><p>She hurried to the coat closet to check the circuit breaker, glanced in the direction of the living room and noticed the fire had caught hold, its golden flames throwing off some heat. But Hunter was gone. Her heart fluttered with fresh apprehension.</p><p>She rushed to the back door and saw him trudging up the hill with another armload of firewood as big as the first. Curbing her annoyance that he would sneak out and chance injuring himself further without her being there to rescue him, she glowered.</p><p>Even her brother couldn\u2019t carry that much, certainly not if he had had been injured like this man. He reminded her of a Highland warrior, his brow creased with determination, his face dark and brooding, his body hard and ready to win any battle no matter how much his enemy had beaten him beforehand. A kilt was all he needed to complete the look. A kilt, and nothing else.</p><p>He caught her eye and offered her a hint of a smile. Hell, she\u2019d been ogling the poor man\u2014again.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything in the house to eat?\u201d</p><p>Walking past her while she locked the door, he smelled like the sea, pines, wind, rainwater, and a rugged outdoorsman. If they could bottle his scent, the cologne would drive women crazy. With a clunk, he deposited the wood neatly with the rest, shaking her loose from her insane thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cUhm, let me check one thing.\u201d She returned to the coat closet and pulled the door open. She yanked on the light switch pull and then shook her head when the bulb didn\u2019t come on. When would she get it through her brain there was no electricity?</p><p>Before she could get the flashlight, he placed another log on the fire and said, \u201cI already checked the circuit breaker.\u201d</p><p>He was way ahead of her. \u201cYou think the ice storm has brought down the lines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince your unwelcome houseguest didn\u2019t mess with the circuit breaker, that\u2019s what I assume.\u201d</p><p>She took a settling breath. If the intruder had shut off her electricity, it probably would mean he\u2019d return. Hopefully, this meant he\u2019d only come for the gun. Unless he realized she was alone and would return later to steal more. The newspaper had covered the press on her brother\u2019s story for weeks. Everyone knew she was by herself now. Instantly re-chilled, she rubbed her arms and returned to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI have a rack that we can put over the fire and grill some steaks,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cRare.\u201d He walked into the kitchen, sure of himself, no hint that he\u2019d been mostly dead a half hour ago.</p><p>Her brother\u2019s sweats would never look the same. Whereas they hung off her brother\u2019s slim frame, they hugged this guy\u2019s muscled body.</p><p>She tried to get her mind off the man\u2019s physique and concentrate on dinner. She had never attempted cooking anything in her fireplace. Would it work? Or be a total disaster?</p><p>\u201cGarlic? Lemon and pepper seasoning?\u201d Wishing it was at least defrosted, she pulled the meat out of the freezer.</p><p>\u201cHowever you prepare it is fine with me. As long as it\u2019s rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think happened to you?\u201d She handed him the rack for the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cNot sure. My skin feels tight, like I soaked for hours in a tub of salt water, so I imagine I took a swim in the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want a shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have enough hot water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>She seasoned the steaks and carried them into the living room. \u201cI\u2019ve got candles and flashlights in one of the kitchen drawers, if you want to get them for later.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be dark for another hour or so, but if the electricity didn\u2019t come back on, she wanted to be prepared before nightfall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch the steaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Medium. That\u2019s the way I like mine.\u201d</p><p>She returned to the kitchen and rummaged through the drawers, looking for the emergency candles.</p><p>\u201cIs anything missing from your house?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She headed back into the living room with an armful of lighting paraphernalia.</p><p>A shadow of dark stubble covered his square jaw, and his eyes looked haunted. No wonder, after all he had been through. His coffee-colored hair hung to his shoulders and dripped water. She needed to get him a towel.</p><p>\u201cHe stole my gun.\u201d She set two flashlights, two camp lanterns, and four candles on the coffee table.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou know how to shoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I have a concealed weapon license. Someone broke into our house a couple of times before because we\u2019re so isolated.\u201d</p><p>He flipped the steaks. \u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d</p><p>Tears cascaded down her cheeks before she could stop them. \u201cHe went to prison for a murder he didn\u2019t commit.\u201d She grabbed a tissue from a box on the coffee table. Almost empty. Again.</p><p>Hunter studied her for a moment before saying anything. A hint of compassion showed in his eyes. For her? Or her brother? Or was she hallucinating?</p><p>\u201cHave any proof?\u201d He flipped a steak onto a plate. Barely cooked.</p><p>\u201cNo. He didn\u2019t do it. And I\u2019ll find the killer if I have to. Michael\u2019s girlfriend was seeing someone behind his back. What if he was the one who killed her? Usually the murderer knows the victim.\u201d</p><p>Hunter looked like he didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>She cast him an annoyed look. After she saved his naked butt, the least he could do was pretend he believed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some rolls and canned asparagus we can eat cold.\u201d</p><p>She stalked down the hall to the guest bathroom, grabbed a fresh bath towel from the linen closet, and returned to the living room. \u201cHere, to dry your hair.\u201d</p><p>He had a plate in one hand and was turning her steak with the other. She hesitated. If he\u2019d been a friend, she would have offered to dry his hair. But he wasn\u2019t. Still, the house was cold, except for the part of their bodies directly exposed to the fire, and...</p><p>He tilted his head back and looked up at her, his mouth curving slightly upward. \u201cMaybe you can towel-dry it. Icy drops of water keep rolling down my neck.\u201d</p><p>Rife with indecision, she stood next to him. The fire flickered light off his eyes, like a wolfish predator, tempting her to draw closer into his web of seduction. What was there about him that turned her insides into mush? No man had ever made her feel that way with just a look.</p><p>The thought of drying his hair seemed so... intimate.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she moved closer, leaning over him, sliding the fluffy towel over larger clumps of his dark hair, trying to dry it quickly. To not get caught up in the feel of him, the way his body\u2019s heat reached out to her, the way he smelled so masculine, so intriguing. But then she separated his hair into smaller sections and wrung the shiny strands as dry as she could to prevent his getting chilled. He leaned his back against her legs, relaxing his posture, and she couldn\u2019t help wanting to melt against him, too.</p><p>He looked up at her, his expression half gratitude, the other half pure tantalization, his eyes clouded with desire. She cleared her throat, switched her attention to his damp hair again, and massaged his scalp.</p><p>\u201cHmm, your hair is a little wet, too,\u201d he said under his breath, his rigid body relaxing as he set the plate down and reached up and touched a wet curl dangling over her shoulder.</p><p>She swore the heat from his touch could dry her hair in a flash. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Tessa. That feels much better. Got another towel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d She touched her sagging bun, damp trails of curls trickling down her turtleneck. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me a dry towel.\u201d</p> <p>How could he sound so sexy when he commanded her to do his bidding? If it had been anyone else, she would have stood her ground. Her hair wasn\u2019t that wet; she was fine. But she headed for the bathroom and hung up the wet towel in the shower and grabbed a dry one.</p><p>On the way back to the living room, she dropped the towel on the leather footstool. \u201cI\u2019ll get the rolls, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can warm them.\u201d He poked at her steak again.</p><p>\u201cSo... how do you think you ended up taking a swim in the Pacific in the middle of winter?\u201d she asked from the kitchen.</p><p>With the package of rolls in hand, she returned to the fire and handed them to him.</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout any clothes?\u201d Her cheeks heated, just thinking about how he\u2019d looked in the raw\u2014male perfection, buff muscles, dark curling hair trailing down his chest, tantalizingly seductive, his stomach flat and his butt\u2014which she would die to have\u2014toned and provocative.</p><p>His mouth curved up slightly.</p><p>Even though he said he didn\u2019t remember anything, she had the distinct impression he knew more than he was letting on. But then again, what did she know about amnesia cases? Nothing, except about some isolated cases she\u2019d read in the news.</p><p>\u201cWho was seeing your brother\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d He turned the rolls.</p><p>\u201cMichael didn\u2019t know. And the police couldn\u2019t locate him.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter gave her a skeptical look and served up her steak and the rolls.</p><p>\u201cMy brother couldn\u2019t catch her with him, but he knew she was seeing someone else.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll get the asparagus.\u201d</p><p>After she returned and served up the asparagus, but before he began to eat his meal, he scooted behind her while she sat cross-legged in front of the fireplace, as if they had known each other forever. His legs stretched out beyond hers way too intimately, caging her in, and yet to be able to keep her arms from being pinned, she rested her elbows on his knees. She had never known anyone she could get this close to so quickly and feel just right.</p><p>He removed the pins from her hair, gently, careful not to pull it.</p><p>\u201cYour dinner will get cold,\u201d she admonished, feeling out of her element. No man had ever let her hair down and the experience was just as beguiling as the rest of his moves. \u201cAnd if nothing else, you need a good hot meal after the ordeal you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty hot.\u201d His deep baritone voice penetrated her defenses, offering protection and silky seduction. Warmed by the fire, his chest pressed against her back. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>Sizzling, as in having one of those hot flashes her mother always talked about. But it had nothing to do with the fire, and all to do with the Greek god warming her backside.</p><p>He stroked Tessa\u2019s hair with tender caresses, and she suddenly wasn\u2019t hungry. Instead, she wanted to turn around and kiss him. She was pretty sure his kisses could melt the polar ice caps the way he looked at her and touched her, heating her from the top of her damp head to her boot-covered toes. The way his first kiss had done.</p> <p>Despite the circumstances that brought them together, she felt a sense of relief that he was here. Well, more than a sense of relief. Here, she could have been sitting in the chilly house alone, without any electricity, still trying to get a fire going, worried that whoever broke into the house was lurking outside. She would never have imagined cooking a meal over the fire either, even though Michael had done so outside a number of times while she\u2019d watched. If she\u2019d been on her own, she probably would have fixed a tuna fish sandwich and sat in the cold, eating it while a flashlight illuminated the place, poking into the dark with a faint light, the rest in shadows. Worrying that the intruder would return.</p><p>Hunter stroked her hair some more with the towel, then leaned over and kissed the back of her head, his groin pressed hard against her backside. He was totally aroused and she was getting herself into hot water. What if the guy was married? He didn\u2019t remember anything about his past. He wasn\u2019t wearing a ring, but maybe in his occupation, he couldn\u2019t. Or maybe he was the kind of man who refused to wear a ring, because it stifled his sex life. Like her father.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for drying my hair.\u201d Her tone was formal, an attempt at keeping her distance.</p><p>\u201cA natural redhead.\u201d He combed his fingers through the strands, inspecting it as if he had never seen anything quite like it, caressing, awed.</p><p>And for a minute in time, she felt adored, when no one had ever treated her that way. But then she shuttered her heart, reminding herself it could all be a show. He might be a womanizer extraordinaire and it was his nature to beguile women with his irresistible magnetism.</p><p>He moved his long legs and rose.</p><p>Instantly, the heat his body had generated faded from hers and the loss of their touching affected her profoundly, when her mind told her she shouldn\u2019t feel a thing. But with her brother gone, the house so empty\u2014 hell, what was she telling herself? Hunter was the first man who\u2019d made her feel like a real woman ever. It had nothing to do with her brother or an empty house and all to do with an empty life. The only thing that kept her busy was taking care of her brother, and photographing anything and everything for a living.</p><p>One look at Hunter and the lustful expression in his gaze, and she knew he wanted her. Or at least he was fully aroused and needed release. She figured any woman who was readily available would do.</p><p>He lifted a brow and she wondered what he was reading in her expression. Skepticism? Interest? He would be right on both accounts.</p><p>He gave her a small smile, then grabbed his plate and sat next to her in front of the fire, his knee touching hers. Did he practice seduction? Or did it just come naturally?</p><p>\u201cYou could hire a detective to look into your brother\u2019s situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. He charged me lots and didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d</p><p>Hunter nodded.</p><p>\u201cMichael\u2019s innocent,\u201d she said, her voice harsher than she intended.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond one way or another, and she knew there was no sense in trying to convince another disbeliever. He devoured his steak as if he hadn\u2019t eaten in ages, but worked slower on the rolls and asparagus, and then gulped down two glasses of milk. When he snagged another roll, she studied his face again. She swore when she first saw them, the bruises were dark purple and cuts were deep and bloody in places. But now they looked like they were fading.</p><p>\u201cDoes your head hurt? Or anywhere else? I don\u2019t have anything really strong but I\u2019ve got headache and backache medicines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m feeling better already.\u201d</p><p>Now it was her turn to look at him unbelievingly. \u201cWhy would you have been swimming in the ocean? You must have some idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo possibilities. I was pushed or I jumped off one of the cliffs up the coast. Probably drifted to your beach.\u201d</p><p>Pushed? She couldn\u2019t imagine him being the type to jump.</p><p>First, she\u2019d put out the word she was going to locate Bethany\u2019s killer, now an intended murder victim was staying with her? Bad things come in threes, her grandmother had always said. Michael was found guilty, the electricity was off during an ice storm, and she found a near dead guy on the beach. Oh, and a guy had broken into her home and stolen her gun. That was four in her book. Now was past time for something good to happen.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything? Except that you like your steak rare?\u201d</p><p>He smiled a hair. \u201cI guess that\u2019s instinctual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t lose all your memory, including how to walk or talk like some do in really bad amnesia cases. Do you at least remember where you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He finished another roll and sat back against the leather footstool, his knees bent, his legs spread, his posture openly sexual, stating he was available if she was, while he studied her with that intense way of his as though he could look into her soul. \u201cSo what were you and your brother doing living way out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur grandparents gifted us the house when they died. I\u2019m a professional photographer.\u201d She motioned to the wall opposite the fireplace where around thirty framed photos picturing wildlife, both flora and fauna hung. \u201cAnd my brother is an artist. He loves to paint the Oregon Coast in all its moods. His work is now in several galleries across the country. You might have seen a couple of his paintings in the hallway and in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you are very talented. I love the way you capture nature in all its beauty.\u201d He observed her photos from where he sat, but the light was fading too much for him to see them well.</p><p>Maybe he had gotten a closer look at them earlier when she was changing.</p><p>\u201cThe way the light plays off the storm-driven waves. The deer eating undisturbed in the sun-mottled forest. Even the seals basking on the rocks near the caves below the cliffs. As if you were an unobtrusive observer preserving nature at its best with one click of the camera,\u201d Hunter said, motioning to them.</p><p>She could tell he wasn\u2019t just making small talk, that their work really touched him, which confirmed what she had assumed about him\u2014he was a rugged outdoorsman. Probably a hunter. She didn\u2019t see him as the fisherman type.</p><p>Yet something else flickered in his expression. A darkness, or concern. She wasn\u2019t sure what.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now that your brother is gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind a way to get him out of prison. I have to discover who Bethany Wade was seeing behind Michael\u2019s back. I really believe he\u2019s the clue to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re right in thinking someone had anything to do with her death, it\u2019s too dangerous for you to look into.\u201d</p><p>What other choice did she have? Not that she would personally chase after a killer. That would be way too risky. She\u2019d hire a good detective who could discover the truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up.\u201d</p><p>Hunter folded his arms across his chest and speared her a look that said he would have his way or else. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. I need to find out what happened to me. If someone pushed me off a cliff, I don\u2019t want whoever did it to know I\u2019m still alive, yet. So I need a nice out-of-the-way place to stay. You require some protection. Michael\u2019s window is broken and needs to be repaired. And if you think you locked the back door, then someone used a key to get in. You\u2019ll need your locks changed, and I can assist you. In the meantime, I\u2019ll snoop into Bethany Wade\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Tessa\u2019s mouth gaped.</p> <p>He added, \u201cFor room and board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you can\u2019t be seen, how can you investigate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Again, she had the feeling he knew more about himself than he was letting on. He sounded like he was an undercover operative used to slipping in and out of dangerous situations, unseen and unheard. He certainly was built like a man who physically trained all the time. Plus, he exhibited an unswerving confidence, bordering on out-and-out male arrogance, as she assumed someone in the Special Forces or Rangers would act.</p><p>\u201cAll right. You can sleep in the spare bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep wherever you bed down for the night.\u201d</p><p>That left unbidden thoughts of rugged sex with a mountain man blazing across her brain. She clamped her mouth shut, blinked, and managed to reopen her mouth and say, \u201cPardon me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>IF EVERY MUSCLE HADN\u2019T ACHED SO MUCH\u2014THE PAIN slicing all the way through to the marrow of his bones\u2014the incredulous expression on Miss Tessa Anderson\u2019s face would have made him smile. But the situation was too dire to make light of it. He might not remember his whole name or what had happened to him, but one thing the concussion had not robbed him of\u2014his wolf instincts.</p><p>They warned him whoever had broken into the house and stolen Tessa\u2019s gun had also lain in her bed\u2014on the side of the mattress where she always slept\u2014rolled in her scent and carried it with him. Which meant only one thing. The perpetrator wanted her for his own\u2014and since he was a lupus garou, that was bad news.</p><p>Worse than that, she triggered a craving in him to such an extent, he was having a hell of a time tamping down the feelings, and remembering why he had to keep his interest to himself.</p> <p>Her hair cascaded over her shoulder blades, thick, soft red curls he longed to plunge his fingers in again. Her clear green eyes were tinged blue, not a speck of amber: bright, expressive, not wary as he expected, being that he was a stranger without any memories and here most likely due to foul play.</p><p>And the frumpy emerald sweats she wore, although designed to hide a woman\u2019s sensuous shape, did nothing of the sort. The swell of her generous breasts, the curve of her thighs, her rounded ass, all were perfectly outlined by the soft attire. No belts or buttons to hinder their removal either.</p><p>He took a ragged breath and sat taller, absorbed the heat from the fire, which helped to ease the ache in his bones, and raised his brows. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you wherever you make your bed. The house isn\u2019t secure. Either we sleep here by the fire, or if you have enough blankets for your bed, we stay in your room.\u201d</p><p>If it was up to him, he would have opted for the comfort of the mattress, but most of all snuggling with the woman. But her scent, her pheromones, the feel of her silky hair, the way her soft body had pressed against him\u2014and the kiss\u2014had aroused him to such a degree, everything about her was throwing him off kilter. A one-night stand with a human female was one thing. But he was certain one tumble with her wouldn\u2019t satisfy the carnal urge. And since he needed to stay longer to protect her, it was better to keep their relationship as platonic as possible. Yet, the wolf part of him was already heading down a dangerous, forbidden path.</p><p>She licked her lips and turned her gaze to the fire. His groin tightened. The light sparkled off her eyes and her moistened lips glistened. He\u2019d been in a half-aroused state ever since the woman had manhandled him on the beach in her tight black denims and breast-hugging turtleneck, dampened by the sleet, her hardened nipples teasing his chest when she had tried to revive him. Even half-conscious, the wolf side of him had been aware of her special scent, sensed her fear\u2014not of him, but for him. If she learned what he was, what he was capable of, she would fear him.</p><p>\u201cI guess we could sleep here. By the fire. It would probably be warmer.\u201d Her gaze shifted from the flames to him.</p><p>The look in her eyes said she\u2019d be safer curling up next to the fire. Less intimate than sleeping with him in her bed. Yet there was a hint of something else. Desire to be with him? But she seemed to be waiting for him to make a decision. Which couldn\u2019t help but please him. His sister was so testy of late, seeing a female bow to his leadership was much appreciated.</p><p>Sister? Where the hell had that memory come from? He tried to dredge up more, but came up blank.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d Tessa asked, when he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Jarring him back to the situation at hand, he rubbed his right arm, the muscle caught in a spasm. He should have said she was right, sleeping by the fire was a good choice. Safer for both of them. But his animal needs were getting the best of him. He took another deep breath of her scent, sweet and musky. He wanted her, no matter how much he tried to persuade himself it would be a mistake.</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine,\u201d he said slowly, his gaze never leaving hers, all the while judging her reaction. \u201cBut already I\u2019m stiffening up pretty badly. Maybe I will take something for the aches and pains.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t lying, but normally he would suffer rather than let a woman know how he felt.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s face grew shadowed, and she hurried to take the plates. \u201cOh, oh, of course. You must be feeling awful.\u201d</p><p>She rushed into the kitchen, and he almost felt guilty. But he liked her maternal instincts, and no matter how much he knew he should shove his baser needs aside, he wanted to share the bed with Tessa. She was a grown woman after all, and he, a grown... well, man of sorts.</p><p>He glanced at the living room window, the curtains drawn.</p><p>Had the gray been watching them when they climbed to the house from the beach? The sleet was coming down hard, cleansing the air. He couldn\u2019t have smelled him if the lupus garou was being careful. Not a true alpha male then. If he had been one, the wolf would have made his presence known, indicated up front that he had laid claim to the woman. As a beta, the wolf would have rolled in her sheets before he saw Tessa hauling an injured gray up the hill. The lupus garou must have observed them, hiding in the trees, loathing him.</p><p>If the thief got anywhere near the house, he would regret it. But even a beta lupus garou could be a dangerous proposition for a lone human female.</p><p>Tessa returned with a glass of water and a couple of white pills. \u201cThis should help. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She whipped around and headed for the kitchen, then banged inside the cabinets.</p><p>He took the medicine, finished off the water, and rose from the floor. Not meaning to, he groaned, and she caught him in the act.</p><p>Her brows furrowed deeper as she tightened her hold on a stainless steel saucepan. \u201cYou\u2019re really hurting, aren\u2019t you? Why don\u2019t you lie down on the floor next to the fire, and I\u2019ll rub some liniment into your muscles. I\u2019ll warm this water over the fire, and you can wash the saltwater off your skin. When the electricity\u2019s back on, you can shower properly.\u201d</p><p>He meant to conceal his satisfied expression, for her sake, but he couldn\u2019t help it. She was eating right out of his hands.</p><p>She twisted her mouth and set the pot on the fire. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>After watching her walk down the hall to the bathroom, and seeing nothing amiss, he returned to the living room, stripped out of her brother\u2019s sweats and reclined on his stomach on the carpeting next to the fire. He rested his head on his arms, but even that movement sent a streak of screaming pain from his arms to his back.</p><p>Tessa stepped into the room and he heard her intake of breath. Her eyes grew big and her lips parted, but she had already seen him nude.</p><p>\u201cI hope that stuff works.\u201d He attempted looking as innocent as an alpha gray pack leader could manage who was already fully aroused, his voice way too husky.</p><p>\u201cUhm, you\u2019re awfully cut up. Let me get some antibacterial cream, too.\u201d She set the tube of liniment next to the fire and left. Down the hall, she rummaged around in some drawers.</p><p>She returned posthaste, carrying a handful of creams, his salvation. In anticipation, he relaxed his stiff muscles.</p><p>After leaving the creams on the coffee table, she knelt beside him and dipped a washcloth in the water. She slid the hot wet cloth over his shoulders, her touch gentle, and he gave a raspy sigh. \u201cGot hot fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo warm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, feels just right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe faucet still had some hot water. The pipes would be cold and it takes forever for the bathroom water to heat even on a warm day, but you might be able to take a fast lukewarm shower.\u201d</p><p>He needed a cold one to keep his libido in check with the woman touching him so tenderly. \u201cThis is fine.\u201d Better than fine.</p><p>She washed his right shoulder and arm and before he could grow chilled, she patted the skin dry with a towel. He closed his eyes and enjoyed her ministrations. No one had ever treated him with so much kindness that he could recall. Hell, his sister would have shoved him in a tub of cold water, not wanting him to soil the sheets with the odor from the sea.</p><p>Again, an elusive memory of his sister. But he couldn\u2019t dredge up anything further.</p><p>Tessa probably couldn\u2019t smell the fishy odor on his skin like his kind could, but the scent was pretty pungent. He felt like he had been dropped in a vat of freshly caught fish off the coast. Not that it bothered him. Getting skunked was about the worst odor any wolf would have to contend with. Although he had been a pup when it happened, too curious for his own good, his parents wouldn\u2019t let him inside the house for days. Thankfully, the weather had been mild and the moon out so he remained a wolf the whole time, foraging in the forest, no chores to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again, a memory. But even so, he couldn\u2019t recall what had happened to his parents or anything else about the incident.</p><p>After Tessa washed his neck, she left. Hating to admit it, he wanted in the worst way to drag her back, beg her to finish, then make love to her. He opened a sleepy eye, wondering what she was up to.</p><p>With a slight blush to her cheeks, she stood over him holding the afghan. \u201cYou must be cold.\u201d Before he could tell her she was heating him up just fine, she covered the lower part of his body with the soft blanket, and then started to wash his back, her touch methodical and soothing. \u201cYou sure took a beating.\u201d</p> <p>She might have talked further, but he couldn\u2019t be sure. His thoughts had drifted to his current predicament and how he\u2019d gotten here. If he had a sister, were they in a pack? He had to be the leader. He couldn\u2019t imagine serving in any other role. But what of his people? Were they from this area?</p><p>The lupus garou skulking around Tessa\u2019s place didn\u2019t remind him of anyone he knew. And then another concern: if his pack thought he was dead, one of the emergent alphas\u2014if there were any\u2014would try to take over. Well, he would remedy that when he got back.</p><p>\u201cI had a premonition something bad was going to happen,\u201d Tessa was saying.</p><p>He opened his eyes, turned his head, and stared at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not psychic or anything. I just have these\u2014bad impressions sometimes. Anyway,\u201d she said, scooting the afghan down to the tip of his spine, \u201csometimes I feel like something is wrong. When my parents died, I felt that way. Before they arrested Michael, it hit me again. Now tonight. I just couldn\u2019t pinpoint the feeling, but I couldn\u2019t squash the sensation of being watched.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, by the gray. He assumed the man had been stalking her for some time before he finally made a move.</p><p>She finished washing his back, slipped the afghan higher, covering his back and shoulders, and began washing his lower extremities. \u201cAre you all right? Not getting too chilled?\u201d</p><p>More than all right. In heaven, as much as he could be, the way he was so bruised and every muscle ached. \u201cIt feels good to have the salt washed off my skin,\u201d he said, his voice muffled in relaxation.</p><p>\u201cTell me if I hurt you and I\u2019ll quit.\u201d</p><p>He would suffer anything as long as she kept touching him.</p><p>When she began to work the liniment into his shoulders, the way her fingers massaged the muscles sent a sizzling heat through every fiber. He groaned with pure pleasure.</p> <p>She stopped. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you quit.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled.</p><p>Despite how good she was making him feel, he couldn\u2019t prevent his mind from working over the problem with the gray wolf intruder. \u201cWho would have a key to your house?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and then began to rub his lower back. \u201cMichael, of course. Bethany had a key.\u201d Her fingers rested on the tip of his spine.</p><p>Move lower, he silently pleaded.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, what if the killer had taken it off Bethany? What if he was looking for evidence Michael might have against him, except my brother was unaware of it?\u201d</p><p>What if the whole scenario was a setup to get rid of Michael so the lupus garou could have a free shot at Tessa? What if it had nothing to do with Bethany Wade?</p> <p>It would make sense that a sneaky beta was seeing Bethany behind Michael\u2019s back, cagey enough not to get caught, but giving Michael an alibi he couldn\u2019t prove. Oh, hell, if a lupus garou killed Bethany, no way could he expose him for the crime. If the killer went to prison, the moon\u2019s appearance would eventually force the man to turn wolf. But to get Michael off, they needed to catch the murderer and have him convicted.</p><p>Hunter let out his breath in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to turn over, and I\u2019ll wash the rest of your skin?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think she could handle what she had done to him with her sweet touch, but he was more than ready and rolled over. He groaned with the effort and any fear she might have had that he would want to take their relationship too far seemed to fade as her eyes widened and her mouth opened slightly. Not that he couldn\u2019t make love to her despite the way he ached. Dealing with that torture would only help alleviate other discomforts she was now making worse.</p><p>She covered him quickly, although the afghan couldn\u2019t hide his full-blown erection, and her cheeks blushed anew. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone else had a key to our place.\u201d</p><p>He studied her face as she washed his chest, her lashes hiding her eyes as she concentrated on her work. He wanted to ask her if she was seeing anyone regularly. The scent of several different males filled the house, but they might have been her brother\u2019s friends. He hoped they were her brother\u2019s friends. But if he asked if she was seeing anyone special, she might make more of an issue of his question than he intended. Still, being an alpha he couldn\u2019t skirt around the situation. What if a suitor turned up and found Tessa and him sleeping together?</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to ruin her relationship with a guy if it was important to her. He couldn\u2019t claim her for his own. He didn\u2019t believe in changing humans, and he hadn\u2019t known anyone personally who had ever done so. At least that he could remember.</p><p>Certainly, he couldn\u2019t imagine anyone doing it in this day and age. Although he supposed if the two were mutually agreeable... he mentally shook his head. It wasn\u2019t possible without the wolf telling the human what they were, which wasn\u2019t allowed. And even if a lupus garou did explain the situation, how could a human truly understand the ramifications of the change? He or she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Tessa lowered the afghan and then worked on his stomach, her hair caressing his belly. Tickling, tantalizing. he itched to take handfuls of her hair and lower her fascinating mouth to his and kiss her again. Only this time with a lot more stamina.</p><p>When she began washing his legs, she avoided looking in the direction of his erection staking the cover in the form of a mountain peak.</p><p>\u201cTessa,\u201d he said, raising up on an elbow, \u201care you seeing anyone regularly?\u201d</p><p>Wide-eyed, she looked at him.</p><p>He sure as hell didn\u2019t mean it like it sounded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin your relationship with a man if you\u2019re serious about one while I\u2019m staying with you, and he was to drop by unexpectedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could say you\u2019re gay.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows. Not only did he not care for the idea, he didn\u2019t like that she had a boyfriend. \u201cThen you\u2019re seeing someone?\u201d He hated how gruff his voice sounded. He meant to ask casually, not like he was ready to rip the guy\u2019s head from his shoulders.</p><p>She shrugged, but avoided looking at him. He smiled. She wasn\u2019t seeing anyone, but was afraid to admit it\u2014maybe embarrassed that she didn\u2019t have a guy, or maybe she thought she could prevent her houseguest from getting too frisky with her in the event he wanted something more.</p><p>He leaned back again, his head resting on the crook of his arms while she washed his feet. From the moment he\u2019d found himself half frozen and hurting beyond belief on the beach, he\u2019d never thought an angel would be the one to save him, or tempt him like she did.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Do you have anyone?\u201d She set aside the wet washcloth and applied ointment to a cut on his shin.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d never considered that. What if he did have a mate waiting at home for him? There were too few to leave widowed, before another male would jump to claim an unattached female.</p><p>Tessa rubbed more antibacterial ointment on a deep scrape on his inner thigh, stirring his erection. But he couldn\u2019t quit worrying if he had a mate. Surely if he did have one, she\u2019d wait for some time before giving up hope on him.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, Tessa looked up at him. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Tessa felt Hunter\u2019s pain, the poor man. He couldn\u2019t even remember if he had someone special in his life. But it was probably good she brought it up, to put a halt to whatever he was thinking might go on between them. He was way too aroused for her to believe he was interested in only protecting her. And she couldn\u2019t help but notice his irritation when he thought she might be attached to a man.</p><p>She glanced at the dwindling fire. They would need the dry firewood for tomorrow\u2019s heat and breakfast if the electricity didn\u2019t come on during the night. She wasn\u2019t sure if taking Hunter to bed with her was a sound idea, but it would be warmer under the covers if they couldn\u2019t have a fire all night long. And the mattress was definitely preferable to the carpeted floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get some fresh sweats for you to wear. You look worn out. Maybe we should go to bed now.\u201d</p><p>He attempted to look serious, but his eyes and mouth hinted at humor. Yeah, he had suckered her right in. He might have been dead tired, but the way he regarded her with such fascination\u2014her hair, her clothes as if he could see right through them, the way he captured her gaze, holding her captive\u2014he was way too interested in her.</p><p>\u201cBut remember,\u201d she said, grabbing a camp lantern, \u201cyou\u2019re gay, so no funny stuff or you\u2019ll be sleeping on the floor.\u201d</p><p>This time he gave her a smug smile and a little chuckle. \u201cAs you wish. Thanks, Tessa, for taking me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say we both benefited.\u201d She tried to sound businesslike, as though she ran a first-rate hotel for half-drowned victims who earned their keep, and hurried down the now dark hall. But then she thought she heard someone in Michael\u2019s bedroom. She had closed the door to keep the freezing wind blowing through his window from chilling the rest of the house, but she was sure a drawer opened and shut.</p><p>Maybe the wind had made the noise. Still, she listened and couldn\u2019t force herself to reach for the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cTessa?\u201d Hunter walked up behind her, this time wearing the afghan slung low over his hips.</p><p>The effect was nearly as erotic as when he wasn\u2019t wearing anything. She would never look at the blanket her grandmother had made the same way again either.</p><p>He seized the doorknob and jerked the door open.</p><p>She held her breath.</p><p>He stalked into the frigid room, and she hurried to give him the lantern. He peered into the closet, and then walked inside. She half-expected him to bring the intruder out, with an arm locked around the culprit\u2019s neck. But instead, Hunter carried a bundle of sweats. Then he went to the window and looked out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s there.\u201d He turned to face her, the breeze blowing his hair across his cheeks, softening his dark expression. \u201cWhat do you think you heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone opening a drawer.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter dumped the sweats on the mattress and peered under the bed. He set the lantern down, and then crossed the floor to the dresser. When she saw what he was about to do, she hurried to help him move the furniture. His muscles strained as he did the majority of the work, and she cringed to think he might injure himself further.</p><p>After they had blocked the window with the heavy mahogany dresser, he grabbed the sweats and lantern.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be getting in that way again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I really heard him? Or do you think I imagined it?\u201d she asked, hoping the intruder hadn\u2019t slipped back in as she led Hunter into her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCould have been the wind. I\u2019ll board up the window in the morning and replace it once we pick up a new one.\u201d</p> <p>Brother, here she worried about him getting too amorous with her in bed, and he was saving her butt again. The long-standing distrust of men she had didn\u2019t help. Not after her father had been one of the worst womanizers in the small community. How her mother had put up with him and his philandering ways she could never fathom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave this lantern on in the bathroom in case you need something in the middle of the night.\u201d She noted he had put on a pair of pale gray sweatpants, but not the sweatshirt. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to be cold?\u201d</p><p>He cast her a small smile and her cheeks heated. Since he was so comfortable showing off his nudity, he probably usually slept in the raw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave a spare toothbrush on the bathroom counter for you. Be right out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tessa. I\u2019ll lie down until you\u2019re through.\u201d</p><p>But he glanced at her bedroom window, and she bet he wanted to check outside for the intruder. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be exhausted, Hunter. Don\u2019t worry about him. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p> <p>As much raw sexual energy as he exuded, she wasn\u2019t sure sleeping with him was such a good idea after all.</p><p>But when she exited the bathroom, expecting to find him lying on the bed, half-asleep, she found the room empty. Sitting by the remnants of the fire then?</p><p>Cinching up her velour robe, she hurried down the hall with lantern in hand to let him know the bathroom was free, but there was no sign of him in the living room. She rushed to the picture window and peered out. He couldn\u2019t be out in this awful weather.</p><p>Not anywhere in sight. Hurrying to the back door, she halfway expected him to trudge up the hill with another enormous load of firewood.</p><p>\u201cLooking for someone?\u201d he asked behind her, his voice dark and husky.</p><p>She squeaked and whirled around. \u201cMy god, Hunter. Where were you?\u201d</p><p>He held up a shaving kit. \u201cI found it in the guest bathroom. I hope your brother won\u2019t mind if I shaved.\u201d</p><p>His skin was smooth as satin and she wanted to run her hands over his face, feel the velvety skin, smell the citrus spice aftershave, but more than that, she wanted another of his soul-piercing kisses. She chastised herself. He probably had a wife.</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t mind that you\u2019ve used his things while he\u2019s... away. He\u2019ll be glad you were here to watch over me. And that you\u2019ve offered to help me find Bethany\u2019s killer so we can free him.\u201d</p><p>A subtle shadow fell over his face, and she wondered if he\u2019d changed his mind. Well, she hadn\u2019t. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need anything else...\u201d</p><p>He moved out of her path and bowed his head slightly.</p><p>The frigid air wasn\u2019t the only thing that chilled her to the bone. She had quickly become used to the idea she\u2019d have a real man on her side to help her locate Bethany\u2019s murderer.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have gotten her hopes up.</p><p>Tessa grabbed the tie to her robe, then apparently thinking better of it, she climbed into bed dressed in fluffy pink socks, polka-dot pink and green pajamas, and the emerald robe. He had never seen a woman so clothed in bed. He stifled a chuckle. The big bad wolf would not eat her all up, unless she chose it and he was free to do so.</p><p>She kept her distance, staying near the opposite edge of the soft queen-sized mattress, which was understandable since he was a stranger. But she needed someone to hold her tight after her harrowing day\u2014the trial, the intruder, finding a near dead man on the beach. She cast wistful looks at him when she didn\u2019t think he could see her in the dark.</p><p>He took a long-suffering breath. Patience was definitely not one of his virtues, but he needed a place to stay until he could sort out his situation. The best thing he could do was ignore his cravings when it came to the woman who stirred his desire with a smile, a touch, and the scent of her subtle aroused state.</p><p>Forget patience or the right or wrong of it. \u201cJoin me, Tessa. The room\u2019s too cold. I promise I\u2019ll behave.\u201d At least that was the plan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re injured.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d suffer anything to have her in his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I\u2019m hurting.\u201d</p><p>Silence. He smiled. She was thinking on it. He waited, anticipating enveloping her soft body in his. She shook her head. He groaned inwardly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. If you get too cold, throw on Michael\u2019s sweatshirt. You can get some of his sweaters, socks, whatever else you need to stay toasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you change your mind and want me to warm you up, just slide over here.\u201d</p><p>Forever, he waited for her to come to him. The wind whipped around the house in a howling frenzy while the rain continued to pelt the roof and windows. Every bit of the cold seemed to have made it inside her home and the bedroom was icier than her freezer. But still, he would not bundle up in tons of clothes when he had a perfectly good woman to snuggle with.</p><p>Then her leg jerked. Her arm twitched. She was asleep. She rolled over. Was she joining him?</p><p>Her foot shot out and connected with his knee. Pain flared through the tendons and surrounding tissue. Hell, he already had a bruise the size of a melon there. Before he could pull her into his arms, she rolled over again. Night terrors? Nightmares? He reached over to rub her back, to comfort her, when her elbow jabbed him in the chest.</p><p>Not what he had in mind after frolicking in the ocean, battered against the rocks in the icy water. Then the sound of distant gunfire caught his attention. As a lupus garou, shouldn\u2019t the shots grip him with terror? Adrenaline flooded his system, but he wasn\u2019t afraid. In fact, for whatever reason, he felt the oddest urge to take up a gun and retaliate.</p><p>If the shooter was nearby, Hunter would make him move so he wouldn\u2019t wake Tessa. Time to see if the gray who broke into her home was wandering around outside at this hour also.</p><p>Careful not to wake Tessa, Hunter climbed out of bed, covered her up, observed her hair splayed across the pillow, her lashes twitching, her alluring lips parted slightly, inviting another kiss. He took a deep, settling breath. A mermaid from the sea, and just as alluring. He groaned to himself, seized Michael\u2019s shoes and sweatshirt, and hurried from the bedroom.</p><p>He thought of changing by the shed, but he couldn\u2019t risk Tessa catching him shapeshifting. With Michael\u2019s field jacket and gloves tucked under his arm, he found a plastic garbage bag to stick them in to keep them dry while he searched for the gray in his wolf form.</p><p>At least it seemed like a good strategy. But the way things were going for him lately...</p><p>He\u2019d had enough bad luck to last him at least one human\u2019s lifetime.</p><p>In the middle of the night, the sound of gunfire in the distance woke Tessa. She jerked her head around and stared at the empty bed. No Hunter. Her heart raced and she practically flew off the mattress. Grabbing the lantern from the bathroom, she hurried down the hall. \u201cHunter?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She half-expected him to be asleep on the couch because she\u2019d been tossing and turning so much, her usual mode of sleep since her brother had been incarcerated.</p><p>\u201cHunter?\u201d She peered into the living room.</p><p>No sign of him. She headed back down the hall to the guest bedroom. He wasn\u2019t there either. Michael\u2019s bedroom would be way too cold.</p><p>Where was he?</p><p>Another shot rang out.</p><p>It was January and no one should be hunting big game along the coast, and not this early in the morning for game bird hunting either. Two more shots were fired. Then silence. She barely breathed.</p><p>Michael\u2019s field jacket was gone, so were his gloves and her ski hat.</p><p>\u201cHunter,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>The back door jerked open, and she squealed. Hunter frowned at her as he stalked inside with an armload of wood. \u201cYou should be sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night. Didn\u2019t you hear that maniac shooting out there? He shouldn\u2019t be hunting, but what if you\u2019d gotten in his line of sight? What if he was a poacher?\u201d</p><p>Hunter dumped the firewood on the dwindling stack, yanked off the gloves, and her hat. \u201cFour more hours until it\u2019s daylight. Electricity is still off.\u201d</p><p>She relocked the back door. \u201cHope that idiot hunter doesn\u2019t shoot anymore. I hate it when they come into the area.\u201d</p><p>He looked in the direction the gunshots had been coming from and shrugged. \u201cHe probably ran out of bullets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike they ever do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss me?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes as they returned to the bedroom. \u201cThe gunshots woke me.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and massaged the tension from her shoulders. Man, did his fingers work magic on her tension-filled muscles\u2014she felt like dissolving into the carpet.</p><p>\u201cThen after you woke, you missed me. Admit it. Having me warm your bed hasn\u2019t been so bad after all, has it?\u201d</p><p>She hmpfed. \u201cNow you\u2019re icy and will make the bed cold.\u201d She climbed under the covers while he slipped the field jacket off his shoulders, and then stripped out of the sweatshirt.</p><p>He reached for the sweatpants, then seeing her mouth drop and probably thinking better of it, he joined her in bed still wearing them. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m cold. I promise I won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want. I\u2019m... gay, remember?\u201d He gave her a devious smirk. \u201cJust come over here and warm me. I gathered enough firewood to keep us toasty for most of the day, didn\u2019t I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although a hint of pleading was evident in his tone of voice, his words were still more of a command.</p><p>She knew this was a very bad idea. But she always seemed to be helping others. Why not get something good out of the experience, even if it didn\u2019t last? He was the kind of guy that wouldn\u2019t stay in a long-term relationship, she would bet. One minute, he would be there for her, and the next, gone. Especially once he learned who he was and where he belonged. Probably had a good paying job, certainly a family, and a home somewhere. But heck, as long as she didn\u2019t get stuck on the guy, what did it matter if they warmed each other for the rest of the morning?</p><p>As macho as he was, she expected him to join her, but maybe he was too honorable, waiting to make sure it was okay with her. She sighed and moved close to him. His cold feet left an icy imprint on the back of her legs where her pajamas had drawn up, and she swore under her breath. \u201cDamn, Hunter, your feet are ice cold, and now I\u2019ll never get warm.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled low and pulled her into his heated embrace. And she did warm up, way too much, but he seemed honor-bound. Maybe because he was concerned he still had a wife or fianc\u00e9e or special woman in his life. Too bad. She sure could get used to a guy like this. Once she\u2019d returned home after college, pickings had been slim. Rourke, the reporter, wanted to renew old acquaintances, but he was the last one she\u2019d want to be stuck with on a desert island. The sheriff\u2019s son, one of Michael\u2019s best friends, was another, but those were the only two single men she knew still living in town after finishing high school who were close to her age. Everyone was eons older, younger, or married. But, Hunter, although she wasn\u2019t sure about his age, seemed perfect.</p><p>His warm breath teased the back of her head and his arms wrapped around her in a loving embrace. His erection stiffened against her back, and she sighed. Too bad he didn\u2019t know who he was. If he wasn\u2019t hooked up with anyone, they could have had a nice fling\u2014not that she was into that sort of thing, but with someone as hot as him\u2014why not? It was about time she let loose, had some fun, and did something for herself for a change.</p><p>Hunter kept Tessa still. He had never known a woman who tossed and turned so much in bed. At least, he didn\u2019t remember anyone like that. What night terrors was she dealing with? After she had beat on him, the only way he was returning to bed with her was to hold her tight, give her solace, and keep her from kicking and hitting him any further.</p><p>At least the hunter wouldn\u2019t be shooting any more for a while. Not until he purchased a new rifle and found another location to hunt in. If Hunter hadn\u2019t needed to remain in hiding for the time being, he would have turned the bastard in for attempted murder. He hoped Tessa wouldn\u2019t see the hole in her ski cap and question him about it.</p><p>How would he explain how he could run faster than a normal human being? He was just fortunate the second bullet had only grazed his upper arm. He\u2019d even forgotten about it when he pulled the sweatshirt off, but thankfully, she didn\u2019t see the wound the way he was turned slightly away from her toward the dark. With any luck, she wouldn\u2019t see the bloody mess before it healed.</p> <p>The man swore he thought Hunter was a black bear attacking him. As if Hunter looked anything like a bear. At least, the maniac\u2019s rifle wouldn\u2019t do him any good, even if it survived striking the rocks below and landing in the ocean. The only thing Hunter regretted was the fact he had littered.</p><p>He took a deep breath of Tessa\u2019s scent, knowing he shouldn\u2019t. When he shared one-night stands with lonely human females, that he recalled, he kept it strictly business, pleasuring them, and experiencing the joy it brought him. But he never attempted to memorize their scents, or make anything of the relationships, like two clouds passing each other in the night, barely touching, and then disappearing.</p><p>He was already too wrapped up in worrying about Tessa, her brother, and the gray lupus garou who had set his sights on her.</p><p>He brushed one of Tessa\u2019s curls tickling his cheek away and grunted when the bullet wound sent a shard of pain through his arm.</p><p>Tessa stirred. \u201cAre you hurting a lot?\u201d She reached over and touched his arm and felt the moisture. \u201cMy god, Hunter. What...\u201d She stared at the blood tingeing her fingertips in the lantern\u2019s soft glow from the bathroom. \u201cYou\u2019ve been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anything,\u201d he said, frowning. Leave it to a human female to make a big deal out of nothing.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d Her face contorted with worry. She pulled out of his grasp, climbed out of bed, and rushed to the bathroom. After opening and shutting several drawers, she returned with gauze and tape. \u201cIs the bullet embedded?\u201d</p><p>Ah hell, he hadn\u2019t wanted her to see the evidence, or worry her. \u201cJust grazed the skin, really, Tessa. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to charge him with attempted murder. He shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with this. Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were hurt? No, I\u2019ll tell you. You\u2019re too macho to let me know, damn it.\u201d</p><p>He hid a grin. Her alpha posturing triggered his primal craving for her all over again.</p><p>She wiped away the blood, but it pooled up more. She clamped the gauze on it and the frown returned to her brow. \u201cHold this while I cut the tape. So what happened exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was gathering firewood. I guess he thought I was a new species of game bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to be shooting in the middle of the night.\u201d She finished taping the gauze to the wound. \u201cAre you really all right? Have you had a recent tetanus shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, to both.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him for a second, her look concerned again, and touched his arm, a jolt of electricity heating his blood. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose you before you help me find Bethany\u2019s killer.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cAnd here I thought you had a hankering for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumpf.\u201d She jerked Michael\u2019s sweatshirt off the floor and waved it at Hunter, her face stern, but he could see she was half-teasing. \u201cYou\u2019re only borrowing my brother\u2019s clothes. I expected you\u2019d give them back in the same shape you received them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to run faster next time.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you running from anyone.\u201d</p><p>She had that right.</p><p>She returned to the bathroom and rinsed the blood out in the sink, and then the shower curtain rings slid across the rod. A dripping sound in the bathtub followed that.</p><p>When she climbed back into bed, Hunter leaned down, kissed the top of her head, breathed in her heady sweet scent, and pulled her into his arms. And wished he could have her, that she was one of his kind, and she\u2019d want him in return.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to get any more of his things shot up. And when I\u2019m able, I\u2019ll buy him replacements. Sleep, Tessa. Or we\u2019ll have to take a nap in the middle of the day to make up for not sleeping half the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to report this to the sheriff\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shooter said he would.\u201d</p><p>She turned and stared at Hunter. \u201cYou talked to him?\u201d</p><p>He tightened his hold on her, keeping her soft body pressed against his chest, her bottom seated provocatively against his arousal. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said, his voice growing ragged with need. \u201cIt has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shot you on my property so it has everything to do with me. What did he say? That he was going to report how he\u2019d shot you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like that he was going to tell the sheriff how I destroyed his brand-new rifle.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew even bigger, the blue specks highlighting the green gems. \u201cWhat... what did he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I stole Michael\u2019s clothes. He had shoulder-length blond hair, stood a little shorter than me, talked big, but was shaking in his boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshton Wellington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff\u2019s son and Michael\u2019s best friend. Great. His father can be a real pain in the butt when it comes to protecting his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much.\u201d He wrapped a curl of hair around his finger and examined the color and texture. \u201cAfter all, the guy shot me, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you destroyed his gun.\u201d She frowned at Hunter. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tossed it in the ocean. Figured he\u2019d wake you up, and he shouldn\u2019t have been shooting that close to your house anyway.\u201d</p><p>She groaned and hugged his arms wrapped around her chest, drawing him into her silky embrace, making his blood sizzle\u2014siren.</p><p>\u201cExpect the sheriff\u2019s visit early in the morning,\u201d she warned.</p><p>He nuzzled his face in her hair, smelled the fragrant peach scent, wanted to lick every inch of her skin to see if she tasted just as sweet. \u201cWhat role do you want me to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCousin from back east. You\u2019re staying with me until we clear Michael of his crime.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled on her hair. \u201cGay cousin?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cLike anyone would believe that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and rubbed her arm with a slow, stroking caress. \u201cGood. Not that I care much for being a cousin either, too easy to get caught up in a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then? My lover?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled darkly. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>EARLY THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE TESS A WOKE, HUNTER searched through her house for any reason a lupus garou would have specifically targeted her other than the fact her pheromones undoubtedly had something do with attracting him and soon found something he couldn\u2019t comprehend. Wolf pictures filled three desk drawers in the guest bedroom. Since lupus garou wolves looked just like regular wolves, he couldn\u2019t tell if they were real wild wolves, or his kind. Not unless he could smell them. Against a wall, shelves housed several books on wolf behavior also.</p><p>But why she\u2019d have tons of photos and books on them, and why her scent attracted him to such an arousing degree\u2014</p><p>A sepia photo half-hidden by the wolf pictures caught his attention, and he pulled it out. \u201cSeth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sitting next to a woman with a baby on her lap, Seth appeared more youthful than Hunter remembered him, his handlebar mustache curled high, his pale eyes as serious as the rest of the expression on his face. Hunter recalled seeing him in a photo panning for gold in California with his great-grandfather and great uncle, the three of them the best of friends. But he didn\u2019t remember Seth having a mate before a rockslide had taken his life.</p><p>Hunter glanced at the back of the photo. No identification. Why would Tessa have a photo of him? And how come Hunter remembered who Seth was, when nothing else was clear?</p><p>In the closet, Hunter found a bunch of half-finished paintings, the focal point of the pictures, wolves\u2014gray, red, Arctic.</p> <p>He frowned. Maybe Tessa\u2019s brother used the wolf photos to create the paintings. But why not finish them? Why hide them away?</p><p>Tessa stirred in her bed in the master bedroom. Hunter shut the closet door and left the guest bedroom to make the fire and start breakfast, but he had a lot of questions to ask the little lady.</p><p>When Hunter\u2019s arms had been wrapped tightly around her, Tessa felt warmer and more secure than she had in months\u2014since the time the sheriff told her that her brother was suspected of murder.</p><p>Except for Hunter nuzzling his face in her hair in the middle of the night, and rubbing his cheek on her shoulder another time, he hadn\u2019t made any overtures that amounted to wanting something further. Probably because he didn\u2019t know if he had a significant other, which made her appreciate him even more.</p><p>After finding her father making out with different women on three occasions at home when her mother was gone, Tessa didn\u2019t think any man could be faithful. Well, maybe she did. For a while. Until she began dating and then she knew the truth. Most men she\u2019d known didn\u2019t care who they were with as long as the woman agreed to have sex.</p> <p>Hunter\u2019s warm embrace had been comforting, and Tessa wanted to bask in the feel of him, the masculine smell of him, the heat of his body all night long, but she finally had fallen into a deep slumber.</p><p>When she fully awoke, she wasn\u2019t surprised to find Hunter making eggs, sausages, biscuits, and coffee over the fire. Another load of wood was stacked neatly on the log rack. He seemed at home under the circumstances, which again made her wonder if he was an undercover operative or a Navy SEAL or something.</p><p>Navy SEAL. She snorted. Yeah, that nearly drowned in the Pacific.</p><p>Part of her hoped he\u2019d remembered something about his former life, mainly that he wasn\u2019t attached to anyone. But part of her was afraid he would recall too much, and he would leave her for his old life pronto. Right now, she needed him, if nothing more than for moral support, well, and protection.</p><p>If someone had tried to kill him, she had no doubt he would want to square things with the person also. She still couldn\u2019t believe Ashton Wellington had shot him.</p><p>\u201cMorning. I\u2019ll get dressed and be right back,\u201d Tessa said.</p> <p>\u201cMorning.\u201d Hunter\u2019s masculine voice heated her through and through, his eyes capturing hers.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a sight for sore eyes.\u201d Clich\u00e9, right. But god, he was\u2014crouching before the fire, an elusive smile on his lips, his windswept hair curled about his shoulders, a shadow of a beard darkening his square jaw, a look of seduction as the fire flickered in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDitto, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>She waved in the direction of the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Yet she didn\u2019t want to leave. Never before had she wanted to be with a man 24/7. It wasn\u2019t that she felt like moss that clung to a stone, rather, she just enjoyed his company\u2014a little too much.</p><p>In the bedroom, she slipped into a pair of jeans and a red turtleneck and sweater, then threw on a pair of warm knee-high socks and suede slipper boots. After washing her face in the icy water in the bathroom, she applied foundation, darkened her red lashes, and brushed her hair. She stared at the sink. Hopefully, the pipes wouldn\u2019t freeze.</p><p>She glanced at her brother\u2019s sweatshirt hanging in the shower, the hole visible.</p><p>Ashton was the reason her brother had gotten into so much trouble over the years. The sheriff always said Michael was the instigator. But he wasn\u2019t. Michael was a born follower, Ashton, always the leader. So it didn\u2019t surprise her he would pull something like this. Well, maybe a little. She didn\u2019t think he\u2019d do something so dangerous. What in the world had gotten into him? Drinking. Maybe. He could get crazy then\u2014as she well knew.</p><p>She padded down the hall into the living room where Hunter still hovered over the fireplace. He seemed so contemplative as he flipped the eggs and sausages, she didn\u2019t want to disturb him, but he turned and smiled. The look was more smug than sweet, almost as if he had known she\u2019d been quietly observing him.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d He served up the eggs.</p><p>She laughed a little under her breath. \u201cWhat woman would complain? If Michael had ever made breakfast before I got my lazy bones out of bed, I would have been elated. And in shock.\u201d</p><p>Hunter would make some woman a darned good husband. But he seemed more like a mountain man, rugged, capable of living alone in the wilderness, yet he had a wonderful tender touch, too. He was perfect. If he wasn\u2019t already attached.</p><p>He handed her a plate. \u201cI found some planks to board up the window, but wanted to wait until you were awake before I began banging around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>His expression said he didn\u2019t need assistance, but she owed him and she wasn\u2019t about to let him do all that work himself.</p><p>They took their meals to the dining table and sat down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still sleeting, a stalled storm front. I can manage without your help.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows. \u201cI bet you tell all your girlfriends that.\u201d</p><p>The forkful of eggs stopped midway to his mouth and his lips turned up a little, his amber eyes reflecting amusement.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re playing the part of lovers, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019d agreed on that. I imagine people in this community might find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of her coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re right. They would, so when the sheriff comes, he\u2019ll be our first test subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure he\u2019ll make it in this weather. I\u2019m surprised his son was able to get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the intruder.\u201d Tessa set her mug down, a lump lodged in her throat. \u201cI never considered it before, but what if Ashton was the person who broke in? He was in the area, could have gotten a key from Michael\u2014he\u2019d been at the house plenty of times\u2014and it would explain why he was still out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is Ashton\u2019s relationship with you?\u201d Hunter asked, super casual-like, but the undercurrent of edginess to his voice couldn\u2019t be missed.</p><p>And why not? The bastard had shot him. \u201cI\u2019m Michael\u2019s annoying sister.\u201d</p><p>He looked skeptical. \u201cAshton appeared to be close to your age. Are you sure there\u2019s not something more to it than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both twenty-three. Went to high school together. Michael met Ashton at a town fireworks display. My brother is two years younger and always looked up to Ashton. So no, Ashton has never shown any interest in me. He\u2019s been in all kinds of trouble ever since we were kids. Senior high pranks, junior high pranks. You name it, he was always the ringleader. His dad was a police officer, then deputy sheriff until he was elected sheriff. He always covered for Ashton and blamed Michael for leading his son astray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, so then I must have led him astray last night when he shot at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShot you,\u201d she corrected, her voice bitter. \u201cEven if the bullet only grazed you, he still shot you.\u201d That\u2019s when she caught a glimpse of her ski cap... and the hole. \u201cWhat... what happened to my hat?\u201d</p><p>Hunter shrugged and finished his eggs.</p><p>Her heart raced lickety-split. \u201cHe didn\u2019t shoot at you twice, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe missed me the one time, Tessa. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m sure we have an understanding now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, he could have killed you! You have to tell the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>The expression on Hunter\u2019s face indicated it was no big deal, and he wasn\u2019t mentioning it.</p><p>\u201cAll right, fine. I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d She jerked their dirty plates off the table. \u201cThe sheriff won\u2019t be able to use my brother as a scapegoat for his son\u2019s actions any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me handle this, Tessa.\u201d He leaned back in the chair, his expression serious. \u201cNot to change the subject, but I was looking for a phone book, to see if I recognized any names or addresses. Didn\u2019t find one, although I came across a bunch of wolf photos in the desk drawer in your guest room.\u201d</p><p>Tessa\u2019s heart hitched. How could she explain how she and her brother were incurably obsessed with wolves? She shrugged, then rinsed the plates.</p><p>He took a deep breath, studying her, as if he was trying to catch her in a lie. Of course, she only felt that way because she was trying to hide her reaction.</p><p>\u201cI saw the paintings Michael did, too. Wonderful job. So where were the pictures taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt wolf reserves or zoos. Michael and I do a fair amount of traveling so we can paint or photograph what we need to.\u201d She stuck the dishes into the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cAh. And the books on wolf behavior?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, and cleared her throat, hating the way her hands had grown clammy. Hunter probably had some hang-ups, too, so what was the big deal? \u201cSome good wolf photos in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Michael\u2019s paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wanted to see Hunter\u2019s expression, but she busied herself with scrubbing the cooking pan. Did he believe her? She didn\u2019t think she sounded believable. And she didn\u2019t think he sounded like he was convinced.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the old-photo with the guy and the woman and baby?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He was so coolly noncommittal, it was almost as though he was hiding his own emotions. Which didn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cIt was with the wolf pictures. Caught my eye because it was sepia, and I wondered if it was an old-time photo of a wolf. So it seemed out of place with the others. Who\u2019s the family pictured?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why would he ask? She didn\u2019t know any guy who was interested in genealogy. \u201cMy great-grandfather, great-grandmother, and grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Unblinking, he stared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou seem a little surprised.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter joined her at the sink and massaged her shoulders with deep, comforting strokes and she relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI thought he looked like someone my great-grandfather panned for gold with. But I must be mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a photo of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly of Seth Greystoke and my great-grandfather, but the photo\u2019s gone\u2014lost in a fire. But he couldn\u2019t have been your relation.\u201d Hunter straightened. \u201cAbout this situation with the sheriff, I\u2019ll take care of this, man to man.\u201d The dark threat to his voice indicated he meant it.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t want to be on the receiving end of Hunter and the sheriff\u2019s confrontation. She relaxed a little. \u201cMy great-grandfather\u2019s name was Jeremiah Cramer. So you\u2019re right about them not being the same man. As far as the sheriff goes, if you don\u2019t tell him everything, I will. Had Ashton been drinking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hunter gave her shoulders a warm squeeze and headed for the living room.</p><p>\u201cWait! Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo board up the window.\u201d He tossed on Michael\u2019s field jacket, the ski cap, and gloves and was gone.</p><p>The frying pan could wait. She rushed to get her snow boots, parka, and gloves on. Why in the world would Ashton have shot at Hunter twice if he\u2019d been sober? Was he the one who was seeing Bethany behind Michael\u2019s back? He had plenty of opportunities and motive, jealous that he couldn\u2019t get a girl like Michael could and that her brother had become so popular because of his artwork.</p><p>Tessa hurried outside to help Hunter, when she saw a figure dressed in a gray parka trudging and slipping along the winding road headed in their direction. She stared at him, trying to make out who the familiar figure was.</p><p>Hunter cast a glance in the man\u2019s direction. \u201cYou sure have a lot of visitors way out here as isolated as it is and as bad as the weather has gotten.\u201d</p> <p>He began pounding a plank over the broken window.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014oh, hell, it\u2019s Rourke.\u201d</p><p>Hunter paused and looked at her. \u201cRourke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe newspaper reporter.\u201d</p><p>Hunter raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cAn old boyfriend from high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom high school.\u201d He pounded another piece of wood in place.</p><p>Tessa grabbed the next board for him. \u201cHe\u2019s looking into Michael\u2019s claim someone else was seeing Bethany. At least if he wants dinner with me, he will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA date.\u201d He took the plank from her and nailed it up.</p><p>\u201cI told him to use his investigative skills and find out something useful concerning Michael\u2019s innocence.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and studied her. \u201cSo he believes Michael\u2019s innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He just wants dinner.\u201d</p><p>Hunter smiled, but quickly masked the expression and took the next board from her.</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in Rourke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s simply a means to an end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHo!\u201d Rourke hollered from a distance after picking himself up from the roadway a second time.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rourke! What brings you way out here?\u201d Not wanting to get her hopes up too much, she prayed he\u2019d found something that would help her brother\u2019s case.</p><p>His cheeks red, Rourke drew closer and wiped his runny nose on a handkerchief. He gave Hunter a long, hard look, although Hunter continued nailing up boards and didn\u2019t spare Rourke another glance.</p><p>\u201cI worried about you being alone in this ice storm. An eighteen-wheeler plowed into an electric transformer. I tried calling, but ice storms brought the phone lines down. I see you had some storm damage.\u201d He looked around. \u201cGood thing you were able to hire a handyman to board up the window this quickly. Guess someone dropped him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your pickup?\u201d Tessa asked, not wanting to explain who Hunter was when she wasn\u2019t even sure herself.</p><p>Besides, if Rourke knew the story, he would propose taking Hunter into town to see the doctor and get him away from her, then where would she be? Probably Rourke would offer to stay with her in Hunter\u2019s place, as if he could be the kind of help Hunter was. She imagined Rourke had never cooked anything over an open fire for one. And replace a window? Never. He\u2019d offer to keep her warm during the night, but she wasn\u2019t interested in him like that.</p><p>\u201cMy truck\u2019s up that way.\u201d Rourke waved in the direction, and then looked Hunter over really good. \u201cSlid off the road and couldn\u2019t get any traction. Figured since you were alone, I\u2019d stay with you until the ice melted.\u201d</p><p>How could she say no, if he was stuck? But she still didn\u2019t want to explain Hunter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you get on your way.\u201d Hunter\u2019s voice was low and gruff.</p><p>Rourke was sure to not like Hunter\u2019s suggestion. He raised his brows, and then turned to Tessa. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside. I\u2019m chilled to the bone. I see you have a fire going.\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked back at Hunter. He still needed to nail up three more boards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d he said to her.</p><p>She waffled. She\u2019d promised to help, but she didn\u2019t want reporter Rourke snooping through her things if she told him to go inside and get warmed by the fire while she helped Hunter.</p><p>He cast her a glance. \u201cI\u2019m nearly done. Go, Tessa. I\u2019ll be inside in a minute for another cup of hot coffee. If you wouldn\u2019t mind making us some more.\u201d</p><p>Rourke glowered at Hunter.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said to Lord Hunter. She felt she should be curtseying to him. Handyman, hell. He was the rooster that ruled the henhouse. Her henhouse.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Tessa,\u201d Rourke said, as he escorted her to the front door, his hand on the small of her back, \u201cyou let people walk all over you too much. Take the hired hand, for instance, he should be doing the job you\u2019re paying him, and you shouldn\u2019t be in this awful weather helping him.\u201d</p><p>She thought she heard Hunter growl when Rourke touched her, and she could have strangled Rourke for speaking loudly enough for Hunter to hear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Rourke continued, as he walked inside with Tessa and shut the door. \u201cYou\u2019re by yourself and the company this guy works for just let him off at your place? What if he\u2019s some kind of criminal? You never know who these companies hire. He could be on a prison work release program.\u201d</p><p>Tessa swore Hunter was pounding the nails into the boards twice as fast as before while she warmed up by the fire and peeled off her gloves. \u201cDid you find anything concerning Michael\u2019s case that will help?\u201d</p><p>Rourke removed his gloves and shoved them in his coat pockets, and then pulled off his wet parka in front of the fireplace. \u201cYeah, but it doesn\u2019t go any further than this room.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped to overdrive to hear Rourke\u2019s news.</p><p>He handed her his coat and rubbed his hands over the fire. Even in this weather, he was dressed in one of his impeccable gray suits. At least he was wearing sensible snow boots for the icy conditions. \u201cBethany was seeing some other guy.\u201d</p><p>Her heart nearly stopped. Maybe finally the break they needed. \u201cI knew it. Who was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t tell anyone else, right?\u201d</p><p>Hunter opened the door and looked from Rourke to Tessa. \u201cCoffee ready?\u201d</p><p>Jeez, Hunter, not now!</p><p>\u201cWho was Bethany seeing, Rourke?\u201d She hoped he wouldn\u2019t clam up with Hunter listening in.</p><p>Rourke\u2019s expression turned blank, and he shifted his attention to the fire. He shrugged. \u201cThe DA\u2019s office proved no one was seeing her.\u201d</p><p>Tessa could have shaken him and screamed bloody murder.</p><p>\u201cNice suit,\u201d Hunter said to Rourke, and then gave Tessa a knowing look. \u201cOn second thought, I\u2019ll check on your truck and see if I can move it.\u201d He headed back outside.</p><p>She hung up Rourke\u2019s coat and her own, and then set the pot of water on the fire, anything to busy herself so she wouldn\u2019t hurt Rourke. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is that guy? He doesn\u2019t act like a handyman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRourke, who was seeing Bethany besides Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said too much already. It doesn\u2019t matter. What\u2019s done is done. You\u2019ll never be able to prove Michael didn\u2019t murder her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho... was... seeing... her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff\u2019s son. But it can\u2019t leave this room, Tessa. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Ohmigod, she knew it. Her bones dissolving, she collapsed on the couch.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Tessa? I probably shouldn\u2019t have mentioned it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m all right.\u201d As right as could be expected to know her brother\u2019s best friend could be the murderer. Bastard. And how would they prove it when his father was the sheriff?</p><p>\u201cYou promise you won\u2019t confront Ashton about this, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hire someone really discreet to investigate it further.\u201d</p><p>Rourke sat next to her on the couch and patted her hand. \u201cWe can have dinner together now, right?\u201d</p><p>Dinner? Sheesh, one track mind. But she promised. She pulled her hand away from him.</p><p>\u201cSure, but there\u2019s no electricity so it would have to be some other evening.\u201d</p><p>Like a couple of months from now. Her mind flipped through different scenarios, remembering all the times Ashton had been to the house, smiling and joking with Bethany and Michael. Why hadn\u2019t Tessa noticed what was really going on between Ashton and Bethany? Maybe she had, but she hadn\u2019t wanted to admit it to herself.</p><p>Rourke waved at the fireplace. \u201cIt sounds like the water\u2019s ready for the coffee.\u201d</p><p>Still in disbelief about Ashton, she gathered her composure and rose from the couch. But then again, Ashton could have murdered Hunter last night. And he had been hunting with a rifle since he was too young to do so. Not that Bethany was killed that way, but it could prove Ashton was capable of committing murder, couldn\u2019t it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo who\u2019s this guy really who was fixing your window?\u201d Rourke asked.</p><p>Hunter stalked back inside, catching Rourke\u2019s question. \u201cTessa\u2019s lover,\u201d he said, with a smirk and the look of the devil sparkling in his eyes, his cheeks slightly red from the chill.</p><p>She could have socked him. Rourke\u2019s jaw couldn\u2019t have dropped any lower.</p> <p>\u201cHandyman, cook, personal masseur, whatever she needs me to be. So who else was Bethany seeing?\u201d</p><p>Rourke turned slightly green.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Hunter asked again, his voice threatening as he helped Tessa with the coffee mugs.</p><p>Rourke swallowed hard. \u201cAshton Wellington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I drove your truck into the driveway. But why don\u2019t you stay with Tessa for an hour or so while I take a walk in the woods.\u201d</p> <p>To investigate? Please, God, don\u2019t let Ashton be wandering in the woods armed again.</p><p>Rourke frowned and she knew it was because he didn\u2019t like Hunter ordering him about.</p><p>\u201cAs a favor to Tessa. I\u2019ll be searching for the stalker who\u2019s been breaking into her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalker?\u201d Rourke looked at Tessa.</p><p>\u201cHe stole my gun last night.\u201d</p><p>Rourke ran his hand through his wind-ruffled hair. \u201cSure, right.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter quickly drank a cup of coffee, kissed Tessa on the cheek, and gave her a sexy smile. If Rourke hadn\u2019t been here, she would have snagged Hunter\u2019s arm and made him kiss her on the lips like he really meant it\u2014like he had on the beach\u2014only this time proving for real she hadn\u2019t dreamed it. As if he read her innermost thoughts, he raised his brows slightly, dimples appearing in his cheeks as his smile broadened, and her cheeks blossomed with heat. Not just her face though as the heat soon spread all the way to her toes.</p><p>He winked, the cad. \u201cBe right back.\u201d Then he gave Rourke a quelling look as though he\u2019d better behave where Tessa was concerned, and stalked outside. She prayed he wouldn\u2019t run into Ashton again.</p><p>Rourke looked from Hunter to Tessa and frowned. \u201cWho the hell did you say he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoser beta male,\u201d Hunter grumbled under his breath as he headed deeper into the woods, the branches dipping under the weight of the icicles clinging to the pine needles.</p><p>At least he didn\u2019t have to worry about Tessa\u2019s interest in the man. He could tell she could barely stomach the guy as a lover.</p><p>So maybe Hunter had it all wrong. If the intruder\u2014the gray\u2014was only after Tessa, maybe the sheriff\u2019s son did the killing. That would solve everything. All Hunter had to do was prove it. But at least once he did, Ashton would go to prison for the murder, Michael could go free, end of Tessa\u2019s problem. As for the gray\u2014that\u2019s who he was hunting now.</p><p>He wondered too about the sepia picture of Seth and the woman and baby. Maybe it wasn\u2019t Seth. A werewolf couldn\u2019t have children with a human, and Tessa definitely wasn\u2019t a lupus garou. Or maybe the picture wasn\u2019t of her family like she thought. But why she would have it then\u2014</p><p>Gunshots rang out across the woods. Crazy hunters. Hunters. Hunter. He paused, trying to recall the rest of his name. Nothing. Damn it. His borrowed snow boots crunched on the frozen ground as the coastal pines shielded him some from the sleet. If he had been in his wolf coat, no one would hear his approach. But for now, he wanted them to see him coming so they didn\u2019t shoot him by accident.</p> <p>He narrowed the distance between him and the two shooters. The shorter, bearded one lowered his gun. \u201cHell, man, wearing a green field jacket makes you blend right in with the woods. You\u2019re supposed to be wearing orange so we don\u2019t shoot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a hunter.\u201d At least not the kind that used bullets, and normally he preferred blending in with his surroundings no matter the form he took. He guessed it was natural, instinctive.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, if you don\u2019t watch out, you\u2019ll be one of the hunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you move farther north?\u201d The way Hunter proposed the question, there would be no doubt he\u2019d issued an order.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you mind your own business?\u201d the taller of the two men said, sizing Hunter up.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there. Cool macho hunters. Tough guys. But neither was a match for him. Which made him wonder if a gang of thugs had gotten the better of him. Had to have\u2014or else he wouldn\u2019t have taken a dip in the Pacific.</p><p>\u201cPrivate property,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, owned mostly by the timber companies,\u201d the bearded of the two men said.</p><p>\u201cThis land is privately owned. And you don\u2019t have permission.\u201d</p><p>The two men cast each other looks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get permission and be back.\u201d The bearded man spit on the ground. \u201cIf you\u2019re still wandering through the woods, blending in like you do now...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be our fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappen to be a good friend of the local sheriff\u2019s.\u201d Hunter gave him a steely-eyed glower\u2014the same kind he would use during a wolf-to-wolf confrontation when he needed to make another back down, tuck tail, and leave. If that didn\u2019t work, he added, \u201cDon\u2019t think you want to go there.\u201d</p><p>The two men seemed a little ruffled at the revelation, or maybe it was the look he gave them that changed their minds as the one stamped ice off his boot, and the other fidgeted with his rifle. They finally cursed under their breaths, but headed north.</p><p>\u201cFind a place a good five miles\u2014at least\u2014from here to hunt,\u201d Hunter added.</p><p>They both glared at him and continued walking.</p><p>Hunter searched for clues to where the gray wolf had been, the trails he had taken, any evidence he had gotten into a vehicle that left tire tracks behind. Although as a wolf, the lupus garou could travel a great distance, his thick coat protecting him from the cold. Hunter located several paths the gray had walked, found where the agitated hunter had paced, snagged strands of gray fur on a couple of branches, rubbed his scent on several trees.</p><p>Was he a rogue or did he live with a pack? The fact he had a key to Tessa\u2019s place didn\u2019t fit. Was he someone she knew? Another one of Michael\u2019s friends? Or one of hers?</p><p>Not locating the intruder, Hunter assumed he was sleeping off his nighttime activities, and he would be back again tonight. What if Hunter moved Tessa somewhere else? Somewhere safe? But where? If he had a place, he could relocate her there. He didn\u2019t have a clue where it could be though.</p><p>\u201cHunter?\u201d Tessa hollered from deep in the woods.</p><p>Hell. Didn\u2019t he tell her to stay with Rourke at the house? He hurried toward her voice.</p><p>\u201cHunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Then he heard them. Two sets of footfalls. They had better be Rourke\u2019s and Tessa\u2019s.</p><p>When he saw them, the adrenaline rush began to drain off.</p><p>Rourke looked annoyed and out of breath.</p><p>Her frown fading, Tessa seemed guardedly relieved, her hair blowing in the breeze, her skin glowing with the cold, her full red lips pouting, begging to be kissed. \u201cI was so worried about you. We heard the gunfire and I told Rourke how Ashton had shot you. We thought maybe he\u2019d killed you this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake more than that to get rid of me. We couldn\u2019t have that now, could we? Not until I can at least locate Bethany\u2019s real murderer and put him behind bars.\u201d Hunter managed a smile as he wrapped his arm around Tessa and walked her back home.</p><p>She felt warm and soft and his thoughts shifted to dangerous notions of getting naked in bed with her. He attributed some of his feelings to wanting to claim her in front of her old high-school boyfriend. Some of his problem was just being attracted to the minx\u2014more than he thought he\u2019d ever been toward any woman, either human or lupus garou. He kept telling himself it was just because she\u2019d rescued him from the beach, and it was nothing more than appreciating the tender care she\u2019d given him. On the other hand, he might have often felt this way toward women. Hell, maybe he was a real Casanova.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the guy you\u2019re hiring to look into this?\u201d Rourke asked, his voice incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s an ex\u2013Navy SEAL.\u201d She looked up at Hunter with adoring eyes.</p><p>He thought she was playing her role a little too obviously.</p><p>\u201cA Navy SEAL?\u201d Rourke looked sick again.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She patted Hunter\u2019s arm. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell by the great shape he\u2019s in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he an ex\u2013Navy SEAL?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got tired of being away from home, the secret missions, unable to settle down and start a family, right, Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Rourke watched them like an investigative reporter looking for another juicy story.</p><p>Hunter sighed deep inside. He didn\u2019t like making up tales that were too far from the truth, but then again, what if his cover of being an ex\u2013Navy SEAL put the fear of God in the sheriff and his bad seed? It didn\u2019t hurt for Rourke to think so either. Hunter imagined the word would soon get out about his \u201cformer occupation\u201d since Rourke was a reporter. Hmm, then he would probably investigate him. One good thing about being an undercover operative\u2014Rourke couldn\u2019t learn anything.</p><p>\u201cHunter...\u201d Rourke waited for a last name.</p><p>Hunter knew only that he was a gray lupus garou. Wolf? Grey?</p><p>Grey. That rang a bell. Not quite right, but it would do.</p><p>\u201cGrey. And we haven\u2019t been properly introduced.\u201d</p><p>Tessa\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at Hunter and she missed a step. He tightened his hold on her. Wishing he had better news, he gave her a subtle shake of his head, warning her he didn\u2019t know for sure.</p><p>\u201cRourke Thornburg,\u201d the reporter offered and stuck his hand out.</p><p>Hunter gave his hand a firm shake, firm enough to let him know the power behind the man.</p><p>Rourke\u2019s eyes watered and he quickly pulled his hand away. Message received.</p><p>Tessa pursed her lips. \u201cDid you see the man who was shooting in the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were two of them. I told them to find game somewhere else, farther north.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey must have loved you,\u201d Rourke said, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t argue and moved along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t expect you to chase off all the idiot hunters in the area and risk them shooting you accidentally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re too close to your\u2014\u201d As soon as they came into view of the house, Hunter saw the back door standing wide open. He felt Tessa crumple slightly against him. Tightening his hold on her, he knew she wouldn\u2019t have left the house unlocked. The intruder was once again warning them he could come and go as he pleased. Maybe not such a beta after all.</p> <p>Rourke\u2019s chill-bitten cheeks instantly lost their red color. \u201cI saw you lock the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got a key.\u201d Tessa\u2019s voice shook.</p><p>Hunter gave her a reassuring squeeze, but until he could eliminate the threat, nothing he did would alleviate her concern and for good reason. The stalker was a real danger.</p><p>Rourke rubbed his gloved hands. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know. Ashton maybe. But whoever it was got in last night when I went to get firewood from the beach,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAshton?\u201d Rourke asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hunter said, not wanting Tessa to fear the wrong man. \u201cSomeone else. Wait here with Tessa. I\u2019ll check out the place first.\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked like she had a million questions to ask Hunter, but with Rourke here, the inquisition would have to wait. Hunter stalked inside, monitoring Rourke and Tessa\u2019s conversation as he checked the rooms.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about this?\u201d Rourke asked Tessa on the porch, sheltered from the sleet and wind.</p><p>\u201cHunter was here. He can take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter was here all night?\u201d Rourke asked, his tone not hiding his surprise or irritation.</p> <p>Hunter couldn\u2019t help smiling, figuring Tessa hadn\u2019t meant to let it slip. Good to let Rourke know he had no chance with her.</p><p>\u201cGood thing that he was.\u201d</p><p>Glad she felt he was an asset despite the fact he hadn\u2019t gotten rid of the stalker, Hunter smelled the bastard\u2019s scent where he had rolled on Tessa\u2019s sheets again. Hunter growled low.</p><p>\u201cAnd the window he was boarding up?\u201d Rourke asked Tessa.</p><p>\u201cThe intruder broke it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Tessa, you should never have said you were going to locate the killer and clear Michael\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Headed back down the hall, Hunter stopped in his footsteps, not believing Tessa would say that to a reporter. Then again, he could, as angry as he imagined she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cDid you print the interview?\u201d she asked, her voice accusing.</p> <p>\u201cDamn right I did. Best news I\u2019ve had in a long time. But I didn\u2019t think anyone else was guilty of the crime except your brother so I didn\u2019t believe there was anything to worry about. If I had thought differently, I would never have printed that story.\u201d</p><p>Hunter wanted to kill the reporter.</p><p>\u201cAll clear,\u201d Hunter said, rejoining them on the back patio. He gave both Tessa and Rourke a hard look. \u201cLooks like nothing\u2019s been disturbed.\u201d At least as far as he would let Tessa know for now. The gray had returned to find out where Hunter had slept for the night and returned to mark his claim to Tessa. Sorry to disappoint him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about an interview?\u201d</p><p>Tessa swore Hunter had the hearing of a cat, although she had hoped he hadn\u2019t heard what Rourke revealed about the interview. \u201cI was angry.\u201d Not that she felt she had any need to explain the way she felt to Hunter.</p><p>Did he remember anything more about his past? She knew Grey wasn\u2019t his real name. Not if the way he had shaken his head at her earlier was any indication of the truth of the matter. She only wished Rourke would go away soon so she could ask Hunter what else he had recalled and why he was so certain the intruder wasn\u2019t Ashton.</p><p>A shiver crawled up her spine. She felt she could deal with knowing it was Ashton, but if it was a total stranger... No, it had to be someone she knew because he had a key. But still, not knowing who made it more frightening.</p><p>Rourke pulled off his wet coat and handed it to Tessa. \u201cI\u2019m staying for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped. Now, she remembered why the guy had been an on-again/off-again boyfriend in her youth. He decided things for her, which were not in her best interests. She meant to remind him the electricity was off, but Hunter cut in.</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Why don\u2019t you stay the night, too?\u201d</p><p>Tessa glared at Hunter. Of all the damned nerve!</p><p>Ignoring her threatening look, Hunter continued, \u201cThe roads are too slick. You might not get very much farther down the road and be in the same predicament. If you got injured, we wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth gaped open. The thing was, Hunter was right. But whose house was it anyway? Shouldn\u2019t she have a say?</p><p>For the first time since the two men had met, Rourke seemed to change his attitude about Hunter. He gave him a serious nod. She could tell he was damned thrilled to get Lord Hunter\u2019s invitation for the slumber party.</p><p>She hung up Rourke\u2019s coat on a wooden peg near the back door. \u201cYou know, guys, it would be nice to ask the hostess her opinion. The electricity\u2019s still not on and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix the food,\u201d Hunter said, and before she could object further, he added, \u201cRourke won\u2019t mind cleaning the dishes afterwards.\u201d He gave Rourke a conspirator\u2019s wink.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Rourke said, jumping in, ensuring he got a bed for the night.</p><p>\u201cI might not have enough food to eat for the three of us, especially since we have to cook so primitively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a tenderloin roast in the freezer. Looked to be big enough for the three of us.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at Hunter. \u201cWhat if I was saving that for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you another. A couple more.\u201d</p><p>Hell, he didn\u2019t even have the clothes on his back. How was he going to replenish her fridge?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you another, too,\u201d Rourke said, cheerfully.</p><p>She groaned inwardly. She wasn\u2019t winning this battle. But she realized Hunter wasn\u2019t worried about Rourke\u2019s welfare, so much as he was about hers. Her irritation melted some.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Rourke said, taking a seat on the couch, \u201cI\u2019m an only child, Tessa has a brother. What about you, Hunter? Have any siblings?\u201d</p><p>Hunter cast Tessa a look, and then started working on building up the dwindling fire. \u201cA sister.\u201d</p><p>Ohmigod, he remembered who he was? Maybe he did have enough money to buy her another roast. But did he have a girlfriend or wife?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you around town before. Where did the two of you hook up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beach,\u201d both Hunter and Tessa said at the same time.</p><p>Rourke laughed. \u201cFigures, being he\u2019s a Navy SEAL. Ex\u2013Navy SEAL, rather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Tessa said, under her breath. Having Rourke stay the evening when it was barely afternoon was going to make for an incredibly long day and night. \u201cI suppose I have to feed everyone lunch also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about tuna fish sandwiches?\u201d Hunter suggested.</p><p>Jeez, when did he take an inventory of her food?</p><p>\u201cThen you can make a list of all the men who have been in the house over the last few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Michael\u2019s friends,\u201d she said, spearing Hunter a dark look.</p><p>\u201cAny male, Tessa, who has been in the house for the last few months. Deliverymen, repairmen, anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld boyfriends,\u201d she said, sarcastically as she proceeded to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYeah, all of those, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them should have had a key to the place.\u201d She yanked two cans of tuna fish out of the cabinet.</p><p>The doorbell rang and her heart hitched. Rourke announced, \u201cSheriff\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Tessa accidentally dropped the can opener on the kitchen floor and swore under her breath. She\u2019d hoped the bad weather would keep him at bay a while longer.</p><p>She hurried into the living room, but Hunter was already nose to nose with the sheriff at the front door.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>HUNTER GLOWERED EVERY BIT AS FEROCIOUSLY AT THE sheriff as he did back, but he couldn\u2019t quit thinking about Tessa and her interview with that jackass reporter. How could Rourke have printed her threat? What an imbecile.</p><p>Rourke was pretty rattled\u2014he\u2019d used her interview and now someone had broken into her house. Too late for regrets. The damage was done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sheriff Wellington,\u201d the man said, who looked like an older version of Ashton, same blond hair, only his was graying at the temples, and the same blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who destroyed my son\u2019s rifle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshton must have been mistaken, Sheriff. After he shot me, he was so shaken that he might have killed me, he dropped the rifle over the cliff side. It\u2019s probably still there, if anyone wants to chance climbing down to get it.\u201d Although Hunter had thrown it far enough, the rifle butt cracked on the rocks, and then the weapon flipped into the briny sea.</p><p>The sheriff glanced at Tessa with murder in his eyes. Hunter steeled his back, fighting the urge to show the sheriff how much he didn\u2019t like his posturing. But then the sheriff caught sight of Rourke. His gaze quickly shifted to the truck parked out front. Recognition dawning? Yep, reporter here looking for another story.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t shoot you.\u201d The sheriff\u2019s voice was so harsh, he sounded like a lupus garou trying to persuade another of his mistake.</p><p>Hunter couldn\u2019t help but admire that aspect of him. Definitely alpha material. Hunter reached for his sweatshirt sleeve and intended to yank it up, but the sheriff raised his hand and stopped him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s say it happened like you said. What were you doing wandering around in the dark?\u201d</p><p>Like that was a crime? He wanted to tell the sheriff it was none of his business and would have if he\u2019d been on his own property. But since he didn\u2019t know where his own property was located, he acquiesced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGathering firewood.\u201d Hunter motioned to the fireplace. \u201cThat\u2019s our only source of heat for the moment.

With the lines down and my Escort unable to navigate in the icy conditions, we would never have been able to get help for him.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff\u2019s eyes bulged. He rubbed his chin and looked like he\u2019d finally been put in his place. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter Grey, Tessa\u2019s boyfriend. Tell Ashton to hunt somewhere else from now on.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff narrowed his eyes and looked like he could shoot Hunter himself for telling him what to do, especially concerning his son. \u201cIf you\u2019re Tessa\u2019s boyfriend, why weren\u2019t you at the trial, giving her moral support?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been away,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cJust got in late yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at Rourke, then warned Hunter, \u201cWatch yourself. The community\u2019s had enough bad publicity over Michael\u2019s criminal activities. Don\u2019t let me hear that you\u2019re causing any more trouble.\u201d</p><p>Hunter wanted to retort that as long as he didn\u2019t keep Ashton\u2019s company, he would be fine, but he kept his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cHunter\u2019s a celebrity,\u201d Rourke proudly exclaimed, his chest puffed up twice its size.</p><p>All eyes turned toward him.</p><p>He raised his brows and smiled like he had the greatest news of the century. \u201cHe\u2019s an ex\u2013Navy SEAL. You probably noticed the great shape he\u2019s in.\u201d</p> <p>The sheriff\u2019s narrowed eyes grew rounder.</p><p>Rourke nodded. \u201cYep, a real celebrity in our sleepy little community.\u201d</p><p>Her expression still fierce, Tessa motioned to the sheriff. \u201cTell him about the intruder.\u201d</p><p>Hunter hadn\u2019t planned to mention the gray. He would take care of the lupus garou. But he didn\u2019t have much choice now. \u201cThe guy broke into Tessa\u2019s place twice and knocked out Michael\u2019s window the one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not suggesting\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head. \u201cNo, Sheriff. A man broke in, but it wasn\u2019t Ashton.\u201d</p><p>Tessa folded her arms. \u201cThe guy stole my gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFile a report at the office when you have time.\u201d The sheriff gave Hunter a warning look. \u201cHeed what I say, Mr. Grey. Watch your step. I keep a safe district.\u201d</p> <p>Right. That\u2019s why Michael is in jail, the killer is on the loose, your son is shooting innocent people in the middle of the night, and someone\u2019s stalking Tessa.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Bethany Wade was your son\u2019s lover behind Michael\u2019s back?\u201d Hunter asked casually, watching to see the effect the news had on him. Did the sheriff already know? Or was he as clueless as everyone else?</p><p>Rourke\u2019s skin turned colorless. Tessa appeared just as pale. The sheriff\u2019s expression grew crimson, and he looked like his head was ready to explode. Hunter wasn\u2019t sure if that meant the sheriff knew or not. To his credit, the sheriff didn\u2019t say anything, whipped around, stalked off down the walk toward the patrol car, slipped on the ice, landed spread eagle, and swore a few choice words. Hunter smiled and closed the door only to face Rourke and Tessa\u2019s angry expressions.</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? He needs to be aware his son isn\u2019t the angel he appears to be. If he even appears to be that.\u201d</p><p>Tessa groaned. \u201cYou just made an enemy of the only man in the county who can make your stay\u2014and mine\u2014a living hell.\u201d</p><p>Rourke ran his hands through his hair and collapsed on the sofa. \u201cYou\u2019ve really done it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you were here, Rourke. I\u2019m sure the sheriff would have made more of a scene otherwise,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I think. You should\u2019ve told the sheriff you were a Navy SEAL, Hunter.\u201d Rourke gave him a devious smile. \u201cHe listens to that kind of talk. Set him back a peg or two. If he thought he could bully you, he lost his nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but according to the rumor mill, the sheriff\u2019s known to hire ex-cons to get his point across,\u201d Tessa warned.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should hang a sign out that says ex\u2013Navy SEAL lives here.\u201d Hunter feigned annoyance as he headed into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey, I imagine you\u2019re used to keeping your former occupation secret, but for now, I\u2019d say it could save your ass.\u201d Rourke followed him into the kitchen and cast him a warm grin, as if he was honored to be on Hunter\u2019s good side.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hurt. The sheriff will tell Ashton for sure. He won\u2019t want his only son getting hurt if Ashton thought to mess with you again,\u201d Tessa agreed.</p><p>Hunter opened one of the cans of tuna fish on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sakes, let me do that. I can at least make lunch.\u201d She pulled a jar of mayonnaise out of the fridge.</p><p>\u201cAt least if he calls in heavy muscle, they won\u2019t want to mess with an ex\u2013Navy SEAL either.\u201d Rourke grabbed the jug of milk from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cUnless they have something to prove. Badge of honor, best one of the government\u2019s finest,\u201d Tessa warned.</p><p>Hunter leaned against the counter and watched Tessa poke a butter knife into the mayonnaise jar. Her hips wiggled slightly as she worked on the sandwiches, which made his body tighten with need.</p><p>Attempting to get his mind off her sweet ass, he thought about his supposed Navy SEAL training. He had learned a few maneuvers over the centuries that could help him deal with just about any scenario, which he could pass off as Navy SEAL expertise. Some martial arts training, taught by some of the best, too. At least he thought that\u2019s where he learned all his lethal moves as a human. And why he remembered that but not his last name, he hadn\u2019t a clue.</p><p>Tessa finished making sandwiches and they sat down to eat, but all Hunter could think of was retiring to bed with her. The way she pushed her hair out of her face, licked her lips, smiled, raised her brows at him in question, made him want her all the more. Not that his wanting to go to bed with her only had to do with the craving he had for her\u2014to get along in a human\u2019s world, lupus garous adjusted to daytime activities and slept part of the night, since they still participated in nighttime activities. Which meant naps during the day were often a necessity. But napping with her was even a greater necessity.</p><p>After they ate lunch, Hunter snagged Tessa\u2019s hand, the heat from her touch making him wish he knew whether he had a mate or not all over again. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you clean up, Rourke, while Tessa and I take a nap? We didn\u2019t sleep very well last evening. You can pull guard duty for now. I\u2019ll be staying up some of the night to watch for this guy\u2019s return. I figure he\u2019ll be lurking in the woods nearby.\u201d</p><p>Initially, Rourke looked annoyed that Hunter was taking Tessa to bed. But when Hunter mentioned guard duty, recognition reflected in Rourke\u2019s gray eyes and his expression turned to concern.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course. I don\u2019t have all the training you do, but I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>Hunter was pretty sure no one would mess with them during the day. \u201cJust holler if anyone intrudes. I\u2019ll come running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I can do that.\u201d</p><p>Hunter stalked toward Tessa\u2019s bedroom, hauling her with him. Her hand tightened on his as she rushed to keep up with him.</p><p>\u201cAre you in a hurry?\u201d she asked, her words laced with amusement.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a tired old dog. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself. A sleepy cat maybe, but a tired old dog?\u201d She smiled up at him, her sparkling green eyes and shiny red hair a tantalizing combination. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cat?\u201d He chuckled, slipping his fingers through her silky strands. \u201cSounds like we could get into quite a tangle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019d come out on top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn top? Not underneath?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but her cheeks turned crimson. \u201cI meant as in winning.\u201d</p><p>When they walked into the bedroom, she stared at her floral sheets thrown in a bundle on the floor. \u201cHe did this?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Hunter had forgotten he had removed the sheets. \u201cNo. I did. I\u2019m sorry, Tessa. I didn\u2019t want to mention it, but the bed smells like him.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew huge. \u201cHe got into my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any other sheets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But he really got into my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, he did.\u201d The bastard.</p><p>She pulled out a fresh set of blue and white striped sheets from the linen cabinet, and Hunter helped her remake the bed. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d she asked, her voice threaded with worry.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sick bastard.\u201d</p><p>She paused as they were pulling the blue velvet comforter back in place. \u201cIt\u2019s someone I know, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But maybe not anyone you know well. He might be someone you met just once, but I believe he\u2019s fixated on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stalker?\u201d</p><p>Worse. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him tonight.\u201d He yanked off the sweatshirt, and Tessa\u2019s eyes shifted to his bandaged arm.</p><p>The wound felt like it had nearly healed, but the bandage sported dried blood so it looked worse than it was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better change that bandage.\u201d She reached out to touch his arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wrapped his hand around hers. \u201cCome, sleep. I can\u2019t function properly tonight without getting more rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you remember about yourself?\u201d</p><p>She looked so hopeful, he hated to disappoint her. \u201cJust bits and pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really remember your last name, do you?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head and began pulling her turtleneck up, his desire to see more of her wreaking havoc with his need to keep his distance. Her smile was contagious and although he thought she might try to stop him, considering the way she\u2019d been dressed the night before, she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember if you\u2019re married or have a significant other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry, Tessa. I wish I did, but those memories still elude me.\u201d However, he hoped that the fact he couldn\u2019t recall, meant he didn\u2019t have a mate.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s brows raised. Yeah, she was wondering where he was going with this. Not that he didn\u2019t wonder himself enough for the both of them. He stared at her white lace bra, her nipples darkened against the fabric, mesmerizing him.</p><p>She unbuckled her belt and slid her jeans down. Teasingly tiny, white lace bikini panties showed off a wealth of silky skin. Every inch kissable.</p> <p>He wanted to take her right then and there. But he couldn\u2019t. Not until he knew for certain whether he was mated. Until that time, he was free to pleasure human women. But once he was mated with a lupus garou, the bond was for a lifetime. No divorce. No ending the mating unless one of them died.</p><p>He pulled Tessa into bed, determined to bury his lustful intentions until he knew for certain whether he was attached or not. Covering them with her comforter, he held Tessa tight, her back against his chest, breathed in the smell of the wind in her hair, the fragrant scent of her skin, her soft heat captivating him. Although he only planned to sleep, her titillating touch aroused a throbbing need he couldn\u2019t fulfill.</p><p>Tessa saw the longing in Hunter\u2019s gaze, knew he wanted her. And she wanted him also. But she loved the way he was reluctant to take the relationship further until he knew for sure if he had someone. Maybe he wasn\u2019t attached, and with the way his memory was returning, it might not be long before he knew the truth.</p><p>She melted in his heated embrace, snuggling closer. She swore he let out a muffled groan against the back of her head as he tightened his hold on her, his hard and aroused body fitting snuggly against hers. She had never felt so protected in her life, and she didn\u2019t want the sensation to stop.</p><p>\u201cRourke really respects you,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have many friends, mostly because he always sees a story in anything anyone does and it either irritates people or makes them nervous, which causes them to shy away from him. But he really likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm, well, I can tell you like him, too. He might not be of the same caliber as your rough and tumble Navy SEAL friends but he\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me\u2014as a boyfriend. But as a friend for you. That\u2019s why you invited him to stay.\u201d</p><p>Hunter grunted. \u201cTo watch over you while I look for the intruder. I couldn\u2019t leave you alone unprotected, worried he\u2019d sneak into the house while I was searching for him outside.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what she thought, but she wanted to hear him say it. She kissed his arm. \u201cNight.\u201d Even if it was midday.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t a Navy SEAL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but you are now. And the way you react to situations, cook like you\u2019re used to living out of doors, have such an uncanny awareness of danger and how to deal with it, you must have trained in military or police operations. So you might as well be a Navy SEAL. It fits with the beach scene anyway. Maybe you\u2019re really an Army Ranger or Special Forces or a member of a specialized Swat Team.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould to me if I were trained in one of the other fields.\u201d</p> <p>She turned her head, his lips curved, and she gave him a small smile. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t suit our first meeting half as well.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand over her hair, then combed the strands with a silky touch. \u201cDo you think a Navy SEAL would have ended up where I did? Flat on my back, half dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were flat on your stomach, half dead.\u201d She sighed, loving the feel of his fingers sweeping through her hair and wished they could take the relationship further. \u201cOnly a Navy SEAL or some other highly trained professional in survival tactics would probably have endured the ordeal.\u201d</p><p>His hand drifted to her breast, his touch blazing a trail of heat across her skin.</p><p>Her nipple tightened, begging for release from the lacy bra. She\u2019d never known anyone as sexy as Hunter, so sure of himself, but sensitive, too.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew for certain if I had a significant other, Tessa.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her and growled. \u201cYou\u2019re way too intriguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I hope you\u2019re unattached, Hunter.\u201d She closed her eyes and breathed in his masculine scent, coveting his heated embrace. And I hope you plan to stick around for a long, long time. But she feared the way her luck was going lately, there wasn\u2019t much chance at that. Even now she envisioned a wife and a couple of small kids sitting by a fire, waiting for Hunter to return home. She groaned inwardly.</p><p>No way did she ever want to be a home breaker like her father had been.</p><p>After he\u2019d been sleeping for a couple of hours, Hunter\u2019s fingers swept across Tessa\u2019s breast. Just a whisper of the most tantalizing touch. Was he asleep? Oblivious to the way he was sending her heart into overdrive? Making her wet in anticipation? Her nipple tingled, but she didn\u2019t move a muscle, listening, trying to discern if he was awake and had felt her up on purpose, or was asleep and it was just an accident.</p><p>His hand rested on her breast this time, the palm in contact with her taut nipple, his caress tormenting her. He was awake, the cad. Then he moved his hand lower, rubbing his thumb across the sensitive nub in a slow, sensual caress.</p><p>Lulled into sweet ecstasy, she didn\u2019t respond, afraid he\u2019d stop if he knew she was awake. He stroked her breast, and then as if the sensation couldn\u2019t have been more erotic, he slid the lacy cup down, exposing her. She took in a sharp breath. His hand molded to her breast, and she wanted to scream, \u201cTake me, oh godly one!\u201d She didn\u2019t even know him! He didn\u2019t even know himself, for heaven\u2019s sakes.</p><p>Did he remember he wasn\u2019t attached to another woman? Please, make it so. She took his roaming hand and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were pretending to be asleep,\u201d he said, the timbre of his voice dark and seductive.</p><p>Her body heated with chagrin. Caught in the act. She smiled to herself. \u201cI thought you were asleep, at first.\u201d</p><p>She was dying to ask if there was someone special in his life, but was afraid to learn the truth\u2014that maybe he still didn\u2019t know, but he was too horny to care, or he did have someone, but he was still too horny to care.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise anything,\u201d Hunter warned, pressing a kiss against her hair with a feather-light touch.</p><p>His action sent a shiver of expectation down her spine. \u201cAre you free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one.\u201d</p><p>She let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t promise you anything long term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take whatever I can get,\u201d she teased, but she was afraid he might have heard the regret in her voice. She tried again. \u201cReally slim pickings around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been with a man in a long time,\u201d Hunter said, as if he knew her whole blamed, pathetic lifestyle.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t lie to him. She figured he would see right through her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to be gentle. It\u2019s been a good long while for me, too,\u201d he admitted, his voice already husky, his fingers encircling her breast in a slow caress.</p><p>As much of a hunk as he was, she didn\u2019t believe it for a minute. But forget gentle. She wanted him to devour her whole.</p><p>His hand shifted to her shoulder, and he rubbed her with a tender motion, as if he was waiting for her to make up her mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to be gentle, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>His lusty chuckle heated her blood. Boy, had she found a pile of treasure when she went to gather wood on the beach yesterday afternoon.</p><p>Hunter unfastened her bra, and then slid the straps down her arms, every move he made deliciously sensual. No man had ever undressed her before, and the sensation sent a delectable heat skittering through her. He brushed aside her hair, exposing her neck, then licked the super-sensitive skin, his warm breath fanning her. He turned her around, his gaze hot with wanting. And then he bent his head, pressed his mouth lightly against hers, his fingers tracing her arms downward, the skin tingling with his action.</p><p>She placed her hands against his naked chest, noting the tension in his hard, lean muscles, his skin tan, no longer bruised or cut, the smattering of dark, curly hair trailing to the waistband of the sweats\u2014 enticingly provocative.</p><p>Although the room was icy cold, his touch heated an internal flame so white hot, she wanted to ditch the covers and expose every delectable inch of him for her viewing pleasure. But he made no move to pull the covers aside, instead dipping his fingers underneath the top edge of her panties, teasing her skin, back and forth.</p><p>He brushed his lips against her mouth, making her want more, and drew his fingers upward across her stomach, blazing a trail to her breast. All her bones dissolved as she melted to his touch, his fingers kneading her swollen breast. A wet ache between her legs commenced, and she tugged at the drawstrings on his sweats. Not waiting for his reaction, she jerked the pants down to his thighs.</p><p>His arousal sprang free and he half-groaned or growled. And lost control of his slow and measured seduction, as if she\u2019d finally given her mountain man permission to ravish her like a woman in need and not treat her like she was a delicate flower.</p><p>He kicked off the sweats and slid her panties down her hips and lower, his tongue penetrating her mouth, conquering, decisive, as if the invisible bars of the cage holding him back had vanished. Pressing his knee between her thighs, he opened her to him, his fingers slipping downward through her short curly hairs, all the way to her womanly folds. His smoldering expression changed subtly, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, she was ready for him. Had been ever since he\u2019d pinned her to the beach.</p><p>His mouth moved to her throat, and he licked a trail to her breast. Then his warm lips latched onto her nipple, suckling, his fingers dipping deep inside her folds. A shiver of need streaked through her, and she arched her pelvis against him, never having wanted sex this bad, or for it to feel so damned good.</p><p>His wet fingers stroked her swollen nub, and she grabbed handfuls of his dark hair, his heated breath on her neck as he kissed her there. Every touch felt more erotic than the last and her nerve endings drew in the sensations.</p> <p>She wanted him inside her, stoking her needs while fulfilling his own, but she didn\u2019t want him to stop what he was doing either. Oh, what the hell. If he didn\u2019t like that she wanted more, that was his problem. \u201cI want you inside of me, now.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his leg between hers again, raising up until he connected with her mound and rubbed. She was ready to burst into flames. She groaned, well, kind of whimpered.</p><p>Which seemed to spur him on. His fingers worked faster, stroking her, drawing her to the peak, while his mouth did sweet things to one breast and then the other, her fingers digging into his shoulders, then releasing and sweeping down his firm sides. His hot tongue tasted, teased, his teeth grazed her reverently, sending delicious chills exploding across her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou smell of peaches and cream, and an enticing scent that\u2019s all you,\u201d he murmured heavily against her cheek.</p><p>Before she could respond, his fingers brought her to the edge of the world and she came, shattered into a million sparks of wonderment, the first time she had ever felt such a sensation, her insides quaking with ripples of orgasm.</p> <p>Her heart thumped rapidly, her breath shallow as he took her in his arms, his eyes smoldering with hunger.</p><p>\u201cYou still want me?\u201d he asked, his voice raspy and tight.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d was all she could manage. If he quit now, she\u2019d strangle him.</p><p>He laughed under his breath and pulled her onto her back. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to brag, but you\u2019re pretty small, and I\u2019m pretty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuge,\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>His amber eyes and delicious mouth smiled. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d warn you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAppreciate the warning, but you\u2019re wasting time.\u201d She still couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that any second now, he would just vanish in a puff of mist, like a genie recalled to his bottle.</p><p>He captured her mouth with his, not slowly, or sweetly, but like he hadn\u2019t had a woman in a very long time, and he couldn\u2019t wait a second longer. He smelled of the wind in the pines, and hot-blooded male, his gaze clouded with lust. His hands captured her hair and squeezed.</p><p>Her heart couldn\u2019t beat any faster as he centered himself between her legs. She might have found her treasure on the beach in the form of the hunky naked guy, but Hunter was about to plunder his own treasure as he eased inside of her.</p><p>No matter how much Hunter had tried to deny his craving for the woman, he knew it would come to this. Thankfully, he had been able to control his wolf\u2019s desires long enough to remember he didn\u2019t have a mate. Still, hooking up with Tessa was not a good idea. She was too damned needy and should have had a decent guy who would care for her, one who wanted to stick it out for the long run. Someone who wouldn\u2019t hunt on moon-filled nights in a wolf\u2019s coat.</p><p>He eased deeper into her tight sheath and began massaging her breasts to loosen her up. He could tell she hadn\u2019t been with a man in a very long time and the notion pleased him. He was even more convinced than before\u2014if she had been a gray lupus garou, he would never let her go.</p><p>Her sweet, musky scent had all but undone him when he first stroked her breast, triggering her arousal. And thinking of the way she had touched him\u2014rubbed his muscles with such finesse, cleaned the salt from his skin with tenderness, covered his injuries with the faintest of touches\u2014every sensation was permanently etched into his brain.</p><p>He embedded himself inside her to the hilt and slowly began to withdraw. She smiled in a way that would heat any man\u2019s blood. What was worse, he already wanted her to smile at only him like that. The problem? Not enough lupus garou females to satisfy the male population.</p><p>He meant to draw out the lovemaking, take it slow and easy the first time with her. But she combed her fingers through his hair in such a sensual way, and then her fingers drew higher and began to massage his scalp, he felt he would lose his seed before he could make it very much farther.</p> <p>He plunged in deeper, harder, fulfilling his raw need to conquer, to possess her. And she was worthy of being his, but he would not go there.</p><p>He watched her expression as he pumped deep inside of her, her sparkling eyes observing him, challenging him to give her everything he had. He felt the end coming and with one last hard thrust, he filled her with his seed. Sweet heaven, she was a gift from the gods.</p><p>Sexually satiated, he kissed her upturned lips, and then rolled onto his back, pulling her into his arms, loving the way her soft body molded against his hardness. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too rough, was I?\u201d he asked, his voice raspy against her ear, although it was a little too late for asking.</p><p>She shivered and touched his extended nipple. \u201cJust perfect. I\u2019ve never taken a nap that\u2019s been so\u2014stimulatingly satisfying.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cHealth experts say a nap a day can add years to your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it. Well, especially while napping with you.\u201d</p><p>He could have snuggled with her until nightfall, although they managed to sleep for an hour, but Rourke began stirring in the living room. More than stirring. He was banging around, probably tired of Tessa and Hunter \u201csleeping\u201d together.</p><p>Hunter gave a ragged sigh and kissed the top of Tessa\u2019s head. \u201cLet\u2019s get up. I need to gather more firewood and start that roast if it\u2019s going to be ready by dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be careful tonight when you go looking for the thief, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you and Rourke stay together and don\u2019t leave the house this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember everything about your life? Where you\u2019re from, where you were born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s coming back in annoying fragments.\u201d But he hoped he would soon remember what had happened to him before he ended up in the Pacific. Then he would take care of that little matter, too.</p><p>The tension ran high the rest of the evening. Rourke seemed perturbed Hunter had slept with Tessa earlier in the day and would again for part of the night. And she couldn\u2019t quit worrying about Hunter\u2019s safety tonight. Something seemed to be bothering him also. Another recollection? Maybe concern that they shouldn\u2019t have made love this afternoon. If he left tomorrow, she would have no regrets about what they had done. Well, no. She wasn\u2019t being honest with herself. She doubted she would ever find a man who was quite like Hunter. No one would ever measure up to him.</p><p>But something was going on with him. He kept watching her, his look so dark she couldn\u2019t fathom what was the matter. If Rourke hadn\u2019t been there, she would have asked. But she didn\u2019t want to in front of him.</p><p>Rourke noticed Hunter\u2019s ominous mood, too. Even though he was pissed about her and Hunter\u2019s relationship, he wasn\u2019t saying a word about it. But she bet he would if Hunter hadn\u2019t looked so lethal.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make that list of names for me,\u201d Hunter finally said to Tessa, fixing her with a piercing gaze as he shoved his empty plate at Rourke.</p><p>Although Rourke was supposed to do the dishes, he wasn\u2019t finished eating, and he cast Hunter an irritated look.</p><p>Tessa had forgotten all about the list of suspects. \u201cI\u2019ll do it after I finish dinner.\u201d</p><p>She realized then, the change had come over Hunter after he\u2019d left to gather firewood earlier. She frowned. Although she knew she shouldn\u2019t bring it up, she wasn\u2019t used to burying problems. \u201cDid you discover anything when you went down to the beach to get firewood?\u201d</p><p>Rourke glanced up from his roast.</p><p>\u201cYou said Ashton wasn\u2019t anything to you. You said he only saw you as Michael\u2019s annoying sister. What the hell\u2019s going on between the two of you? Is he your lover? Former lover? Is that why he shot me?\u201d</p><p>A sickening flood of fear washed over her. He watched the emotions playing across her face, his hard look instantly changing to a hint of compassion. How did he come up with the conclusion that she and Ashton were lovers?</p><p>The... the incident in the shed out back? How could he know about that?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>His voice was so stern she might have cowered if she had done something wrong.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t, damn it. She hadn\u2019t even known Hunter back then. What right did he have bullying her?</p><p>No longer hungry, she rose from the table. \u201cYou want a list of possible suspects, I\u2019ll give you a list. But beyond that, go to hell.\u201d</p><p>She swore his lips turned up a fraction before he stood like one pissed-off giant grizzly.</p><p>He tossed a pair of her shredded silk panties on the table. \u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere... where did you get those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the shed.\u201d</p><p>Rourke looked anxious, like he wished he hadn\u2019t agreed to stay the night. Some hero he would make. On the other hand, he looked like he wanted to know what the panties had to do with Ashton Wellington. Good news for the morning paper?</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d she said, gathering her composure. Once she told Hunter the truth, she figured he would want to kill Ashton, so somehow, she had to minimize the seriousness of what had happened.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me. Did you seduce him in the shed, Tessa?\u201d He advanced on her. \u201cDid you? Or did something else go down?\u201d</p><p>She fought fleeing to her bedroom to avoid the topic.</p><p>She had never told anyone about it. How could she? No one would ever have believed her. But Hunter had instincts that were more attuned than anyone she had ever met. She didn\u2019t think she could get away with outright lying.</p><p>\u201cWhat business did you have in the shed?\u201d She tilted her chin up and glowered right back at him, but wondered again where the panties had been that she hadn\u2019t found them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe intruder had been there. I was looking for clues when I found those.\u201d Hunter motioned to the incriminating evidence.</p><p>Oh, hell, the stalker.</p><p>\u201cAshton had been drinking, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Hunter\u2019s face turned even more hot-tempered. \u201cHe forced you? Damn it, he raped you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He tried to get me to do it with him, but I... I knocked him out with a shovel and when he came to, we never discussed the incident. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? No one would ever have believed me! Ashton can do no wrong! I tried to tell my brother, but he wouldn\u2019t hear of it. I\u2019d seen Ashton smoking out by the shed. Michael was still at the art gallery at one of his special exhibits. I thought it was a good opportunity to tell Ashton to go to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you did me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, you deserved it. I told Ashton I didn\u2019t want him seeing my brother any longer. He was a bad influence, but it was my fault for confronting him. I shouldn\u2019t have interfered. Not when I saw that Ashton was drunk. He left before Michael came home, and we didn\u2019t see him for a couple of weeks. He wasn\u2019t pleasant to me after that, but he kept his distance.\u201d</p><p>Rourke whistled. \u201cHell, a shovel, eh? Good thing you didn\u2019t crack that worthless skull of his in half. Not that he wouldn\u2019t deserve it, but you wouldn\u2019t have deserved the consequences either.\u201d</p><p>Hunter took Tessa\u2019s hand, but she jerked free and folded her arms. \u201cNext time you want to ask me a question, do it in a nicer way, and not with a reporter in audience, all right?\u201d</p><p>Rourke shook his head. \u201cI swear, Tessa, on my mother\u2019s grave, I wouldn\u2019t breathe a word of this to anyone. I swear it. Although that worthless piece of shit deserves the bad publicity.\u201d</p><p>Hunter took Tessa\u2019s arms and unfolded them. Holding onto her hands, he scowled, \u201cI don\u2019t often apologize for my actions, but finding the evidence in the shed made me a little crazy.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say for someone who didn\u2019t want to make a commitment, what was the big deal? But she bit her tongue, because somewhere deep in this mountain man\u2019s psyche, he seemed to be fighting with himself over wanting to be with her longer.</p> <p>She gave him a wry smile. \u201cApology accepted. But don\u2019t you dare kill that tapeworm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make any promises.\u201d He cast Rourke a look like he better not print a word of any of this.</p><p>Rourke threw his hands up in capitulation. \u201cSecret\u2019s safe with me. But you can\u2019t bind me to any oath either if that bastard gets in my way after what he\u2019s pulled.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to laugh. As if Rourke would ever get more violent with a body than shoving a recorder in his face to do an interview. Hunter smiled, as if he were thinking along the same line.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making up to me tonight for this,\u201d Tessa warned Hunter, poking her finger against his solid chest.</p><p>He learned over and cupped her face, gliding his lips over hers, then captured her mouth and gave her a searing kiss that promised much more. He bowed his head slightly, touching his forehead against hers. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to apologize more, later.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tingled with heat and pleasure, and she wished Rourke hadn\u2019t been here. \u201cHmm, you\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hat and Michael\u2019s jacket and gloves. \u201cGot to take a look around now that it\u2019s getting dark. Keep her inside the house no matter what, Rourke. Even if you hear gunfire, don\u2019t let her out of your sight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she said, her heart in her throat, because no matter how capable he seemed, someone had already nearly killed Hunter, and she was having awful feelings about this. Just like before.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>WHY HUNTER HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION HE had concerning Tessa, he didn\u2019t know. Well, yeah, he did. She had really gotten under his skin and one thing he didn\u2019t like was being lied to. When he had found her panties on top of a shelf of some old paint cans, an unreasonable rage had filled him. But seeing her expression made him realize he had gotten the scenario all wrong, and he wished to hell his wolf instincts had played more of a role in his handling of the situation.</p><p>He meant what he said. He would make it up to her. Hopefully, she was being honest when she seemed to understand his anger and didn\u2019t hold a grudge against him for it. But maybe if she stewed about it for a while, she would be mad at him all over again. He wouldn\u2019t blame her. Why he had brought up the matter in front of Rourke was another thing.</p><p>What had gotten into him? Damn it.</p><p>He\u2019d fallen hard for the woman\u2014that\u2019s why. For some inexplicable reason, he wanted her for his own, despite the fact she was human, which went against all that he stood for. He took a deep ragged breath, trying to focus on the business at hand. He had every intention of locating the gray tonight, assuming he would be in his wolf form. Hunter figured that as badly as the gray had the hots for Tessa, there was no persuading him to cease his stalking. The lupus garou wanted her for a mate, and if Hunter didn\u2019t kill him, he was sure the gray would try to change her. If she didn\u2019t go with him willingly, he would murder her.</p><p>Hunter\u2019s blood heated even more. The gray wouldn\u2019t get the chance.</p><p>Movement in the woods caught his attention. He peered into the dark and saw a rifle poised in his direction and the bastard holding it. But as soon as Ashton Wellington realized Hunter had spied him, he raised the gun in surrender. Hunter charged toward him, his temper red hot.</p><p>He reminded himself the reason he had to get rid of Ashton was to ensure he could tangle with the gray, wolf to wolf, without witnesses. But as angry as he was with Ashton concerning Tessa, he couldn\u2019t control the urge to put the sheriff\u2019s son out of his misery, quickly.</p><p>Ashton stood his ground, although his face had turned as pale as the snow now falling.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to stay away from here?\u201d Hunter growled, using his most lethal voice and glower.</p><p>Ashton shivered, and Hunter figured it was due in part to the cold, in part because of his threatening posture.</p><p>\u201cI promised Michael I would watch out for his sister, damn it. I already told you that.\u201d</p><p>Hunter balled up his fist and punched Ashton in the jaw. Pain streaked through his knuckles. Ashton fell back against a pine tree with a grunt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for attempting to rape Tessa.\u201d Hunter readied his fist again.</p><p>Ashton dropped his rifle in the accumulating snow and held up his hands in submission. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I\u2019m sorry. I was drunk. Angry. I know it doesn\u2019t excuse my behavior. Michael has been the only friend I\u2019ve ever had and when his sister told me to get lost and leave her brother alone because I was a bad influence, something inside me snapped.\u201d</p><p>Hunter grabbed the rifle, intending to send it over the cliff, but Ashton yelled, \u201cWait! Hear me out. You wouldn\u2019t listen to me last night you were so riled, but someone\u2019s stalking Tessa. I thought it was you. Dad gave me hell about being here late last night, but I told him Michael wanted me to promise I would look after Tessa. And I\u2019m going to do it, damn it. I owe her for the way I behaved, and I owe Michael.\u201d</p><p>He sounded sincere enough, but the guy was always in trouble, according to Tessa. Why couldn\u2019t he be lying?</p><p>\u201cWhat about your seeing Michael\u2019s girlfriend, Bethany Wade? If you\u2019re such a good friend of Michael\u2019s, why would you do that?\u201d</p><p>Ashton\u2019s face darkened. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it, Hunter. Why did you have to bring that up to my dad? He gave me hell for that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you ought to come clean with me, before I throw your worthless carcass off this cliff.\u201d</p><p>Ashton looked like he was ready to pee his pants. Despite trying to put on a tough guy act, the smell of fear cloaked him. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill Bethany. I went to see her that night. The one when I was so drunk. I\u2019d been feeling sorry for myself because Michael had a talent I didn\u2019t have, and he was so successful. His painting had nothing to do with me, and I felt left out. While he was getting all his accolades during the showing, I drank too much. After Tessa beaned me with the shovel, I finally came to my senses, somewhat.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cI went to see Bethany, although I halfway suspected she would be at the art gallery with Michael. Hell, Tessa was supposed to be, too, but she had stayed home because she had a bout of the flu. Which she gave me also! Anyway, Bethany had been drinking, too. She felt like I did. Michael had a new circle of friends, and we didn\u2019t fit into his new lifestyle. She hated all the women who threw themselves at the great artist. His works were beginning to appear all over the states at museums and in books. We knew before long, he wouldn\u2019t have time for either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you screwed his girlfriend and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ashton\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cAt first, it was because we were mad at Michael. A sneaky form of revenge, I\u2019ll admit. But we became really fond of each other. I think we were falling in love. Michael was spending more time with his artwork and exhibits and less time with us, so what difference did it make?\u201d</p><p>Hunter growled, \u201cHe was your best friend! You could have had the balls to square it with him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and lose his friendship?\u201d Ashton shoved his gloved hands in his pockets. \u201cAfter Bethany died\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell me you didn\u2019t kill her over a lover\u2019s spat and frame Michael for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Hunter. I didn\u2019t kill Bethany. I figured Michael had done it. Sure, I had been seeing Bethany behind his back just like he said, only he didn\u2019t know who it was. We\u2019d been supercautious so no one could ever prove it. I figured he murdered her because he knew she was seeing someone else. Who else would have killed Bethany?\u201d</p><p>Hunter shoved the rifle into Ashton\u2019s chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want you coming around here any longer. I told you that last night. I won\u2019t warn you again.\u201d</p><p>Ashton rubbed his jaw, his blue eyes piercing Hunter with a frigid glower. \u201cI promised Michael. Someone\u2019s stalking Tessa. I\u2019m not breaking my promise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I hate to admit it, I\u2019m glad. But you\u2019d better let me in on this. My dad\u2019s contacted two ex-cons, extortionists, murderers, although they weren\u2019t convicted on the last count since the DA\u2019s office couldn\u2019t locate enough evidence. Believe me, they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to eliminate you. I told my dad you\u2019re good for Tessa\u2019s protection. But he was so mad about the rifle and everything else, he wouldn\u2019t listen. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t kill Bethany, I\u2019d say you don\u2019t really have it in you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not. You\u2019ve solicited that idiot Rourke\u2019s help, and he definitely won\u2019t be able to protect her.\u201d</p><p>Hunter glanced back in the direction of the house. \u201cAll right, but make sure your dad is agreeable. Let him know we\u2019re in on this together. You get yourself killed, I don\u2019t want your dad thinking I\u2019m the one who did it.\u201d</p><p>Ashton bobbed his head up and down. \u201cOkay. You got it. Are you sure you don\u2019t want me to stick around a little longer? What if the guy\u2019s out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably is. But I don\u2019t want your ass out here until your dad agrees. All right?\u201d Hell, when had Hunter become such a damned softy? He ought to have thrown the rotten cuss over the cliff with his new rifle.</p><p>\u201cYeah, agreed.\u201d But Ashton looked like he wanted to stay.</p> <p>\u201cNow, Ashton. You don\u2019t want to see me when I\u2019m really pissed. Your dad might have mentioned I\u2019m an ex\u2013Navy SEAL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re trained to eliminate any threat no matter how small, so just remember that. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot before tomorrow. And come to the front door of the house, only if you get your dad\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Ashton vigorously nodded and waited for Hunter to move out of his way since he had his back wedged up against the pine tree.</p> <p>\u201cBe back tomorrow,\u201d Ashton promised.</p><p>Hunter shook his head and stalked off in the direction he smelled the gray\u2019s scent. The stalker was back and had probably listened to their whole blasted conversation. Hunter should have thrown Ashton over the cliff, if for nothing better than to prove to the gray he wasn\u2019t a damn pushover.</p><p>The doorbell rang and Tessa looked at Rourke, both of them standing in front of the fire, rubbing their hands, trying to stay warm. Tessa didn\u2019t think the stalker would come to the front door. Maybe the sheriff had returned? Or perhaps he had sent some of his minions to rough Hunter up a little. But in front of witnesses? Probably not.</p><p>She headed for the front door, but Rourke bolted in front of her and grabbed her arms, his gray eyes wild. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s him\u2014the stalker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check.\u201d Rourke released her, hurried to the door, and peeked out through the peephole. \u201cNo one there.\u201d</p><p>Before she could tell him not to open the door, he unlocked it and swung it wide. \u201cHoly crap!\u201d</p><p>Rourke jumped away and tried to shut the door, but something knocked him flat on his back. Tessa stared at the large, pale gray wolf as he stood next to Rourke lying unresponsive on the floor. The wolf turned his attention from Rourke to Tessa, his amber eyes feral. In disbelief, she stood frozen in place. He... he was the same one who lunged for her in California?</p> <p>Couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Heart racing, she dashed for the fireplace and grabbed the cast-iron tongs. The wolf leapt halfway across the living room, barely missing the coffee table, and landed only feet from her. She swung the tongs at the animal\u2019s head, connecting with his nose in a loud whap, and the tongs flew from her grasp. He yelped and shook his muzzle.</p><p>She dove down the hall and reached her brother\u2019s room, the blood pounding so hard in her ears she couldn\u2019t hear the wolf following. But as soon as she grabbed the door and tried to slam it shut, the wolf lunged. Like a replay from the incident in the woods in California, the animal snarled and snapped, only this time he blocked her from shutting the door.</p><p>\u201cTessa!\u201d Hunter yelled from the living room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in here, Hunter! Watch out for the wolf!\u201d Except she was the one still fighting with the wild beast, his paws against the door, his teeth snapping at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>The wolf turned its head and she knew he would attack Hunter next.</p><p>\u201cStay there. Don\u2019t come out until I holler it\u2019s all clear,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>She slammed the door closed. \u201cHunter, be careful! The wolf\u2019s probably rabid.\u201d</p><p>What if it bit Hunter? And what about poor Rourke?</p><p>Furniture crashed. Her heart jumped. Growls sounded. She raced through Michael\u2019s room, searching for a weapon.</p><p>More crashing noises. More growling.</p><p>\u201cHunter?\u201d</p><p>Hunter tore off the field jacket and then kicked off the sneakers as the wolf slinked around the sofa, snarling at him. Thinking to kill Hunter as a human? It would be easier for him. Hunter jerked off the sweats and hurried to shapeshift. The gray was dead meat. Rourke was out cold, thankfully, and Tessa couldn\u2019t see Hunter\u2019s new look, standing as a wolf, waiting for the stalker\u2019s approach. He just hoped to god she stayed put, but he didn\u2019t trust her one bit.</p><p>The lupus garou skirted around the overturned table, the brass lamp on the floor, the bulb shattered. He inched forward, slowly, cautiously, his tail straightened, his eyes focused on every movement Hunter made, from the twitch in Hunter\u2019s ears to the tautness of his tail. The gray\u2019s nose was bleeding and Hunter made the connection with the bloodied fireplace tongs. Tessa. He was certain Rourke hadn\u2019t used the tongs on the gray and then fallen by the door.</p><p>Had the stalker listened to Hunter\u2019s conversation with Ashton before he approached the house? Attempting to judge Hunter\u2019s strengths and weaknesses? Hunter hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d had much in the line of weaknesses when it came to human dealings. Then again, maybe he didn\u2019t usually come into contact with them. He couldn\u2019t recall.</p><p>Hunter surveyed the furniture in the way, hampering their ability to fight well. He needed to get the wolf out of doors, away from the humans.</p><p>The wolf snarled and then charged. Hunter swiftly retaliated. Both growled fiercely and struck with such force, neither made any headway. They dropped back to their pads and separated.</p><p>Hunter hoped Tessa didn\u2019t hear all the noise they were making, or she would be trying to figure out why there were now two wolves, but the instinct was so inborn, he couldn\u2019t stop it. Growling was like a war yell for a fighter in battle\u2014a need to frighten the enemy into submission or inaction, and he would use every means necessary to eliminate the threat.</p><p>The gray was an equal match in size and agility. In his wolf way of thinking, Hunter was glad he had a worthy advisory, which would make it that much sweeter when he destroyed him. The two clashed again, their powerful jaws snapping, their teeth connecting. Hunter tasted both his blood and the gray\u2019s.</p><p>They landed on their paws, their chests heaving. They truly were matched. But Hunter couldn\u2019t work him toward the door. The lupus garou probably wanted to stay near the woman he intended to claim.</p><p>The gray dove in again, biting at Hunter\u2019s neck.</p><p>Hunter tore the gray\u2019s cheek, exposing the muscle. He yelped, retreated, waited. Hunter charged him, grabbed for his throat, but the lupus garou turned, and Hunter bit him in the flank instead. Another yelp.</p><p>Rourke groaned.</p><p>The distraction caught Hunter off guard, and the wolf went for Hunter\u2019s throat again. Hunter shifted the weight of his body to avoid the wolf\u2019s bite and ran into the damned leather footstool. The stalker\u2019s teeth sank into his shoulder. Pain radiated through the wound. Hunter growled.</p><p>Rourke moaned.</p><p>The wolf glanced at him as he began to stir, and then the stalker leapt toward the door. With another bound, he was outside.</p><p>His shoulder bleeding and hurting like hell, Hunter bolted after him. This ended, tonight.</p><p>Rourke weakly hollered, \u201cTessa? Tessa?\u201d</p><p>Her nerves wired, she opened Michael\u2019s bedroom door and peeked out. No more growling. \u201cHunter?\u201d</p><p>No reply.</p><p>Irritated she couldn\u2019t find a weapon in Michael\u2019s bedroom for protection, she called out, \u201cRourke, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Her spine tingling with apprehension and feeling vulnerable without a weapon in hand, she crept down the hall toward the living room.</p><p>The place was deadly quiet except for the wind blowing through the open door. She feared the worst\u2014 Hunter was dead or unconscious and the wolf was waiting for her. The adrenaline in her system was running high, her heart pounding hard. If she could get to the fireplace tongs or the poker...</p><p>She peered into the living room. No sign of the wolf. Both brass lamps had crashed to the floor. Blood was spattered throughout. Tan, pale, and darker gray fur clung to the edges of the couches and love seat. Rourke had again passed out by the front door. The clothes Hunter had been wearing were strewn all over the place.</p><p>She gasped, her hand to her mouth, her eyes tearing up. The wolf must have killed Hunter and dragged his body off. But what if he hadn\u2019t? Then again, what if the wolf came back? She grabbed the fireplace poker and rushed to the door. Except for drops of fresh blood on the porch, she didn\u2019t see anything in the blowing snow.</p><p>\u201cHunter!\u201d she screamed. If she\u2019d had a gun, she would have gone after the wolf and shot it.</p><p>Rourke groaned, and she quickly closed and locked the front door. \u201cRourke, Rourke, wake up. I... I think the wolf killed Hunter. But if it didn\u2019t...\u201d She wiped tears from her cheeks. \u201cRourke! Wake up! We need to save Hunter.\u201d</p><p>The gray was racing through the woods as fast as he could while Hunter kept track of him in the blowing snow. Where the hell was he fleeing to? Maybe a getaway vehicle. He had the tenacity of an alpha. Yet some of his posturing, like escaping through the forest, indicated he was more of a beta. It didn\u2019t matter what he was because the gray served as a threat to Tessa either way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For three miles, Hunter chased the lupus garou, the icy air whipping across his open wound, making it burn like the devil. Stop and fight like a wolf, damn you!</p><p>Another two miles after that. At least Tessa and Rourke were safe now that Hunter had the gray on the run. Hopefully, Rourke had only suffered a bump on the head and nothing more serious.</p><p>The wolf suddenly slowed. Tiring? Weak? He was bleeding, too, leaving a trail of blood in the fresh snow. But he didn\u2019t smell like he was afraid, which confused the issue. Maybe he was mad. Some lupus garou were crazy, just like their human counterparts.</p> <p>Another smell\u2014another wolf. No two. Damn it, Hunter was in a pack\u2019s territory. Something seemed familiar. He glanced at the cliffs. One blackened pine stood naked in the snow at the edge of the outcropping of rocks. Oh hell. Here\u2019s where he was thrown from the cliff.</p><p>He smelled the air. They were the three who\u2019d fought him. That\u2019s how they had gotten the best of him the last time. But why had they attacked him?</p><p>Which made him wonder if he had tried to take over the pack, or had targeted one of their females as his own. Yet since this one wanted Tessa, had they thought Hunter would discover her and want her also? No matter how he tried, he couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>One of the males moved around to his right flank, the other behind him, while the one he had already fought stayed where he was, panting, dog tired. Hunter almost felt the same way, but fresh adrenaline surged through his veins again, preparing him for the fight. He imagined the injured wolf was feeling complacent now that his buddies were here to bail him out.</p><p>He had a whiter mask on the underside, except for the blood caked on his nose and cheek. The one to Hunter\u2019s right was a darker gray. The one behind him was a little heavier, but they all had a similar scent, way of moving, overall look. He guessed they were brothers, triplets. Packs protected their members, but family could be even more ferocious in taking care of their own.</p> <p>His tail stiff like a flag of warning, Hunter kept his eye on the stalker, but listened with regard to the other two. This time someone else, preferably three someone elses if he could manage, would be taking a dive into the ocean, over the cliff side. And then he would make sure Tessa didn\u2019t return to her beach for a good while afterward. No sense in her dragging home any more wounded, naked lupus garou males. Or finding their remains if they didn\u2019t survive.</p><p>The wolf behind him moved forward, his pads crunching on the upper crust of snow. The one on the right stepped toward Hunter, trying to box him in. Hunter didn\u2019t budge. He might as well put some of that supposed Navy SEAL training to use. At least if nothing else, he wouldn\u2019t be pushed toward the edge of the rocks. And he knew just who to target this time. The weakest link. He dove after the stalker.</p><p>For an instant, the wolf\u2019s ears flattened. Hunter smiled inwardly. The stalker was afraid of him. That\u2019s why he brought Hunter here. To get his brothers to back him up. He probably thought he could take Hunter down initially because of the way he was so \u201chumanized.\u201d</p><p>The wolf fled. Hunter whipped around so suddenly, he caught the wolf chasing him off-guard. Hunter immediately lunged at him and bit the gray\u2019s snout. He yelped and dove away. The remaining wolf attacked. Hunter aimed low at his front right leg. With a snap, he brought the wolf down. The wolf howled. Hunter again turned, prepared to take on the other, but he and the stalker had disappeared into the blinding snow like a couple of gray wraiths. Calling for reinforcements? Hunter knew his limits. He couldn\u2019t fight a whole pack of grays.</p><p>The wolf with the broken leg lay panting on his side. Hunter knew he should kill him. But he still couldn\u2019t remember why they had thrown him from the cliff. Maybe he had been the one in the wrong. Not concerning Tessa though. No matter what, the stalker had no right to claim a human, and Hunter wasn\u2019t going to allow it.</p><p>He growled at the injured wolf. The gray closed his eyes in submission. Probably readying himself for the killing blow. Hunter glanced back in the direction of Tessa\u2019s house. What if the other two wolves went back for her?</p> <p>Hell. He dashed back the way he had come, mile after mile. A quarter of a mile from the house, he heard Tessa calling, \u201cHunter!\u201d Her voice was filled with tears.</p><p>Crap. Was Rourke with her? She wasn\u2019t supposed to leave the house. Somehow, he had to return to the place, get dressed, and... No, he couldn\u2019t risk her being out here in the event the other lupus garous were coming for her.</p><p>With the pine trees still shielding him, Hunter shape-shifted into his human form. He\u2019d suffer frostbite for sure. If Tessa and Rourke had just stayed in the house, he could have gotten much closer before he\u2019d had to change.</p><p>Racing into their line of view, he found Rourke wielding the fireplace poker and Tessa ready to swing the bloody fireplace tongs.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, Hunter.\u201d Tessa\u2019s gaze shifted from his face to his bloody shoulder as she rushed forward. \u201cOhmigod.\u201d</p><p>He dashed toward her and grabbed her hand, pulling her back toward the house. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out here. I told you to keep her in the house, Rourke. Didn\u2019t I?\u201d The threat in his voice was real, but Rourke was smiling. Probably because of Hunter\u2019s state of undress.</p><p>So much for his ferocious image.</p><p>\u201cI kept telling Tessa we would find you in pretty good shape.\u201d Rourke threw his parka over Hunter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI told you he\u2019d have wrung the wolves\u2019 necks and would bring their tails home as souvenirs.\u201d</p> <p>Now that was a barbaric notion. Tessa wrapped her arm around Hunter\u2019s waist as they hurried to the back porch. Tears streamed down her cheeks, and she didn\u2019t say anything more.</p><p>Rourke wouldn\u2019t shut up and handed Hunter Tessa\u2019s ski cap. \u201cSorry. We didn\u2019t think of bringing any of your clothes. We should have thought of it, but all we had in mind was attacking the wolves that had dragged you off, and the best weapons for the job. But I kept telling Tessa you would be all right. That we\u2019d find you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of this is to be reported to the newspaper,\u201d Hunter warned.</p><p>\u201cWe have an obligation to warn folks that wild wolves have taken up residence in the woods here. We can\u2019t allow them to kill people.\u201d</p><p>Tessa was shaking so hard when they reached the back porch, she dropped the keys. Rourke retrieved them and unlocked the door.</p><p>\u201cNo reporting any of this.\u201d Hunter used his most threatening voice as they walked into the living room, his arm tight around Tessa.</p><p>Rourke stared at him. Tessa finally pulled away from Hunter and hurried down the hall.</p><p>He handed Rourke his parka and slipped the sweat-pants back on.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean it, Hunter. What if one attacked Tessa? It would have, too, if you hadn\u2019t come and saved us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a wolf. All right, Rourke? Just drop it.\u201d</p><p>Tessa returned to the living room with rubbing alcohol and bandages. \u201cIt was too a wolf.\u201d Her voice was shaky and her body slightly trembled.</p><p>When she applied the alcohol to the wound, Hunter clenched his teeth. Hell, he hadn\u2019t hurt this much since the time he was wounded in the Mekong Delta. Again, a distant memory, but nothing else came to mind except the excruciating agony he was in.</p><p>Her gaze caught his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her skin was as white as the gauze in her hands and her eyes glistened with tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d he said between gritted teeth. He sure as hell didn\u2019t want her to worry that he was dying when he would heal within a few days and be as good as new.</p><p>She set the bottle of alcohol down and applied the gauze to his shoulder. \u201cI saw it, Hunter. If it wasn\u2019t a wolf, what was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wild dog that looked like a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have to report it. A wild animal that attacks humans has to be destroyed,\u201d Rourke said.</p><p>Tessa taped the gauze to Hunter\u2019s shoulder and shook her head. \u201cIt was a wolf. I have a photo of one that looks exactly like him. And not only that, but he had almond-shaped eyes. Dogs have rounded eyes.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a minute, then recalled all the books she had on wolves. Hell, now what? Hunter collapsed on the sofa, the adrenaline fading and weariness settling in. He wanted to tell them he had destroyed the animal, but he couldn\u2019t because the stalker would undoubtedly return, maybe this time with his two buddies once everyone had healed sufficiently. Hunter didn\u2019t want Tessa and Rourke believing they were perfectly safe. But he didn\u2019t want to create a mad scene of hunters shooting every wolf throughout Oregon either. And they probably would, even though wolves were a protected species. They couldn\u2019t kill the lupus garou that way, but they could kill the real wolves, and for wolves and lupus garous it would be one long nightmare.</p><p>\u201cCan I see the picture?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and headed back down the hall.</p><p>Hunter ran his hand through his damp hair. \u201cListen, Rourke, I\u2019m going to ask you for a big favor on this. I know what I\u2019m doing. Believe me. I\u2019ll destroy the wolf\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard two of them fighting in the house,\u201d Tessa said, returning with the printout of the photo.</p><p>\u201cTwo fought one another. So you see if we announce this, hunters from every crack and crevice in the state will be here shooting everything that moves. Everything. You know how it goes. Then even Tessa wouldn\u2019t be safe getting a load of firewood from the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got you and me for that now,\u201d Rourke said, as if he were staying for the long haul.</p><p>Actually, it probably was a good idea\u2014for the time being.</p><p>Hunter considered the photo while Tessa hurried back down the hall. It was the gray all right. But the trees weren\u2019t correct. A hint of memory eluded him. He recognized the forest. Not here, but where?</p><p>Rourke whispered, \u201cDid you kill it already? I could see you didn\u2019t want to say in front of Tessa.\u201d</p><p>Before Hunter could reply, she returned and frowned at them. He figured she heard Rourke\u2019s loud whisper.</p><p>She carried a man\u2019s flannel shirt and a pair of big fuzzy sock slippers. Kneeling at Hunter\u2019s feet, she pulled on one of the slippers, and then the other. He hadn\u2019t realized how icy his feet were until she warmed them. But what heated him even more were her tender ministrations and thoughts of returning to bed with her and snuggling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He considered the picture of the lupus garou again. \u201cWhere did you get this photo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took it in California. Right before he lunged at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were on that photo shoot for the magazine?\u201d Rourke asked. \u201cHell, Tessa, I told you not to take the job, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe looks just like the one that knocked Rourke out,\u201d</p><p>Tessa continued, ignoring Rourke\u2019s scolding. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Hunter lied, \u201cThey can all look the same.\u201d Well, to an untrained eye, they could. He and his kind easily distinguished the differences. A change in the colors of the masks, or the patterns of coloration on the body and head. Sometimes subtle between wolf siblings, but still anyone who observed them closely enough could see the difference. Personality-wise, they\u2019d be totally dissimilar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Yet something in the way Tessa looked at him and her tone of voice, indicated she wasn\u2019t being totally honest with him either.</p><p>He wanted to know what made her suspect he wasn\u2019t speaking the truth, or that he at least didn\u2019t understand the truth. She couldn\u2019t know this wolf was the same as the one she\u2019d seen in California.</p> <p>But that he had followed her from California showed how determined he was to have her.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the wolf that attacked us here before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn La Grande. I\u2019m pretty sure. I took a photo of him, but he was turned sideways, and I didn\u2019t get a good shot of his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas to be another wolf,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think, Hunter? That\u2019s a long ways for one to travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Hunter knew better. When looking for mates, they\u2019d travel for miles. \u201cDo you have the photo?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cSure, but we need to take you to the doctor to see about your wound. The animal was probably rabid.\u201d She looked up at him, her eyes shimmering like emeralds awash in tears.</p> <p>Her upset cut straight into his soul. He didn\u2019t think a human had ever touched him the way she did. Although if he had much to do with them, he probably wasn\u2019t usually this beat up around them. He touched her face and would have leaned down to kiss her as she crouched in front of him, but his shoulder hurt so much, he couldn\u2019t bend if his life depended on it. She stood and helped him into the flannel shirt.</p><p>Then she kissed his lips, her touch velvety soft, heating his chilled blood. \u201cI\u2019ll find some blankets for you, but we need to make plans to get you to the clinic.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her hand and squeezed tight. \u201cI won\u2019t deny I\u2019m bone weary, Tessa, but the animal didn\u2019t have a case of rabies. I\u2019ll be fine in a day or two.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Rourke as if looking for his support.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, Hunter. That wound\u2019s pretty nasty. It\u2019s going to need some sutures.\u201d</p><p>Hunter released Tessa\u2019s hand. \u201cNo.\u201d He closed his eyes and groaned as he tried to get comfortable. She hurried to help him stretch out on the sofa in front of the blazing fire. \u201cJust make sure everything\u2019s locked up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we drove in this icy snowstorm, we could run off a cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get to a doctor,\u201d Tessa whispered to Rourke.</p><p>Hunter opened his eyes and scowled. Since when did his word not mean the law? \u201cNo! I\u2019ll be fine. I heal fast. Just let me sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Tessa brushed away tears and then rushed back down the hallway. He only realized then she had been fighting them all along. He hadn\u2019t meant to sound so harsh, but he didn\u2019t need doctors messing with him. Not that they would discover what he was. Thank heavens the lupus garou genetics precluded that. As a wolf, they had only wolf genes and as a human, human genetics. But he still didn\u2019t want anyone seeing how fast he healed. Although as bad as the bite was, it would be a couple of days, maybe more, before it healed properly.</p><p>Rourke tried his phone, but shook his head. \u201cStill no reception.\u201d</p><p>Tessa returned with an armload of blankets, a pillow, and the other wolf photo.</p><p>Hunter studied the two photos. Hell, it was the same lupus garou. \u201cHow long ago was this taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen any wolves around here since then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d... I\u2019ve heard howling up north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a month ago. Well, the first time. I\u2019ve heard it on and off since then.\u201d</p><p>The bastard must have seen her at La Grande and tracked her here. Had he caught a whiff of her? Her special scent that ignited his own cravings?</p><p>Or had he taken objection to her photographing him? The fact he was rolling in her sheets meant he wanted her. He was taking her scent back to his wolf mates, declaring she was his and no one else\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe he\u2019d been owned before.\u201d She pulled the soft blue blanket up to Hunter\u2019s chin.</p><p>\u201cOwned before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He doesn\u2019t act like a normal wolf. Well, I mean he does, with the snarling and chasing and all. But\u2014he stares me down like he\u2019s trying to remember a past life, like maybe he was once someone\u2019s pet and I look like the owner, or something.\u201d She gave Hunter a couple of pills.</p><p>Rourke shook his head. \u201cNo way was that wild animal someone\u2019s pet, unless he already ate his owners.\u201d</p><p>Hunter gave him an annoyed look. He wasn\u2019t helping his cause. His shoulder feeling like it was on fire, Hunter offered Tessa a pained smile. \u201cWhy would I need a doctor when I\u2019ve got Miss Nightingale?\u201d</p><p>Her lips lifted a little, but he could tell her heart wasn\u2019t in it.</p><p>He closed his eyes and listened to Rourke and Tessa move to the kitchen where they discussed him and how they would get him to the clinic in town despite what he wanted. He let out an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Tessa was not normally a wimp, but she\u2019d fought collapsing when she first saw Hunter\u2019s muscle torn to the bone. He had to have medical attention and soon. But he was right about the driving conditions. She would never normally chance driving in this kind of weather. Anyone with an ounce of sense wouldn\u2019t either. But infection could set in and he couldn\u2019t heal properly without getting some stitches no matter what Hunter said about it. Yet she wondered if he practiced some kind of mind-over-body meditation that helped him heal faster because all the injuries he\u2019d suffered from his swim in the Pacific had healed.</p><p>How he could have survived the cold for so long before they reached him, she couldn\u2019t imagine. It was almost as if he\u2019d holed up in a nice warm cabin for a while. Except there were none close by, and he had been too injured to have gone very far.</p><p>Rourke let out his breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, Tessa. He needs a doctor for sure. My phone still isn\u2019t getting a signal or I\u2019d call for an emergency crew to come get us.\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked out at the accumulating snow\u2014already drifts had piled up half a foot around the back of the house. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we wouldn\u2019t make the six-mile trip into town. If we ran the truck off into the woods down one of those steep embankments\u2014if we survived\u2014we could all be injured so badly we might not be able to crawl back to the road. Then what? And if we just got stuck, we\u2019d have to walk in these freezing conditions the rest of the way into town. I don\u2019t think Hunter can take any more of the cold as badly injured as he is. But I\u2019m also worried about infection and continued bleeding. And although he says the wolf wasn\u2019t rabid, how does he know? What if it was? The way the animal came into the house and headed for me, he acted more like a rabid wolf than not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Rourke glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s already midnight. One of us will need to keep a vigil on him all night. If he begins to run a fever or gets violently ill, either we can attempt a run into town, or we can wait out the storm and try then. The alternative is I can go by myself and try to get help.\u201d</p><p>Tessa shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d worry about your safety. What if you didn\u2019t make it? And then, too, the stalker could still be out there. Oh, hell, I hadn\u2019t thought about it since it happened, but remember, someone rang the doorbell and then disappeared? Do you think the wolf killed the person and dragged him away?\u201d</p><p>Rourke collapsed on the dining chair. \u201cHell. We\u2019ve got to report this as soon as we can. It\u2019s our civic duty, despite what Hunter says.\u201d</p><p>Rourke was right, but what kept running through her mind was the strange way Hunter had considered the photographs. The concern etched in his face and actions, the questions he\u2019d asked\u2014all led her to believe he thought the same as her, despite his words to the contrary and how insane the notion could be. The wolf was the same one she\u2019d seen on the three separate occasions, and he was stalking her.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>FOR TWO HOURS, TESS A SAT WITH HUNTER, HIS HEAD RESTING in her lap as he slept fitfully on the couch. Her nerves raw, she wanted to take him to the hospital in the worst way, to have medical personnel\u2014who knew what they were doing\u2014care for him.</p><p>Rourke had finally fallen asleep on the other sofa, snoring softly. The fire crackled and cast a soft glow into the room, but the lamps remained on the floor where they had fallen. Not wanting to disturb Hunter\u2019s rest, she\u2019d clean up later. Battling to stay awake, she kept vigilant, watching for any sign Hunter\u2019s condition was worsening.</p><p>\u201cMeara,\u201d Hunter mumbled and groaned. \u201cMeara.\u201d</p><p>Tessa\u2019s soggy eyes widened, and she strained to hear him speak again. Was he remembering something more? Of course he was. But about a girlfriend or his sister? Her heart skittered with the thought.</p><p>She brushed the hair away from his forehead, the shadow of a beard giving him a rugged, sexy appearance, but his cheeks seemed flushed. She touched his cheek, her fingers recoiling at the feel of his skin. No, no. He was burning up.</p><p>She hurried to move out from under him, removed his blankets, and went to the kitchen. Pouring water into a glass, she glanced out the window to see how bad the storm was. Maybe they could chance taking him into town. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Half-hidden in the shadows of the shed, the security light revealed a wolf sitting, watching the house.</p><p>A shiver stole up her spine. Was it the one that had knocked Rourke out and come after her? No, this one didn\u2019t have any blood on his nose. She squinted her eyes, trying to get a better look. Its darker gray fur blended with beige and its snout had the same pretty beige on top, white underneath. Was he the one that Hunter said attacked the other then?</p><p>Maybe Hunter was right. She wouldn\u2019t want anyone to shoot a good animal.</p> <p>She opened the window and tried to get a closer look. The animal\u2019s ears twitched and his eyes focused on her. He didn\u2019t seem vicious, but he was still feral.</p><p>She closed the window and returned to the living room with the medicine.</p><p>\u201cHunter,\u201d she said, trying to wake him.</p><p>He looked up at her, his eyes glassy. He closed his eyes and moaned.</p><p>\u201cNo, Hunter, take this medicine. We need to bring down the fever. Hunter!\u201d</p> <p>Rourke touched her arm and she nearly dropped the glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, his voice ragged with sleep.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s burning up and I can\u2019t get him to take anything for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, let me.\u201d Rourke helped Hunter sit up and forced the pill down his throat, but Hunter growled and bit him. Rourke jerked his finger free. \u201cHell, Hunter, I\u2019m only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get some antibiotics for that. Jeez. What next?\u201d Tessa asked.</p><p>\u201cI just hope to hell the wolf that bit him didn\u2019t have rabies.\u201d Rourke helped Hunter lie back down and joined Tessa in the kitchen. \u201cHe seems to be sleeping all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRestlessly.\u201d She washed Rourke\u2019s finger in the sink and glanced out the window. No sign of the wolf. \u201cHunter broke the skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed. Here I get off pretty easily by surviving the wolf attack, resulting in only a lump as big as a melon on the back of my head and one hell of a headache, and the ex\u2013Navy SEAL bites me instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can write it in your memoirs some day.\u201d She coated his finger in antibacterial ointment and then wrapped a bandage around it. \u201cAt this rate, I\u2019m going to have to buy a whole lot more medical supplies. By the way, I saw one of those wolves out back.\u201d She got Rourke a couple of pills for his headache.</p><p>He leaned against the sink and peered out the window. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything but snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone now, but it\u2019s not the one who attacked us. He had a bloody nose. This one didn\u2019t have a mark on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they were fighting, how did he get away without a scratch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was hurt somewhere I couldn\u2019t see. I just know it wasn\u2019t the one that came after us. Can you get back to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Rourke took the pills, drowned them with a glass of water, and followed Tessa into the living room. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try sleeping for a while? I\u2019ll watch Hunter and the house for a couple of hours.\u201d</p> <p>She ran her hand over Hunter\u2019s temple, his face flushed and sweaty. \u201cI hope the roads are clear enough in the morning. No matter what condition they\u2019re in, we\u2019re going to have to chance taking Hunter to the clinic.\u201d</p><p>Everyone was fast asleep when the doorbell rang at six in the morning. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Immediately, Tessa bolted upright from the sofa opposite the one Hunter slept on. Rourke opened a sleepy eye as he lay back on the recliner. Hunter continued to sleep, his face still red.</p><p>She studied the door. \u201cIf there\u2019s no one there, I\u2019m not opening the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Rourke offered, pulling the blanket off his lap.</p><p>\u201cNo. Last time you did, it was a disaster. Are... are you okay? You look a little feverish.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang again.</p><p>Tessa rushed to peek through the peephole. \u201cOh, hell,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s Ashton and he\u2019s got a rifle.\u201d</p><p>Rourke hurried to join her. \u201cSince Ashton got here safe and sound, maybe we can take his truck and get Hunter to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a gun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t know what hit him.\u201d Rourke bolted across the living room, grabbed the fireplace poker, and then rejoined Tessa at the front door. \u201cOkay, open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to hit him with that, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to persuade him to let us use his truck so we can take Hunter in for heavy-duty antibiotics and sutures.\u201d</p><p>Ashton rang the doorbell again.</p><p>\u201cHide the poker behind your back and don\u2019t hit him. I\u2019ll try to convince him to agree to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Hunter! It\u2019s me, Ashton! I got my dad\u2019s permission to be here.\u201d</p><p>Tessa glanced at Rourke. He shrugged. \u201cLet him in.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounding hard, she unlocked the door and opened it. Ashton was more cheerful than she had seen him in months. His blue eyes sparkled with humor and his grin couldn\u2019t have been any more friendly, but his jaw was slightly bruised.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter? I told him I\u2019d help him locate the stalker. He made me get my dad\u2019s approval first. Dad and I went around and around about it late into the night, but I finally wore him down. Hey, you look a little ill, Rourke.\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked at him. \u201cOh, Rourke, your face is as red as Hunter\u2019s.\u201d She clapped a hand on his forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re burning up, too.\u201d</p><p>Ashton peered around them at the mess in the living room, and his mouth gaped. \u201cWhat the hell happened? Did the stalker break in? I knew I should have stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wolf attacked Hunter. We\u2019ve got to get him to the clinic. Can you get us there?\u201d She closed the door.</p><p>Ashton swore under his breath. \u201cHe\u2019s got a fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe animal might have been rabid,\u201d Tessa warned.</p><p>\u201cI sure hope the hell he wasn\u2019t. Hunter bit me!\u201d Rourke raised his bandaged finger to show Ashton.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to know how that happened.\u201d Ashton set his rifle down. \u201cLet\u2019s get Hunter to the truck. We\u2019ll go to the hospital emergency room. I have chains on my tires, so we should be able to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ashton,\u201d Tessa said, relieved that he would help without resorting to Rourke\u2019s tactics. She wondered if Rourke had wanted to clobber Ashton though, for what he\u2019d pulled with her out by the shed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Rourke, can you help me? Or are you too sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Tessa got the front door and then the truck door while Ashton and Rourke carried Hunter to the extended cab. As strong as Hunter seemed, she couldn\u2019t believe how sick he was. Which was ridiculous. As torn up as he was, infection had to have set in. He was only human after all.</p><p>She threw on her parka and grabbed blankets, a pillow, and her purse. Rourke yanked on his parka and gloves, and they climbed into the truck.</p><p>\u201cSo what the hell happened?\u201d Ashton pulled out of the frozen driveway.</p><p>Tessa knew her vehicle would never have made it. Rourke\u2019s either, since his had slipped into a ditch even before the storm had worsened.</p><p>\u201cA wolf knocked Rourke unconscious and came after me. Hunter was searching for the stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Ashton sounded so guilty, she immediately became suspicious. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe found me looking for the stalker instead.\u201d Ashton rubbed his jaw. \u201cI guess I distracted him from his mission for a time. Sorry, Tessa. I had to tell him I was there to protect you. I\u2019d promised Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? Thanks, Ashton.\u201d Maybe the jerk was salvageable after all. She hadn\u2019t thought he could ever be.</p><p>\u201cI shot Hunter because I thought he was the stalker.\u201d</p><p>She barely breathed. \u201cHave you seen the guy then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s tall like Hunter. Dark-haired, too. It really was an honest mistake. I have to tell you, I couldn\u2019t go to the trial, Tessa. I thought Michael was guilty of murdering Bethany. I thought he did it because she was seeing some other guy, and he found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the other guy,\u201d Tessa said, her voice bitter.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But he\u2019d asked me, begged me to watch out for you. I promised him I would. Believe me, I really didn\u2019t think there was anything to worry about concerning your safety. That first night I was out there, I saw someone peeking in the windows. I think Michael already knew there was someone, but like with me seeing Bethany, he couldn\u2019t catch the guy in the act. Anyway, I hollered at the Peeping Tom. Asked him what the hell he was doing. He took off running. Really fast dude. Just like Hunter when he charged up the hill toward me the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was getting firewood. He was wearing Michael\u2019s clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t getting firewood when I saw him. He was naked.\u201d</p><p>Tessa closed her gaping mouth and stared at Ashton in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cHe began yanking Michael\u2019s clothes out of a plastic sack and jerked them on. I didn\u2019t recognize the sweats. But I did see the familiar eagle on the back of the field jacket and knew it was Michael\u2019s. So I thought maybe he\u2019d gotten into the house and stolen some of Michael\u2019s things.\u201d</p><p>She cast a glance over the seat. Hunter was sound asleep, the blankets tucked under his chin. What in the world had Hunter been doing undressing and dressing in the bitter cold? Unless Ashton had been drunk, like she\u2019d suspected, despite what Hunter had said.</p><p>\u201cSo I didn\u2019t know what to think. After Rourke said Hunter was an ex\u2013Navy SEAL, I realized what he was doing. Hardening himself for the worst conditions he would have to face. That way he could survive anything. If I\u2019d done what he had, I would have double pneumonia.\u201d</p><p>But Hunter wasn\u2019t an ex\u2013Navy SEAL. If he hadn\u2019t been gathering firewood, she figured he would have been searching for the intruder. He wouldn\u2019t have been naked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I give, Rourke. How\u2019d Hunter bite you?\u201d Ashton asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. Tessa looked at him. He was sleeping, his head propped against the cold window. She wished she had brought some more pillows. At least they had plenty of blankets if they got stuck. Although she hadn\u2019t considered taking them for that reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLong night for all of us,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cI was trying to get Hunter to take some fever-reducing medicine, but couldn\u2019t wake him enough. Rourke finally got the pill down him, but Hunter clamped his teeth on Rourke\u2019s finger. Broke the skin even. I\u2019m really worried that wolf was rabid. What if Hunter and Rourke have rabies now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter\u2019s bite was pretty bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTore the muscle all the way to the bone.\u201d Tessa shuddered.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get the shots and be fine. But if they don\u2019t, rabies in humans is fatal. The doctor will have to decide. But if we can kill the animal and bring him in, the medical personnel can check out his brain and know for sure. No sense in Hunter and Rourke having to go through the painful ordeal if it\u2019s not needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter doesn\u2019t want the wolf shot. He said it didn\u2019t have rabies, and he\u2019d take care of it himself.\u201d</p><p>Ashton smirked. \u201cI love his style. Get rid of the offender personally. Of course, when I was on the receiving end of his drive to right the wrong, I felt a little differently. But Hunter\u2019s all right. I mean, if the roles were reversed and some dude shot me, I probably would have killed him. On the other hand, I doubt I would have had the balls to charge up the hill after a guy who had his rifle sights on me. That took a hell of a lot of guts. It was as if he knew he\u2019d shake me up so much, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get off another round. And he was right. I couldn\u2019t twitch a muscle, shoot, run, nothing. Must be his training.\u201d</p><p>Ashton shook his head. \u201cI talked to my dad about going into the Navy SEALs. He\u2019s all against it, said I couldn\u2019t live with having my hair cut. But after we get rid of this stalker and Hunter reassures me he\u2019s sticking around to keep you safe... oh, hell, I promised Michael. Okay, here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019ll help Hunter find whoever murdered Bethany, and then once Michael\u2019s set free, I\u2019m checking into the Navy.\u201d</p><p>Rourke lifted his head from the window. \u201cI\u2019m helping also. Maybe between the three of us, we\u2019ll discover something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour of us,\u201d Tessa corrected him.</p><p>\u201cI thought you believed Michael was guilty, Rourke,\u201d Ashton said.</p><p>\u201cI did. I changed my mind. Since we now know he wasn\u2019t lying about someone seeing his girlfriend behind his back, what else was he being truthful about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it was me?\u201d Ashton asked, his voice growing hard.</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone else who knew all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe list. I\u2019ve got to write that list of possible suspects,\u201d Tessa said.</p> <p>\u201cOf possible murderers?\u201d Ashton asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, of stalkers. Hunter thinks it\u2019s someone who was in the house before he broke in that one night. Someone we knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gray,\u201d Rourke muttered under his breath as he rested his head against the window again and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d Tessa asked.</p><p>But Rourke had fallen back to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get some sleep?\u201d Ashton said. \u201cYou look pretty worn out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to watch your driving?\u201d</p><p>Ashton gave her a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be slow going. This two-hour-long trip will probably be more like four.\u201d</p> <p>The blowing snow made for whiteout conditions and the windshield wipers swept away the building snow, but it continued to shower down on them\u2014huge white flakes. Thank god the truck\u2019s heater was working fine, and the cab was toasty warm.</p><p>Tessa closed her eyes and slept for a while. Until the truck jerked to a stop. Her eyes popped open. Ashton swore under his breath, yanked the door open, jumped out, and slammed the door shut. They were in the middle of nowhere still, surrounded by forest, no traffic, nothing but cold, wet snow and a gray bleakness. So what was the problem?</p><p>The truck was leaning at an odd angle. In the ditch? Great. Tessa pulled on her gloves to investigate.</p><p>Ashton threw open the door and jumped back into the cab, shoving the door closed, his face ashen despite the chill in the air.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Tessa asked, afraid to know the answer.</p><p>\u201cI left my rifle at your place, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy rifle! I left it at your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has that got to do with getting stuck in a snowdrift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRourke and I probably could get the truck out, but three gray wolves were watching me from the woods. They looked hungry. Maybe the one that attacked you was one of these?\u201d</p><p>A shiver sped down her spine as she peered into the blowing snow, but saw nothing.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re wild dogs,\u201d Rourke said softly, peering out the window.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see them,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>\u201cThose are wolves,\u201d Ashton reiterated. \u201cWild dogs, my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just stay here. What if the snow piles up behind the muffler?\u201d Tessa glanced behind them.</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d Ashton warned.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, then we\u2019d have to stop the engine, and we\u2019d freeze.\u201d</p><p>Ashton rubbed his gloved hands together. \u201cAfter what happened to Hunter, I\u2019m not sure trying to move the truck while those animals are out there is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll move it.\u201d Hunter pushed the blankets aside and groaned.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d Tessa gave him a look like he had better not even think of it.</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cI told you not to take me anywhere. I would have been fine in a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter, you\u2019re sick. We\u2019re taking you to the hospital and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re stuck in the middle of nowhere and not going anywhere fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Hunter glared at her. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You look like you\u2019re still burning up with fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dogs won\u2019t attack us, will they, Hunter?\u201d Rourke asked.</p><p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t is the key word,\u201d Ashton said. \u201cThe wolf shouldn\u2019t have entered Tessa\u2019s home and bitten you either. Which means it has to be rabid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to move the truck,\u201d Rourke said, albeit reluctantly. He cast Hunter a dirty look over the backseat. \u201cYou stay here. You have a hell of a lot of explaining to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Let me try my phone.\u201d Ashton pulled out his cell phone. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have a signal here.\u201d</p><p>Everyone watched as Ashton punched in a number. He shook his head. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d Tessa buttoned her parka.</p><p>\u201cNo, you stay and try to drive us out of the mess. Rourke and I\u2019ll stack up some wood under the tires, and then we\u2019ll push while you drive,\u201d Ashton said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Hunter growled.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cThat shoulder of yours is too badly damaged. You\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here, Tessa. I\u2019ll help. Then you can take me to the hospital and get me patched up. All right? But without my assistance, we may not be going anywhere.\u201d Before she could object, he added, \u201cThree hulking men should be enough of a deterrent for the dogs. I don\u2019t want anyone else bitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your shoulder. You shouldn\u2019t do anything physical. And the fever. You shouldn\u2019t be out in this cold. What if you drove the vehicle, and I helped the guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d all three men said at once.</p><p>Hunter pulled on the ski cap. But she hadn\u2019t brought Michael\u2019s field jacket for him because she didn\u2019t figure he could get into it with as bad as his shoulder was, and she hadn\u2019t thought he would be leaving the truck except to be wheeled into the hospital.</p><p>Ashton tossed his parka back to Hunter. \u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, he really owes me,\u201d Rourke grouched.</p><p>Rourke didn\u2019t elaborate, but she figured he was still pissed off at Hunter for biting his finger and worried he had rabies. He was sick with a fever, too. Working in these winter conditions couldn\u2019t be good for any of them.</p><p>Tessa started to remove her parka. \u201cHere, Ashton, take mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSize petite? Wouldn\u2019t fit over my broad shoulders.\u201d He rolled them back to make them appear larger. He wasn\u2019t half as broad as Hunter.</p><p>The men headed outside while Tessa moved into the driver\u2019s seat, wishing she could do more. The dogs must have been hiding or had run off. She didn\u2019t see any sign of them, although the guys kept casting glances at the woods while they were working. As soon as the men had piled up enough branches under the tires, Ashton motioned for Tessa to drive out. With them pushing and the truck tires finally getting some traction, she managed to pull back onto the road.</p><p>Ashton and Rourke whooped and hollered and she was glad, too, but afraid Hunter might have done more damage to his shoulder as quiet as he was.</p><p>With snow covering his long hair and sweater, Ashton helped Hunter into the truck while Hunter groaned. She knew he shouldn\u2019t have helped with the truck. Probably did most of the work, too, knowing him. Rourke climbed in and Tessa moved over to the center of the front seat. Once everyone was settled, Ashton put the vehicle in drive and began the remainder of the slow trek toward the hospital.</p><p>Tessa peered over the seat. \u201cAre you okay, Hunter?\u201d</p><p>He buried himself in the blankets and mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, imagining he could have broken every bone in his body and his response would be the same\u2014I\u2019m fine. \u201cHow about you, Rourke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows. \u201cGood. Then the hospital staff won\u2019t have much work to do when they check the two of you over. How about you, Ashton?\u201d</p><p>He smiled broadly. \u201cI\u2019m frozen to the bone, I skinned my knuckle, and I pulled my calf muscle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn honest answer for once. What about the dogs? Did you see any sign of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves.\u201d Ashton tightened his grip on the steering wheel as they plowed through another snowdrift. \u201cThey were watching. But like Hunter said, they didn\u2019t seem interested in attacking. Just curious, maybe. Pray we don\u2019t end up in the ditch again before we reach our destination.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they reached the hospital later that afternoon, barely any of the staff had made it to work and unless patients had an emergency\u2014like a couple of car accident victims, a baby delivery, and an elderly man who\u2019d had a heart attack\u2014most people stayed away. Woe to the patients stuck in the hospital whose families couldn\u2019t venture out in the storm to visit them.</p><p>Although Hunter hadn\u2019t wanted to be taken in on a stretcher, the hospital staff felt otherwise as soon as they saw his condition. Poor Rourke had to wait longer to be seen, but once they thought a rabid wolf might have bitten Hunter, they took Rourke right in.</p><p>As soon as Hunter was resting comfortably in a room after surgery, Tessa, Rourke, and Ashton went in to see him.</p> <p>\u201cOnly family can see Mr. Grey,\u201d an officious nurse said, who had hovered over him ever since they had arrived. A striking brunette, tall, even more beautiful if she could manage half a smile.</p><p>Something about the woman irked Tessa. Maybe it was the way she cast Tessa condescending looks like she was beneath her, or maybe the way she\u2019d taken charge of Hunter and dismissed them. Worse, a hint of recognition seemed to pass between Hunter and the nurse, and Tessa wondered if they had been lovers before. At once, she felt like an outsider.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Tessa said, her chin up, her eyes glowering.</p><p>The woman tucked a curl of hair behind her ear that had loosened from her bun. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>How the hell would she know?</p> <p>The nurse pointed at Tessa\u2019s unadorned fingers. \u201cNo engagement ring.\u201d</p><p>Tessa offered a fake smile. \u201cLeft it at home. But I don\u2019t really give a damn what you believe. The wedding\u2019s scheduled for the spring.\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed. \u201cRight. And I\u2019m the queen of England.\u201d She looked at Rourke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his brother.\u201d He folded his arms. \u201cNeed any proof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I believe you.\u201d She considered Ashton.</p><p>\u201cAnother brother.\u201d</p> <p>Again, she laughed. \u201cThis is just too damned unreal. You\u2019ve got fifteen minutes, and then visiting hours are over.\u201d She squeezed Hunter\u2019s hand like a lover would and brushed back a lock of hair from his forehead. Then she sneered at Tessa and left the room.</p><p>Hunter was sound asleep, and to Tessa\u2019s relief, the doctor said Hunter would have the full range of motion in his shoulder once he had gone through months of therapy after it healed.</p><p>Rourke pulled a chair over to the bed for Tessa and then turned to Ashton. \u201cCan you get Tessa a cup of coffee? She looks a little peaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll miss my fifteen minutes with Hunter.\u201d</p><p>Rourke raised a brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think we\u2019re going to allow that nurse to boss us around, do you?\u201d</p><p>Ashton shrugged. \u201cThe thought had crossed my mind.\u201d He left the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right, Tessa,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fast healer. And the rabies shots will ensure if the animal was rabid, Hunter will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? How are you feeling? You still look feverish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI received rabies shots and antibiotics, too. I\u2019ll be good as new soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it, Rourke. He didn\u2019t bite you on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you never know when one little bite can change your whole life.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and reached out to take Hunter\u2019s hand. \u201cHe\u2019s still awfully hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe antibiotics and fluids they\u2019re giving him will make him feel like his old self before long. You were right to bring him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that nurse knew him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that impression. How did you and Hunter really meet? I never saw him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beach. We told you.\u201d</p><p>Rourke stared at him for sometime and then looked back at Tessa. \u201cNaked? Injured? Tell me the whole story.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to say anything about how they had really met, not when they\u2019d had such a good cover\u2014at least up until now. But Rourke seemed to suspect the truth, and she really was a lousy liar.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>HUNTER WOKE TO THE CLOYING ODOR OF HOSPITAL antiseptics with a roaring headache and his shoulder feeling like it was on fire. But Tessa had been right to bring him here. He would heal much more quickly after the surgery, enabling him to fight the grays again. The room was dark and quiet, and Tessa was sleeping in the chair, a blanket from the car wrapped around her. She looked like an angel. Not the kind of woman he thought he would want to have for his own.</p><p>He wanted to pull her into bed and hold her close.</p><p>He closed his eyes. Hell, he had bitten Rourke. It wasn\u2019t the human bite that did it either. Already Rourke was aware of the change, although they hadn\u2019t been able to talk about it, and he wouldn\u2019t realize exactly what he was. His senses would be on higher alert. The urge to shapeshift hopefully would come on more gradually. But Hunter\u2019s gut clenched as he thought of how he\u2019d changed Rourke. Damn it.</p><p>The nurse walked into the room, a gray lupus garou itching to make trouble where Tessa was concerned. The woman\u2019s eyes rounded when she saw Tessa sleeping there. When she reached out to wake her, Hunter growled low, \u201cYou touch her and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>The nurse folded her arms, her dark hair coiled into a bun, her amber eyes challenging him as she gave him a wicked look. \u201cHow did an alpha like you become so badly injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have nursing duties to perform?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have her. So what\u2019s the deal? Got anyone else lined up that you\u2019re interested in? I need a mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing working in this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put up with my pack\u2019s politics. What are you doing with the woman and that other man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess with them.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkling with deviousness, she bowed her head slightly and then left the room. He didn\u2019t trust her. But he knew if he breathed one word of leaving to Tessa, she would have a conniption. Rourke would understand. Somehow he had to solicit his help. Ashton would agree because of the perceived thrill of adventure. Rourke was bound to him as a newly appointed member of his pack. Of course, Rourke wasn\u2019t exactly aware of pack traditions yet, but he was instantly gifted with a wolf\u2019s wariness. The part about self-preservation of their species and keeping their secret was tantamount.</p><p>Hunter let out his breath in exasperation. Damn Rourke for poking that pill down his throat. Chomping down on the intrusive finger had been instinctual, but what a mess. Thank god he hadn\u2019t bitten Tessa. Teaching Rourke was going to be enough of a pain. This was why wolves didn\u2019t change humans. At least with lupus garous who were born that way, all the rules were known from day one, while their lupus garou parents reinforced the lessons from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cHunter?\u201d Tessa whispered, her eyes trying to study him in the dark.</p><p>\u201cTessa, why don\u2019t you get a hotel room and get some sleep?\u201d</p><p>In fact, that was the solution. Ashton could take her there and stay with her. Then Rourke could sneak Hunter out of the hospital in the morning, and they could say the hospital had released him.</p><p>\u201cWould the stalker have followed us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIn this storm? I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>But then again, what if he and his brothers had? The three who had watched them from the woods when they were trying to get the truck unstuck from the snowdrift were different. Yet... familiar, somehow. He thought he recognized their scent, but not their appearance.</p><p>Hunter took a steadying breath. If the brothers had managed to follow them here, Ashton wouldn\u2019t be any match for them. Although the one wolf\u2019s leg shouldn\u2019t have healed this quickly either. Hunter ground his teeth. Maybe staying put for a while longer was for the best.</p><p>With the blanket wrapped around her shoulders, Tessa drew the chair over to the bed. \u201cRourke\u2019s upset with you for biting him. I told him you didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>Hunter grunted. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have had his finger in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was trying to help you. Would you have bitten me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had, you\u2019d have given me hell for it.\u201d</p><p>Looking wiped out, but as beautiful as ever with her long red hair in tangles around her face, she sat in the chair. \u201cDo you know that nurse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you both seemed to recognize each other.\u201d</p><p>He noted a hint of jealousy, but he didn\u2019t want her believing he knew the woman when he didn\u2019t\u2014just that she was a lupus garou. \u201cI thought she seemed familiar, but I\u2019ve never met her before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Meara? Who\u2019s she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeara?\u201d He frowned. The name sounded familiar, but he couldn\u2019t recall.</p><p>\u201cYou said her name when you were delirious with fever. Is she your sister maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Tessa reached her hand out to him. \u201cHunter, don\u2019t get mad at me, but Rourke realized our cover story wasn\u2019t true. I don\u2019t know what made him suspicious, but now he knows about your amnesia and how I found you on the beach. About the fact someone may have tried to murder you, too. He won\u2019t tell anyone. He\u2019s promised.\u201d</p><p>Rourke would know a hell of a lot more in a little while. \u201cI figured he\u2019d learn of it before long.\u201d</p><p>Her posture relaxed a little. \u201cWhat about Ashton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word to him. I don\u2019t want to shatter his image of me.\u201d</p><p>Tessa smiled and rested her head on Hunter\u2019s lap, pressing against his groin and instantly he hardened. Despite the way his shoulder felt, she stirred his loins. Not only that, but her scent and the feel of her set his blood on fire.</p><p>\u201cI wish we could snuggle together.\u201d</p><p>Just what the doctor ordered. Hunter patted the mattress. \u201cIt\u2019s small, but if we get really close, we should be able to manage.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head and looked at him. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we get caught\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can throw us out of here.\u201d He gave her a devilish smile.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but you need their help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you\u2014more.\u201d</p><p>The smile on her lips said he won. She climbed onto the bed, one knee posed on the right side of him before she raised her other leg to cross over his waist. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe anticipation is killing me, Tessa.\u201d With his good arm, he helped her get settled, groaning when her sweet body sank on top of his rigid erection.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, I\u2019m sorry. Did I hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>Hunter wrapped his arm securely around her, holding her hot little body tightly against his before she bolted from the bed. \u201cPure torture, but not in the way you mean.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled softly against his chest and relaxed.</p><p>Feeling Tessa\u2019s heated body against his, he had the overwhelming desire to screw convention and turn her, claim her. Had he ever felt this way toward a woman? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>But he wondered how he could ever give up the minx. And yet he knew he had to. No woman in her right mind would willingly become a lupus garou. He wasn\u2019t sure how he was going to cope with Rourke\u2019s change, let alone a female he\u2019d make his mate. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to her, any more than it was to Rourke. But the deed was done and there was no going back.</p><p>She took in a deep breath and kissed his chest covered in the thin hospital gown. Her lithe body pressed against his heavy groin. He moaned inwardly. Already, he wanted her again, when he had no business coveting her. But everything about her made him desire her, the way her soft body felt against him, her fragrance, the way she cared so about his welfare.</p><p>Her breathing soon grew shallow, and he sensed she had fallen asleep.</p> <p>Maybe he could take her to Rourke\u2019s place for a while. At least until he healed up sufficiently. The stalker\u2019s wound wasn\u2019t as severe, and he would be back to Tessa\u2019s house soon, probably with the brother who wasn\u2019t injured badly either.</p><p>Knowing sleep would help his body to heal more than anything else, Hunter willed himself to shut down his concerns.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t realize he had even fallen asleep until sometime later the sound of footsteps entered the room, waking him. Hunter opened his eyes and stared at the man dressed in scrubs, his dark hair curling down to his shoulders, his face covered in a shadow of a beard. He looked way too scruffy to be a male nurse. Hunter expected him to come closer, to make a comment about the sleepy redheaded goddess in Hunter\u2019s arms, to check his vital signs. But this wasn\u2019t a medical call.</p><p>Hunter got a whiff of the man\u2019s scent. One of the stalker\u2019s brothers. The one who hadn\u2019t been injured too badly, probably now completely healed. If he\u2019d thought to slip in and steal Tessa away while Hunter was drugged and asleep, he was going to have a fight on his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy does your brother want her so bad?\u201d Hunter hoped to learn more about these men before he had to eliminate them. Maybe he could still convince the brothers to give up the deadly quest.</p><p>\u201cYou have to ask?\u201d The man snorted. \u201cShe\u2019s as close to one of us as we can find, and my brother, Yoloff, will have her. If I\u2019d seen her first, she would\u2019ve been mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad he followed her to California?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s grim face brightened a little. \u201cHe almost had her there. Several times he\u2019s nearly taken her. The hunt is as appealing as the mating. Then you came along and he had to solicit our help.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter could envision how frustrated the lupus garou was, but the previous comment stuck in his craw. \u201cWhat do you mean by she\u2019s nearly one of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, you can smell her pheromones.\u201d</p><p>Which didn\u2019t make sense, but there wasn\u2019t any way she was one of them. \u201cShe\u2019s not a lupus garou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what you will, but she\u2019s garnering a lot of lupus garous\u2019 attention in any event. Only she\u2019ll be my brother\u2019s mate. You can either give her up nice and easy or we\u2019ll take her the hard way. You don\u2019t want her in any event or you would have already turned her, so you might as well just let us have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s only one way this is going down.\u201d Hunter reached for the nurse\u2019s call button.</p><p>Before he pressed the button, a female nurse suddenly entered the room. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked the faux male nurse.</p><p>\u201cI work on another floor.\u201d He gave Hunter a sinister smirk. \u201cJust checking on my buddy here.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Hunter, her eyes rounding when she saw Tessa asleep with Hunter. \u201cWhat... you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The stalker\u2019s brother gave Tessa another long look. \u201cJust remember what I said.\u201d Then he left.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t sleep with you in the bed. I can get another bed for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who just left has been stalking Tessa. He\u2019d planned on grabbing her while I was knocked out on pain medication. She\u2019s not moving from here.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s face paled. \u201cI\u2019ll call security and report him.\u201d She whipped out of the room and shut the door.</p><p>Hunter must have fallen asleep after that because the next thing he heard was Ashton\u2019s chuckle near the doorway. Hunter opened his eyes, his arm still wrapped securely around a sleeping Tessa. His shoulder was stiff, but not half as painful. Although the medication dripping into his veins could have had something to do with that.</p><p>\u201cYou have style, Hunter. Real style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rourke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still sleeping at his apartment down the road. He was pretty wiped out, but before I left, I checked and his fever was gone. We were going to take Tessa with us, but found the two of you like this before we left. Guess Nurse Godzilla didn\u2019t bother you any longer. I asked about her schedule and she\u2019s gone home, but she comes back on duty tonight.\u201d</p><p>Tessa stirred. Her eyes opened and she would have jumped from the bed if Hunter hadn\u2019t held on tight. He kissed her good morning on the lips and wanted more, but she was squirming in an attempt to bolt, stirring him to high heaven, and he released her.</p><p>He gave her a smile, then said to Ashton, \u201cI\u2019m starving. When do they serve food around here?\u201d</p><p>Tessa climbed off the bed, her cheeks blushing beautifully.</p><p>Ashton cast her a conceited smirk. \u201cNever knew you had it in you to break the rules, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>She glowered at him and headed for the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cMy breakfast?\u201d Hunter asked Ashton, before he ripped off the I.V. and wiped the smirk off his face.</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019s on its way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want sausage, bacon, and a mess of scrambled eggs. Biscuits, too. And three pints of milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what they ordered for you last night,\u201d Ashton said.</p><p>\u201cTessa told me you were a real prankster in school. I\u2019m starving. I need solid food to build up my strength. Go get me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rourke poked his head in the door, his eyes blurry, his hair mussed up, dark whiskers covering his chin, not the look of a reporter on his way to work. \u201cYou could have woken me, Ashton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get your breakfast,\u201d Rourke said to Hunter, and he headed down the hall.</p><p>\u201cWait up, Rourke! I\u2019ve got to see this.\u201d Ashton rushed after him.</p><p>Tessa stepped out of the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019m taking a hot shower. Don\u2019t let anyone in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! You can\u2019t get those bandages wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could manage.\u201d He started to climb out of bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare or I\u2019ll call a nurse.\u201d Tessa ducked back into the bathroom, shut the door, and started the water.</p><p>Hell, wet bandages wouldn\u2019t bother him. He was about to remove the I.V. when Rourke and Ashton walked back in the room, each carrying a covered dish.</p><p>\u201cAshton said you wanted both sausages and bacon. They came with one or the other. So we had to procure a couple of dishes to accommodate you.\u201d Rourke glanced at the bathroom and sniffed. He smiled and then frowned. \u201cSurprised you\u2019re not in there with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have been if the two of you hadn\u2019t returned with the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t get those bandages wet anyway,\u201d Ashton said.</p><p>Rourke gave him a get-real look. \u201cYou think that would have stopped Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d Ashton uncovered the dish of eggs and sausage. \u201cTwo poor patients will be without breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen staff can make them more,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cCome on, Ashton. Let\u2019s go to the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Tessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably won\u2019t leave Hunter\u2019s side.\u201d Rourke gave him a pointed look.</p><p>Enough with the innuendos. Hunter knew she was becoming way too attached to him. But what could he do about it? He had to stay with her until he got rid of the gray threat and helped free her brother. Of course, his human side said to cool it with her. His wolf instincts told him she was the one for him. But those were deeper, more primal needs. They didn\u2019t take in account the horror she would most likely feel if he changed her. She could hate him. Probably would. She was close to her brother. How could she not tell him what had happened to her? Why she had to become a wolf for a jaunt in the woods sometimes during the moon\u2019s appearance, how she aged so slowly? Yet, if she were changed, she couldn\u2019t tell a human soul.</p><p>The shower shut off and Rourke grabbed Ashton\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s get something to eat before anyone catches us in here with the stolen food and blames us for it.\u201d</p><p>Ashton laughed. \u201cHell, I thought you were as straight-laced as Tessa.\u201d</p><p>The two hurried back down the hall.</p><p>Tessa came out of the bathroom, wearing a towel on her head.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Hunter said, patting the bed. \u201cShare breakfast with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get two breakfasts?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCourtesy of Rourke and Ashton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother.\u201d She peered down the hall. \u201cHere come the food trays. Now you\u2019re in for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your show.\u201d He grinned at her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, great, so I have to explain this? The two Stooges left me with the evidence? I should leave you alone here to explain it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the innocent patient. I couldn\u2019t have left the bed.\u201d He shook his I.V.</p><p>She whipped the towel off her head, tossed it on the bathroom floor, and then stepped into the hall. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll take Mr. Grey\u2019s breakfast for him.\u201d</p><p>Hunter smiled with satisfaction. If the circumstances had been different, they would all have made pretty decent pack members.</p><p>Tessa closed the door and carried the tray in to Hunter. He sniffed the air. \u201cDo you like pancakes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat them then.\u201d</p><p>She opened the lid. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent sense of smell. Did the doctor talk to you about my condition last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he said it might take months of therapy to recover the full use of your shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t take that long. What did he say about my release?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>She poured syrup on her pancakes. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, Hunter. You were in terrible shape when we brought you in. Even the doctor said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I need is you to take care of me. I\u2019ll heal ten times faster. Fever\u2019s all gone even.\u201d</p><p>She looked up from her pancakes and frowned. \u201cYour face is still flushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly all gone then. I was thinking we ought to go to Rourke\u2019s place until I\u2019m healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a studio apartment. No bedroom, couch makes into a bed. Kind of cramped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. What about Ashton\u2019s place?\u201d</p> <p>Tessa licked the syrup off her lips and laughed. \u201cHe lives with his dad. Big house, but somehow I don\u2019t believe he\u2019d appreciate it if we moved in with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill lives at home?\u201d Hunter shook his head. \u201cHe does need to join the Navy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never held a job long enough that he could afford to live on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could remember where I live. That would solve the problem.\u201d Footsteps sounded down the hall headed in their direction. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming. Probably the nurse.\u201d</p><p>Tessa flew into action. He hadn\u2019t planned on hiding the evidence, but Tessa took his empty dishes and stuffed them in the clothes cabinet. She sat back down on the chair, her face crimson.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Grey. I\u2019m here to take your vital signs,\u201d the nurse said, smiling broadly at him, her long, dark curls bouncing as she walked with a spring to her step.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>She gave a breathy little laugh. \u201cWe try to get patients out of the hospital as quickly as we can, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m ready. Just sign the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be here a couple of more days at least.\u201d</p><p>Hunter wasn\u2019t waiting that long. Not with the lupus garou nurse itching to destroy his relationship with Tessa and the rest of the grays still a real problem.</p><p>\u201cThe fever\u2019s come down quite a bit. The doctor will be here after a while to check on you. Do you need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the release papers.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cWe need more male patients like you. Just push the button if you need me.\u201d She wiggled her butt a little too much as she left the room.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave until the doctor says so. Enjoy all the pampering. You deserve it,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>Hunter was surprised she wouldn\u2019t be upset with the way the nurses were making fools of themselves over him. \u201cFood\u2019s not as good as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you get three times as many dishes here.\u201d She motioned to the leftover pancakes.</p><p>Ashton and Rourke returned looking well fed. Rourke sniffed the air. \u201cWhen did you get pancakes?\u201d</p><p>Ashton laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, very funny, guys. I had to hide the other dishes,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>Hunter pointed to the clothes cabinet. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go. I was trying to come up with a safe place to stay, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnow\u2019s melting off the roadway,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cTemperature rose to forty-five degrees.\u201d</p><p>Tessa shook her head. \u201cHe has to stay here until the doctor says.\u201d</p><p>Ashton folded his arms. \u201cYeah, I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place is kind of small.\u201d Rourke rubbed the back of his head. \u201cBut you and Tessa could stay there for the time being. Place is well stocked. The electricity\u2019s back on all over the county. And phone service has been restored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the stalker?\u201d Ashton sounded disappointed.</p><p>\u201cHunter can\u2019t mess with him for a while,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>Hunter considered his options. But only one seemed viable. \u201cAll right. We return to Tessa\u2019s house. We need new locks, a window, and lots of food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd medical supplies. Bandages, tape, gauze, antibiotics. But you\u2019re not leaving here until the doctor releases you.\u201d Tessa gave Hunter a hard look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got your mission,\u201d Hunter said to Rourke.</p><p>Ashton\u2019s face brightened. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it!\u201d</p><p>The two vacated the premises pronto. Hunter took Tessa\u2019s hand and kissed it. \u201cWant to snuggle some more? All that food made me sleepy.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI can just see the doctor catching us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s an idea. Then he would release me, figuring I was well enough after all.\u201d But when she didn\u2019t make a move to join him, Hunter smiled and let go of her hand. \u201cWake me when he comes, if I don\u2019t get up before then.\u201d</p><p>Although it didn\u2019t matter if he got the doctor\u2019s permission or not. He couldn\u2019t stay much longer before someone discovered he was healing too fast for it to be normal and wonder why.</p><p>Wake Hunter when the doctor came? No way. Tessa was determined to keep him right where he was. Rourke should have had better sense. Ashton was being Ashton, impulsive, devious, loving to go against the rules whenever he could.</p><p>The time dragged on and she knew if the doctor didn\u2019t hurry, Hunter would wake. She didn\u2019t want Rourke or Ashton returning either and trying to convince the doctor to let Hunter go. Then again, she figured at least someone on the medical staff would say no.</p><p>When the doctor arrived, she wanted to shove him into the hall and talk to him privately. The blond-haired man looked like he had barely finished high school.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Tessa Anderson,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHunter wants to leave, but he needs to stay for a couple of more days, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter being torn up by that Rottweiler? I\u2019d say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRottweiler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. His friend said the dog had attacked Mr. Grey, but that they were so close to the edge of the cliff, the dog fell to its death. Tide washed him out or we would have been able to run tests on him to see if he had rabies. But Mr. Grey and Mr. Thornburg are receiving the rabies shots anyway as a precaution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dog looked more like a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRottweiler,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cReady to release me, Doc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the man who was bitten by a wild dog?\u201d Sheriff Wellington asked down the hall.</p><p>Hunter\u2019s expression darkened. Tessa took a deep breath. Now what story would Hunter tell?</p><p>The sheriff stalked into the room like he owned it, glanced at the doctor, and then at Tessa. His eyes widened. He whipped his head around and stared at Hunter.</p><p>Hunter gave him an arrogant smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou were the one bitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my son? He said he was coming to see you. If anything happened to him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went into town to get some supplies for Tessa\u2019s house. Doc\u2019s releasing me and we\u2019re returning to her place.\u201d</p><p>The doctor cleared his throat. Good, he would set Hunter straight. Even if he did look like he\u2019d just graduated high school. The doctor took a look at Hunter\u2019s injury. \u201cHmm, looking better, Mr. Grey, but you\u2019ll be here for a couple of more days as bad as the wound is.\u201d</p><p>Tessa smiled at Hunter. She was glad at least the doctor had enough sense.</p><p>He wrote something in his chart. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later to check on you.\u201d</p><p>The doctor walked out and the sheriff folded his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t want you filling my son\u2019s head with glorified stories of how wonderful serving in the Navy SEALs is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t think of it. The notion of joining them is all his idea, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have told him why you quit. The downside of being in the Navy.\u201d The sheriff shook his head. \u201cSo what\u2019s the story about this wild dog? Are you sure it\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Hunter repeated the farfetched tale that Rourke had made up. Tessa couldn\u2019t believe it. Was he trying to protect the vicious animal? Or was it like Ashton had said? Hunter wanted to take care of the menace personally?</p><p>She watched his facial expression\u2014the amusement in his lips and eyes\u2014even though he was trying to keep a straight face while he told the story. What did she really know about him? Nothing. Except that he was super-protective of her, dependable when it came to survival instincts, a great handyman, a born leader, a damned good cook, and the greatest lover she\u2019d ever had. But she still didn\u2019t know who he was, where he had come from, or how he had gotten there. What if he was a bad guy, but didn\u2019t remember being one? Could a person forget a past life of crime and become someone new? But when the memories returned, then what?</p><p>\u201cIs that what happened?\u201d the sheriff asked Tessa.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cDid it happen like Mr. Grey said?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d She gave Hunter a scathing look. She didn\u2019t lie, normally, and she didn\u2019t appreciate being forced into one when she didn\u2019t have a clue as to the reason.</p><p>\u201cWe got the...\u201d Ashton said, walking into the room, but quit speaking and stopped dead when he saw his father. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see concerning this dog incident?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing. When I arrived, the damage was already done. I just drove Hunter and the others here so he and Rourke could get medical treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a job to do. Rourke and I are replacing Tessa\u2019s broken window and door locks. Then we\u2019ll scout around for that thief.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff grunted. But Tessa could see a hint of admiration in his face. He cast Hunter an ill-boding look, but again, it was more like it was to cover his true feelings. \u201cYou keep my son safe. He\u2019s a good shot with a rifle, but he\u2019s no ex\u2013Navy SEAL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe picked up enough provisions to last a week,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cWhen are we leaving? Some of the stuff needs refrigeration, although for now it\u2019s in cold storage in the truck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe doctor said a couple of days at least,\u201d Tessa said with great satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cCall me and let me know what\u2019s going on with this intruder,\u201d the sheriff said to Ashton. \u201cWith car accidents and cases of asphyxiation due to the misuse of generators during the power outage, my investigators are spread pretty thin. But if you need anything, call me.\u201d He looked at Tessa. \u201cAnd file the report on the gun as soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about now, Tessa?\u201d Hunter asked. \u201cWe\u2019re here, I\u2019m stuck at the hospital for now. Ashton can run you in and bring you back. By then, we could share lunch.\u201d He smiled. The look was totally faked.</p><p>\u201cI will, only because I\u2019m afraid the thief might use my gun to commit a crime, and I don\u2019t want to be in trouble for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the food?\u201d Ashton asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can pick up Rourke in a little while and take it to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrop by my place after Tessa files the complaint. We can store the food there. No sense in driving the two hours to her place and back here again.\u201d Rourke looked at Hunter for approval.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s get this done.\u201d Tessa figured when they were at Rourke\u2019s place, she would question him about this new dog story. Hell, the animal had knocked him unconscious. How would he have known what it was?</p><p>When she started to leave with the sheriff and Ashton, Hunter smiled. \u201cNo good-bye kiss?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an annoyed look. He grinned. Stalking across the floor, she meant to give him a peck on the cheek\u2014show him. He grabbed her with his good arm, kissed her thoroughly\u2014mouth to mouth, tongue to tongue\u2014which melted her insides, and she wanted a hell of a lot more. Her face suffused with heat, she pulled away.</p><p>He gave her a sly smile. He knew what he did to her, damn it! \u201cDon\u2019t be gone too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be,\u201d she whispered, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGood. Best to be alert always.\u201d</p> <p>Ashton grinned, but Rourke looked annoyed. The sheriff had already left.</p><p>\u201cWatch him,\u201d she said to Rourke. \u201cDon\u2019t let him sneak out of the hospital.\u201d Then she thought about the food incident and added, \u201cAnd don\u2019t you help him do that either.\u201d</p><p>Then she left, but she had a very bad feeling about the situation.</p><p>For a human, Tessa had pretty good wolf instincts. As soon as she was a little way down the hall with Ashton, Rourke got Hunter\u2019s clothes for him. Hunter pulled out the I.V. and then hurried to dress. \u201cI take it you have a way to get us to your place until we rendezvous with Ashton and Tessa and head to her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaxi.\u201d Rourke got on the phone and called for one. He took the knife from one of the breakfast dishes and sawed through the hospital tag around Hunter\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cCan you occupy the nurse while I go to the lobby and wait for the taxi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Rourke left the room.</p><p>Hunter waited until Rourke asked the nurse when the doctor was releasing Mr. Grey. Then Hunter stalked down the hall, found the stairs, and bolted down them. When he reached the lobby, he paced. Rourke soon joined him.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long for them to realize you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t hold patients against their will.\u201d Hunter glanced out the window. \u201cTaxi\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was sure quick.\u201d Rourke raced after Hunter.</p><p>\u201cMr. Holloway?\u201d the driver said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hunter climbed in and Rourke shut his door and then ran around to the other side.</p><p>\u201cFive-twenty-two Sycamore, right?\u201d the taxi driver asked.</p><p>Rourke smiled as he entered the cab. \u201cTake us to 1032 Redwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of giving an alias,\u201d Hunter said to Rourke.</p><p>Rourke motioned to an old guy standing in front of the hospital, leaning on a cane. \u201cI told you I thought it was awfully quick for the cab\u2019s arrival. I think we took his.\u201d</p><p>Another cab pulled up.</p><p>Hunter watched out the back window. \u201cGood. He took ours then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope he tells him a different address than my place.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived at the brick apartment complex, Rourke paid the driver and Hunter headed toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a hell of a lot of explaining to do.\u201d Rourke fumbled for his keys as he joined Hunter. \u201cLike why I can see in the damned dark? And why I can see things in the distance when I used to have to wear glasses. And hell, why that nurse smelled like a gray wolf\u2014you, too. But also why I knew what a wolf smells like in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you shouldn\u2019t have stuck your finger down my throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to spit the pills out. I was trying to push them down farther so you\u2019d swallow them. Wish I hadn\u2019t. Well in a way. I mean, I like some of these abilities, but I want to know what I\u2019ve gotten myself into.\u201d Rourke shut the door behind them and turned on the heat. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll make the couch into a bed, and you can lie down before Ashton and Tessa show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe couch is fine. I\u2019m feeling better already.\u201d</p><p>Rourke removed the bandage from his finger. No sign of a bite. \u201cOkay, start talking.\u201d</p><p>Hunter meant to sit on the couch, but he was wearier than he thought. He reclined instead.</p><p>Rourke frowned. \u201cHell, I thought you were nearly healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a few more days. But I\u2019m healing too fast to stay at a hospital any longer.\u201d</p><p>Rourke got him a pillow and blanket. \u201cNeed any pain medication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but this time, keep your fingers to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeed\u2019s already done, but believe me, I\u2019ll be careful when I\u2019m around you from now on.\u201d He left and then returned with a glass of water and two white pills. \u201cStart talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lupus garou. Werewolves.\u201d</p><p>Rourke collapsed on the leather chair in front of the coffee table. \u201cHoly crap. You can\u2019t be serious. But damn, you can\u2019t be making it up either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. When we shapeshift we\u2019re like real wolves, except we still have our human reasoning. When we\u2019re humans\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have the increased senses of the wolf. I already got that part since I smelled women\u2019s scents, pine needles, the shift in the weather from snow to drier conditions.\u201d Rourke rubbed the newly sprouted whiskers on his chin. \u201cThe antiseptics in the hospital were nearly killing me, they were so strong. And I heard people talking way down the hall\u2014not just talking, but heard what they were saying when I shouldn\u2019t have been able to discern a thing. Then my finger began tingling like crazy, and it felt like it was healing at the speed of light. But I couldn\u2019t figure out what had happened to me\u2014only that it had to do with you. You really don\u2019t remember who you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Only that I have a sister. I\u2019m sure I lead a pack. And three grays pushed me off a cliff north of Tessa\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d</p><p>Hunter shrugged. \u201cI might have deserved it. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Rourke said, easing back in the chair, \u201cif we bite someone, we turn them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always. And we can\u2019t when we\u2019re human. It would put a damper on our sexual relations with human women if we had to worry about changing them by accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you bit me! And gave me your condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bit you, yes. But I\u2019d tangled with the stalker before that. Our mouths clashed a couple of times and I tore his ear. I bit the other two wolves also. Either it was their blood or the stalker\u2019s blood or saliva that transferred the genes. We\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying, technically, one of them changed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically yes. Because as a human, I couldn\u2019t bite you and transfer the condition, but since my teeth opened your skin, it helped the transmission.\u201d</p><p>Rourke relaxed. \u201cGood, because I thought... well, I worried about Tessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t turn her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the stalker\u2014he\u2019s a gray and he plans to, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Yoloff plans. I\u2019m not giving him the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoloff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and he has two brothers. The one paid me a visit in the middle of the night, figuring he could slip Tessa out from under my nose. I broke the one\u2019s leg. He\u2019ll probably heal in about the same amount of time it takes me to get back to normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. They\u2019re not going to give up.\u201d Rourke combed his fingers through his hair. \u201cSo what are the negative aspects of being a lupus garou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving the uncontrollable urge to become a wolf when the moon is out, particularly strongest when it\u2019s the full moon, although it\u2019s not a constant craving. Once we fulfill the urge to hunt, we can manage several weeks without changing again. On the other hand, I\u2019ve never personally known anyone who was changed by a bite, so it might be a little different for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of us were born lupus garou.\u201d</p><p>Rourke\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHow many of you are there? I had the impression that a wild wolf had some kind of a weird virus and infected a few people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have no idea how many there truly are of us. Since we live in secret, most of us only know about our local packs. Sometimes we learn of others while we\u2019re searching for a mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mate.\u201d Rourke perked up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s one of the more important rules we have to live by. We don\u2019t turn humans.\u201d</p><p>Rourke made a disagreeable face. \u201cRight. Very important to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, otherwise we have to deal with the consequences.\u201d Hunter raised a brow.</p> <p>\u201cLike me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. That\u2019s another thing. You\u2019re part of my pack now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious, but why wouldn\u2019t I be part of the pack of the ones who actually turned me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a gut feeling, Rourke, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re soliciting newly changed lupus garou pack members. I doubt another male would be accepted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, not that I was interested since they\u2019d tried to murder you, but I just wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother thing\u2014when we take a female for our mate, it\u2019s for life. We don\u2019t have marriage rituals, wear wedding rings\u2014or any other jewelry for that matter\u2014too hard to change into our wolf form quickly. We don\u2019t believe in divorce. It\u2019s for life. And we live very long lives.\u201d</p> <p>Rourke\u2019s expression brightened. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we reach eighteen, our aging metabolism slows down. We age one year for every thirty we live.\u201d</p><p>Rourke whistled. \u201cMan, oh man, what a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can die early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver bullets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposedly, if they\u2019re in the heart or brain and not extracted quickly enough. But we can drown, die in a fire, a snapped spinal cord at the base of the neck will do it. Probably other ways. Old age eventually, too. Although our bodies have an unusual capability to heal quickly, as we grow old, the ability wanes. So we\u2019re not completely invincible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough for me. So what are you going to do about Tessa?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p> <p>ASHTON RANG THE DOORBELL AT ROURKE\u2019S APARTMENT and although Tessa worried Hunter would try to steal away earlier than the hospital staff recommended, she never expected him to leave this soon or be resting on Rourke\u2019s couch.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this! What did the doctor say, Hunter? That you needed to be at the hospital for at least a couple of more days. At least! Didn\u2019t he? What happened to sharing lunch with you? What happened to...\u201d She growled, whipped around, and stalked out of the apartment.</p><p>Outside, she shivered and rubbed her arms, her frosty breath filling the air. How could Hunter be so damned stubborn and illogical about this? What if he got sick again?</p><p>Rourke joined her outside. \u201cHe\u2019s got a horrible phobia about hospitals, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>In disbelief, she stared at him. Was he telling the truth or making up another Rottweiler tale? \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Rourke shoved his hands in his pants pockets. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe somebody special died in one. I don\u2019t think he remembers. He\u2019s doing really well physically. Psychologically, he couldn\u2019t handle the hospital stay any longer. If he starts running a fever, we can bring him back here. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not all right. You didn\u2019t get the doctor\u2019s permission, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to the nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t sign the release forms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t go back, Tessa. Trust me on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he gets worse...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he gets worse, I promise we\u2019ll return him to the hospital and chain him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s afraid of Nurse Godzilla\u2019s return also.\u201d</p><p>Rourke winked.</p><p>Tessa frowned. \u201cNot Hunter. I don\u2019t see him being afraid of anyone or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but that woman was scary. She\u2019d definitely wear the pants in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Hunter well enough to travel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Hunter is well enough to travel!\u201d he roared from the couch. \u201cAnd I want to arrive at your place before lunch.\u201d</p><p>Despite how annoyed she was with him, she smiled to hear his gruff voice. \u201cHmm, he\u2019s sounding better already. Grouchy and hungry.\u201d She returned to the apartment and glowered at him. \u201cIf you get sick again, we\u2019re bringing you back and chaining you to the hospital bed. Phobia or no phobia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Rourke, you didn\u2019t tell her about my phobia, did you?\u201d</p><p>The devil shined in Hunter\u2019s amber eyes, and Tessa had the feeling he and Rourke were bamboozling her.</p><p>When they arrived at Tessa\u2019s house, she wanted Hunter to return to the couch, but he organized a search of the place to ensure the stalker wasn\u2019t there first. Always business first, although she felt Rourke and Ashton could have done the deed so Hunter could rest.</p><p>After Rourke and Hunter checked the rooms while Ashton stayed with Tessa, she made Hunter lie down on the couch and covered him with blankets. Rourke and Ashton hauled in the groceries and Rourke\u2019s bags. Ashton had brought his own. One big happy family. If only her brother were here. And here she thought she would be alone until she could obtain her brother\u2019s release.</p><p>What else could go wrong? If it hadn\u2019t been for her stalker and the wolf attack, Hunter might have made some headway into investigating Bethany\u2019s murder.</p><p>Disheartened at the turn of events, Tessa started putting away the groceries: meat, and lots of it.</p><p>\u201cRourke and I are going to replace the window now,\u201d Ashton said. \u201cIf you need anything, just holler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I should have gone grocery shopping with you. Don\u2019t you guys believe in eating vegetables?\u201d</p><p>They laughed and headed outside. When they began pulling the boards off the house over Michael\u2019s broken window, it sounded like a tornado was ripping the place apart. She hoped they didn\u2019t do more damage than the thief had done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix lunch if you don\u2019t need anything else,\u201d Tessa said to Hunter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Just yell if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>She started preparing ham sandwiches for lunch and was glad that Rourke had helped foot the bill. When Ashton and Michael ate her out of house and home, it was bad enough, but at least Michael always brought in an income, too.</p><p>Hunter\u2019s shoulder seemed okay, but he appeared disquieted about something else. He and Rourke had shared a look between them after checking out the house, although it was fleeting enough it had been barely noticeable, but she suspected something was wrong. Had the intruder been here again? She suspected so.</p><p>Ashton was oblivious, happy to be one of the \u201cgang.\u201d She guessed maybe one of his problems was he had never fit in with most anyone, and for whatever reason, he had latched onto her brother. Hunter was more of a leader figure, and Ashton seemed to need his kind of guidance.</p><p>\u201cTessa,\u201d Hunter called out.</p><p>She set the bread on the kitchen counter and hurried into the living room. \u201cAre you feeling badly?\u201d</p><p>Still looking weary, Hunter was sitting up on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you lie back down?\u201d she asked, touching his good shoulder.</p><p>His expression uncomfortably serious, he motioned to the couch. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like those words. They were the same the sheriff spoke when he informed her he had arrested her brother for murder. She stood rigid.</p><p>Hunter took her hand and eased her onto the couch next to him. He draped his arm around her shoulders and his free hand held one of hers in her lap. \u201cI\u2019ve been so wrapped up in this business with the stalker, I haven\u2019t talked to you about some things I need to.\u201d</p><p>She barely breathed. Did he remember who he was?</p><p>\u201cWhen I went after the wolf\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rottweiler?\u201d she asked, her voice and brows arched.</p><p>\u201cThe wolf. I discovered the place where I was pushed off the cliffs. I need to return there, to discover clues of why I was thrown from there.\u201d</p><p>Her heart raced. \u201cDo you know who did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember there were three men, but I didn\u2019t know them, and I don\u2019t know why they did it. I might have deserved it. I don\u2019t have any clue. I just wanted you to be aware of the fact I need to return there. Maybe seeing the place will help the rest of my memories return. I\u2019ll take Rourke with me, but I want you and Ashton to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now. You can\u2019t leave until you\u2019re perfectly healed.\u201d She hated how desperate she sounded. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen these men again, have you? Is that why you need Rourke? Why don\u2019t you call the sheriff? Even if these men were mad at you, they had no right pushing you off a cliff. That\u2019s attempted murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with it, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not invincible, Hunter. When will you get that through your thick head?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and melted some of the icy worry collected in the pit of her stomach, but she still couldn\u2019t shake loose of all her concerns.</p><p>\u201cListen, there\u2019s another matter Rourke and I were anxious about,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>Ashton opened the front door and he and Rourke walked inside.</p><p>\u201cWindow\u2019s done,\u201d Rourke announced. \u201cWe\u2019re not interrupting anything, are we?\u201d He almost looked like he hoped they had.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to tell Hunter another of our concerns. About the guy who disappeared after he rang the doorbell. We opened the door and the wolf jumped on you. Had he killed the man first and dragged his body off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy got away,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cWhen I was fighting with the wolf, I saw the man looking scared to death in the cab of his truck. Then he drove off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t offer to help you?\u201d Tessa asked, frowning, not believing someone could be that horrible.</p><p>\u201cSome people are afraid of dogs,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>Especially when it was a wolf. But still, couldn\u2019t he have done something to help Hunter? \u201cSo what did his truck look like? Who was he?\u201d</p> <p>Hunter shrugged his good shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t get much of a chance to look. Phone lines were down or I\u2019m sure he would have called for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw another wolf on the back patio last night when I was getting a glass of water for your fever. He wasn\u2019t the one I\u2019d hit with the fireplace tongs though.\u201d</p><p>Hunter frowned. \u201cCan you describe him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarker gray and beige, white mask, no blood on nose. He was sitting, watching me as I looked out the window. That\u2019s it. I didn\u2019t see any wounds on him, but he might have had some somewhere. Where he was sitting was dark. Oh, and he was a little smaller than the one who bit you. Was that what the wolf looked like that fought the other?\u201d</p><p>Hunter nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>But she could tell by the way he seemed to puzzle over the matter that he didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cLunch ready soon?\u201d Ashton asked. \u201cWe\u2019re going to install the new doorknobs next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re finished, the sandwiches will be ready,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you in a minute, Ashton. Be right back.\u201d Rourke went out back and Ashton hurried to join him.</p><p>Hunter ran his fingers over Tessa\u2019s hand with a reassuring touch. \u201cSo where and how did Bethany die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I guess you wouldn\u2019t know. Like you, she was pushed off a cliff. Right beside a burned-up pine tree, about six or seven miles north of here. But of course, she didn\u2019t survive the fall.\u201d</p> <p>Hell. The same place the grays had thrown Hunter off the cliff?</p><p>They would probably come in a pack the next time. He didn\u2019t want Tessa out of the house, ever, until he took care of the menace. Now with this newest revelation about Bethany, he again wondered if the stalker, Yoloff, had something to do with her death to get Michael out of the way so he could go after Tessa.</p><p>\u201cYou look pale. Are you all right?\u201d Tessa touched Hunter\u2019s forehead. \u201cNo fever, thank goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same place where I was shoved from the cliff.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew big and her lower lip quivered. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDo... do you think the same guys who pushed you could have killed Bethany? We\u2019ve got to tell the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we have to so we can free Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may not have been the ones who\u2019d thrown her from there. Besides what would I tell the sheriff? That everything I\u2019ve said is a lie?\u201d Hunter ran his thumb over her hand, trying to pacify her, wishing he could reassure her. \u201cThen what would he believe? Maybe I did it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Bethany\u2019s murder happened months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and then here I was at the same crime scene months later. Who\u2019s to say I wasn\u2019t the one who did it, and then like murderers will often do, I came back to investigate the area where I\u2019d committed the crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have done it. You didn\u2019t.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears and his stomach clenched.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t. Three men pushed me off that same cliff. But I don\u2019t know who they were, where I\u2019m really from, or what my last name is even. How will the sheriff believe any of it?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened her back and folded her arms. \u201cWhy did you and Rourke lie about the wolf?\u201d</p><p>Hell, what was he to say now?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an advocate for wolf rights. They cull out the weak and old, unlike human hunters who target the biggest and healthiest elk or deer. Humans kill the prime stock that would provide for more offspring. Wolves go after the easier prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me? You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this one\u2019s so dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTessa, hunters won\u2019t discriminate. Believe me in this. They\u2019d come here in droves, killing anything that moved, hoping to get a chance to take down the devil wolf. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Rottweiler.\u201d Tessa shook her head. \u201cDumbest story Rourke could have made up. He should have at least thought of a dog that looked more like a wolf\u2014that had fur even! Let me finish making lunch, but we\u2019ve got to figure out what we\u2019re going to do about clearing Michael so we can get him released from prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Bethany have a cabin near that burned-up pine tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a mile north of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRourke and I\u2019ll check it out. But I mean it, Tessa. You and Ashton have to stay here in the house at all times when we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d As long as the two of them were together, Tessa figured they would be okay once Hunter had healed up.</p><p>She returned to the kitchen and finished the sandwiches. Looking out the window, she saw Rourke and Ashton talking and examining the ground. So much for replacing the back doorknob.</p><p>\u201cAfter we eat, I\u2019ll look at your injury and see if the bandages need changing yet,\u201d she called out to Hunter.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. She peeked into the living room. The front door was wide open, letting in the frigid air. He was gone. Her heart in her throat, she rushed to the door and looked outside. Hunter was examining the work Ashton and Rourke had done on Michael\u2019s window.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Hunter, you about gave me a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThey did a super job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in here before you get sick again.\u201d</p><p>He saluted her.</p><p>\u201cWrong hand,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t use the other. Shoulder\u2019s too stiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I was afraid you\u2019d forgotten how a Navy SEAL salutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNavy SEALs don\u2019t salute. Not while they\u2019re on a mission and undercover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Like you\u2019d know. So what are you, really?\u201d</p><p>When Rourke and Ashton came back inside to eat lunch, Hunter could tell Rourke had some news for him. Somehow he had to slip away to speak to him in private without Tessa fussing about his injury. But after a nap. He was feeling weary again. Another nap with Tessa would definitely help.</p><p>\u201cFind anything?\u201d Tessa asked as she set out the sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cGray fur,\u201d Ashton said. \u201cRourke\u2019s got great eyesight. He ought to go into the Navy SEALs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere had they been?\u201d She sat down and everyone followed her lead.</p><p>\u201cEverywhere. He found fur down on the beach clinging to driftwood, on the back porch, front porch, by the shed. Just everywhere,\u201d Ashton said.</p><p>Hunter finished off his food in record time and scooted his plate toward Tessa. \u201cGot any more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let her at least eat her food first?\u201d Rourke asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhile Hunter\u2019s incapacitated, I don\u2019t mind babying him. But after that...\u201d</p><p>Hunter gave Rourke a satisfied smirk.</p><p>Tessa glanced at Rourke\u2019s hand. \u201cYour bite. It\u2019s all healed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess it wasn\u2019t as bad as it appeared. The antibiotics helped, too.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his hand and then got up from the chair. \u201cIt looked terrible before.\u201d Taking Hunter\u2019s plate, she made him another sandwich and returned to the table.</p><p>Hunter gave Rourke an irritated look. Keeping a new lupus garou in line was a chore. He would have to tell him everything he could and couldn\u2019t do. Like remove a bandage only after a sufficient amount of time had passed to give the illusion the injury was still healing when around humans. Of course, the bandage scenario was sure to come up with Tessa again where Hunter\u2019s shoulder was concerned, but he would handle it with a lot more finesse.</p><p>Rourke looked a little sheepish and continued to eat in silence.</p><p>Ashton said, \u201cWe went to the cliff where you pushed the wolf off, but didn\u2019t see any sign of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTide had to have washed it out,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a look north of here and see what we can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of exploring with Rourke this afternoon, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother storm\u2019s coming in,\u201d Rourke warned. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look around before that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you watch the weather report? I haven\u2019t heard a thing about it.\u201d Tessa finished her sandwich and sat back against the chair.</p><p>\u201cAt my place. Anyway, you can feel the air growing colder again and smell the wintry moisture in the air.\u201d</p><p>Hunter gave Rourke a warning look, but he wasn\u2019t paying any attention to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say we were going to get sleet and snow before nightfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re guessing?\u201d Tessa began clearing away the dirty dishes. \u201cI thought you got this from the weather report.\u201d</p><p>Hunter finished his lunch. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you show me what you found, Rourke? Ashton can stay with Tessa and change the door locks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go, too.\u201d She shoved the plates in the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cLater, Tessa.\u201d Hunter left the table and grabbed Michael\u2019s field jacket. But when he couldn\u2019t put it on by himself, Rourke helped.</p><p>Tessa watched, her arms folded, her mouth a thin grim line. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be going out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tessa. You can help me with the doorknobs.\u201d Ashton grabbed a paper sack and headed for the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou got one for both the front door and back? He only seems to have a key to the back door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to be safe. And we bought security glass for the window in Michael\u2019s room. The guy won\u2019t be able to break it again. We can replace all of them with that glass if Hunter thinks it\u2019s a good idea, and you want to foot the bill.\u201d</p><p>Hunter figured once he got rid of the stalker menace, she wouldn\u2019t have any more trouble. He went outside with Rourke while Ashton occupied Tessa. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. You\u2019re the expert lupus garou. I discovered dozens of wolves\u2019 scents, tons of wolves\u2019 prints, thousands of wolf fur fibers, and a smattering of wolves\u2019 urine in various places. So you tell me what it all means.\u201d</p><p>Hunter hadn\u2019t realized the smells would probably overload Rourke\u2019s new abilities. From birth, lupus garou filtered out the smells and sounds, but he guessed the sudden onslaught would confuse someone who had just been turned and at the same time, the enhanced abilities could be a distraction.</p> <p>Hunter led Rourke down to the beach. \u201cIf you get injured, from now on, hide the fact you are, or keep the injury bandaged for longer than necessary. And don\u2019t show off your abilities to humans.\u201d</p><p>He thought that went without saying, but apparently not.</p><p>Rourke scowled. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. I kept seeing fur everywhere. I forgot Ashton couldn\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t even realize how it might sound to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always have to remember what we are. When we\u2019re in a wolf pack, no problem. But around humans, watch yourself, always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just turned, remember? I haven\u2019t had much time to get used to this.\u201d Rourke looked up at the clouds. \u201cI can\u2019t see it for the gray skies, but I can feel the moon\u2019s strong pull. I keep wanting to strip off my clothes and run naked through the woods. It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter bent down to check out a piece of fur caught on driftwood. \u201cLater tonight. You and I will take a run, and I\u2019ll show you what it\u2019s all about. That should break you of the urge for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be properly healed for a couple of more days, but the exercise will do it good, give it a stretch. Getting out of Tessa\u2019s sight for a couple of hours is the problem. I\u2019ll take a nap when we get back. We\u2019ll have supper, and then after she\u2019s gone to bed, we\u2019ll take a run.\u201d</p><p>Rourke motioned to the area. \u201cSo what do you make of all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve counted six different gray wolves that have left their mark. The three I fought and three others who seem familiar, but I can\u2019t recall why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Can we fight them all off?\u201d</p> <p>Two shots rang out from the front porch of the house.</p><p>\u201cTessa!\u201d Hunter\u2019s heart pounded against his ribs as he bolted up the rocky path with Rourke hot on his heels.</p><p>Three more shots were fired and a wolf yelped twice before Hunter barreled through the living room, concerned Ashton might shoot them if they came around the side of the house.</p><p>Tessa was holding the rifle, getting ready to fire again, the weapon propped against her shoulder, when Hunter saw Ashton sprawled out on the front porch, his hand bloodied, his face pallid.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Hunter said under his breath. If the damned wolf had turned Ashton... Hunter took the rifle from Tessa.</p><p>She was shaking so hard, he thought she might collapse, her own face flushed, but tears filled her eyes. She dropped to her knees and held Ashton\u2019s uninjured hand. \u201cAshton, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Rourke took the rifle inside, and Hunter crouched beside Tessa. \u201cHe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>She started to cry and her tears undid him. He wrapped his arms around her, her body still trembling.</p> <p>\u201cI... I think I hit the wolf twice. At least he yelped twice. But... oh, Hunter, he\u2019s got to be rabid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Rourke asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get Ashton inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to take him to the clinic in town, or to the hospital in the city. He\u2019s got to be treated for rabies,\u201d Tessa insisted.</p><p>Hunter crouched to lift Ashton, but Rourke grabbed his arm and stopped him. \u201cYou can\u2019t reinjure that shoulder. I\u2019ll lift him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>\u201cYou get the door, Tessa. I\u2019ll just use my good shoulder.\u201d Hunter hated playing the part of a damned invalid even if Rourke was right. He needed to heal so he could be prepared to fight again, as bold and rash as the lupus garous were getting.</p><p>Rourke lifted Ashton\u2019s torso, his gaze shooting up to meet Hunter\u2019s while Hunter carried Ashton\u2019s feet. Yeah, another ability. More strength. Rourke smiled. At least he seemed pleased with the change. Now Hunter had to deal with Ashton, damn it. What the hell was wrong with the lupus garou? Every time they changed a human who had family, it could cause problems. Although there was a slight chance the wolf hadn\u2019t turned Ashton.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to take him to the clinic at least.\u201d Tessa locked the front door after them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the rabies vaccine and antibiotics with us.\u201d Hunter helped carry Ashton into Michael\u2019s room. \u201cRourke will give him a shot. If you\u2019ll get some soap and water for the bite, we\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Tessa hurried out of the room and down the hall.</p><p>Hunter rushed to wrap Ashton\u2019s hand in a towel to hide the bite from Tessa, although he was sure she had seen enough of the damage. When she returned, Hunter took the washcloth and water from her, then handed it to Rourke.</p><p>Ashton was scowling and alert. \u201cBloody damn wolf. Didn\u2019t even see him coming as I finished changing out the doorknob. Thank god he didn\u2019t get Tessa.\u201d</p><p>But most likely he was trying to. Hunter was sure they had frustrated the bastard because they had left the house the night before and were gone for so long, and now had another \u201cguard\u201d to keep Tessa safe.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Hunter took hold of Tessa\u2019s hand. \u201cYou can\u2019t have slept well last night, and I\u2019m feeling dog tired again. What about you?\u201d</p><p>She looked back at Ashton as Hunter led her out of the room. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this discussion before.\u201d Her gaze shifted to Hunter. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t sleep well in that hard chair at the hospital, and when I rested with you, I kept feeling like the nurses would catch us. I must have dropped off right before Ashton walked in on us though. Wouldn\u2019t you know.\u201d</p><p>Hunter smiled at her. Even when she was tired, she was agreeable. Even when she was mad at him, especially when she was mad at him. She reminded him of an alpha then.</p><p>Mentally, he shook his head at himself. He had to quit thinking of her in those terms before he went down the path he knew he shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou locked the back door, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Hunter asked, helping Tessa out of her sweater.</p><p>\u201cYes. You guys left it wide open. I\u2019m going to have to start charging you for the high electric bill I\u2019m bound to get.\u201d She helped Hunter ease out of the field jacket. \u201cYou seem really stiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to work the shoulder out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to let it heal first.\u201d</p><p>He swept his hands down her arms and kissed her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019ll help to make it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ashton!\u201d Rourke shouted down the hall. The back door slammed shut.</p><p>Now what the hell?</p><p>Footsteps ran toward the bedroom, but Hunter jerked the door open and met Rourke midway down the hall. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshton said he had to take a... walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Hunter turned to see Tessa standing in the hallway, her eyes wide. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a nap? I\u2019ll join you in a few minutes. Rourke will stay here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your shoulder.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t reply, just headed for the back door. No time to waste. \u201cDid he take the rifle?\u201d he hollered back to Rourke.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he did.\u201d</p><p>Good. Maybe Ashton hadn\u2019t been turned after all. Maybe he intended to shoot the wolf that bit him. Not good, but better than if he\u2019d been turned.</p><p>Hunter hurried outside, sniffed the air, then saw the rifle next to a patio chair. Damn it. He grabbed the rifle and handed it to Rourke. \u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d</p><p>Then he tore across the patio and headed for the woods. \u201cAshton, come back here this instant!\u201d Hunter hollered in his most threatening alpha voice.</p><p>The wind howled back and he knew the storm would begin soon. But worse, Ashton was bound to get himself into a hell of a lot of trouble without a guide his first time as a wolf.</p><p>Tessa pulled her sweater back on, figuring she couldn\u2019t take a nap now. Not with worrying about Hunter and Ashton\u2019s safety. But she wondered now if Ashton had been infected and could carry rabies, which might account for his strange behavior. Yet she thought it would take longer for a person infected to react. She just hoped to god he didn\u2019t have rabies.</p><p>Trying to settle her upset, she meant to fix a cup of cocoa for her and Rourke and then replace the back doorknob. But when she walked down the hall, she felt the cold wind blowing into the house through the back door.</p><p>A chill sliced through her, and she ran toward the kitchen. \u201cRourke?\u201d she yelled.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer and Tessa felt as afraid as the day she came home from the trial and suspected someone was watching the house. She stepped onto the back patio and stared at where she thought the guys might have gone\u2014north. She hollered again.</p><p>No reply.</p><p>With apprehension, she closed the door and locked it. She\u2019d manage if she didn\u2019t let her fear run amok. Grabbing the new doorknob for the back door, she hoped to replace it before the stalker realized she was home alone, and tried to squash the nerves wreaking havoc with her stomach. She opened the door, her heart gave a jolt, and she squeaked out a scream.</p><p>Nurse Godzilla. Wearing her long dark hair down, she had on a jeans jacket, turtleneck, jeans, and snow boots, the only part of her outfit that looked warm enough for the weather.</p><p>The attractive woman smiled at her in a fake way. \u201cMr. Grey took a powder. The doctor reported his \u2018escape\u2019 to the police. The sheriff should be coming here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here? To warn him?\u201d Tessa assumed the woman wanted to see him instead, try to ignite a flame between them, maybe outside the hospital setting.</p><p>\u201cSure, to warn him.\u201d She looked around the place. \u201cCozy, pretty forest green color scheme. Soft, like you.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cHmm, your other male friend\u2019s changed. Mr. Grey bite him, too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Thank you for the news, if that\u2019s all...? \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cara Woodson, by the way. Can I help you with that?\u201d She pointed at the doorknob in Tessa\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I can manage. Hunter won\u2019t be back for a long while. Maybe you could return some other time.\u201d How was she going to get rid of the pesky woman without just shoving her out the door?</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t stay with you, you know.\u201d Cara grabbed the Phillips-head screwdriver resting on the countertop. She began removing the old doorknob. \u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d</p><p>Barely hearing the question, Tessa was too wrapped up in the woman\u2019s comment about Hunter. \u201cWhy do you think he won\u2019t stay with me? Are you his former lover?\u201d</p><p>Cara laughed. \u201cHardly. Although I\u2019d like the chance to be his new lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not interested.\u201d Tessa had no doubt he wasn\u2019t interested in her. But what if the woman plied her sexual charms on him? Any man would succumb eventually to a seductress.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not interested in me yet because of you. But you\u2019re a temporary fling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know him, how could you think you know so much about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do. So, has someone been getting into your place without permission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Why Tessa said so, she didn\u2019t know. And afterward she wished she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHe has a key? Someone you\u2019ve known? An old lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who it might be.\u201d</p><p>Tessa began installing the new lock while Cara examined the old one.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if he didn\u2019t have a key to your place?\u201d</p><p>Tessa glanced at her. \u201cHow could he not have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he had a skeleton key? A lock-picking toolkit so he can get in anywhere he wants?\u201d</p><p>Tessa felt sick to her stomach. If the guy could get in no matter the kind of lock they installed, she would never be safe until he was caught. Then what? He would get a slap on the hands? A restraining order? Then he would most likely be back to stalking her again.</p><p>\u201cIs Hunter trying to locate the intruder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But then he got bitten and...\u201d Tessa shrugged.</p><p>They finished replacing the doorknob, and Tessa glanced back at the woods. A couple of inches of snow had already fallen. She turned around and found Cara watching her. \u201cSince you came all the way out here, did you want some cocoa before you return to the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That would be grand.\u201d Cara pulled off her jeans jacket and slipped an envelope out of her pocket. \u201cThought maybe you\u2019d like these since your insurance was paying for Hunter\u2019s accident on your property, and he left the hospital\u2019s care early.\u201d</p> <p>Tessa glanced at them.</p><p>\u201cThe release forms. That way you weren\u2019t charged for Hunter\u2019s stay when he\u2019d already left because he hadn\u2019t officially signed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I appreciate it.\u201d Truly she did, but Tessa was torn between being glad the woman was here so she wasn\u2019t alone while the men were gallivanting in the woods, and not liking that Cara would undoubtedly try her womanly charms on Hunter again as soon as he returned.</p><p>\u201cSo what does your intruder look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him, but Ashton says he\u2019s tall, dark-haired like Hunter, and runs pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. So what\u2019s Hunter going to do about it?\u201d Cara grabbed up a couple of napkins like she was used to playing hostess, and when the cocoa was ready she took the mugs to the table.</p><p>Tessa grabbed a package of chocolate wafers and joined her. \u201cHe\u2019s going to turn him over to the sheriff when he catches him. He broke one of my windows and stole my gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGun. Oh. So you couldn\u2019t shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr so he can commit a crime. Listen, I don\u2019t want to keep you long in case the weather gets too bad. Aren\u2019t you working tonight at the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called in sick.\u201d Cara smiled. \u201cHow did you know I was working tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshton checked.\u201d</p><p>Cara\u2019s smiled broadened. \u201cMy, my. He\u2019s the cute guy with the long, blond hair? Sharp blue eyes? Muscular build, but not quite as much as Hunter? So he wanted to know when I was coming back on duty?\u201d</p><p>Tessa laughed inwardly. Wouldn\u2019t the woman like to know the real reason Ashton wanted to know and what he really thought of her? On the other hand, it wouldn\u2019t hurt for Tessa to spark the woman\u2019s interest in Ashton if it meant she would leave Hunter alone. Ashton definitely deserved some payback after what he had pulled with her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could take a look at his wound. Hunter and Rourke took care of it, but since you\u2019re a nurse, I\u2019d feel better if you made sure it was really all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to.\u201d Cara frowned. \u201cWhy did they leave you alone? Are they in pursuit of this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not exactly. Ashton took off for whatever reason. Hunter told Rourke to stay with me, but the next thing I knew, he\u2019d taken off after them. At least I presume he had.\u201d Tessa pointed at the rifle. \u201cThey left that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how to shoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why would I own a gun if I didn\u2019t? I got off a couple of rounds into the wolf that bit Ashton, I think.\u201d</p><p>Cara\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, well, good shooting.\u201d</p><p>Tessa raised the mug to her lips to take another sip when the doorbell rang. Her heart skipped a beat, and she nearly dropped her mug.</p><p>\u201cShall we see who it is? Maybe it\u2019s the sheriff.\u201d Cara sounded perfectly fearless.</p><p>Tessa wished she felt as sure of herself. But the wolf attack that had followed the ringing of the doorbell earlier still had her spooked.</p><p>Tessa set her mug down and grabbed the rifle, just in case it wasn\u2019t the sheriff. Or maybe it was Hunter or one of the others. She had locked them out of the house.</p><p>But when she looked through the peephole, she saw a striking brunette, her amber eyes peering back at her. Uncle Basil\u2019s niece?</p><p>Figuring as irritated as the woman looked, she\u2019d give Tessa some more guff, she opened the door. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowing, the woman growled, \u201cWhere the hell is Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>HUNTER FOUND ASHTON\u2019S CLOTHES DITCHED ABOUT a mile north of Tessa\u2019s house and swore under his breath. He removed his clothes, shuddered in the frigid air, ripped off his bandages, and changed into the wolf. But it wasn\u2019t painless this time. Sharp streaks stabbed through his injured shoulder, hurting more than he thought it would. All he wanted was to return to Tessa, nap, snuggle, and a hell of a lot more if she was receptive. He would kill Ashton.</p><p>For three miles he trotted after him, stopping to sniff at the scents in the air, checking the direction Ashton went. Ashton had marked \u201chis\u201d territory four times already. Idiot. If he came across the brothers Grimm, he would never be able to handle a wolf-to-wolf fight. Not as a newly turned lupus garou, Hunter didn\u2019t think.</p><p>Although if Tessa did manage to shoot one of them twice, he probably wouldn\u2019t be messing with anyone for a while. The one with the broken leg would be pretty incapacitated still. Hunter relaxed a little.</p><p>Until he heard a wolf howl somewhere in the distance farther north. Ashton. Maybe.</p><p>Hunter headed in the wolf\u2019s direction. The snow was falling heavier, the air colder, the flakes burying the evergreens, making them droop like white-bearded old men. The place was already looking like a winter wonderland again.</p><p>The pain in Hunter\u2019s shoulder seemed to grow incrementally every step he took. Going for a run with Rourke later was now out of the question. He hoped Rourke could hold off a while longer.</p><p>Something moved to the west, catching his eye. He whipped around. A cougar stood still, holding a rabbit between his teeth, his eyes wary as he watched Hunter.</p><p>His heart thundering, Hunter waited, twitching his ears back and forth, listening to the rapid beat of the cougar\u2019s heart. With any luck, the cougar would take his meal and go, but he stared Hunter down like any feral predator would. Messing with a wild cat when they were protecting their meal could be a dangerous proposition. One of his lupus garou pack had perished when fighting a cougar this big, and Hunter had no intention of tangling with him when he needed to protect that idiot Ashton.</p><p>A twig snapped west of them. The cougar bolted through the woods and the reason came into view. Ashton\u2014his fur more of a beige, his snout a little darker, a dead duck in his mouth. If Hunter could laugh in his wolf form at the ridiculousness of it, he would.</p><p>Movement in the woods behind Hunter made him twist around. Pain sliced through his shoulder. Fury slid through his veins, setting his blood on fire as he found Rourke facing him. His fur a dark brown, he bowed his head slightly to Hunter.</p><p>Holy crap! He would kill the two of them. Hunter raced in the direction where he\u2019d left his clothes, but even so it would take valuable time to get there, dress, and run home. If anything happened to Tessa, he would never forgive himself.</p><p>Even though he kept telling himself he should have left Ashton and Rourke to fend for themselves after what they\u2019d pulled, he couldn\u2019t. Not by lupus garou laws. Once they were turned, they had to be somebody\u2019s responsibility and no one else was stepping up for the job.</p><p>Technically, Tessa wasn\u2019t his responsibility. So why was his human side casting away all his inborn rules? Damn it to hell. If anything happened to her... there would be hell to pay.</p><p>When he finally reached his clothes, he shoved them on, no longer feeling the pain in his shoulder because of the adrenaline spiking through his system. Ashton ran up beside him, the stupid dead mallard still in his mouth. Rourke ran ahead toward the house. No sign of his clothes, so he must have changed sooner after he left the house. Hell, hopefully, not in front of Tessa.</p><p>His heart hammering, Hunter sprinted for the house. A couple of hours had already passed since he had left Tessa, and he still had another damn mile left to go in the snowdrifts.</p><p>The brunette\u2019s amber eyes speared Tessa, then she turned her attention to Cara. \u201cWhere the hell is Hunter?\u201d she repeated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs he your brother?

It isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. Tessa hadn\u2019t meant to tell the world, but if this woman knew Hunter... \u201cCome inside. Hunter had a terrible accident, and he\u2019s lost his memory, but he\u2019s been regaining it in bits and pieces.\u201d</p> <p>The woman\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s... he\u2019s okay.

Would you like some cocoa?\u201d</p><p>The woman pointed at Cara and growled, \u201cWho\u2019s she to Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Cara smiled in an evil way. \u201cHis personal nurse.\u201d She tilted her nose up and took in a deep breath. \u201cAnd you\u2019re his sister?\u201d</p><p>Having had the sinking feeling the woman might be his girlfriend, Tessa could now see the resemblance, the same dark hair, the same colored eyes, the well-defined cheekbones and aristocratic noses, and relief washed over her. \u201cMeara?\u201d</p> <p>The woman frowned. \u201cHow did you know my name if he lost his memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called it out when he was delirious the one night. He remembered having a sister, but not his full name or where he was from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was he injured?\u201d</p><p>The women followed Tessa into the kitchen where she refilled mugs with fresh cocoa. \u201cHe said three men pushed him off a cliff.\u201d</p><p>Her face colorless, Meara gripped the back of one of the kitchen chairs. \u201cUncle Basil said you were trouble.\u201d</p><p>Tessa didn\u2019t fully believe it when he\u2019d been so kind to her, yet an inkling of self-doubt wormed its way into her system.</p> <p>\u201cOh boy,\u201d Cara said, casting Meara a look. \u201cNot good. A guy\u2019s been breaking into Tessa\u2019s house also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures.\u201d Meara shook her head. \u201cGreymere\u2019s our name.\u201d</p><p>At least Hunter had half of his name right.</p><p>\u201cSo if you work at the hospital in the city, what are you doing way out here?\u201d Meara asked in the same manner she spoke to Tessa, and she figured it was just her way. Or she didn\u2019t like women much.</p><p>Cara didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by the sarcasm in Meara\u2019s voice and shrugged. \u201cHunter left the hospital without being released first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Meara said, her brows knitting together. \u201cHe was in the hospital because of the fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wolf bit him.\u201d Tessa served up the cocoa. \u201cHe said he had a phobia about hospitals. That he couldn\u2019t stand being in a hospital longer than necessary.\u201d</p><p>Meara cast Cara a look.</p> <p>Cara smiled. the look was a bit devious, which made Tessa wonder what was up between them. Even though Meara didn\u2019t seem to care for Cara, a mutual connection seemed to exist, like between Cara and Hunter. Tessa shook her head, annoyed at herself for overanalyzing people\u2019s darker motives when there was probably nothing to them, as usual.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me why he has such a phobia?\u201d Tessa ushered them into the living room.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>No, as in she didn\u2019t know? Or she did and wouldn\u2019t tell Tessa?</p><p>Meara sat down on the couch, her eyes taking in every detail in the place from the fire in the brick fireplace, to the photos of wildlife on the wall. Tessa wondered what she was thinking, but the woman\u2019s face remained impassive. \u201cHow long has Hunter been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn overnight stay at the hospital also,\u201d Cara added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take him off your hands,\u201d Meara said softly, changing her whole demeanor. \u201cWhere did you say he went?\u201d</p><p>Tessa didn\u2019t want Hunter taken off her hands. She wanted to wrap him in her arms and stay there until spring. Already lack of sleep was giving her a major headache.</p><p>Cara gave Meara a small smile. \u201cI think Hunter\u2019s way over his head on this one.\u201d</p><p>Both women looked in the direction of the kitchen seconds before someone banged on the door like he intended to break it in. Tessa grabbed the rifle and headed for the kitchen, but when she saw Hunter and Rourke at the door, she quickly set the gun down and unlocked it.</p><p>Hunter took Tessa into his arms and squeezed the breath out of her. \u201cThank god, you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>And at once she sensed he really did feel something for her deep down, while she felt the same kind of incomprehensible bond between them.</p><p>He separated from her a little and gazed down at her. A hint of tears filled his eyes, and the sight of them touched her soul. He hugged her again. Wrapping her arms around him, she basked in his heated embrace, forgetting for the moment his sister was behind her, or that Nurse Godzilla would make a move on Ashton next. At least Tessa assumed she would.</p><p>Ashton entered the kitchen and set a dead duck on her counter. What...?</p><p>Rourke came up behind Hunter. \u201cWhat the hell is the nurse from the hospital doing here? And who is she?\u201d</p><p>That was when Hunter saw his sister and dropped Tessa like she was a burning ember. Not expecting to be coldly thrust aside, she felt a heartbeat of rejection, but then quickly reminded herself his seeing his sister had to be quite a shock. But would he remember her? And everything about his past life?</p><p>\u201cMeara.\u201d He stared at her for a long moment and then hurried to hug her. \u201cMeara.\u201d</p><p>Thank god, he remembered her.</p><p>\u201cDear brother. I thought I\u2019d lost you. I\u2019ve been looking for you for three days. Then I tracked you here.</p><p>Tessa said you\u2019d lost your memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Meara, you\u2019d taken off with...\u201d He glanced back at Tessa, his eyes and face hard. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He pulled Meara outside. \u201cWho the hell were they and where the hell did you go?\u201d He slammed the door closed.</p><p>So he did remember more.</p><p>Figuring the family reunion would go a lot better than that if her own brother had been returned to her, Tessa\u2019s mouth gaped in surprise. Apparently Hunter\u2019s seeing his sister did bring back memories, but that didn\u2019t seem to be a good thing.</p><p>Hunter escorted his sister far enough away from the house that no one could hear them. He glowered at her, waiting for Meara to tell him what had happened, the notion of her disappearing from the house in the company of the three gray males hitting him like an icy avalanche of bad memories.</p><p>\u201cQuit looking at me like the devil\u2019s possessed me, Hunter!\u201d She looked out to the ocean.</p><p>She was beautiful and any one of a number of males would want her, but her reluctance to choose a mate from the alphas she\u2019d seen fit to date was one thing\u2014 running off with a bunch of horny betas quite another.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she finally said under her breath. \u201cI... I came right home after the idiots talked me into running with them for a while. It didn\u2019t take much time for me to appreciate none of them would interest me for very long. I... I didn\u2019t realize someone would have tried to kill you in the meantime.\u201d She glanced up at him, her body shuddering in the cold wind.</p><p>He took her arm and pulled her into his embrace. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stick together, Meara. No matter what else happens with the pack, we\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked everywhere for you, and then thought about this Tessa Anderson woman and how she\u2019d intrigued you. I thought maybe you\u2019d come here to be with her. I smelled your scent here, and sat on the back patio, hoping you\u2019d look out and see me. But Tessa peered out the window instead. I figured you\u2019d succumbed to her charms. I\u2019d considered howling to let you know I was out back, but I was afraid the men I\u2019d run off from might locate me. So I returned home. The next morning I drove here, but no one was here. I had no way of knowing you had been injured so badly.\u201d Tears glistened in Meara\u2019s eyes, and as much as she tried to hide her feelings, he knew she felt badly that her irresponsibility could have gotten him killed. But worse, she would have been left alone to fend for herself, and that made his stomach clench even tighter.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d she said.</p><p>He explained about the three brothers, the mess Tessa was in, and the problem with the two newly turned lupus garous. Meara had been quiet, taking everything in, until he came to Rourke\u2019s story. And then she laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cI never expected to find you\u2014the great Hunter\u2014in such a quandary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, hell, if you hadn\u2019t run off...\u201d He said the harsh words before he could stop himself.</p><p>She focused on his chest, and he was afraid she was going to dissolve into tears. But then she raised her gaze, cast him an irritated look, and tried to put the blame on him again. Knowing her, she couldn\u2019t deal with the guilt.</p><p>\u201cYou know how important it is to keep our situation secret from humans. Isn\u2019t that what\u2019s drummed into us? Kill them if they get wind of the truth. Or change them only if the situation truly warrants it. What a mess. How are you going to fix all this, Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have been getting the cabins ready to rent out, waiting on the pack to tire of the city and join us.\u201d But even thinking of that, he couldn\u2019t believe how all the memories flooded back to him so quickly. The fire, losing their home, Uncle Basil\u2019s warning him to take \u201ccare\u201d of Tessa Anderson, and the subsequent fight he\u2019d had with the gray wolves when he\u2019d gone in search of his wayward sister. He was certain his uncle hadn\u2019t quite had this scenario in mind when he gifted the properties to Hunter though.</p><p>\u201cNone of our people have returned yet.\u201d Meara pushed her windswept hair out of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Leidolf, the red pack leader in Portland, hasn\u2019t chased them off yet. Maybe our pack members are behaving themselves for a change.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it for a second.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAs soon as I resolve this situation with the gray who\u2019s stalking Tessa, I\u2019ll make the trip to Portland and force the pack to return.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay here.

You\u2019ll change half the population of Oregon if I leave you alone again.\u201d</p> <p>He grunted and moved her toward the house. \u201cYou\u2019re staying with me until I take care of the gray.\u201d</p><p>She growled, and he knew the fight had only just begun.</p><p>\u201cFamily feud,\u201d Cara said, motioning to Hunter and Meara outside, then turned her attention to Ashton. \u201cWent hunting, I see. I like duck, too.\u201d</p><p>Rourke rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m getting a shower before supper.\u201d He looked at the clean kitchen. \u201cYou are fixing it soon, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just ate a little over three hours ago!\u201d Tessa declared.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s long enough. I\u2019m starving. So is Ashton.\u201d Rourke waved at the dead duck.</p><p>\u201cHunter, too, after all the exercise we had.\u201d He stalked down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a chance to have lunch,\u201d Cara said.</p><p>Well, Tessa wasn\u2019t hungry. She glanced out the kitchen window. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re going to get snowed in. You might want to leave before that happens,\u201d she said to Cara. Tessa had no idea why she would want to save Ashton\u2019s butt. Although he cast her a grateful look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hang around. I haven\u2019t been with... a lot of people... on a more social basis for a number of years. This is the most fun I\u2019ve had in eons,\u201d Cara said.</p><p>Tessa couldn\u2019t understand what the woman was talking about. No one seemed enthusiastic about seeing her even. Why would she think anyone wanted to be around her?</p> <p>\u201cDid you lose your bandages, Ashton?\u201d Cara asked, her voice sultry and sexy as she took hold of his injured hand. \u201cTessa, do you have some new ones? I\u2019ll fix him right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll get them and the antibiotics.\u201d Tessa glanced at Ashton\u2019s hand, but Cara was holding it so that she couldn\u2019t see the bite wound.</p><p>When Tessa returned to the kitchen, Hunter and Meara had come back inside. For being reunited after losing her brother, and considering the ordeal he had been through, they scowled at each other and didn\u2019t appear grateful in the least. But worse, gone was Hunter\u2019s lustful interest in Tessa. At once she felt she was the center of the controversy and wasn\u2019t good enough for the family.</p><p>Well, he had said he couldn\u2019t promise her anything. Just that he would help her find Bethany\u2019s murderer and set her brother free. Tessa should have known when his memory came back, she would be history. But no matter how she tried to reconcile herself with the notion, she couldn\u2019t squash the dismal feeling he would soon abandon her.</p><p>\u201cHere, Cara.\u201d Tessa handed her the bandages. \u201cI guess everyone\u2019s staying for dinner?\u201d She cast Hunter a questioning glance. She halfway expected him to say he was leaving with his sister for good now.</p><p>His brows still furrowed, his lips grim, he nodded. He gave Meara a hard look. She folded her arms and looked doubly cross at Tessa. So much for a lovely dinner when she wasn\u2019t even hungry. Cara was the only one who seemed to be pleased to be here, and the one Tessa really wanted to see leave.</p><p>Tessa pulled out a package of hot links. \u201cCan everyone manage spaghetti with hot sausage, bell peppers, and onions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, sounds good to me,\u201d Cara said, licking her lips while she bandaged Ashton\u2019s hand with tender loving care. He tried to jerk his hand away, but she held on tight and tsked.</p> <p>\u201cAnything you fix is fine with us.\u201d Hunter\u2019s tone of voice was terse.</p><p>Meara didn\u2019t have a choice?</p><p>Wearing a towel, Rourke came out of the bathroom and hollered from the hallway, \u201cFine with me.\u201d</p><p>How had he heard what she\u2019d asked? She stared after him as he slipped into Michael\u2019s room to grab some clothes. What had gotten into him? She\u2019d never thought he\u2019d dress so scantily in front of a bunch of women.</p><p>\u201cThe snow\u2019s bound to make the road impassable again. Is anyone leaving soon?\u201d She directed the question at Cara and Meara. \u201cThe food won\u2019t take long to fix so we can eat and let you get on your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo work for me tonight,\u201d Cara said cheerfully.</p><p>Hunter grunted. \u201cMeara\u2019s staying here with me for as long as I need to be here.\u201d</p><p>For as long as he needed to be here. Well, that said it all. Once he was done helping her, Hunter was out of here.</p><p>Fine with Tessa. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll want to sleep with your sister then, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cara laughed. \u201cA macho male like Hunter sleeping with his sister? That would be the day.\u201d</p><p>Tessa sure wasn\u2019t sleeping with Hunter under the current circumstances. \u201cOkay, well, you and Meara can sleep together and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with Ashton,\u201d Cara announced, her eyes flashing with humor. \u201cHe might need medical attention during the night. Look at how pale the poor man is.\u201d</p><p>He had been, but now his face flushed crimson. Tessa had never seen him blush. She expected some objection from Lord Hunter, but he didn\u2019t say anything. She was really surprised Ashton wouldn\u2019t have nixed Cara\u2019s suggestion himself.</p><p>Tessa threw the fajita bell pepper and onion mix into the saucepan, added the sausage links, and then the tomato sauce. \u201cOkay, then Hunter and Rourke can take the spare bedroom and Meara and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sleep alone,\u201d Meara said, fire burning in her eyes.</p><p>Wearing a clean pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, Rourke walked into the room. More casual than she had ever seen him. In fact, the sweatshirt belonged to her brother.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind sleeping by the fire. I can watch the rest of the house that way in the event anyone plans to break in,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tessa considered Hunter\u2019s expression, but it was still dark as ever. About the sleeping arrangements? Or something else?</p><p>She coyly smiled. \u201cHunter, you can sleep with Rourke by the fire and keep him company.\u201d</p><p>Meara laughed, a catty, annoyed kind of laugh. She stalked into the kitchen and began opening drawers. When she found the silverware, she set it on the table.</p><p>Guess she could be a little bit of help. Maybe Meara was mad at Hunter and not at her. Still, Tessa had every intention of cooling her relationship with Hunter because when he left, she didn\u2019t want to be upset over it for days, weeks, months afterward. Best to end this insane infatuation now.</p><p>Life had been so simple for Hunter after Tessa had found him on the beach: discover his identity, learn what had happened to him, deal with Tessa\u2019s stalker, and find Bethany\u2019s murderer so Michael could be released from prison.</p><p>Now he had to deal with two freshly turned lupus garous. And Meara. Unfortunately, she had been right concerning everything they had fought about.. All that mattered was the lupus garous\u2019 safety and secrecy. He knew that. As pack leader, he sure as hell didn\u2019t want his sister reminding him of the fact. He should have taken Meara, Rourke, and Ashton back to his cabin resort up north once he learned that\u2019s where he lived and pretended Tessa and her problems didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>Any other alpha leader would not have allow himself to be dragged into human affairs.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t abandon her. Not yet. Tessa had taken him in and cared for him when she didn\u2019t have a clue as to who he was. If he left her alone, the stalker would change her against her will. Hunter wouldn\u2019t let him. Another alpha leader, given the same scenario, would take the gray to task also, if he had been in his territory, but beyond that, she would be on her own. For now, Tessa\u2019s property was in Hunter\u2019s territory\u2014newly franchised.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let her brother stay in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. No other wolf would feel obligated to help out in a case like this\u2014except in the event one of their kind did the killing. Dealing with the lupus garou would be the end of it though. No lupus garou would try to release an innocent human. In fact, he would serve to keep the lupus garous out of the limelight. But Hunter couldn\u2019t allow it, although how he was going to get Michael out of his incarceration eluded him. First of course, he had to prove the grays had committed the crime.</p><p>To complicate matters, Hunter had to force Meara to stay with him and keep her out of trouble. Her first wolf heat was making her crotchety and difficult to handle. Thank heavens he didn\u2019t have any more sisters and that none of the three wolves she had taken off with had forced a mating. She needed an alpha to spar with and keep her in line.</p><p>Tessa placed the spaghetti in the pan of boiling water, her back rigid. He took a ragged breath. His shoulder was killing him after running in the woods for so many miles as a wolf today, and all he could think about was making love to the woman who heated his blood as hot as the raging fires they\u2019d left behind in California.</p><p>Sleep with his sister? That would be the day. And have Rourke sleep with Meara? She would bite him for sure and not in a playful way. Hunter was glad Cara was targeting Ashton as her love interest. He needed to remind him, though, if he mated her, it was a onetime deal. No fooling around a few nights, and then parting ways, although if she did mate him, that might be the solution to one of his problems. She would teach Ashton the ways of being a lupus garou and take him off Hunter\u2019s hands.</p><p>If Tessa thought Hunter was sleeping with Rourke in the living room, she could think again. For one, he didn\u2019t trust that the gray might not attempt to break her window and get in while she was alone. All he would do was bite her, and then come back to claim her later once she was a lupus garou. Hunter assumed the gray had intended to kill Ashton, and then bite Tessa, but when she brought out the rifle and started shooting, he gave that notion up in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cHunter,\u201d Meara said. \u201cGathering wool? We\u2019re all sitting down to eat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tessa had moved her plate to the foot of the table and had seated Meara next to him in her place. He smiled at Tessa\u2019s tenacity. Still, he was angry with himself for feeling more than he should toward Tessa and that Meara had to remind him of his duty to their pack, but most of all to their kind. Yet, he couldn\u2019t help but admire the spunky human female.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting married in the spring,\u201d Cara said, as the tension escalated in the dining room as thick as the snow was getting outside. \u201cWon\u2019t they make a cute couple?\u201d</p><p>Meara choked on her water. Tessa avoided looking at Hunter and cut up her sausage.</p> <p>\u201cShe just said that so she could get in to see Hunter at the hospital.\u201d Rourke glowered at Cara. \u201cWhy are you here anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bring the hospital release forms for Hunter. So what do we do after dinner? Do you have any board games? Cards? Anyone want to play strip poker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we finish here, I need a word with Ashton, and then we\u2019re all going to bed. We\u2019ve had quite a day of it. And we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do tomorrow,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>\u201cCan I be in on this little adventure?\u201d Cara asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can keep Tessa company. Both you and Meara. Rourke and I have some hunting to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I go, too?\u201d Ashton asked, looking chagrined.</p><p>Cara patted his arm. \u201cWe need you to protect us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to Bethany\u2019s place? They\u2019ve removed the police locks, and I have a key if you need one,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll need a key.\u201d</p><p>Tessa\u2019s eyes filled with tears and Hunter couldn\u2019t tell if she was happy he was still looking into this situation for her brother, or was worried they wouldn\u2019t discover who really murdered Bethany.</p><p>Meara cleared her throat and patted Hunter\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd if you see those three guys I was with while you\u2019re at it, don\u2019t kill them, okay, Hunter? We were just having some fun. Nothing more.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter gave her a dark look. He wanted to bang those guys\u2019 heads together for stealing an alpha leader\u2019s sister right out from under his nose. They had to be some of the dumbest betas around. He thought his sister would have had better sense. He was surprised neither Ashton nor Rourke showed any interest in her. But maybe they were afraid of how Hunter might react\u2014and for good reason.</p><p>After dinner, Cara and Meara helped Tessa with the dishes. Rourke and Ashton went with Hunter to get another load of firewood in case the electricity went out again. The wind was gusting higher and the waves were growing more violent. If the weather got much worse, the increasing storm would flood the beach, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to forage for firewood.</p><p>\u201cRemember how I told the two of you that mating is for life? That\u2019s something that can\u2019t be broken except by death. It might be a hard concept for you to understand since you\u2019ve always been human, but it\u2019s the wolf way and the lupus garou way.\u201d</p><p>Rourke grabbed an armload of wood. \u201cWhat about Tessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s different.\u201d Hunter didn\u2019t want to have to defend his actions to a subordinate wolf and wouldn\u2019t have if it hadn\u2019t been that Rourke was Tessa\u2019s friend and was sincerely concerned about her well-being.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, she\u2019s human so her feelings don\u2019t count.\u201d Rourke headed back up the hill.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Rourke, of course her feelings matter. We\u2019re both adults. We had consensual sex and that\u2019s all there is to it. As a lupus garou we can\u2019t have sex with another lupus garou unless we accept the female as a permanent mate. Humans don\u2019t live by the same rules, as well you know. And I\u2019ve already explained to her our relationship can\u2019t be permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if we want to party with a woman, she has to be a human.\u201d Ashton trudged up the slope with an armload of timber behind Hunter.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, so that means you can sleep with Cara, but no sex. If you go all the way with her, you\u2019re mated\u2014 for life.\u201d</p><p>Rourke chuckled. \u201cWhat if she forces herself on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the case of a forced mating, the punishment for the perpetrator is death. Unless the victim chooses to accept the perpetrator as his or her mate. We don\u2019t tolerate the abuse of our lupus garous or laws.\u201d</p><p>Wide-eyed, both Rourke and Ashton stared at him.</p><p>\u201cHell, I knew it would be a lot of trouble teaching the two of you all the rules.\u201d Hunter gave Ashton a sympathetic look. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want Cara for a mate, just say no. Firmly! Don\u2019t waffle.\u201d</p><p>Rourke laughed out loud. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like she readily accepts taking no for an answer. Thank god she latched onto Ashton and not me.\u201d</p><p>When Hunter opened the back door, he heard Cara say, \u201cIf you want him\u2014\u201d She abruptly quit speaking, but he wished he knew who she had been talking to and who \u201che\u201d referred to.</p><p>\u201cAshton, do something with that dead duck.\u201d Hunter motioned to the kitchen on his way to the living room. \u201cStick it in the fridge or something.\u201d</p><p>Then he walked into the living room and found the three women watching him. \u201cEarly morning, ladies. Let\u2019s get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he always this bossy?\u201d Tessa rose from the couch, scarcely giving him a look.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Meara said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some sheets and blankets, Rourke.\u201d Brushing past Hunter, Tessa headed down the hall.</p><p>Cara hopped up from recliner. \u201cNeed some bandaging, Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Hell, he forgot he\u2019d removed his bandages on the run, and Tessa was sure to wonder how come he was healing so fast as soon as she saw his naked torso when they went to bed. \u201cYeah, let\u2019s go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>In the hall, they passed Tessa carrying an armful of bedding, and she gave Hunter a scornful look. He was definitely in the doghouse, but he didn\u2019t know why. He closed the bathroom door behind him.</p><p>Cara located the bandages in a drawer. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to turn her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you look at her, you could melt her heart. She\u2019ll accept our ways before long.\u201d Cara taped up his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShe has a brother. Even in the distant past, lupus garous targeted those who had no families so they wouldn\u2019t be missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, so change her brother, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got enough trouble on my hands in the form of two new lupus garous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wound is looking much better, but I bet it hurts after that run you took for as long as you were gone.\u201d She found some medicine and handed him a glass of water. \u201cI want to join your pack.\u201d</p><p>He choked on the pills. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like pack politics.\u201d All he needed was another female alpha upstart in the pack. Although they were always short on females, and she might entice some of the rest of his pack to return.</p><p>She smiled and wound a dark curl around her finger. \u201cI didn\u2019t like my pack\u2019s politics. But I\u2019m intrigued with yours. Besides, you need some help with these new guys. I don\u2019t think your sister is interested in showing them the ropes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push Ashton too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, he\u2019s an awfully interesting candidate. The vote is still out on him. But I\u2019ll let you know one way or another what I decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. He doesn\u2019t understand our rules, even though I\u2019ve explained them to him. Don\u2019t force him on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in seduce him? I\u2019ll try not to.\u201d</p><p>Someone banged on the bathroom door. \u201cAre you going to hog the bathroom all night, Hunter?\u201d Meara scolded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use the master bathroom since you\u2019ll be sleeping in the master\u2019s bedroom anyway?\u201d</p><p>Cara patted Hunter on the chest. \u201cYep, you could use my help.\u201d</p><p>Hunter opened the bathroom door, brushed past his sister, and stalked into the living room. Time to settle matters between him and Tessa and get a good night\u2019s sleep.</p><p>Tessa was speaking low to Rourke while she helped him make a bed on the couch. Hell, couldn\u2019t Rourke make his own damned bed?</p><p>She gave Hunter a cursory glance and then ignored him. He shared a look with Rourke that meant he had better not be getting any ideas about Tessa either.</p><p>Rourke quickly caught the message. \u201cI can do the rest of this. Thanks, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>Hunter seized Tessa\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving early in the morning, Rourke, so get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>Before Tessa could object, Hunter hauled her down the hall.</p><p>Cara winked at her from the entrance to Michael\u2019s bedroom. \u201cSleep tight.\u201d</p><p>Meara was already running the shower in the guest bathroom, and Ashton had gone to bed. Hunter hoped Ashton could resist Cara\u2019s charms if he didn\u2019t truly want her in the event the woman decided to seduce him after all.</p><p>In Tessa\u2019s bedroom, Hunter released her hand and shut the door.</p><p>She folded her arms and glowered at him. \u201cWhat, Hunter? What do you want from me? I\u2019m not in the habit of having flings with guys I\u2019ve just met. And since you\u2019ve made it abundantly clear you\u2019re leaving as soon as you fulfill your promise, I don\u2019t want you staying in here with me any longer.\u201d</p><p>Hunter motioned to the window. \u201cIf I leave you alone, the stalker could try to break in. So I\u2019m staying with you, end of discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all the reason you\u2019re giving for wanting to sleep with me?\u201d Her eyes flamed hotter than a fire\u2019s blue flame.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty damned good reason.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and headed for the master bathroom, walked inside, and slammed the door.</p><p>He raised his brows. If he didn\u2019t know better, he would think Tessa was going through her first wolf\u2019s heat. Women.</p><p>He yanked off his shoes, sweatshirt, and pants and climbed into bed. Why couldn\u2019t women be more like men? More... logical? Surely, she could see how he needed to be here for her protection after all that had happened. He pulled the covers to his waist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took forever in the shower and even longer drying her hair. The mattress in Michael\u2019s bedroom began to squeak, the bed frame banging lightly against the opposite wall. Hunter shook his head.</p><p>Tessa came out of the bathroom wearing a pair of pink flannel pajamas covered in red lips and pink hearts and a pair of fuzzy pink, red and white striped socks. She again folded her arms and gave him an icy look, although her bedroom attire ruined her angry effect. Not only that, but if she thought wearing pj\u2019s hid that sexy body of hers, she was mistaken.</p><p>Even now her nipples stood out against the soft fabric, and he was ready to tackle her, drag her to bed, and ravish her.</p> <p>She opened her mouth to speak, but Michael\u2019s bed banged violently against the wall, making her hesitate and glance in that direction. Hunter smiled.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cGreat. I hope that doesn\u2019t go on all night. Why don\u2019t you just move the dresser in front of the window like we did in Michael\u2019s room? Then you can stay with Rourke and you won\u2019t have to baby-sit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tessa. Get in bed. Heater\u2019s off. The room\u2019s cold. Join me under the covers and get warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warm enough.\u201d She jerked her covers aside and climbed into bed.</p><p>\u201cDo you always wear such sexy nightclothes?\u201d</p> <p>She gave him a derisive hmpf back. He chuckled. \u201cI thought all women wore T-shirts to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been with a lot?\u201d</p><p>As many years as he had lived, yes. But in the scheme of things, no. And certainly not recently. The worst was during the Victorian era. Although some of the ladies were daring enough to strip down to bare skin, some insisted they remain fully dressed in their long nightgowns while he satisfied them. Pj\u2019s were certainly no obstacle. \u201cThere\u2019s been no one for a long time, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>And never anyone as special as her.</p><p>\u201cI wear pajamas in the winter because I don\u2019t like to waste electricity heating the place at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm-hmm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? You think I\u2019m just wearing these because you\u2019re here? I usually sleep alone and that\u2019s why I wear warm pj\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnuggle with me, Tessa. Then we\u2019ll both be warm.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything. He waited for her to come to him like she had done before, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear T-shirts in the summer either,\u201d she finally remarked.</p><p>Nude, that\u2019s the way he liked his women, but he didn\u2019t figure Tessa ever went to bed like that. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t wear pajamas in the summertime, do you slide naked into a bed of satin sheets?\u201d</p><p>She offered a derisive chuckle. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to visit you in the summer then.\u201d</p><p>She remained silent.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Tessa. I\u2019m getting cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut Michael\u2019s sweatshirt on then.\u201d</p><p>Fine. He took the initiative. He knew he shouldn\u2019t. She was right in trying to keep the distance between them. But he also recognized she wanted him as much as he wanted her.</p><p>He moved closer to her and pulled her into his arms, but she remained rigid. He tried to caress her hair, but a twinge of pain streaked through his shoulder, and he groaned.</p><p>The tension seemed to drain from her spine, and she melted in his embrace. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have carried that load of firewood up to the house. What were you trying to prove? How macho you are to the other guys? They weren\u2019t injured as badly as you. You could use some common sense.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed the top of her head.</p><p>She turned slightly toward him, her brows pinched, her eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you hurting really badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d he admitted, since she seemed to like him better when he was in pain or he would never have said.</p><p>\u201cWell, lie on your back and I\u2019ll...\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll snuggle with you so you don\u2019t have to hurt your shoulder.\u201d</p><p>He was about to say something, but decided he would be better off not in case he ruined her generous offer. Instead, he rolled onto his back. He wanted to feel her against him, skin to skin, even though her flannel pajamas were soft and cuddly. At this point, he didn\u2019t figure he could push her to remove her clothes. She reached over to join him, brushing her fingers over his naked thigh.</p><p>She recoiled. \u201cWhere are your sweatpants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, in situations where a person is hypothermic, naked bodies pressed together provide more heat than if they\u2019re clothed.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth gaped and her gaze narrowed again. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not hypothermic. Are you?\u201d</p><p>Luckily, because of the dark, she couldn\u2019t see the way he was grinning at her. \u201cI\u2019m feeling chilled to the bone after chasing down Ashton and then getting a load of firewood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could turn on the heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, waste of electricity.\u201d He reached over and unbuttoned her top button. \u201cCome warm me, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Cara\u2019s warming Ashton?\u201d</p><p>He was pretty sure Tessa\u2019s voice held a hint of sarcasm not hope.</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t answer and when she didn\u2019t stop him, he finished unfastening her buttons and removed her top, taking a deep breath to see her breasts heavy and her nipples already hard.</p><p>Despite wanting to make love to her, he knew he had to leave the decision up to her. They both recognized it couldn\u2019t last.</p><p>At first, he took it slow and easy, sliding her pajama bottoms down her silky thighs. He forgot how much his shoulder hurt or how he shouldn\u2019t be making love with the woman again. All because she licked his lips, hummed her pleasure, and combed her fingers through his hair with tenderness. His arousal jumped, and she chuckled deep and sexylike. Again, he found himself wishing she were a lupus garou.</p><p>She leaned her supple nude body against his, heating his skin to the nth degree. \u201cCara said I should try to keep you for my own,\u201d she whispered against his lips, then licked them again. She slid over his erection and he moaned.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry about your shoulder.\u201d She started to slip off him, and he grabbed hold of her lissome body, his hands cupping her buttocks, keeping her tight against him.</p><p>\u201cNot my shoulder.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t conceal his annoyance with Cara that she would interfere in his affairs. She knew better than to encourage Tessa\u2019s further interest in him.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Tessa murmured, nuzzling her face against his cheek, \u201cshe said you\u2019re a real alpha male.\u201d Tessa slid her body lower and kissed his nipple.</p><p>The sensation sent a jolt straight to his rigid erection. He grabbed fistfuls of her hair and became mesmerized in the peach-scented, soft red curls.</p><p>\u201cBut of course, I already knew that.\u201d She swirled her tongue around his nipple and then teased the stiff peak.</p><p>Hunter groaned. She was killing him. A shiver stole through every nerve ending. No one had ever brought him so close to climaxing with such a simple, sweet touch.</p><p>\u201cSo then, how do I keep someone as wild as you, Hunter? How would I entice you to want me for longer than a fling?\u201d She folded her arms across his chest and rested her chin on them.</p><p>Although he knew she couldn\u2019t see his face for the dark, she looked straight at him, her eyes challenging.</p><p>\u201cI know for whatever reason, you don\u2019t want me,\u201d she said, her expression dead serious.</p><p>His hands stilled on her bare arms. Hell, where did she get the idea he didn\u2019t want her?</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s fine. We do it, and both satisfy some primal urge and that\u2019s it. No strings attached. I\u2019ve never had it so good as with you. And so...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI might as well enjoy it until the next guy comes along. Maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and he\u2019ll be just as good as you. Or, heck, maybe even better.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. Despite her goading him, she wouldn\u2019t get him to say that which was on the tip of his tongue\u2014that he wouldn\u2019t let her be with anyone else. That he would be the only one for her. But he couldn\u2019t. \u201cThere won\u2019t be anyone better.\u201d</p><p>She smiled in the most devilish way. \u201cNever know, Hunter. You just never know.\u201d</p><p>Forget the damned shoulder. He would show her how good it got. He pushed her onto her back, and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cVixen.\u201d Now it was his turn to tease her enticing nipples, his tongue laving over one while his thumb stroked the other, preparing it for its due.</p><p>\u201cHmm, what about your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she ran her fingers over his whiskered cheek. \u201cI could ride you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that. You had your chance.\u201d Ride him? Yeah, some other time, but for now he wanted to be on top, controlling, possessing her. No one could replace him. \u201cI should give you one of those sexy rubs you gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen your shoulder\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d take her up on it. Massage everywhere, too.</p><p>He slipped his hand between her legs and pushed them apart. \u201cHmm, warm, wet, and willing.\u201d Hot, she was hotter than any woman he\u2019d ever been with.</p><p>He wanted to take it nice and slow, but his shoulder was acting up too much. He gritted his teeth, centered himself between her legs, and plunged his erection deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou might be right,\u201d she whispered against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always right.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and pinched his butt. \u201cAlways so modest and not in the least bit arrogant.\u201d</p><p>He growled, \u201cNo one will be better.\u201d</p><p>Hunter was sooo good, Tessa thought as he sank into her again and again, stretching her, rubbing against her sweetest spot, making her yearn for more. He lowered his mouth to hers as her insides burned a thousand fires, the hair on his chest caressing her nipples, sensitizing them even more, his body sliding against hers, intoxicating her.</p><p>She savored every bit of his hot-blooded nature, his wanting his way with her, his possessiveness, his protectiveness. She never wanted the lovemaking to stop because with it she felt complete, whole, satisfied, and a part of his life that she didn\u2019t care to end. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmm, Hunter,\u201d she mewed, loving every bit of him, and he recaptured her lips as if to say he knew he did wicked things to her body no man had ever done\u2014carried her to the heavens and back in a million shattered, ecstatic pieces. And here she thought the reason for her inability to feel anything for another man had all to do with her. That she couldn\u2019t inspire such passion.</p><p>Hunter rubbed her most sensitive spot at the juncture of her thighs, making her beg for more\u2014for faster, harder, fulfilling completion. And then she reached the point of no return, a blast of heat washing through her, mind-numbing satisfaction as ripples of orgasm gripped her in the final throes of passion. He joined her, milky heat filling her womb, warming her like a hot bath, and he groaned with deep satisfaction.</p><p>He pulled away, but not separating from her, just rolling backward, keeping her close as he settled on his back, her leg resting between his, her arms wrapped around him and his around her tightly. To sleep with her in his cocoon of an embrace, his rapid heart thumping out a comforting rhythm in her ear, to keep the connection.</p> <p>She wanted to say how much she loved him, not in a marriage kind of way, but because of all he already meant to her. No one had ever been so shielding, or considerate of her feelings, or so determined to take care of her in her time of need, without wishing anything in return. And the sex? Oh, yes, no man had ever made her feel so sexy and wanted her like she was an aphrodisiac he couldn\u2019t get enough of, or made her nearly climax with a seductive glance, touch, whispered word. And no man had ever wanted to keep her close after the lovemaking was done, showing her he wanted more than just the sex, but also the intimacy of sharing the same space, of maintaining the connection.</p><p>From his muscular arms that held her tight to his sculpted abs and the firmest butt she had ever seen on a guy this close up, Hunter was physically as beautiful as one of the Greek statues of gods. Deep down, he was all she\u2019d ever hoped for in a man. And for the moment, he was all hers, although it wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>But the tender memories would be hers forever.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>SOMEONE POUNDED ON THE MASTER BEDROOM DOOR the next morning, jump-starting Hunter\u2019s heart. Tessa cuddled against him, her voice whisper soft as she nuzzled his chest. \u201cTell whoever it is to go away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHunter! We need to talk!\u201d Meara said. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Hell, what now? Leave it to Meara to ruin a perfectly good morning wake-up.</p><p>He kissed Tessa\u2019s lips, gently at first, then building up steam as she wrapped her arms around him, leaning into his arousal. Instantly, he hardened.</p><p>\u201cHunter!\u201d</p><p>Hunter growled under his breath. \u201cTime for Rourke and me to check out Bethany\u2019s place anyway.\u201d With reluctance, he kissed Tessa\u2019s cheek, then left her warm embrace, dressing as she watched every move he made, licking her lips, purring, a slight smile curving her lips. Vixen.</p><p>\u201cMore, later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromises, promises.\u201d</p><p>He gave the siren one last look, then took a deep breath and joined Meara in the hall and scowled at her. Giving him an equally disgruntled look, she motioned to the guest bedroom as he shut Tessa\u2019s door. He knew then what this was all about. Meara entered the room and waved at a stack of wolf photos spread out on the desk, the sepia picture of the man he\u2019d thought was Seth taking center stage.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d She put her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cHer brother paints wolves. Did you see his oils in the closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d she said, lifting Seth\u2019s photo. \u201cExplain what an old-time photograph of Seth is doing here.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t that photograph that interested him now, or the concern that she also thought the man pictured was Seth, but another photo lying underneath that caught his eye. Sepia like the other, but this one was of a group of gold miners\u2014their great-grandfather included, and a great uncle, Seth, and some others Hunter didn\u2019t know. Although one seemed familiar.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d He studied it more closely, his heartbeat ratcheting up several notches.</p><p>\u201cBuried at the bottom of the drawer underneath all these wolf pictures. So, what\u2019s going on? We both know Seth had a mate who died in Colorado and then he left his small son to live with his pack while he went to California because of the Gold Rush. But this woman isn\u2019t his mate, and he didn\u2019t have another when he died. So who is the woman and infant in the photo? And why does Tessa Anderson have the two photos?\u201d</p> <p>Hunter rubbed his chin in thought. \u201cHell, Tessa thought Seth, by another name\u2014Jeremiah Cramer\u2014was her great-grandfather and the woman, his wife and child.\u201d</p><p>Meara\u2019s eyes widened and she looked at the photo again and at the one with their great-grandfather in it. \u201cI would say she\u2019s mistaken, or that this wasn\u2019t Seth, but the one with our great-grandfather proves he was.\u201d She stared at Hunter. \u201cShe\u2019s not a lupus garou and our kind can\u2019t produce offspring with a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what if he was fooling around with the human woman after his mate died, and this woman already had a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly, except for the fact that Tessa\u2019s as much of a magnet for male lupus garous as you are. Why? There\u2019s got to be a reasonable explanation.\u201d</p><p>Meara touched the baby in the photo. \u201cShe\u2019s not one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if for the sake of argument, her grandmother had mixed parents. What if through some freak mistake of nature, her human great-grandmother conceived Seth\u2019s child?\u201d</p><p>Meara shook her head as she studied the photo again. \u201cWe\u2019ve never known a case like that in all the years we\u2019ve lived. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo explain the photos, Tessa\u2019s fascination with wolves, and their interest in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe females have enough males to choose from. If they weren\u2019t so picky,\u201d he amended, giving his sister a pointed look. \u201cMost lupus garou females wouldn\u2019t be interested in a male who had only a small percentage of lupus garou genetics running through his veins, I suspect. But Michael seems to be as drawn to our kind\u2014 well, wolves\u2014as Tessa is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any of our senses. I know because she can\u2019t tell what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a thought. I don\u2019t know how else to explain this.\u201d</p><p>Meara\u2019s stubborn streak was shining through. \u201cShe\u2019s not a lupus garou.\u201d</p><p>But if Tessa was in part, it would make it a hell of a lot harder for Hunter to leave her as she was. Word would undoubtedly spread about a mixed lupus garou female who didn\u2019t have a pack to protect her.</p><p>The back of his neck prickled, and Hunter rubbed it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Hunter, so if Tessa\u2019s grandmother was half lupus garou, who protected her from lupus garou suitors during her lifetime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably none in the area so no one learned about her. Which makes me wonder if the woman was Tessa\u2019s maternal or paternal grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to be paternal,\u201d Meara said. \u201cOtherwise they\u2019d have had another generation of females with the lupus garou pheromones.\u201d</p><p>Hell, did Uncle Basil know about this all along? \u201cDo you have your cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering why Uncle Basil befriended her, then implied I had to take drastic measures to eliminate her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mean as in mating the woman? Making her one of our own?\u201d</p><p>Hunter swore under his breath. It was one thing for it to be his own idea, but he sure as hell didn\u2019t appreciate his uncle setting him up.</p><p>Meara handed him her phone and folded her arms. \u201cI knew he was up to something and that his sudden desire to retire was due to something lots more devious.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Hunter should have known the way his uncle was so eager to leave, something was up.</p><p>When his uncle\u2019s answering machine came on, Hunter let out his breath and left a terse message. \u201cWhat\u2019s the true story behind Tessa Anderson? What\u2019s her relationship to Seth? Call me soonest.\u201d</p><p>Meara raised her brows. \u201cHe\u2019s not answering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got his machine.\u201d He handed her the phone.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou should have been more cryptic. Said you\u2019d run into troubles. Call back. ASAP. Better yet, get your butt back here and explain yourself. Once he sees what you\u2019re calling about, he\u2019ll undoubtedly let it slide until you resolve it one way or another on your own.\u201d</p><p>As if Hunter had any intention of worrying his uncle when there wasn\u2019t any need.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t turn her,\u201d Meara finally said, her voice softened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to.\u201d Yet the more things got out of control with Yoloff and his brothers, the more he was considering just that option.</p><p>The doorbell rang and the master bedroom door opened. Tessa.</p><p>Hell, she\u2019d better not go near the door without his protection. His heart pounding, Hunter bolted out of the guest bedroom and gave her a warning look as she was going in the direction of the door. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d He was certain his sister was shaking her head at his overreaction, but he knew it was only a matter of time before the grays tried for Tessa again.</p><p>The doorbell rang once more, and he heard Cara and Ashton stirring in Michael\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Hunter opened the door to find the red lupus garou pack leader of Portland standing on the front porch.</p><p>Meara said under her breath, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>His expression dark and menacing, Leidolf barged into the house. \u201cYour people are causing trouble in my city. When I attempted to contact you at home where your pack members said you were living, I got your sister. She gave me this address. I want them out in three days, or I\u2019ll take care of the situation myself. And you don\u2019t want that to happen if you care anything about them.\u201d</p><p>Hunter slanted his sister an irritated look that she would give the red Tessa\u2019s address. Meara gave him a half smile.</p><p>Leidolf was bigger than most reds Hunter had seen. Although that amounted to only a couple of dozen over the years. But the man was as tall as Hunter, his chestnut hair tinged red, his eyes a slightly more olive color than Tessa\u2019s. But it was the dark brooding look that really defined Leidolf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced at Tessa, his eyes widening when he saw her. Surprised to see a human in a house full of lupus garous? Or was he interested in the redhead?</p><p>Irritated that Leidolf had seen Tessa, Hunter moved across the floor to block Leidolf\u2019s view of her. \u201cI\u2019ve got a situation here I need to resolve before I can go to Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the woman?\u201d Leidolf asked, his voice and brows raised.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Tessa Anderson, and you are?\u201d She moved around Hunter to shake Leidolf\u2019s hand. She didn\u2019t look pleased Leidolf would treat her as some woman when the house was hers, or that Hunter would stand between them.</p><p>But Hunter didn\u2019t like that she would get near another alpha male. Where Rourke and Ashton were concerned, they seemed to know their place. Leidolf was an unknown quantity\u2014and an alpha leader.</p><p>\u201cLeidolf Wildhaven.\u201d He tilted his nose up and took a deep breath, his eyes darkening as he took her hand and held on longer than necessary, not shaking it, but restraining her.</p><p>For long enough that Hunter\u2019s blood heated.</p><p>Hell, if her pheromones were triggering Leidolf\u2019s interest\u2014and worse, she seemed intrigued by him also and didn\u2019t pull away... \u201cFascinating.\u201d Then Leidolf released her hand and saw the wolf photos on the coffee table. He motioned to them. \u201cWho took these?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d Tessa sounded as ready to defend herself as Leidolf\u2019s tone was accusing.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go outside, Leidolf.\u201d Hunter motioned for him to take the lead and shut the door behind them before he gave in to his wolf nature and fought him over Tessa. \u201cLike I said, I have a situation here, and I need to resolve it before I can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcerning the woman? She knows what we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smelled at least six different lupus garous in the house, and she doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. A gray is trying to change her. I need to stop him before it gets that far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe one who\u2019s been in the house? The one in the photos? Hell, he\u2019s Yoloff and he and his brothers and three more of their pack members are from La Grande. All males. All looking for mates. They came sniffing around Portland, but we don\u2019t have any unattached red females, so the grays moved farther west. You\u2019re bound to have more trouble with them. I take it you want the woman for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in changing humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least that\u2019s something we agree on.\u201d Leidolf offered an arrogant smile. \u201cYet two are newly turned, am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoloff changed the one and the other was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I don\u2019t blame you about the woman. I\u2019m a royal and mixing our kind with a newly turned lupus garou doesn\u2019t appeal.\u201d</p><p>A royal? But Leidolf\u2019s attentions toward Tessa hinted at more than a little intrigue. Mixing his purer lupus garou line with a human just turned might become an option if the red got desperate enough for a mate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d guess she has a red in her family tree because of her hair color and as petite as she is.\u201d</p><p>Hunter snorted. \u201cA lupus garou can\u2019t impregnate a human.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn all of the years I\u2019ve lived, I\u2019ve learned one important thing: there are exceptions to nearly every rule.\u201d</p><p>Hunter snapped his gaping jaw shut, glanced back at the house, saw Tessa watching him through the picture window, and turned his attention back to Leidolf. In all the years Hunter had lived, he\u2019d never seen a case like that. \u201cYou know someone like that?\u201d</p><p>Leidolf motioned to the house. \u201cRight inside. Maybe a couple of generations back. Maybe more. But she\u2019s got a lupus garou in her genes somewhere along the line. Got to have if she\u2019s chasing down lupus garous like Yoloff, drawn to us, curious, and we\u2019re just as attracted to her.\u201d</p><p>Hunter glanced back at the house. Tessa\u2019s brows lifted.</p><p>\u201cShe may not smell like us or have our enhanced wolf abilities, but she triggers your craving, doesn\u2019t she? I can see in your expression you don\u2019t believe me, but I met one other nearly a hundred years ago. A human female.</p><p>She moved close to where my father\u2019s pack lived in Wildhaven. Several of our unmated males fought over her. Finally, a red won her over and that was that. But she had lupus garou pheromones that triggered quite a bit of testosterone between our males before the situation was resolved. A grandfather was the culprit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the woman didn\u2019t interest you.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf shrugged. \u201cI told you. I want a lupus garou who\u2019s close to being a royal. Why don\u2019t you bring the woman to Portland where you can keep an eye on her, and then you can force your pack to return to the coast?\u201d</p><p>Bring her to Portland to watch over her? Or give Leidolf another opportunity to check her out? Only this time in his territory.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t resolve this by week\u2019s end, I might do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Leidolf looked back at the house and bowed his head to Tessa. \u201cToo bad she isn\u2019t a red lupus garou. I imagine though, you wish she were a gray.\u201d</p><p>So Leidolf was interested in her. \u201cShe\u2019s human, and I intend for her to stay that way. But if she were part lupus garou, she would have gray lineage.\u201d Hunter made the comment as pointed as he could. He didn\u2019t want one horny red thinking he might claim her.</p><p>Leidolf perked up. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s true she has distant lupus garou lineage, her great-grandfather was probably Seth Greystoke.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf\u2019s eyes rounded. \u201cThe devil gray who beat Alfred\u2019s great-grandfather?\u201d</p><p>Hunter frowned. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfred was the previous red pack leader in the Portland area. His great-grandfather was as much of a terror when he was the pack leader in the Oregon territory. Seth had come here with the gold fever. Made a mint. Then after he took down Alfred\u2019s great-grandfather, he returned to his home in Colorado. Seth\u2019s great-grandson, Devlyn, came here looking for a female red, Bella, and destroyed Alfred three months ago, after Alfred and some of the males in his pack had killed young women in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth.\u201d Hunter shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019d heard he had a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, whose own son fathered three boys. But everyone died in a house fire set by vigilante humans, except for Devlyn. Being punished for disobedience, he was sleeping in a shed that night.\u201d</p><p>Hell, if Tessa and her brother were truly Seth\u2019s descendants, they were Devlyn\u2019s distant cousins. Which could be more of a problem, or Hunter\u2019s solution, depending on the way he looked at it. \u201cNever would have figured Seth to oust a leader. He was in California when my great-grandfather met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier gold fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, guess he never did get over it.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf glanced back at Tessa. \u201cI\u2019ll get word to Devlyn that he\u2019s possibly got a couple of distant relations still living. Never know. He might want to take her back to his pack\u2014for safekeeping. Once others discover she\u2019s available, the stream of lusty suitors will never end. You know as well as I, a vulnerable human will soon succumb. As for your people, don\u2019t wait too long to get them.\u201d Leidolf climbed into his black Hummer, gave a wave, and drove off.</p><p>He\u2019d had every intention of getting rid of Yoloff to protect Tessa, but if Leidolf was right and Seth truly had been her great-grandfather, the trouble would never end. So why not take the easy way out and hand her over to Devlyn? If he truly was family, he\u2019d take care of her. Her brother, too. So why did that make Hunter want to fight to the death for her before anyone took her away?</p><p>His only other option as he could see it was to change her and claim her for his own. But not without her consent. So if he chose that path, how the hell was he going to get it if she knew what they were without using some damn caveman approach? And then there was one other nagging worry\u2014that she might not be alpha enough to be his mate.</p><p>Hunter ground his teeth and headed back inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say, Hunter?\u201d Meara\u2019s brows pinched together in worry.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Rourke, hurry up and finish eating so we can go.\u201d</p><p>Looking sour, Ashton shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cCan\u2019t I be the one to go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can shoot. Rourke can\u2019t. Stay here and protect the women.\u201d</p><p>Cara ran her hand over Ashton\u2019s arm. \u201cBesides, we can take a nap later since we didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep last night. Wouldn\u2019t you like that?\u201d</p><p>Ashton threw his coat on and stalked out back.</p><p>\u201cWatch him, Cara. Make sure he stays here when we leave,\u201d Hunter warned.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat I will, Hunter. He\u2019s all mine.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t so sure. Ashton didn\u2019t seem to be taking the change well, unless something else was bothering him. Maybe he didn\u2019t like that Rourke seemed to be Hunter\u2019s favorite now. But it wasn\u2019t that. It really had all to do with who could use the rifle.</p><p>While Rourke was finishing off a banana, Hunter took Tessa aside, cupped her face in his hands and kissed her mouth, enjoying the warm, soft feel of her. Her tongue flicked against his lips, her arms reaching around his neck, her body screaming she wanted him to take her. And he sure as hell wanted to oblige. Some of it was the need to prove he was more to her liking than Leidolf was, damn him for interfering.</p><p>He took another deep breath of her uniquely heady scent and groaned inwardly. Afraid Leidolf was right in speculating Tessa was in part one of them and with him notifying Devlyn of the situation, Hunter knew he had to take drastic measures one way or another soon. \u201cDon\u2019t take a nap without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be half as satisfying.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again and gave her another warm embrace, not wanting to let her go, but he had to take care of this matter with her brother. \u201cCome on, Rourke.</p><p>Let\u2019s get this done.\u201d</p><p>She gave Hunter a concerned smile. Afraid for his safety? Or that he wouldn\u2019t learn who Bethany\u2019s murderer was? She had a lot more than that to worry about. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He and Rourke headed outside and into the woods, wary of signs of danger in the form of three lupus garous. Although if Leidolf was right, there were six of them he\u2019d eventually have to contend with.</p><p>Praying they wouldn\u2019t encounter any trouble, Tessa watched Hunter and Rourke until they disappeared into the woods. Cara coaxed Ashton inside. Tessa couldn\u2019t understand why he was behaving like a spoiled child.</p><p>Meara cleared her throat. \u201cThey\u2019ll be all right, Tessa. Let\u2019s go back in the house.\u201d</p> <p>In one respect, Meara acted as though she wanted to keep Tessa safe. But on the other hand, she didn\u2019t seem to care for Tessa and Hunter\u2019s relationship. Although why it would matter to Meara was a puzzle.</p><p>Leidolf was another mystery, the way he tore into the house, roaring about like he was in charge, when if he\u2019d known Lord Hunter at all he would have realized Hunter was always the one in charge.</p><p>Tessa turned to Meara. \u201cWhat did Leidolf mean about Hunter\u2019s people being in Portland and that they had to leave? Was he talking about more of your relatives? Why does he act like he owns the place? Sounds like he\u2019s head of an organized crime ring in the city.\u201d</p><p>Her expression indifferent, Meara shrugged. \u201cA couple of Hunter\u2019s friends must be causing trouble in Leidolf\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do?\u201d</p> <p>Meara paused too long before answering, which made Tessa suspicious.</p><p>\u201cHe has a... bar in town. You know, the guys probably have been drinking a little too much and stirring up trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... why does Hunter have to take care of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re friends from way back. You know.\u201d</p><p>Meara and Cara exchanged looks, and again Tessa felt like an outsider, while the women who\u2019d never met each other before shared some dark secret. Fine. She\u2019d ask Hunter when he returned.</p><p>Tessa unloaded the dishwasher while Meara and Cara put away leftovers from a hastily grabbed breakfast. Tessa thought she heard Ashton stacking more wood by the fireplace. But Cara suddenly dropped the napkins she\u2019d gathered on the table and dashed through the house and out the front door.</p> <p>\u201cDamn, Ashton!\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou come back here this instant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go after him,\u201d Tessa offered, although why he was acting the way he was, she didn\u2019t have a clue. Unless he felt hurt that the \u201cboys\u201d were leaving him out. Probably didn\u2019t want to be tied down to babysitting the women.</p><p>With tears in her eyes, Cara closed the door and shook her head. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t leave. It wouldn\u2019t be safe for us.\u201d</p><p>Meara actually looked sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cI can use the rifle, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d But of course Tessa did worry about Ashton. What if the wolf attacked him again? No. She had shot it and it was probably half-dead somewhere in a pile of snow.</p><p>Remembering she\u2019d neglected to write the suspect list and glad for the diversion, she grabbed a piece of paper. Except for Michael, Ashton, Rourke, and half a dozen of her brother\u2019s artist friends, she couldn\u2019t think of anyone else that visited regularly. A man cleaned their chimney once. An electrician checked their heater when it kept flipping the circuit breaker. A plumber had to repair a frozen pipe. That was it.</p><p>\u201cHot cocoa, anyone?\u201d Meara asked, while Cara watched out the front window.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great.\u201d Tessa considered her list. \u201cThe chimney sweep didn\u2019t look like the guy Ashton described\u2014dark haired, same approximate build as Hunter. Michael had dealt with the electrician and plumber so I didn\u2019t get a chance to see either. I think I was selling photographs to shops in Portland at the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell,\u201d Meara said in the kitchen.</p><p>Tessa dropped the list on the coffee table and hurried to join her. Ashton was pacing on the back patio. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d She had never seen him so agitated, except for maybe the time he was drunk and had attacked her.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Cara!\u201d Meara said. \u201cAshton\u2019s back here. Why don\u2019t you take care of him?\u201d</p><p>Cara raced from the front window to the back door. She bolted outside, slammed the door shut, and grabbed Ashton\u2019s arm, but he shook loose. Tessa couldn\u2019t hear their words, but his face was red, his brows furrowed, and he snarled back at Cara when she tried to calm him.</p><p>Then he started tugging off his clothes as if he had gone totally mad. Tessa\u2019s mouth gaped.</p><p>Meara seized Tessa\u2019s arm. \u201cCome on, we don\u2019t want to watch this. Cocoa\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>But Tessa did want to watch. What if Ashton had rabies? What if Cara was in danger? \u201cWait, Meara. Cara could be at risk. We need to get her away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Meara tried to yank Tessa toward the living room, but she was rooted to the floor. \u201cFinish your list. I\u2019ll bring\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ashton stretched his arms upward toward the gray clouds, his face began to distort, elongate, and his naked lean body began to change, his back arching. Pale gray hair, no it was more like... fur, began to cover his body, the whole thing happening so quickly it was like watching a movie playing at triple speed or more in a blur. He dropped to his... his paws, no longer a man, but a gray wolf. A beautiful creature, wild and dangerous.</p><p>She barely breathed. If she hadn\u2019t seen the sudden transformation with her own eyes, she would never believe it. Even now, she had a hard time accepting it. Every inch of him looked like a real wolf.</p><p>Her heart pounding and her head swimming, Tessa\u2019s knees buckled. Meara was still holding her arm and when Tessa collapsed on her knees, Meara fell with her. \u201cOhmigod... did... did you see... what happened to Ashton?\u201d</p><p>Meara watched Tessa with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cCara! We\u2019ve got to get her away from him.\u201d Tessa scrambled to her feet and peered out the window, clinging to the kitchen sink for support.</p><p>Shaking her finger at him, Cara scolded the wolf\u2014 Ashton. For a couple of seconds, he listened to her, but then bolted for the woods.</p><p>Turning, Cara saw Tessa watching. Her face turned pasty despite the fact her cheeks had been cherry colored from the cold. Tessa stepped away from the window, her heart thundering.</p><p>Cara was one, too. She had to be. Had she turned Ashton last night when she seduced him? Turned him? What was she saying? They were shapeshifters?</p><p>Tessa bolted for the door and locked it.</p><p>\u201cLet me in, Tessa. I don\u2019t have my coat on and it\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d Cara half-coaxed, half-demanded, rubbing her arms with her bare hands.</p><p>Tessa couldn\u2019t find her voice. What if the wolf that had bitten Ashton was the culprit and not Cara? But then, why wasn\u2019t Cara surprised when Ashton shapeshifted?</p><p>Tessa didn\u2019t realize how much she was shaking until Meara touched her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s too cold out. We\u2019ve got to let her in.\u201d</p><p>Tessa stared at Meara. She saw Ashton turn into a wolf. She observed the whole thing and wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>What if she was one? And what did Ashton say about Hunter? He saw him naked in the freezing weather before he dressed and charged up the hill after Ashton for shooting him. Why? Because Hunter had been shapeshifting beforehand? Ashton hadn\u2019t been drunk. She groaned.</p><p>\u201cTessa, we have to let Cara back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of them.\u201d Tessa\u2019s eyes misted. \u201cYou\u2019re one and Hunter is one and he bit Rourke. Leidolf is, too, isn\u2019t he? Everyone but me is.\u201d Her heart beating too rapidly, she backed up.</p><p>\u201cTessa, you\u2019re just imagining things.\u201d Meara took a step forward, cautious, concerned.</p><p>Where had Ashton left the rifle? In the living room?</p><p>Tessa dashed for it just as the back door squeaked open. Meara was letting Cara in.</p><p>The door shut and the lock clicked, but no one said a word. They didn\u2019t need to. They\u2019d share one of those conspiratorial looks that said it all.</p><p>She grabbed the rifle and headed back into the kitchen where Meara was pouring Cara another mug of hot cocoa. \u201cI want you both to leave, now. Get in your vehicles and drive away. I won\u2019t say anything to anyone. Hell, what could I say? Anyone would think I was nuts. But I want you out of here, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave,\u201d Meara said, softly. \u201cHunter would kill us if we left you unprotected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would kill his own sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking. He\u2019d be angry, and I don\u2019t want to go there. You know how upset he was with me for taking off with three other guys. Believe me, this would be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know why, Tessa? Because that intruder who\u2019s after you is also one of our kind,\u201d Cara piped in. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave you to face him on your own. If he manages to get you alone now, he\u2019ll change you.\u201d</p><p>Tessa sat down hard on the dining chair. \u201cThe one who bit Ashton, was he the same man/wolf?\u201d</p><p>Meara sighed. \u201cI imagine he\u2019s the same one.\u201d</p><p>Everything that had happened in the last few days ran through Tessa\u2019s mind\u2014Hunter being naked on the beach, the way he knew the man had been in her bed, and that it was him and not some other man. He knew things he shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you are, exactly.\u201d</p><p>Meara shook her head. \u201cYou know too much already. In most cases, the pack leader would have two options. Kill you, or turn you. Hunter won\u2019t want to change you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Not that Tessa wanted that option, no way, but death wasn\u2019t the greatest choice either. Not that she would go willingly either.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in it,\u201d Meara said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t known anyone personally changed by a bite. It\u2019s just something we prefer not to do.\u201d</p><p>Tessa gave a haughty laugh. \u201cYeah, right. He changed Rourke, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then he\u2019ll have to kill me. That\u2019s why he said the relationship would never work.\u201d Tessa swallowed a lump in her throat. \u201cWill he at least get my brother free first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll want to eliminate you. But enough said. Like you mentioned, people will think you\u2019re certifiable if you breathe a word of this. So here\u2019s the deal. You don\u2019t ask questions or learn anything more about us, and when we free your brother, we all will...\u201d Meara snapped her fingers. \u201c... disappear. You\u2019ll never hear from us again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUnless Hunter wants to terminate me.\u201d</p><p>Meara took in a ragged breath. \u201cWe won\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><p>She cast Cara a warning look.</p> <p>Cara bowed her head slightly.</p><p>In disbelief, Tessa stared at Meara. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019d want to eliminate all of us for putting him in this bind. It\u2019ll be our little secret.\u201d</p><p>Keeping secrets from Hunter was like trying to drive a car across the ocean. Tessa knew she would sink and drown before she got anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWant some cocoa?\u201d Cara put on a fake smile and offered Tessa a mug.</p> <p>Tessa had known something would go terribly wrong after she had come home from Michael\u2019s trial, but she never guessed the nightmare could get this bad.</p><p>Rourke looked over the edge of the cliff where the men had pushed Hunter. \u201cI don\u2019t know how in the hell you managed to survive. The tide must have come in just at the right time.\u201d</p><p>Hunter examined the nearby trees, looking for signs of a struggle. Half a foot of snow had fallen, so the ground would yield no clues.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you gave them a hell of a time.\u201d Rourke twisted a broken branch back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t figure out why they would have attacked me. If I came into a wolves\u2019 territory unannounced, the pack leader would either welcome me, or tell me to leave. The only way he would fight me with the intent to kill was if I had seriously violated pack laws, killed one of his wolves, tried to claim a female he had other plans for, or threatened to take over his pack. Maybe I was headed in the direction of Tessa\u2019s cabin and Yoloff, the one who wants her, got riled, thinking I was after her.\u201d</p><p>Hunter led the way to Bethany\u2019s log cabin. Like Tessa\u2019s place, the house sat cliffside with a view of a rocky beach, woods all around, and no sign of any other homes.</p> <p>\u201cWhy she would live out here by herself is what puzzles me,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cI can understand Tessa\u2019s situation. She and her brother lived together and had inherited the house. But Bethany?\u201d He shook his head as Hunter unlocked the door. \u201cShe was kind of a loner, like... .\u201d Rourke stopped dead inside the house. \u201cIt\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it? The smell of Tessa\u2019s stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoloff, yeah. He\u2019s been here. His brothers, too. And recently. Did they have a key to her place also? No broken windows.\u201d Hunter checked over the two-bedroom, one-bath house. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t killed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the coroner said she\u2019d died when she fell to her death on the rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why not here? Why a mile away?\u201d Hunter searched through her bedroom drawers.</p><p>\u201cShe loved to take walks in the woods. That\u2019s what Michael said at the trial. He didn\u2019t like it that she was taking them alone. Of course, it sounded like a perfect alibi since no one could confirm that she was seeing someone behind his back. Either this phantom guy did it, or some stranger. Neither the sheriff or his deputies bought Michael\u2019s story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff\u2019s been here. So has Ashton. And three of the wolves that had been around Tessa\u2019s place? They\u2019ve been here, too. Which meant they were tied into her death, or curious possibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a ton of other humans. Coroner, deputies. But I wouldn\u2019t know whose scent I\u2019m smelling unless I got a whiff of them now.\u201d Rourke motioned to the house. \u201cWhat did you want me to look for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny sign of anything out of the ordinary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t find her diary. The D.A. kept it as evidence. But there was nothing incriminating in it about Ashton. Or anyone else for that matter. Just Michael. They fought concerning her seeing someone else, but she never confirmed it one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshton said he kept a pretty low profile,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>They moved back into the kitchen. Rourke pulled open a cabinet door. \u201cYeah, he didn\u2019t leave any clothes in the house. Nothing personal to tie himself to her.\u201d</p><p>Hunter paused. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? He didn\u2019t want Michael to learn that he was here with Bethany on the sly. Ashton still valued his friendship, even if he wasn\u2019t showing it in a very loyal way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he had some things here and got rid of them after he\u2019d murdered her.\u201d Hunter pulled open another drawer.</p><p>\u201cI thought you believed the grays had killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d considered it. The one might have wanted Michael out of the way so he killed Bethany, and then Michael was blamed for it. Tessa would be left unprotected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why not just kill Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wolf\u2019s a beta. If he\u2019d been an alpha, he would have killed Michael and taken Tessa. But he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s stalked her, waited, watched, for what? He couldn\u2019t get up the nerve. Maybe he cared for her too much and was afraid if he turned her and things didn\u2019t work out, he\u2019d have to destroy her. On the other hand, what if the guy couldn\u2019t even kill Bethany? What if Ashton did it? But now Bethany\u2019s murder played into the gray\u2019s hands, and he had a chance to make Tessa his. Only he still stalked her, worried about her acceptance of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you appeared on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And he got anxious. Started playing games. Showing how he could get in, leaving his scent on her sheets, wanting to claim her, getting more and more rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then he bit Ashton to...? \u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe at that point he wanted to kill Ashton so he could get to Tessa since you and I were gone. Even more desperate, he took a bigger chance, but when Tessa got the gun and started shooting, he tucked tail and ran.\u201d</p><p>Rourke shoved his gloved hands under his arms. \u201cWhat if the gray did it? Or Ashton for that matter? We can\u2019t prove either did because they can\u2019t go to prison. Not when they\u2019re werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just have to find the evidence, and I\u2019ll sort it out from there.\u201d</p><p>Rourke took a deep breath. \u201cAll the evidence points to Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have an alibi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He was supposed to be home sick with the flu, but nobody was there to verify he\u2019d stayed home in bed either. Tessa had run to the city to get supplies and sell some more of her photographs. When she arrived home, the sheriff had already arrested Michael and taken him in for questioning.\u201d</p><p>Not that Hunter wanted to believe anything bad about Tessa, but his wolf\u2019s wariness instantly made him suspect anyone and everyone. \u201cHow long was she in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour hours.\u201d Rourke\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, no. Don\u2019t you go thinking Tessa had anything to do with it. Between receipts and store personnel and surveillance tapes at the stores where she sold her work, she had an airtight alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all the time?\u201d</p><p>Rourke looked out the living room window. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for all the time. You\u2019d make a lousy liar, Rourke. Don\u2019t try it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. So she had enough time. But she wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d</p><p>Hunter smelled the air. \u201cShe\u2019s been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Tessa has. She was friends with Bethany, too, damn it, but she didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the defense think she might have?\u201d</p><p>Rourke looked at the floor.</p><p>\u201cDid they, Rourke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Michael\u2019s defense attorney said she had motive because the attorney was trying to cast doubt on Michael\u2019s supposed guilt. Tessa suspected someone else was seeing Bethany, too. That\u2019s what the defense attorney said. That as loyal as Tessa was to her brother, she could have killed Bethany in a fit of rage. Two police officers had to restrain Michael to keep him from hitting his attorney, he was so pissed. His temper didn\u2019t help his case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Michael always have a temper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that he showed publicly. I always thought he kept pretty quiet, except for getting in trouble for minor infractions of the law. Breaking and entering, joy riding in a car once, but I figured Ashton was the mastermind.\u201d</p><p>Hunter returned to the bathroom and sifted through the drawers.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand why Ashton wouldn\u2019t leave anything incriminating here in case Michael came across it, but why wouldn\u2019t Michael have left anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t like coming here, so he said at the trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Seems to me it would be a great place to have private time with his girl.\u201d</p><p>Rourke gave a derisive laugh. \u201cHe thought it was haunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaunted?\u201d Hunter shook his head. \u201cI need to pay Michael a little visit at the jailhouse.\u201d</p><p>Rourke peered out the bathroom window. \u201cThe wind is really picking up. Holy shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe grays?\u201d Adrenaline instantly flooded Hunter\u2019s system, preparing him for another fight.</p><p>\u201cNo, that idiot Ashton.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s blood heated several degrees. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Although Hunter\u2019s sister and Cara were still at Tessa\u2019s house to protect her, if the three male grays tried to take off with Tessa, his sister and Cara could be in a world of trouble.</p><p>As soon as Hunter headed outside with Rourke on his heels, a patrol car drove into the driveway. Hell. Ashton in his wolf form judiciously moved away from the house, slinked deeper into the woods, and slipped out of sight. But Hunter and Rourke had a lot of explaining to do.</p><p>\u201cHave you got permission to be breaking into Bethany Wade\u2019s house, gentlemen?\u201d the deputy asked, as he climbed out of the car, his hand on his holster. He was a scrawny, sawed-off little guy and Hunter could have eaten him for a midnight snack if he gave them any real trouble.</p><p>\u201cThis is Deputy William O\u2019Neal,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cAnd, William, I want you to meet my friend, Hunter Grey. He\u2019s an ex\u2013navy SEAL. He\u2019s done quite a lot of investigative work for the navy, and he\u2019s trying to dig up more clues concerning Bethany\u2019s murder. I\u2019m doing an investigative report for the newspaper.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me, Rourke. Did you get permission from her family first, or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want this resolved one way or another. Got the key right here.\u201d Rourke dangled it from a heart-shaped key chain.</p><p>With his head turned slightly south, Hunter listened for Ashton. He better be in a dead run, heading straight back to Tessa\u2019s place.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Then I\u2019ll call the sheriff and have him verify with her family that you had permission and you can run along.\u201d The deputy glanced around. \u201cWhere\u2019s your vehicle?\u201d</p><p>Rourke shoved the key in his pocket. \u201cWe walked from Tessa\u2019s house, looking for any clues on the way over and by the cliff where she fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this weather? It\u2019s only going to get worse. After I clear this matter up, I\u2019ll drop you off at Tessa\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take us back to Tessa\u2019s house while you\u2019re verifying this?\u201d Hunter asked. \u201cThe winds are whipping up more, and we don\u2019t want to get stuck here in whiteout conditions.\u201d</p><p>The deputy held the phone to his ear and he nodded at Hunter, but then turned his attention to the phone. \u201cHello, Katie. Is the sheriff there? Where?\u201d He laughed. \u201cTell him to call me when he has a chance.\u201d The deputy shook his head and pocketed his phone. \u201cSheriff\u2019s seeing some new woman. After all those years of pining over his two-timing ex-wife, it\u2019s about time, but he\u2019s trying unsuccessfully to keep it under wraps. Climb in. I\u2019ll get you back to Tessa\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>The road conditions worsened by the mile. A violent gust of wind blew the deputy\u2019s car to the other side of the road. Between the slick conditions and the increasing wind, Hunter was surprised they weren\u2019t blown off the cliff.</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff will probably issue an evacuation order soon. We\u2019ve never had winds this high. And waves cresting forty-five feet? Unheard of. Some fool kids were even trying to surf. If you can imagine,\u201d the deputy said.</p><p>\u201cWilliam and I played soccer together on the high school team,\u201d Rourke explained to Hunter. \u201cWe always said we\u2019d blow this town when we graduated.\u201d</p><p>The deputy chuckled. \u201cYeah, look at us now.\u201d</p><p>The two continued to talk about old school days while Hunter watched out the window, hoping Ashton would get to Tessa\u2019s place and that Hunter\u2019s worries about the grays were unfounded. But he could still thrash Ashton for leaving the women alone.</p><p>At one point, he had to fight the urge to take over the deputy\u2019s driving, they were inching along so slowly. Hell, at this rate, Hunter could jog faster.</p> <p>As soon as the house came into view, Hunter grabbed hold of the door handle. Once the deputy stopped the vehicle, Hunter threw open the door and bolted for the house.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worried about Tessa,\u201d Rourke explained to the deputy. \u201cSheriff probably mentioned to you that she\u2019s had a couple of break-ins. You drive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. I\u2019ll let you know if the sheriff issues an evac order.\u201d</p><p>Rourke waved good-bye and the deputy drove off. Hunter tried the front door. Locked. He rang the doorbell. No answer. He and Rourke raced to the back of the house. Ashton\u2019s clothes were sitting half-buried in snow on the patio. Hunter stared at the kitchen window. If Tessa had been at the sink, she could have seen Ashton shapeshift.</p><p>Hunter bolted to the back door and tried the doorknob. Locked. He pounded hard enough he figured he\u2019d break the door down.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Meara yelled.</p><p>He released the breath he had been holding. Everything sounded fine. But when Meara let him in, he sensed the tension in the air. Meara was the only one of the three women who hid her fear well. Cara reeked of it and he figured it had to do with the fact Ashton was still missing. Tessa stared at Hunter as if he had sprouted devil\u2019s horns, her back rigid against the dining room chair.</p><p>Ashton\u2019s disappearance was probably the reason why all of them were so fearful. Unless something else was wrong, like Tessa had seen Ashton change into the wolf.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen Ashton?\u201d Cara asked, her voice wobbly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d At least he hoped he was. Despite being angry over Ashton\u2019s actions, Hunter still felt responsible for him.</p><p>Rourke patted the snow off his gloves. \u201cI\u2019ll take a look to see how far behind us he was.\u201d</p><p>Hunter nodded and Rourke exited the house, seized Ashton\u2019s clothes from the patio, and headed for the woods.</p><p>Cara grabbed her coat and gloves. \u201cI\u2019ll go with him.\u201d She slammed the door shut behind her.</p><p>Meara looked like she wanted to search for Ashton also, but it wasn\u2019t in her nature. She was more the wait-and-see kind of woman. Except in Hunter\u2019s case when he disappeared. He figured she knew he would go after her \u201cfriends\u201d when he discovered her missing and wanted to stop him from killing them. They were lucky Hunter didn\u2019t find them with her still.</p><p>Then he wondered if something else was going on with Tessa. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find anything incriminating, I\u2019m sorry to say, that would automatically clear your brother of the crime, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped and her jaw tightened.</p><p>He drew close and ran his hand over her arm, the muscle tensing. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep looking. I need to speak to Michael. When the weather clears up, I\u2019ll see him.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth were so tightly clenched, he assumed she was fighting tears. \u201cTessa, maybe we could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Meara grabbed her coat and gloves. \u201cMaybe you could fix Hunter some cocoa? Warm him up a bit? I\u2019ll see what\u2019s happening with the others.\u201d She threw on her coat and hat and bolted outside.</p><p>Hunter stared after his sister. What the hell was up? Meara didn\u2019t want him to make anything of a relationship with Tessa, yet her actions were tantamount to proving otherwise. She wouldn\u2019t have cared about Ashton\u2019s welfare when the others were handling it.</p><p>Hunter crouched next to Tessa, lowered himself to her level so he wouldn\u2019t appear so imposing like a wolf who lay down before one who was standing\u2014a non-threatening posture.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look at him, but toyed with the full mug of cocoa, cold now.</p><p>\u201cTessa, I know you\u2019re disappointed that we couldn\u2019t find evidence to support your brother\u2019s case of innocence, but I\u2019ve only begun to look into Bethany\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>Still, she refused to look at him. He wouldn\u2019t press the issue.</p><p>\u201cWhen Ashton returns, will you take a nap with me?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shot up and he sensed her fear\u2014the look in her eyes, the smell of it on her skin, the hint of perspiration on her brow, the tension in every muscle returning. He reached for her hand, but she pulled away from him. She remained seated as if the chair and table shielded her from his getting too close.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it something other than Michael\u2019s situation that distresses you? My sister? Did she upset you in some way? She can be pretty unconventional at times.\u201d</p><p>Tessa choked on a laugh. \u201cUnconventional.\u201d But the way she said the word was bitter, not with humor.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Hunter said softly. He reached for her hand again and this time she didn\u2019t avoid him, but she didn\u2019t respond with tenderness either as if he had captured her, the reluctant victim, and held her hostage. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong. Did Cara upset you? Or did Ashton\u2019s actions worry you when he left the three of you alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can shoot, Hunter. You know that already.\u201d Her eyes flashed annoyance.</p><p>Something else then. \u201cYes, you\u2019re a damned good shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked like she wanted to say something more, but clammed up.</p><p>He rubbed his thumb over her hand, wanting to set her at ease, but she didn\u2019t relax. \u201cSo what\u2019s wrong? I promise I\u2019m not going anywhere until I discover who murdered Michael\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>The back door opened and Meara entered first. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say how bad the storm was getting. Jeesh, the winds must be topping one hundred miles per hour.\u201d</p><p>Cara and Ashton both entered after that, Ashton\u2019s arm around her shoulders, neither of them looking very happy. \u201cSorry,\u201d Ashton said to Hunter, slouching as if he thought he was about to be whipped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a word with you later.\u201d Hunter would not accept this kind of insubordination, not when it endangered others\u2019 lives.</p><p>Rourke closed the door behind him. \u201cThat shed\u2019s about ready to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A grinding metal sound and then a scrunching noise and a bang followed. Everyone went to the window to see what happened.</p><p>\u201cHell, there goes the shed,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cWe saw several trees uprooted when we located Ashton and if this weather keeps up, we\u2019re bound to lose the\u2014\u201d</p><p>The kitchen light flickered and died.</p><p>\u201cElectricity,\u201d Rourke finished.</p><p>\u201cThe beach will be flooded so we can\u2019t get any more firewood,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>\u201cMakes for good snuggling weather.\u201d Cara tugged at Ashton\u2019s arm. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough firewood for a couple of days, if we conserve,\u201d Ashton said.</p><p>Hunter turned to speak to Tessa about the candles and flashlights for when it got dark, but she had left the dining room.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened while we were gone?\u201d Hunter asked his sister.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAshton left. Tessa wrote a list of suspects. We had cocoa. That\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think that was all of it. \u201cWhere\u2019s the list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving room. Coffee table, I think.\u201d</p><p>Hunter headed into the living room and grabbed up the piece of paper. \u201cAs soon as the weather clears, I want every one of these men checked out. In the meantime, Ashton, Rourke, see if you can salvage anything from the shed before everything blows away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d They headed out the back door.</p><p>Meara looked guilty as hell. Cara did, too, although he didn\u2019t know her that well, but in the short time he had been with her, he hadn\u2019t seen her so nervous\u2014the way she avoided looking at him and chewed her bottom lip instead of challenging him like she usually did. Ashton was back safe and sound. So what was the problem? The storm? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Meara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I thought you were going to take a nap with Tessa.\u201d She motioned to the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m going to clean the cocoa mugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d Cara vamoosed to the kitchen.</p> <p>A strange noise sounded in Tessa\u2019s bedroom. He listened, trying to discern what it was. A grating sound? A window opening?</p><p>He raced down the hall and grabbed Tessa\u2019s doorknob. Locked.</p><p>His blood chilled. \u201cTessa! Open up!\u201d</p><p>No response, but the wind was blowing into the room, papers fluttering, curtains flapping, the frigid air seeping under the bottom edge of the door. \u201cTessa!\u201d</p><p>Turning, he saw Meara watching him, wringing her hands. He didn\u2019t even want to know why at this point. He made a dead run for the front door and threw it wide open.</p> <p>Tessa struggled with the key in her car door lock. His heart beat out of bounds, the thrill of the chase deeply ingrained in him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t leaving him. Not unless he chose for her to do so.</p><p>He glanced at the key. Not making any headway on the lock. Frozen?</p><p>He stalked toward her, his footfall crunching on the glazed snow. She glanced up at him, held herself rigid, testing him with an icy gaze, but she shivered and looked like a rabbit caught in a trap. He gave her credit for not running away.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside and discuss this, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike two human beings?\u201d she asked, her eyes narrowed.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t help the smile that tugged at his lips, but then he frowned at her. \u201cIf you stay out here, you\u2019re going to catch pneumonia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can discuss this inside, now.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit together, and she stormed past him. Meara and Cara watched from the front entrance, but quickly moved out of Tessa\u2019s path. Hunter gave Meara a look that meant he would have a word with her later. Cara closed and locked the door behind him. Ashton and Rourke came inside from the back way.</p><p>\u201cNot much worth saving at this point.\u201d Ashton shook snow off his parka.</p><p>Everyone was glowering at Ashton, except for Tessa. Trembling, she knelt before the fire, her hands spread over the flames.</p><p>Hunter crouched beside her. \u201cAsk me what you will.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the others and then focused on Hunter. \u201cYou have two options as far as taking care of me. Make me one of you, or kill me.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 12</p><p>HUNTER SUSPECTED THE WORST\u2014THAT ASHTON HAD shapeshifted in plain view of Tessa and now he was faced with a new dilemma.</p><p>Rourke swore under his breath.</p><p>Hunter clenched and unclenched his hands. Damn Ashton. \u201cAshton, the window\u2019s open in the master bedroom. The door is locked. Go around the front and climb in, shut the window, and unlock the door, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with him,\u201d Rourke hastily said.</p><p>When the men left, Hunter pulled off one of Tessa\u2019s cold wet gloves and then the other.</p><p>Meara said, \u201cI\u2019ll make lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help her,\u201d Cara quickly added, and the two disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cTessa, what did you see?\u201d Hunter\u2019s gut clenched with concern for what she was feeling.</p><p>If he could undo the last few days in a heartbeat to save her from what now had to be done, he would. He couldn\u2019t believe Ashton had caused so much trouble. No wonder changing humans wasn\u2019t a good policy.</p><p>Tessa swallowed hard and stared at the fire while Hunter rubbed her cold fingers. \u201cAshton was acting crazy, pacing all over the place, and then he went outside and stripped off his clothes in the snow. I thought he was rabid, and I was afraid he would hurt Cara. Instead he... he changed. Transformed into a wolf. Cara wasn\u2019t surprised. Your sister told me nothing had happened. And if neither of them was shocked, it meant they were whatever he was also. And you, too.\u201d</p><p>Wanting her, despite everything\u2014her cousin, his own feelings about changing a human, the fact she had a brother, which would cause even more problems\u2014 Hunter unbuttoned her coat, knowing now he had no choice but to explain his world. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you have to terminate me now? I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Her eyes glistened with tears. \u201cHow could I? They\u2019d lock me away.\u201d</p><p>He let out his breath, unsure how to approach the problem. He didn\u2019t want to upset her any further, but he couldn\u2019t be dishonest with her at this point. \u201cLetting you go, isn\u2019t one of our options.\u201d Their laws had kept them alive and their secret intact for this long, he wasn\u2019t about to break one of the most important rules they lived by.</p><p>She blinked away tears and looked back at the fire. \u201cWill you at least help my brother get his release?\u201d</p><p>Her tearfulness cut straight through to his soul. \u201cChanging you was the other choice.\u201d Or giving her up to Devlyn Greystoke.</p><p>\u201cYour sister said it wasn\u2019t an option for you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Leave it up to his sister to be truthful at the most inopportune times.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s bedroom door opened, and Rourke stomped back down the hall. \u201cWhat else did you need done?\u201d</p><p>Ashton slinked in behind him.</p><p>\u201cRourke, why don\u2019t you take a nap in the guest room? Ashton, you take one in Michael\u2019s room. We\u2019ll need some sleep so we can pull guard duty tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rourke cast a sympathetic look Tessa\u2019s way and gave Hunter a hard look. Then he and Ashton headed down the hall.</p><p>\u201cIf I turned you...\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be crazy like Ashton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the same person you are now even after the change. Maybe he was already a little crazy.\u201d Hunter stroked Tessa\u2019s hand. \u201cThere are benefits for being what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShapeshifters. Lupus garous. Werewolves. We normally don\u2019t associate much with humans, and we don\u2019t normally change them.\u201d</p><p>Tessa\u2019s eyes were so big, Hunter knew telling her the facts of life wasn\u2019t going to be any easier than it had been when he told the guys.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have been born this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re born this way. Normally, it\u2019s much easier to stay with our kind since we\u2019ve grown up this way. Teaching a newly turned human can be a real trial. Both Rourke and Ashton have already made innumerable mistakes. If I could, I\u2019d take them to my home and keep them there, isolated from humans until they more thoroughly understood how dangerous it is for us to let down our guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Can you imagine if people knew of our existence, what would happen? DNA testing, for one, to learn why we heal so quickly, how we can shapeshift, what makes us age so slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou... you don\u2019t have the life span of a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Although we can die.\u201d He pulled off her coat. She looked so petite sitting there, he again wondered if she could handle being his mate. \u201cThink on it, Tessa. I won\u2019t pressure you into making a decision.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cDeath or life as a werewolf. No pressure. Right.\u201d She took a ragged breath and stared at the floor. \u201cYou wanted to take a nap.\u201d</p><p>And the fact she wouldn\u2019t look at him made him worry she was intending on trying to slip out while everyone was napping. \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>She looked so damned vulnerable, he didn\u2019t want to push her into accepting any of this until she could handle it. What was he supposed to do? Letting her know their secrets, but allowing her to live on her own as a human was not an option. But killing her wasn\u2019t either.</p><p>He ran his hands through her silky hair, wanting to bury his face in the sweet peach-scented strands. \u201cIn part, you and your brother are already one of us, if it helps any. It seems Jeremiah Cramer, your great-grandfather, was Seth Greystoke, a friend of my great-grandfather\u2019s. One of his great grandsons still lives. Which creates another situation. Maybe the solution, or not. Once Devlyn Greystoke learns of your existence, I\u2019d be willing to bet, he\u2019ll want you to join his pack.\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked so distraught, Hunter took her hand and kissed it, and he noted how small her fingers were compared to his, just like the rest of her\u2014petite, delicate, not tall like his sister or Cara, which meant she\u2019d be a small wolf when she shapeshifted, and most likely unable to deal with the heftier grays if one of them tried her. But touching her turned his body into a torrent of need\u2014the desire to claim her overcoming any rational judgment.</p><p>Trying to get his mind off what Tessa\u2019s sweet body did to his, he considered the matter of turning her further. He didn\u2019t object to making her one of their own for the same reason Leidolf did because of his roots, even though he and Meara were of royal lineage also, but having offspring who were not, didn\u2019t matter to him. Turning a reluctant woman did. But if she had wolf roots already and she was willing... \u201cYou have a choice, Tessa.\u201d As much as he hated to admit it.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to go with some stranger?\u201d She sounded slightly hysterical, her eyes wide, scared. \u201cI can\u2019t leave. My brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs the last of his kin, I\u2019m certain Devlyn would want to do whatever he could to help free your brother.\u201d</p><p>Although Hunter had every intention of freeing her brother himself, somehow.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s expression changed subtly\u2014almost as though she thought family might be more of a help than he would be. And the notion irked him. He was her savior, no one else.</p><p>But then she squeezed Hunter\u2019s hand and his groin tightened. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Hell, he wanted her, but in reality, since Devlyn was a pack leader and her kin, by their laws, he should decide her future. Hunter chided himself. That was one law he wasn\u2019t willing to abide by\u2014not when it came to Tessa\u2019s fate.</p><p>She bit her lip, her hands nervously rubbing her jeans. \u201cWhat, Hunter? If it pertains to me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Tessa.\u201d He tugged her from the floor and pulled her toward her bedroom. \u201cIf I was being perfectly honest with you, I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s out of my hands. That according to our laws, your cousin would decide what would happen to you and your brother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slumped a little. \u201cBut...? \u201d She looked up at him with a mixture of emotions\u2014hope, worry, insecurity.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give up control.\u201d Well, a hell lot more than that. He didn\u2019t want to give her up, period.</p><p>Her lips twitched up slightly.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s a natural curse when you\u2019re an alpha pack leader. Give no quarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...? \u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I make you mine to prevent the other grays from having you, Devlyn might choose to fight me because of it\u2014if I didn\u2019t get his permission first. All packs have female shortages. He may want to give you to one of his own sub pack leaders.\u201d</p><p>Not that Hunter wanted that, but alpha leaders didn\u2019t mate betas. Both an alpha male and female ran the pack. If Tessa wasn\u2019t alpha enough, she would never survive as his mate. Devlyn could pair her off with a subleader or a beta. If Tessa stayed with Hunter, there wasn\u2019t any way he was giving her to anyone else and that could put her in harm\u2019s way. He couldn\u2019t do that. But he didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her she might not be able to be an alpha\u2019s mate.</p><p>He took her into the room and shut the door.</p> <p>She folded her arms and glowered at him. \u201cRight, damn it. Like some guy I don\u2019t even know can come here and tell me who I have to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate. We don\u2019t marry.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot more to tell you about us before you really know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d Although he wasn\u2019t sure how much to reveal all at once.</p><p>For a moment, she looked annoyed, and he figured it had to do with not saying he\u2019d fight for her. He had no qualms about fighting Devlyn for her, but the fact of the matter still remained he had to do what was right for Tessa\u2019s safety.</p><p>But then Tessa began unbuttoning her blouse. He recognized that devious look in her eyes that meant she was up to something. Get him so worked up he didn\u2019t want to give her up, perhaps. He didn\u2019t want to give her to anyone, but if it meant keeping her safe, he\u2019d... well, he\u2019d have to do what was right for her.</p> <p>Hesitating, he didn\u2019t want to give her the wrong message. She gave him a wickedly sinful smile in response and that decided it. Talk about having no willpower when it came to the red-haired goddess.</p><p>She ran her fingers down Hunter\u2019s chest with a provocative stroke of her long nails and reached for his waistband. \u201cWhat happened to your pack? Are they the ones Leidolf said were in Portland?\u201d</p><p>What pack? Hell, his other head was thinking for him now.</p><p>He yanked her shirt down to her elbows, leaned over, and kissed her soft throat, his voice husky when he replied, \u201cThey weren\u2019t happy about losing their homes in California to the forest fire. They thought living in a city would be a nice change. But we\u2019re not urban wolves. Leidolf\u2019s pack is established in Portland. He has every right to defend his territory against encroachers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she murmured, lifting her chin as he ran his mouth lower, trailing kisses over her collarbone, down to the top edge of the lacy bra covering the swell of her breasts.</p><p>Despite not looking to see where her fingers roamed, she dipped them inside his sweatpants and a shiver of need stole through him.</p><p>Lower, he silently pleaded, wanting her to stroke the itch she\u2019d created. And she touched him, smiling when his arousal jumped in her hand.</p><p>Unable to restrain the urge to rip off her clothes and have his way with her, he reached down and attempted to unbuckle her belt, vowing she\u2019d wear sweats like him from now on, less to remove and lots quicker.</p> <p>She chuckled as he fumbled with the belt, and he growled. Somehow, despite his lust-soaked brain, he was able to remove Tessa\u2019s clothes without destroying them, baring all that luscious skin, her pert breasts, the nipples already peaked, but screened by her silky mane of red hair. She trembled in the frigid room, and Hunter scooped her up in his arms and carried her to the bed.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to go to Portland and bring them back.\u201d</p><p>Bring who back? Hell, all he cared about was Tessa at the moment. And he sure was rethinking the Devlyn situation, cousin or no, alpha leader problems notwithstanding. \u201cI can\u2019t leave you behind while I deal with my pack.\u201d</p><p>He set her on the bed, then climbed onto the mattress and pulled the covers over them to keep the chill out. Trailing a finger around his nipples, she tortured his body, caressing with featherlight touches. \u201cWhy does the stalker want me for real?\u201d</p><p>Jeez, she had to ask? Everything about her was sexier than sin\u2014just to look at, to touch, to taste, to smell her special scent. But beyond that? She drugged him with her easygoing manner, her innocence, yet her strength to right wrong, to persist when everything told her the situation was futile, to risk her life to protect him. What more could a lupus garou ask for in a mate?</p><p>He gave a ragged sigh, hating that she\u2019d garnered others\u2019 interest as well. \u201cYour pheromones, looks, actions. You caught his attention, but he\u2019s cautious in taking you because he\u2019s a beta.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips, possessively, craving every inch of her, to hold, to protect, to keep her for his own forever.</p><p>\u201cAhh, betas, of course. Your sister and Cara are alphas, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He groaned inwardly. Some part of his brain realized it was important for her to talk about this, but he sure as hell wanted to get on with what his other brain felt was important. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Rourke and Ashton?\u201d Her fingers slid over Hunter\u2019s arm, her gaze focused on the way his muscle tensed.</p><p>\u201cBetas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would I be?\u201d Her eyes shifted to his, and he could see the concern there.</p><p>Hunter took a deep breath. \u201cAll that I want in a woman.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened, her green eyes spearing him with a determined look. \u201cI\u2019m an alpha,\u201d she said, with great conviction. When he smiled, she pinched his pebbled nipple with a gentle squeeze. \u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her face, wanting to make love, but wanting to clear the air between them first. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re definitely an alpha.\u201d He couldn\u2019t lie to her and say she was always one, because he wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d fare among the alpha of his kind, but he hated the way her brows pinched together, when he wanted to reassure her instead.</p><p>\u201cA beta\u2019s not good, is it?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. Without betas, a lupus garou pack would constantly be in turmoil, alphas butting heads, what a mess. \u201cBetas in a pack are fine. Alphas must lead the pack though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I were a beta and you turned me, I\u2019d be stuck with someone like Rourke?\u201d</p><p>Hunter tightened his hold on her. Hell, no way.</p><p>\u201cOr someone of Devlyn\u2019s choosing,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d He ran his fingers over her smooth cheek and kissed her velvety lips, loving the way every bit of her felt to him, melding to him.</p><p>She parted her lips for him and touched her tongue to his, a sexy dominating caress, and then thrusting into his mouth, exploring, conquering, nearly undoing him.</p><p>He moaned and pushed her onto her back, her silky hair falling against the sheets, and he couldn\u2019t deny she was the most sensual and intriguing woman he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>With a gentle push of his knee, he spread her thighs, opening her sweet body to him, her short red curls drenched, her swollen pink lips wanting. Her eyes half-lidded, she more than obliged, her hands tugging at his hips to join her.</p><p>Sliding his engorged arousal into her tight sheath, he savored the way her body stroked him as he thrust into her, clenching, tightening, wringing him to the nth degree, heightening the exquisite pleasure. He cupped her face and conquered her mouth with his, her lips and tongue fueling his desire. Tightening her hands on his back, she arched against him, deepening the bond, their hearts beating hard, their breathing heavy and ragged.</p><p>For the moment, she was all his, but it wasn\u2019t enough. It would never be enough unless he could have her for all eternity.</p><p>As if she felt it was her last chance at convincing him she wanted him to choose her for his mate, she wrapped her legs around his waist, her heels digging into his ass, pressuring him to deepen his thrusts. And he gladly did her bidding, diving deeper, craving completion, wanting to find release in the only woman he\u2019d ever desired making his own.</p><p>She moaned, her orgasm gripping him with waves of pleasure, pulling him to the edge, and he quickly followed with a staggering climax that left him sated, but he knew it would never be enough.</p><p>Before he could roll off Tessa and pull her into his arms to enjoy the afterglow, someone pounded on the bedroom door as the wind roared over the house. Ignoring whoever it was, he shook his head and drew Tessa on top of him, wanting to snuggle and sleep, to recharge their batteries before they faced much more trouble.</p><p>\u201cHunter, I got through on the phone to the sheriff\u2019s office. Wind\u2019s are gusting up to one hundred miles per hour. Tessa\u2019s roof sounds like it\u2019s about to go. The sheriff\u2019s department wants everyone evacuated from the coastal areas,\u201d Rourke warned.</p><p>Tessa kissed Hunter\u2019s cheek, her hand caressing his chest. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to go to Portland.\u201d</p><p>Hunter agreed. \u201cPack two vehicles, Ashton\u2019s pickup since it made it before, and Meara\u2019s SUV. We\u2019ll be out in a minute, Rourke.\u201d</p><p>He yanked the covers aside and grabbed Tessa\u2019s clothes and handed them to her, taking a long look at her tantalizing body, her breasts heavy, her nipples taut, a slight sheen of perspiration making her skin shimmer, and slightly red from all the hot friction they\u2019d created. She gave him the same kind of salacious look, grinned at him when he caught her eye, and dressed.</p><p>When they entered the living room, something crashed outside and Tessa jumped. Ashton and Rourke ran to the front window and peered out.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d Ashton said. \u201cThere goes my new truck.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head, not happy about having to take Rourke\u2019s truck instead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better hurry before another tree comes down.\u201d Rourke jerked on his parka. \u201cDo we take my truck now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. Ashton can drive if he\u2019s more used to the conditions.\u201d At least Hunter hoped so.</p><p>Rourke scowled as if Hunter had unmanned him. \u201cNo one can get \u2018used\u2019 to these conditions.\u201d</p><p>Tessa handed him an armful of blankets for the trip, and Rourke carried them out to his truck.</p> <p>\u201cCara, you and Rourke ride with Ashton. He\u2019ll lead the way.\u201d Hunter turned to Meara. \u201cYou and Tessa will ride with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy two vehicles?\u201d Cara asked. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if we all stayed together in the SUV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf one of us has trouble, the other can pick up the stranded passengers. Let\u2019s go.\u201d The way things had been going since they had arrived here, he had hopes for the best, but planned for the worst.</p><p>Shingles on the ridge of the roof flew off, and Tessa rushed to lock the front door. Then she and the others climbed into their respective vehicles.</p><p>Once they were on the road, Hunter hoped Rourke\u2019s truck would hug the road better with Ashton driving it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about our pack?\u201d Meara stretched out on the middle seat, covered in blankets with a pillow underneath her head.</p><p>\u201cForce them to leave the city. Either they\u2019ll return with us or they\u2019ll have to go elsewhere. Staying in Portland is not an alternative.\u201d</p><p>But only three miles from Tessa\u2019s house, Ashton slammed on the brakes, the tires screeching, the taillights coloring the snow cherry. The vehicle slid perpendicular to the road.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh,\u201d Tessa gasped.</p><p>His skin prickling, Hunter pumped the brakes and tried to avoid colliding with Rourke\u2019s truck. Tessa gripped her seat. The SUV slid to a halt. Rourke\u2019s pickup tore off the road, plowing into saplings down the steep incline.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Hunter said, his voice gruffer than he intended. At least he prayed they were all right. He cut the engine. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p> <p>Tessa pulled on her parka. \u201cYou might need my help.\u201d</p><p>Not only did he not want her to see what had happened in case anyone had died, he didn\u2019t want her injured. Hunter grabbed her hand and shook his head, his look meant to make her obey. \u201cStay, Tessa. They\u2019ll be all right. We heal quickly, remember? If you become injured, we might not be able to get you any medical attention for some time. So stay.\u201d All he needed was for her to get hurt. No way was he going to permit it.</p><p>She pursed her lips, and then gave him a tight nod. He wanted to reassure her further, but time was of the essence and despite her noticeable reluctance, he was glad she\u2019d listened to him.</p><p>Meara poked her head out from under the covers in the backseat. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRourke\u2019s truck went off the road.\u201d The fact no one hollered up the hill to let them know everyone was all right furthered his disquiet.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d Meara jerked on her jacket, hat, and gloves. He could use his sister\u2019s help no doubt, although he hated to leave Tessa behind by herself.</p><p>She folded her arms and looked cross, her eyes narrowed, her brows pinched, a real hellion.</p><p>Hunter patted her leg, trying to reassure her. In a heartbeat, he would have taken her with him, except for the potential danger, and he really didn\u2019t want her to see the wreck if any of them hadn\u2019t survived. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p> <p>He opened the driver\u2019s door and the frigid winds blasted him.</p><p>\u201cRockslide? What next. I told you we should have gone to the city to live or at least stayed in California where it\u2019s not so wet and cold,\u201d Meara grouched, then slammed the door behind her.</p><p>This was their home, for better or for worse. Hell, the forest fires were worse. Hunter closed his door, gave one last long look at Tessa, still feeling she was safer locked in the vehicle, and then at a rush, he and Meara headed across the road and down the hill.</p><p>Tessa rubbed her hands together. Now that the SUV\u2019s heater was off, the chilled wind quickly cooled the interior of the vehicle. She watched where Hunter and Meara vanished. This is ridiculous. She wasn\u2019t a fragile piece of glass that could break with the slightest motion. With her brother, she had hiked and climbed every trail into the wilderness and... well, this was just nonsense.</p><p>She buttoned her parka. Why should she stay in the car while everyone else was helping out?</p><p>She yanked on her ski cap.</p><p>Just because they could heal fast, Hunter thought she could never do anything, just to avoid being injured?</p><p>She jerked on one glove, then the other. As soon as she pushed the door open, she saw lights approaching from behind, glowing softly in the curtain of blowing snow. What if the driver didn\u2019t realize the danger ahead? Tessa dove back into the SUV and looked for the hazard lights button. Where the hell is it? There! She switched it on.</p><p>Glancing over the seat, she watched as the light blue pickup parked about twenty feet behind Hunter\u2019s vehicle. She shivered from the cold.</p><p>The truck\u2019s engine remained running. She waited, looking back in the direction Hunter and Meara had gone. Rubbing her gloved hands, she warmed her chilled fingers. Come on, come on, Hunter.</p><p>She sat on her hands and looked out the back window. The occupants of the truck didn\u2019t make a move. Did they think she was going somewhere, and they were waiting for her to do so? She climbed out of the SUV and shut the door. Stomping her boots to warm her feet, she shoved her hands in her pockets and stared at the tinted windows of the truck. Come on. Get out of your vehicle and either ask to assist, or turn around and leave.</p><p>The truck inched forward and slipped on the ice and snow. She waved her arms, trying to tell them to go back the way they came. All Hunter would need was to have this truck plow into his vehicle. Then where would they be?</p><p>The truck stopped again. Tessa glanced back at the trees Rourke\u2019s truck had plowed down. Hell. She had to help them. Hunter and Meara were taking too long. She turned around to look at the pickup. Fine. She would go to them.</p><p>She stalked toward them and slipped, nearly falling. Heat suffused every pore. She slowed her step to keep her footing, but halfway to the pickup, her spine tingled with apprehension. No matter that the air was frigid, her hands felt sweaty and her skin perspired.</p><p>Fearing the motorist was silly. After all that had happened to her concerning the stalker, she was becoming paranoid. But no matter how much she rationalized her fear, she still couldn\u2019t move. The driver could get out and ask her what the matter was. That\u2019s what froze her in place. If it was a woman, surely she wouldn\u2019t fear another woman. Which made Tessa worry the driver was someone more sinister.</p><p>The truck continued to idle, its exhaust leaving a wake of frosty smoke in its path. Fine.</p><p>\u201cA rock slide\u2019s blocked the road,\u201d she hollered, motioning to the road ahead.</p><p>The driver didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>She whipped around, figuring she had done as much as she could to warn the idiot. Now it was high time she helped Hunter. She slipped on the ice-covered snow and nearly fell, her arms flailing to keep her balance. One of the pickup\u2019s doors opened. Another shiver stole up her spine. She didn\u2019t look back. Unable to shake free of the fear that gripped her, she walked as quickly as she could in the direction where Rourke\u2019s vehicle had disappeared, her heart racing faster than she could move.</p><p>Then running footfalls behind her, crunching on the crusted snow, warned her of the danger. Her heart in her throat, she tried to run, slipped, and landed on her butt. The person behind her was nearly at her back. Hoping her fear was unfounded, she turned. The man\u2019s ski-mask-covered face loomed in front of her before his fist slugged her in the forehead. She fell backward. Cried out. Knew at once this was the stalker. Had to be. And she was in a hell of a lot of trouble.</p><p>Amber eyes peered at her from the black knit mask. His lips turned up and she screamed, just before he clamped his gloved hand over her mouth and yanked her up from the road.</p><p>The truck inched closer. There were at least two of them. She tried to knee him in the groin, but he grabbed her around the waist and hoisted her over his shoulder.</p><p>She screamed, \u201cHunter! Help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTessa!\u201d was the reply from down the hill.</p><p>He was too far away. Too deep in the ravine to come to her rescue. She struggled so hard against the man, squirming to get loose, he fell on his backside. Scrambling to her feet, she managed to jerk her arm free from his iron grip. The driver\u2019s door flew open and the one behind it, too.</p><p>Ohmigod, how many were there?</p><p>She dashed away from the truck and slipped on the ice, falling on her knees. Pain shrieked through her kneecaps.</p><p>\u201cGet her, damn it,\u201d the man on the ground growled.</p><p>She jumped to her feet and took a step, but one of the men grabbed her arm, spun her around, and hit her in the cheek. Her vision blackened. She was doomed if she didn\u2019t do something\u2014and quick.</p><p>Using her knee, she gave a hard, short jab to the man\u2019s groin. He dropped to his knees, clutching his crotch, swearing.</p><p>The first man seized her arm and dragged her toward the truck. She dug in her heels and tried to jerk free. With as quick a move as she could manage, she slipped her right leg in front of him, and he tripped and fell.</p><p>And pulled her down with him.</p><p>\u201cGet in the damned truck!\u201d the one yelled, who she had hopefully maimed for life.</p><p>She noticed then, the third man was standing next to the truck still, his leg in a cast. Thank god he couldn\u2019t help them.</p><p>A wolf howled, and then another. Her hope soared, Hunter would come to her rescue. The injured man ran with his hands clutching his crotch at a fast limp toward his truck, cursing violently. The other was behind him and jumped into the driver\u2019s seat. He shut the door as three wolves raced by Tessa and slammed their bodies into the truck, snarling and clawing. She was damned glad they were on her side.</p><p>Before she could react, the driver drove forward, ready to run over anyone in his path while he tried to turn the vehicle around. A new flood of adrenaline rushed through her.</p><p>With her heart in her throat, Tessa scrambled to her feet and dove off the road into the woods. Tumbling down the steep incline, she smashed into trees until she slammed into a giant fir. Upon impact with her right side, the breath whooshed out of her. Up above on the road, the truck roared off. Beyond the pain she was in, she prayed Hunter and the others hadn\u2019t been injured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart beating furiously, Tessa lay next to the tree, her face bruised, her ski hat snagged on a branch several feet up the hill. Icy snow filled her boots and gloves and clung to her hair. She couldn\u2019t stop shaking, wishing she\u2019d had a fur coat and wicked teeth to deal with the brothers herself.</p><p>Three wolves peered down the hill at her from the roadway. \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she hollered, feeling foolish to be talking to wolves, yet immensely relieved to see they were unharmed.</p><p>Two tore off down the incline toward Rourke\u2019s truck that was even deeper in the ravine than she had envisioned. Trees blocked her view of the truck. The biggest wolf of the three, a beautiful gray, his face masked in white, made his way slipping and sliding to her. And she wanted so to give him a big hug and kiss.</p> <p>He nuzzled her hand and then her face where she hadn\u2019t been hurt. But she couldn\u2019t get over the fact that this big furry beast was a god in the flesh when he wasn\u2019t in his wolf suit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m all right. What about the others?\u201d As if he could say anything more in response than woof. She sighed. Although she was damned glad he scared the men off, she was having a hard time believing Hunter and the wolf were one.</p><p>She tried to pull herself up, but as soon as she put weight on her right ankle, pain shot through it. She gritted her teeth and forced herself up. \u201cGo. Help the others. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d As long as she hadn\u2019t broken anything. But she wasn\u2019t going to be a burden to them. Not when two of them were still unaccounted for, and she imagined they had been badly hurt.</p><p>Hunter watched her struggle as she grasped at tree branches, trying not to put any weight on her ankle. She could crawl up the hill if Hunter wasn\u2019t observing her. He began to shapeshift, his gorgeous wolf form quickly shifting into the bronzed god she knew best. One minute, a feral wolf, and the next, a dangerously seductive semi-immortal.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Hunter, you\u2019re going to get frostbite.\u201d</p> <p>Naked, he lifted her in his arms and hurried her up the hill to the SUV, his tight embrace heated, comforting, possessive, but still, she couldn\u2019t combat being annoyed with herself for her helpless condition when the others desperately needed Hunter.</p><p>As soon as he set her on the car seat, he commanded, \u201cStay. And lock the doors.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to delay him, especially while he was standing naked in the frigid weather, but she had to know. \u201cWhat happened to the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRourke\u2019s unconscious. Cara\u2019s hurt. We can\u2019t get the doors unjammed. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d He kissed her forehead and locked the door, then shut it. Then he stretched, and began to shift, the transformation so fast, she couldn\u2019t get over how he could be a human in one moment and a wolf in the next. The change was fluid in its sensual elegance, powerful, seductive, and for a moment, she wanted to know what it felt like\u2014exchanging skin for fur, brace-straightened small human\u2019s teeth for killer canines, having the speed and endurance and strength of a wolf instead of human frailties.</p><p>God, he was beautiful, no matter what form he took. Strong, gentle, protective.</p><p>A flash of a thought crossed her mind. What would she look like as a wolf if he changed her? Small, raggedy? Red?</p> <p>Hunter loped off in his wolf coat and vanished down the hill.</p><p>Great. Just great. Here the others needed her and she was totally useless. Worse. A handicap.</p><p>She yanked down the visor to look in the mirror and see what a mess she really was. Cheek red and swollen. Matching knot on her forehead. Runny nose, red as Rudolph\u2019s. But her ankle throbbed worst of all. Although a pounding headache and aching hip came in for second place. Damn the stalker and his brother.</p><p>She peered out the window. How badly were Cara and Rourke hurt?</p><p>Headlights shone in the side mirror. She jerked her head around.</p><p>Ohmigod. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>The adrenaline in her system spiked again.</p><p>Had they been watching, waiting for Hunter and the others to leave her alone again? Or was it another truck that looked like the stalker\u2019s, pale blue, darkly tinted windows, slowly making its approach like before.</p> <p>Chapter 13</p><p>SEEING THE BLUE PICKUP APPROACH, TESS A INSTANTLY forgot all her aches and pains. Her heart beat with renewed dread as she watched the truck\u2019s progress. The driver paused again some distance from the SUV. It had to be them. She looked in the backseat for a weapon. Ashton\u2019s rifle! Relief washed over her.</p><p>Her hands shaking, she grabbed the weapon and then unlocked the SUV\u2019s passenger door. With the greatest care, she managed to climb out without putting any weight on her ankle and leaned against the SUV\u2019s icy metal. Aiming the rifle at the pickup\u2019s windshield, she hoped they would get the message and back off, turn around, and leave for good, no matter who they were without having to fire a shot. No way did she want Hunter and the others to come running to protect her when they needed to rescue Rourke and Cara.</p><p>The driver didn\u2019t back off. In fact, the truck inched forward. She fired a warning round in between the driver and front seat passenger, blasting a hole in the glass, the gunfire reverberating in the woods. The rifle butt recoiled against her shoulder blade, bruising it, like the last time she\u2019d shot at the stalker, only in wolf form that time. The truck spun around, slid, stopped, and retreated. She let out her breath, feeling she\u2019d had a reprieve.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d Ashton hollered, carrying Cara across the road. Her head was bleeding, and she looked dazed, her eyes focusing on nothing.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cara.\u201d Tessa nearly dropped the rifle when she got the door for Ashton and stepped with her full weight on her injured ankle. Pain shot all the way up through her thigh, and she gritted her teeth, stifling a pathetic whimper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my hands full,\u201d Ashton grouched. \u201cI can\u2019t be carrying both of you at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, Ashton,\u201d Cara mumbled. \u201cGive the poor woman a break.\u201d</p><p>Despite his scowl and the hint of sarcasm in his voice, he sounded upset to see Cara hurt. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding to death, and you think I\u2019m not shook up about it?\u201d</p><p>Cara cast him a sardonic smirk. \u201cIt\u2019s one way to get rid of your mate in case you\u2019re already dissatisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live.\u201d Ashton helped her into the SUV. \u201cAt least Hunter warned me you would.\u201d</p><p>Cara puckered her lips and blew him a kiss. \u201cHmm, the honeymoon\u2019s already over.\u201d</p><p>But Tessa didn\u2019t think so. Rather, the way he acted so tenderly toward her, despite his disdain, he seemed to suit Cara perfectly. A match made in werewolf heaven.</p><p>Tessa hurried to sit with Cara and slipped her hat over the head wound, wishing she had a scarf instead. She applied pressure and hoped Cara would be all right.</p><p>\u201cGo help Hunter. Tessa\u2019s taking good care of me,\u201d Cara ordered Ashton.</p><p>He grunted, considered her for a moment longer and then checked to make sure the truck hadn\u2019t returned. \u201cStay in the vehicle this time,\u201d he said to Tessa, then closed the door, and took off across the road, disappearing down the hill.</p><p>As if she planned on going anywhere now. \u201cAre you really going to be all right?\u201d As big a gash as Cara had, Tessa figured she might need a blood transfusion and stitches.</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t look so worried. On second thought, continue to look worried. It\u2019s nice having a friend who\u2019s anxious over my welfare. It\u2019s not really part of our lifestyle. We get hurt. We get better. Life goes on. Everyone knows that in a pack. No worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rourke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>But the way Cara avoided looking at Tessa, she was pretty sure Cara didn\u2019t know the truth.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill any of them? The men in the truck?\u201d Cara asked, her voice hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid it wasn\u2019t them. What if it was some other motorist with a pickup that looked like theirs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was them. The truck had the same engine rumble.</p><p>Hunter couldn\u2019t leave Rourke\u2019s truck, as he was wedged in between the half-jammed door, trying to get it opened wide enough to get me out. Ashton was in the same predicament, and Hunter didn\u2019t want Meara leaving, figuring you were safe inside the locked SUV. But when you fired the rifle, he swore you\u2019d never mind him if you joined the pack. Meara said you nearly unmanned the one guy, and if she\u2019d gotten a hold of him, she would have done the rest. You got her vote. Guess you\u2019re an alpha after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Like Tessa really believed that now, laid up with an injured ankle, unable to help anyone.</p><p>The sound of footfalls crunching on the frozen roadway caught their attention, and Tessa was relieved to see Hunter and the others, although seeing Rourke unconscious made her heart hitch.</p><p>\u201cHere comes the rest of the crew. Help me into the very backseat, will you, Tessa? It\u2019s going to get a little crowded.\u201d</p><p>Tessa helped Cara into the backseat and was mad at herself for saying ouch when she pressed against her ankle. Cara and Rourke were the ones with the real injuries.</p><p>She smiled at Tessa. \u201cBelieve me, my head doesn\u2019t hurt a bit. I know what it\u2019s like to have torn ligaments or a broken ankle. It hurts. Nothing to be ashamed of. And if you hadn\u2019t dove over the cliff, that maniac might have injured you a hell of a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>Meara jerked the car door open, letting in a whirlwind of cold and snow. Hunter lay Rourke on the middle seat, his eyes shut, unresponsive.</p><p>Her heart hammering, Tessa leaned over the seat to touch Rourke\u2019s forehead. \u201cIs he going to be all right?\u201d He had to be. Didn\u2019t their kind have recuperative abilities? Yet, what if\u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s got a concussion. We\u2019re returning to your place,\u201d Hunter said, his voice dark and strained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit with Rourke.\u201d Meara climbed in and lifted Rourke\u2019s head onto her lap.</p><p>Ashton got into the front seat with Hunter, then slammed the door shut.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to get a license plate number off that truck, did you, Tessa?\u201d Hunter backed away from where Rourke\u2019s vehicle had left the road and turned around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBefore or after the one guy slugged me?\u201d she asked. Hell, she was lucky to see that the truck was pale blue and had tinted windows in this snow. And now a bullet hole with a spider web of cracks trailing out from it in the center of the windshield. If they didn\u2019t replace it, she would recognize it anywhere.</p><p>Hunter chuckled darkly. \u201cYes or no would have sufficed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do about them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnd their pathetic existence.\u201d</p><p>Rourke moaned.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me, Rourke?\u201d Meara asked.</p><p>Tessa leaned over the seat again to get a look at him, keeping her hand still planted on the hat over Cara\u2019s wound to stem the bleeding. He focused his eyes on Meara and gave her a devilish smile.</p><p>Meara leaned away from him and folded her arms. \u201cHe\u2019s going to live.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter looked in the rearview mirror and caught Tessa\u2019s eye. He hadn\u2019t thought Rourke would be all right. But now his shoulders relaxed, and he concentrated on the road again.</p><p>She took a deep breath of relief.</p><p>\u201cDid you at least shoot one of them?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI shot the windshield. I wasn\u2019t sure the truck was theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was them.\u201d</p><p>Rourke said, \u201cI... got... a... call... just... before\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShh, let Ashton tell the story,\u201d Meara said.</p><p>Ashton cleared his throat. \u201cThe Department of Transportation sent out the word that the coastal highway was closed because of downed electric lines, flooding, slides, and fallen trees and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked up from pressing the cap on Cara\u2019s forehead to see why Ashton had quit talking.</p><p>Hunter pulled to a stop in front of a Douglas fir blocking the road. \u201cUnless anyone thought to bring along a chainsaw, looks like this is the end of the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many miles left before we get to Tessa\u2019s place?\u201d Meara asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d Hunter shut off the engine. \u201cAshton and I can go back and grab your chainsaw, Tessa, and cut up the tree, then we\u2019ll drive home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tessa said. Everyone waited for her to speak further on the matter. She had expected Hunter would just ignore her response. She straightened her shoulders. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait here like proverbial sitting ducks. Unless you think Cara and Rourke are too injured to move, and then we\u2019ll have to take our chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Cara said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right. Just someone help me up.\u201d Rourke tried to sit up with Meara\u2019s help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of you, Tessa,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this stubborn streak you have later. If everyone is agreeable, we\u2019ll all walk back to Tessa\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>Both Rourke and Cara looked paler than normal, but they put on stoic faces and began the trek home. Tessa had planned to somehow walk on her own, but Hunter lifted her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t carry me all that way.\u201d</p><p>Everyone chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a lupus garou\u2019s strength, you\u2019d probably be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard anyone question Hunter\u2019s strength before and get off that easily,\u201d Meara said, her voice amused. Rourke stumbled and she took hold of his arm and kept glancing at him as if to make sure he was okay.</p><p>Ashton had his arm around Cara\u2019s waist, and she snuggled under his arm.</p><p>\u201cAbout the driver of the truck, I couldn\u2019t kill him. I was afraid he might not have been the same guy who was stalking me. And even if he was...\u201d Tessa let her words trail off. She couldn\u2019t have murdered him in cold blood. If he had tried to run her over with the truck again, she wouldn\u2019t have hesitated then.</p><p>Hunter shook his head. \u201cThe bullets wouldn\u2019t have killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they were silver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo legend says. I don\u2019t know of anyone who shot a lupus garou with silver bullets. But it could have happened. That\u2019s often how legends get started.\u201d</p><p>They all grew quiet. The snow fell around them, the wind still blowing hard, and they slipped as they walked on the icy road. After a mile, Rourke had slowed his pace even more, and he seemed to be leaning on Meara\u2019s strength. Ashton finally lifted Cara and carried her. But before they reached the house, Tessa saw a black Hummer parked in the driveway. Her heart tripped.</p><p>\u201cLeidolf,\u201d Hunter said, his voice couched in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cThe red lupus garou is back for the redhead,\u201d Meara said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack for me?\u201d Not that there were any other redheads in their little party. \u201cRed lupus garou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are red and grays,\u201d Meara explained.</p><p>\u201cBetter not be the reason why he\u2019s returned,\u201d Hunter responded.</p><p>Tessa didn\u2019t see any sign of Leidolf in the Humvee, then observed him looking out the picture window.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he get in my house?\u201d Her frigid skin turned icier.</p><p>Leidolf opened the front door and came outside. \u201cBack door was unlocked. Road was blocked by downed wires the way I was headed. Looks like you ran into some trouble, too.\u201d</p><p>Tessa felt sick to her stomach. At least she was pretty sure she had locked the back door. Unless someone had gone out that way and hadn\u2019t relocked the door.</p><p>\u201cRockslide our way. Then on the return home, a tree had fallen across the road,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>Leidolf dropped his gaze to Tessa as if he had only now noticed her in Hunter\u2019s arms. \u201cIs she injured badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she is not injured badly.\u201d Tessa frowned at him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to act like she was a child or didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>He smiled and then looked at Hunter. \u201cWe need to talk about the woman.\u201d</p><p>Woman, as in her? Hunter didn\u2019t respond, just carried Tessa into the house and headed for her bedroom. The red lupus garou was so intolerably arrogant.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll play nurse,\u201d Meara said. \u201cNot my favorite role, but I can muddle through.\u201d She followed Hunter into the master bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Meara. Go take care of Cara,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Ashton will want to look after her,\u201d Meara said.</p><p>Hunter lay Tessa on the bed, and then pulled off her gloves. \u201cI need Ashton to play guard, and I\u2019ll take Leidolf with me to cut up that tree so we can return with the SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they come after you?\u201d Tessa asked, not liking this one bit.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t mess with two alpha lupus garou males, guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you trust Ashton to stay put this time?\u201d Meara asked.</p><p>\u201cTo protect his injured mate? I think so. Besides, I don\u2019t trust Leidolf to stay here with Tessa.\u201d</p><p>Meara laughed. \u201cYou know what, dear brother? I don\u2019t either.\u201d She headed down the hall and spoke in Michael\u2019s bedroom. \u201cHere, Ashton, let me take care of Cara. Can you talk with Rourke for a minute? Make sure he\u2019s lying down in the guest bedroom? I\u2019ll see him after I bandage Cara\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we really leave the back door unlocked?\u201d Tessa asked Hunter. \u201cI know for sure I locked the front door, but we were all busy getting stuff for the trip, I just don\u2019t know about the back door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither we did, or we didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t worry about it, Tessa. They won\u2019t try to get in with as many of us as there are here now.\u201d He got her a glass of water and some medicine. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the pillow and unbuttoned her parka, trying to ignore her throbbing ankle or the fact the house was frigid.</p><p>Hunter soon returned with an ice pack from the freezer. \u201cGood thing you had this handy.\u201d He pulled the boot off her uninjured foot, and then carefully slipped the other off as she gritted her teeth in silent suffering.</p><p>\u201cBroken or sprained?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBruised and swollen. We won\u2019t know whether it\u2019s broken or sprained without an x-ray.\u201d</p><p>He placed the ice pack on her ankle, and then helped her out of her coat. Pulling the comforter off the bed, he moved it over her so that it didn\u2019t cover her foot. \u201cYour socks are wet and cold. Let me get some dry ones for you.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he pulled open the top drawer, she opened her mouth to tell him where he should have gone. He held up a handful of colorful silk panties and smiled. \u201cWrong drawer.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cTry the one below that.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a couple of pairs of pastel fuzzy socks and closed the drawer with his hip.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t match.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and pulled off her wet socks and then slipped on the dry ones. \u201cThe way to avoid spending hours looking for matching socks is to have all the same color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me. It\u2019s either that or wear nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Yeah, she could see Hunter like that\u2014in nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d Awful, really, but maybe the medicine would kick in soon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar. Don\u2019t ever play poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI play poker very well, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with me. I\u2019d insist on strip poker and I\u2019d have you naked in record time.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back after a little while.\u201d</p><p>She saluted him.</p><p>\u201cWrong hand. You\u2019d never make it in the Navy SEALs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t salute when they\u2019re undercover. Remember?\u201d She raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d Meara said, walking into the room. \u201cCara\u2019s sleeping. Rourke is lying in bed. Ashton\u2019s working on a fire. Go talk to Leidolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d Hunter kissed Tessa on the lips, hot and wanting, pressing for more, until he pulled his mouth away with reservation, and she wanted to drag him back and devour him whole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t allow her to move from the bed, Meara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one guy had a walking cast on,\u201d Tessa said, as Hunter was about to leave the room.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw. He had a broken leg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you healed up quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead of six to eight weeks, it would be more like a week. Rest. I\u2019ll return soon.\u201d He winked and left.</p><p>Meara pulled a chair up to the bed and sat down. Tessa opened her mouth to speak, but Meara raised her finger to her own lips and raised her brows.</p><p>In the living room, Hunter said, \u201cCome on, Leidolf. Let\u2019s get a workout on that downed tree. Watch the others, Ashton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you can count on me.\u201d</p> <p>The front door slammed closed.</p><p>Meara took a breath. \u201cI hope Hunter doesn\u2019t get into a fight with Leidolf over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d Unable to quit shivering, Tessa pulled the covers to her chin.</p><p>\u201cTwo alpha males interested in the same woman? Hell, you saw what happens when one beta wants you. You better believe now that you have to be turned; Leidolf\u2019s interested, and there will be trouble between him and my brother. Not only that, but this business with Devlyn Greystoke is bound to cause problems. Hunter told me Devlyn lost all his family in a fire. Any family connection, no matter how slight, would most likely interest him. Which leads to the real problem.\u201d</p><p>Tessa tensed, not liking the warning in Meara\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the shortage of females in a given pack, a leader who can entice a female to join his pack\u2014 particularly if it\u2019s his relation\u2014can offer her to another member, strengthening his bonds with his pack.\u201d</p> <p>Finally finding her voice, Tessa said, \u201cThat sounds like some medieval barbaric ruling. The king decides which of his wards weds and whom. Why didn\u2019t Hunter already tell me this?\u201d</p><p>Meara shrugged, but Tessa could tell she wasn\u2019t saying all there was about the subject. \u201cAll right, so what about Leidolf? He doesn\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But for lupus garou, pheromones have a lot to do with the selection process. We\u2019re attracted to someone\u2019s looks, but also to the sexual scent each of us gives off. It\u2019s subtle, not noticeable to the human population. Since the lupus garou males outnumber the females, males are always on the lookout for a female. But what entices one male might not another. It\u2019s like having a craving for chocolate and entering a shop full of spicy pickles. Kills the desire. Walk into the store next door where a pot of hot chocolate is brewing, the male is in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPickles and hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>Meara chuckled. \u201cOkay, maybe peppermint and hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>Ashton poked his head in. \u201cInteresting discussion. Fire\u2019s going good. Did you want to move in there? This room is awfully cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSparks will fly if she\u2019s moved in there by the fire and Leidolf gets close to her when he and Hunter return,\u201d Meara warned.</p><p>Ashton gave her a devious smile. \u201cNo television, radio, nothing else better for entertainment. Besides, it\u2019s freezing in here and Tessa\u2019s shivering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is awfully chilly in here. With the ice pack on my ankle, it\u2019s making me even colder.\u201d</p><p>Although she intended to walk with Ashton\u2019s help, he lifted her from the bed. \u201cCan you bring the comforter, Meara?\u201d Ashton asked. \u201cUnfortunately, all the blankets are either in my truck or your SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, hell, I never thought of it,\u201d Meara said. \u201cAt least when the guys come back, we\u2019ll have some of the blankets. Is Cara warm enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we get Tessa situated on the couch, I\u2019ll check on Cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay with her. I\u2019ll be the guard for a while.\u201d</p><p>Ashton lay Tessa on the couch. \u201cHunter will be pissed if I\u2019m not guarding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d Meara waved her hand and then covered Tessa with the cover. \u201cGo. Keep Cara warm.\u201d</p><p>When Ashton retired from the room, Tessa asked, \u201cHe really won\u2019t be mad at him, will he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But, we can come up with a good story.\u201d</p><p>Right. As if Tessa could bluff her way through anything where Hunter was concerned.</p><p>With the incessant frigid wind blowing, Hunter trudged through the snow back to the SUV with Leidolf at his side, carrying the axe while Hunter held the chainsaw Ashton had rescued from the demolished shed.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t turned the woman. Yet, I imagine as cozy as you are with her, she knows what we are by now,\u201d Leidolf finally said.</p><p>Hunter knew the red was interested in Tessa, and he couldn\u2019t help but be irked by it. Hell, he had enough problems already. \u201cIt\u2019s my business to take care of. Where are my people, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Leidolf ignored his question. \u201cShe\u2019s a petite redhead. If she\u2019s turned, she\u2019ll be more like a red wolf than a gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be a gray. But what\u2019s your point?\u201d Hunter was trying to keep his temper, but he knew exactly where this line of reasoning was going.</p><p>\u201cTwo bachelors in my pack are seeking mates.\u201d</p><p>Well, not exactly what he expected Leidolf to say. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a royal. I already told you that. The woman wouldn\u2019t interest me.\u201d</p><p>Hunter knew better, just the way Leidolf observed Tessa when he thought Hunter wasn\u2019t looking, the way he pretended disinterest when he looked at her and knew Hunter was watching.</p><p>Leidolf swung the ax as if fighting an unseen enemy. \u201cBut since you\u2019re not interested in changing her and two of my men are, it seems we could come to some kind of agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the weather breaks, I\u2019ll go to Portland, strictly to take my rowdy pack members off your hands, and speak with Tessa\u2019s brother in prison at Salem on the way up there. Tessa will stay with me for her own protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t eliminated the stalker yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou noticed Tessa\u2019s injuries? The stalker did that. Or one of his brothers.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf\u2019s expression turned stormy. \u201cAnd they still live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now. As soon as the storm quits pounding the coast, we\u2019ll be up to your place. You might have noticed Tessa lost her shed, part of the shingles on her roof, a couple of trees came down on her property, one on Ashton\u2019s truck, and she has no electricity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo electricity in parts of Portland either. Our winds haven\u2019t reached the levels yours have, but we\u2019ve suffered a lot of devastation from this system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where are my people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve isolated them in one of my barns.\u201d</p><p>Hunter stiffened his spine and glared at Leidolf.</p><p>He cast him a smirk. \u201cTeach them to run out on their pack leader. Give them worse conditions than they\u2019re used to and they\u2019ll beg to return. Although I\u2019ll admit, two escaped to Washington State.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had problems with your pack of this sort\u2014that you would admit to?\u201d</p><p>Leidolf grinned. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never had your kind of trouble. But then again, I\u2019d been a loner for a number of years before I came here. Some in my pack believe I have special powers.\u201d</p><p>Hunter bit back a laugh and with the most serious face he could muster, asked, \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome say I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like it to me.\u201d Hunter hoisted the chainsaw over the other shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re both alphas and the magic only works on betas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe because we\u2019re both royals.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf stared at Hunter for a minute. \u201cYou\u2019re a royal, but would take a human mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have, had the circumstances been different. But not because I\u2019m a royal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, so keeping the lines pure doesn\u2019t mean anything to you.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head. \u201cNo, changing a human is the only thing that makes the difference, only now it seems I have no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always have choices. You can give her to me.\u201d</p><p>Hunter laughed. \u201cYou, or the two males who want a mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me, my pack, for one of the males who wants her. Don\u2019t you think three newly turned lupus garous in one pack will be a little much to handle?\u201d Leidolf asked, avoiding the issue.</p><p>\u201cYou live in the city. How could you manage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d keep her at my ranch in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Rourke or Ashton off my hands?\u201d</p><p>Leidolf laughed. \u201cI need females, not more males.\u201d He shook his head. Then he tilted his chin up with a gleam in his green eyes. \u201cI contacted Devlyn Greystoke in Colorado to let him know about his distant cousin, as a courtesy.\u201d</p><p>Courtesy, my ass.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as the weather clears, he\u2019s flying out here. He wanted me to give you a message since I didn\u2019t have your phone number. Don\u2019t touch her.\u201d</p><p>Hunter attempted to shrug off the annoyance that another leader was dictating to him, even if he was distantly related to her. \u201cAnd you still want Tessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say whatever happens before he arrives, happens. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem dealing with him. Not after he slipped Bella out from under my nose when she was living secretly in my territory and she\u2019s a red.\u201d</p><p>So that was why Leidolf told Devlyn about Tessa? Not out of some admiration for the gray who\u2019d fought the murdering red alpha leader, or because he felt it was his duty. Hell no. Leidolf wanted to get back at Devlyn for stealing Bella, in the event Hunter took Tessa for his own.</p><p>Leidolf stopped dead and stared at the tree blocking the roadway around the bend. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me it was that big.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>\u201cOUCH,\u201d TESS A SAID AS A STAB OF PAIN SHOT THROUGH her ankle while Meara helped her settle on the couch in front of the fire.</p><p>\u201cIf Hunter changes you, it won\u2019t take as long for you to heal.\u201d Meara sat down on the chair opposite her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t care for me much.\u201d Although if Cara had spoken the truth, Meara admired Tessa somewhat and had given her stamp of approval behind her back.</p><p>\u201cI really have no choice, do I?\u201d Meara offered her a wicked smile.</p><p>Tessa couldn\u2019t tell if she was teasing or being truthful. Maybe a little of both.</p> <p>\u201cHunter will be changing you. Then you\u2019ll be our pack leader\u2019s mate. So...\u201d Meara shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll have to live with it, or give you a hard time. And believe me, I\u2019m very capable of it. Just ask Hunter. Are you alpha enough to take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to be, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to be one of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see that I have much choice.\u201d Yet if Tessa could have had a semi-normal life with Hunter, she would have jumped at the chance. Marriage meant getting along with the relatives though, but mixing it up with the personalities of a werewolf pack?</p><p>The doorbell rang and Tessa glanced back at the door. Please be Hunter and Leidolf.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see who it is,\u201d Meara said.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s heart sped up. \u201cWait, let me come with you.\u201d She tried to stand.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t walk on that foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay put, Tessa,\u201d Ashton said, hurrying into the living room, zipping up his jeans, his chest bare.</p><p>Meara crossed the floor and peeked out the security hole. \u201cOh, hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Ashton asked.</p> <p>\u201cUhm, three guys I know. If Hunter catches them here, they\u2019ll be dead meat.\u201d Meara opened the door. \u201cGo home before my brother finds you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Meara. We\u2019re planning on heading up to Idaho for a change of scenery. Come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d Ashton said, joining Meara at the door, his voice as threatening as Tessa had ever heard it. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He might be a pushover when it came to Cara, which made her wonder if Bethany had had the same effect on him. But when it came to most men, except for Hunter, he could get pretty physical.</p><p>Tessa couldn\u2019t see the other guys, but she was dying to get a look.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make us? One lone male?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Rourke said, looking pale still as he made his way to the front door, a little unsteady on his feet. \u201cOh hell, they\u2019re three of the ones Hunter and I smelled down by the beach. Why don\u2019t you leave before the two alpha pack leaders return and rip you guys to shreds?\u201d</p><p>One laughed. \u201cLike there\u2019d be two alpha leaders chumming together.\u201d</p> <p>Her head bandaged, Cara walked into the room and grabbed the rifle. \u201cHere, Ashton. Want to go hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, maybe you\u2019d like to go with us,\u201d another male said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a mate. He\u2019s the one now holding the loaded rifle,\u201d Cara said. \u201cSo maybe you ought to run along like everyone says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know anything about the gray Ashton saw? My stalker?\u201d Tessa asked from the couch.</p><p>\u201cA stalker, you say, little lady?\u201d one of the men said. \u201cWe might know something about it. Got some beers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. You guys just get out of here,\u201d Meara warned. \u201cIf my brother catches you after you encouraged me to leave our cabin, no telling what he\u2019ll do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf any of them know about my stalker, I want to talk to them,\u201d Tessa said, trying to make it off the couch. \u201cSo let them in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t.\u201d Meara shook her head at Tessa. \u201cBelieve me, you don\u2019t want to see what Hunter will do if he finds them here.\u201d</p><p>Tessa sat on the arm of the couch and scowled. \u201cLet them in now, or else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is her house,\u201d Cara conceded.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Meara folded her arms. \u201cI won\u2019t watch Hunter kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with them, we\u2019ll talk, and then return. All right with everyone?\u201d Jeesh, Tessa couldn\u2019t believe she would have to leave her own house to interrogate possible witnesses.</p><p>\u201cThen Hunter would really kill them,\u201d Meara said. \u201cNo way are you leaving with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not one of us?\u201d one of the men asked, trying to look around the wall of people at the door.</p><p>Tessa caught a glimpse of the man who appeared to be in his midtwenties, black beard and shoulder-length hair, dark brown eyes. Cute. No wonder he had enticed Meara to go with him.</p><p>He whistled. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a human in a lupus garou pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in and tell me what you know about my stalker,\u201d Tessa commanded and would have dragged him into the house, if it hadn\u2019t been for her blamed ankle.</p><p>No one moved. Meara and the rest still blocked the three guys from entering. Ashton still held his rifle ready.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Tessa hobbled to the front door. \u201cLet me out and I\u2019ll speak with them on the front porch.\u201d</p><p>Rourke grabbed her arm so she could lean against him. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have your coat on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, someone get it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell, let them in.\u201d Meara raised her hands in resignation. \u201cIf they\u2019re too stupid to recognize the danger...\u201d She shrugged and returned to the living room and collapsed on the recliner.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Ashton asked, still keeping the men at bay on the front porch.</p><p>\u201cLet them in,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cIt\u2019s my house and my business. Besides, if Hunter learns you sent them away and they had information about the guy who\u2019s trying to turn me, he\u2019d be even more furious.\u201d</p><p>The black-haired guy nodded. \u201cI told my friends I thought that was what this was all about. Either that, or a pretty lupus garou female lived here on her own. Although we smelled a human female and suspected the gray got himself hooked on one of them instead.\u201d</p><p>Rourke lifted Tessa in his arms and carried her back to the couch. \u201cMight as well let them in, Ashton. Tessa\u2019s right. If they know something about this gray and his brothers, and we chase these guys off, Hunter\u2019s bound to be furious with us.\u201d He cast Meara a sympathetic look. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll just have to hope he doesn\u2019t kill them afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can get whatever information they have out of them quickly, and they can be on their way,\u201d Cara suggested, sitting beside Tessa on the couch.</p><p>Ashton motioned with the gun. \u201cGet inside. You\u2019re letting all the cold air in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it\u2019s our fault,\u201d the black-haired guy said. \u201cJessup\u2019s the name. These are my friends, Redmond, on account he\u2019s got a red lupus garou in the mix way back when, otherwise he\u2019s all gray. We try not to hold the other against him.\u201d He gave Redmond a sly smile. \u201cAnd Butch, cuz he chopped off all his hair, although we haven\u2019t figured out why he would do that now in the dead of winter.\u201d</p><p>Looking cross, Meara cleared her throat. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve made your introductions, tell us what you know about this guy and his brothers and then get your butts out of here.\u201d</p><p>Redmond stood next to the fire, warming his backside and grinned at Tessa. \u201cI can see why he\u2019s got the hots for you. So, are you the one who\u2019s getting her?\u201d he asked Rourke.</p><p>Meara gave a haughty laugh. \u201cHe might want her, but my brother is the one who\u2019s claimed her. Quit changing the subject and tell us what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought we might have a beer while we\u2019re talking.\u201d Butch\u2019s pale green eyes speared Tessa.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tessa wondered why the guy seemed so familiar. The courthouse! His hair was cropped short now, not long like when she had seen him at the trial, she was pretty sure. And he stood a little taller now, not as sloop-shouldered. But the eyes... she was sure they were the same eyes that had watched her so closely. \u201cNo alcohol in the house.\u201d Tequila, but not for the likes of them. \u201cWhat do you know about my stalker?\u201d</p><p>She noticed Rourke surreptitiously taking pictures of the three men using his phone. She knew if he put his heart into it he would make an excellent investigative reporter.</p><p>\u201cHe and his brothers aren\u2019t from around here,\u201d Jessup said. \u201cLike most unmated males, they\u2019re looking for a female. He saw you sometime and decided you were the one for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met them? Talked to them? Know who they are?\u201d</p><p>Jessup tipped his head to the side. \u201cYoloff is the one who wants you. The one with the broken leg, he\u2019s Andreas, and Ren is the other. They\u2019re from Arizona, not looking to settle down here. Too wet. I talked to Yoloff. He didn\u2019t say what he was doing here exactly, but I knew it had to be over a woman. They plan to return to Arizona once they\u2019ve finished their business here.\u201d</p><p>Or Hunter finished with them. Tessa looked over at Butch. \u201cHow come you were at my brother\u2019s trial?\u201d</p><p>He stared her down as if he was trying to intimidate her, then finally shrugged. \u201cWhy would I be at a human\u2019s trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d</p><p>Waiting for his response, everyone watched him. Either Redmond and Jessup didn\u2019t know their friend had been at Michael\u2019s trial, or they pretended innocence.</p><p>Butch gave her a smirk. \u201cDon\u2019t know your brother, why he\u2019d be on trial, or where it was held either. You must have mistaken me for someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been at my house at some time or another, would you have? As an electrician? Plumber?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Then Rourke jumped into the fray. \u201cThe three of you were at Bethany\u2019s house. Why?\u201d</p><p>Butch smiled in an evil way, turning his attention from Rourke to Tessa. \u201cI thought we were discussing your stalker, Miss Anderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems you might know something about Bethany\u2019s murder, too,\u201d Tessa said, her blood stirring. \u201cWhere do you live? Why have you been in the area? Seeking mates, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Redmond winked at her. \u201cCan\u2019t blame us. When the urge hits us... Human females are one thing, but they\u2019re not quite as feral as our own kind. No offense, miss.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wanted to say that Hunter seemed to be attracted to her even if she was human. And so was this Yoloff. But maybe Hunter didn\u2019t really want her. Sure, he had said that all along. Not permanently. She would scratch an itch, but not in the long run. She could never be as wild as their kind. It wasn\u2019t in her nature. Look at her bedroom attire even\u2014soft, cuddly pajamas, or slinky nightgowns in summer, but he was probably used to his women naked. Not that she was inhibited about sleeping nude, but it just seemed... weird. Especially since she was alone. Well, even with a guy unless they were making love.</p><p>Everyone was waiting for her response. She was sure her cheeks were rosy red as hot as they felt.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what about my other questions? Where do you live? Around here? I\u2019ve never seen you in town before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFarther west,\u201d Jessup said.</p><p>\u201cSo what brought you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for mates. Redmond already said so. But we couldn\u2019t find any. Not until we caught Meara\u2019s scent. We were curious about you, too, because Yoloff wanted you. So we\u2019ve been hanging around, trying to catch sight of you.\u201d</p><p>But Tessa knew it wasn\u2019t true because Butch had been at the trial. \u201cDid you see Hunter fighting the other gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if we had, we would have come to his aid.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t think Jessup or his friends would have helped Hunter. Why would they? When he was sure to keep them away from his sister.</p><p>Unless that\u2019s why Jessup and his buddies were hanging around here. To get rid of Hunter and it had nothing to do with Tessa. Sure, and then one of them could claim Meara. Or try to, if she was all alone.</p><p>Although he would probably have a fight on his hands. But if Hunter had died and she was so distraught over losing him, Jessup or one of the others would come to comfort her. He might have gotten his way with her then.</p><p>Jessup cast a glance at his buddies, looking a little uncomfortable when Tessa didn\u2019t respond to his remark about coming to Hunter\u2019s aid when he fought the gray.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bethany?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were curious about what had happened to her. Sometimes the police can\u2019t pick up clues that we can,\u201d Jessup said.</p> <p>Rourke stood taller. \u201cWhy would you care?\u201d</p><p>Jessup raised a black bushy brow. \u201cWe wondered if they had the right murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rourke asked again. \u201cIf you\u2019re not from this area, and the killer wasn\u2019t part of your pack, what difference would it make to you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust curious. Like I said.\u201d</p><p>Before Tessa could ask them another question, everyone but her turned their attention to the front of the house. She didn\u2019t hear anything, but she assumed they must have.</p><p>The door slammed open and Hunter stood in the entryway, his face dark as he considered the three new men standing in Tessa\u2019s living room. Leidolf stalked in beside him and his expression was just as lethal.</p><p>Jessup, Redmond, and Butch\u2019s posture changed from arrogantly sure of themselves to ready to run out the back door as they moved closer together and took a step backward.</p><p>\u201cMeara?\u201d Hunter roared, although he kept his eyes on the three men.</p> <p>\u201cUhm, I told them they\u2019d better hightail it out of here, but your future mate insisted they come in for a chat, since they know something of Tessa\u2019s stalker,\u201d Meara said, her voice a little shaky.</p><p>Tessa imagined not much shook her up.</p><p>Hunter\u2019s expression changed subtly as he looked at Tessa, not as angry, but she couldn\u2019t grasp what he was feeling. He jerked his attention back to the three grays. \u201cStart talking.\u201d</p><p>His voice vibrated with raw anger and a shiver even streaked up Tessa\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cWe already told her who the stalker is. Yoloff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo which one of you killed Bethany?\u201d Hunter asked, his voice still threatening.</p><p>\u201cYou got it wrong, mister,\u201d Jessup quickly said. \u201cSure, we went to her house and checked the place out. We were looking for valuables. She wasn\u2019t there any longer to care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThieves? You three are thieves?\u201d Tessa asked, her voice rife with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWe had nothing to do with her death,\u201d Redmond said. \u201cWe were curious about who might have killed her though. So we looked around for any evidence the police might have missed. But we\u2019d never met the lady.\u201d</p><p>Tessa pointed to Butch. \u201cWhy was he at my brother\u2019s trial then?\u201d</p><p>Hunter focused on Butch, and he shrank under the harsh scrutiny. \u201cThe lady is mistaken,\u201d he quickly said. \u201cI told her so already. I wasn\u2019t there. Don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolice car just drove up in the driveway,\u201d Leidolf warned.</p><p>Someone yelled from the driveway. \u201cHello!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy William O\u2019Neal,\u201d Ashton and Rourke said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d Rourke said.</p><p>Before he made it to the door, the deputy poked his head inside. \u201cIs everyone all right? Sheriff got a call that Rourke\u2019s truck careened down a hill. We didn\u2019t find anyone so assumed everyone made it out all right, but I had to make sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a little battered,\u201d Rourke said, \u201cbut otherwise okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, glad to hear everyone\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll let the sheriff know. Road\u2019s still blocked the way you were going, but north of here has been cleared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Deputy.\u201d Jessup inched toward the front door, keeping his distance from Hunter. \u201cWe\u2019ll be running along then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to stay awhile and explain some other matters to us,\u201d Hunter said, with a warning look.</p><p>\u201cLater. Got to run.\u201d Jessup gave Meara a long look and then rushed out of the house.</p><p>Redmond and Butch followed him, although Butch glanced back at Tessa. She was sure he had been at the trial. But why?</p><p>Hunter took a step toward him, and he dodged outside.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got road crews clearing the rock slide and the rest of that tree, but it\u2019ll probably be another day or so before it\u2019s cleaned up. Is your electricity still out?\u201d the deputy asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Portland,\u201d Hunter announced. \u201cAt least some of us are. The rest are going to my cabins up north of here. They\u2019ve got generators at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh and by the way, Bethany Wade\u2019s parents confirmed they had asked you to check her house for any evidence that would lead to finding the right murderer. They never believed Michael had done it. So you\u2019re welcome to go there anytime,\u201d the deputy said.</p><p>Tessa closed her gaping mouth. Hunter and Rourke smiled.</p><p>The deputy looked at Ashton. \u201cYour dad wants you to report in, let him know what\u2019s going on. See you all later.\u201d He returned to his vehicle and backed out of the drive.</p><p>Meara took a deep breath. \u201cWho\u2019s going where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you handle Ashton and Rourke?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>\u201cNo moon for a few days,\u201d Meara said. \u201cThey should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll protect the women,\u201d Ashton said.</p><p>Rourke seconded his promise.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I want the four of you to go to our place. Meara, we have a couple of rifles there, plenty of food, and the generator will keep you warm. Tessa and I are going with Leidolf. We\u2019ll drop by the prison to speak with Michael and then head to Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust me to not run off?\u201d Meara gave her brother a wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, since you know what a problem this is if I can\u2019t rely on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can count on me. So, when are you going to change her?\u201d Meara asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen the time\u2019s right. I can\u2019t now until the moon reappears, for one.\u201d</p><p>Meara gave Hunter a get-real look.</p><p>Tessa wondered what that meant, although she again assumed Hunter wasn\u2019t interested in being saddled with her. Why didn\u2019t he just \u201cgive\u201d her to Leidolf or Devlyn then? Not that she wanted to be handed off to another lupus garou pack either, and she wasn\u2019t sure she could handle becoming a werewolf in any event. She hadn\u2019t any family anywhere else that she could run to. Still, if she could get Hunter to help free her brother, she might be able to disappear and...</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t leave her brother. What a mess she was in.</p><p>Hunter carried Tessa out to the Humvee. When he had her settled on the seat, he propped her foot up to ease the swelling and covered her with a blanket. Watching him change from hostile when it came to dealing with Jessup and his friends to tenderness when handling her, she wished he could\u2019ve been a regular guy. But then again, the fact he wasn\u2019t was probably why she loved him so much. Love?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>He and Meara moved some of the gear to Leidolf\u2019s vehicle and after Hunter locked Tessa\u2019s place, they all loaded into the two vehicles.</p><p>Hunter motioned to Ashton to take off. Meara waved as they headed out.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure dividing our forces is such a good idea?\u201d Tessa asked, as Leidolf drove out of her driveway.</p><p>Leidolf chuckled darkly. \u201cA lupus garou would know never to question the alpha leader\u2019s decisions.\u201d</p><p>Talk about male chauvinists. Tessa folded her arms.</p><p>Hunter smiled at her over the seat. \u201cShe\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your kind may live in the Dark Ages, Hunter, but I\u2019m not going there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to take her off your hands?\u201d Leidolf asked.</p><p>During most of the drive, Hunter had seemed to be brooding about something, but Tessa didn\u2019t want to ask what the matter was in front of Leidolf. When they arrived in Salem, the sun had already set and visiting hours at the prison were over. If it hadn\u2019t been for all the ice and snow, they might have made it in time. Tessa brushed away useless tears, hoping to hide her distress. Both Leidolf and Hunter caught her action though.</p><p>Leidolf drove them to a nearby hotel. \u201cTwo beds, one room for safety sake?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwo adjoining rooms will suffice,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cBut drop by the hospital first, will you?\u201d</p><p>Leidolf cast a questioning glance Hunter\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cTo get Tessa\u2019s ankle x-rayed.\u201d</p> <p>Leidolf found the hospital and when he parked, Hunter skipped getting a wheelchair for her and carried her in. Once a technician had taken her in for an x-ray, Leidolf took a seat in the empty waiting room while Hunter stood nearby.</p><p>\u201cSo what was that all about?\u201d Leidolf asked.</p><p>Hunter looked over at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wanting to turn Tessa until the next moon appears. You\u2019re a royal. You can shapeshift anytime it suits you, moon or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her to be ready for it.\u201d</p> <p>Leidolf shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019ll never ask you to change her. The idea of confronting Devlyn bother you? If I were you, I\u2019d have doubts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not turning her over to you and your pack, Leidolf, so quit suggesting it.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf smiled and sat back in his chair. \u201cShe\u2019s too petite to be a gray. She couldn\u2019t handle your pack when you\u2019re away, could she?\u201d</p><p>Hunter looked back at the hall where Tessa had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cThree newly turned lupus garous all in one pack make for an awful lot of trouble. What are you going to do about her brother? Ashton\u2019s father, the sheriff? What about Rourke? Has he got any family?\u201d</p><p>Hunter tried to ignore him, but the truth of the matter was he had no idea how he was going to handle any of it.</p> <p>\u201cAshton might not be very close to his father, which will help some, although his father seems to keep tabs on him. But, Tessa, you can tell she\u2019s really close to her brother.\u201d</p><p>Hunter would deal with it, damn it. All of it, somehow.</p><p>The sound of a wheelchair rolling along the floor down the hall drew closer and Hunter\u2019s spine stiffened.</p><p>A nurse pushed Tessa into the waiting area, but all that Hunter focused on was Tessa\u2019s smiling face as she held onto a pair of crutches, her enticing lips beaming, her green eyes sparkling, the dimples in her cheeks endearing. His frown evaporated and he let out his breath as he hurried to join her.</p><p>\u201cThe ankle\u2019s not broken,\u201d she said. \u201cJust a bad sprain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood show. I\u2019ll take her,\u201d he said to the nurse and wheeled Tessa out of the hospital.</p><p>\u201cWant to get something to eat?\u201d Leidolf asked, walking them to the Humvee.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late and it\u2019s hard for Tessa to get around. We\u2019ll get room service.\u201d</p> <p>Leidolf opened the back door for Tessa. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>When they returned to the hotel and got the rooms, Leidolf dropped off their bags and leaned Tessa\u2019s crutches next to the bed while Hunter deposited her on the mattress.</p><p>Leidolf bowed his head slightly. \u201cSee you both in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Tessa frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have room service with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hunter said, and then gave Tessa a half smile as soon as he realized how harsh he sounded. \u201cLeidolf drove all that way. I offered to relieve him while you were sleeping, but he won\u2019t let anyone drive his Humvee. So he needs his rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take you up on sharing a... meal with you, Tessa, but I believe Hunter is feeling a bit possessive.\u201d Leidolf shrugged. \u201cIt happens to the best of us from time to time. If you have any trouble in the middle of the night, don\u2019t hesitate to holler for my help. Just keep the adjoining doors to our room unlocked, and I\u2019ll come running. Good night.\u201d He slipped into the hall and closed their door.</p><p>\u201cYou should have let him eat with us,\u201d Tessa chastised.</p><p>The lock to the adjoining door clicked open.</p><p>Wanting to be alone with Tessa and not about to change his mind, Hunter removed Tessa\u2019s parka and didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to unlock our door for Leidolf?\u201d she asked, her voice annoyed.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d Hunter lifted the phone off the hook and called room service. \u201cTwo steaks, one rare, one medium, baked potatoes, everything on them, blue cheese dressing on the salad, water. Thanks.\u201d He hung up the phone. For a moment, he stared at her.</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPajamas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He turned the heat on in the room and then he came over to the bed and began unbuttoning her sweater. \u201cI like summer best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFewer clothes to remove.\u201d He grinned at her.</p><p>Her cheeks heated. She could just imagine he would be half-naked\u2014no totally naked\u2014all summer long. \u201cAs if it matters to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI can imagine you don\u2019t wear much at all in the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d imagine right.\u201d He kissed her forehead and then unwrapped Tessa\u2019s injured foot. \u201cI\u2019ll get some ice in the bucket for it.\u201d</p><p>He unlocked the adjoining door, then grabbed the bucket and headed for the door to the hallway. When he opened it, Leidolf had his hand raised, ready to knock. In the other hand, he was carrying a full ice bucket.</p><p>\u201cFor Tessa.\u201d He handed it to Hunter.</p><p>Feeling annoyingly humbled, Hunter gave him the empty one. \u201cOrder your meal yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a rare steak. It\u2019s on it\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it over to our room when you get it.\u201d Hunter closed and locked the door, and then turned.</p><p>Tessa smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Hunter. Well, except you\u2019re a paragon of mixed messages. I can\u2019t understand why your people left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were mad about losing their homes in the forest. They have some notion that if they live in the city, or in the case of the others, down in the California vineyards, they\u2019ll avoid this tragedy again. It\u2019s understandable to an extent. But we\u2019ve always lived on forested land. I can\u2019t imagine making do anywhere else. However, I don\u2019t begrudge them their choice. Pack members can leave any time they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for Ashton, Rourke, or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. You\u2019re right. You\u2019ll need plenty of supervision for the first year at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to be supervised, I can tell you that right now. I\u2019ve always been responsible for my brother, the one in charge, the one who\u2019s had to deal with everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019ll be a nice break for you.\u201d Hunter set the bucket of ice on the bedside table.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give up my independence, Hunter.\u201d</p><p>Someone knocked on the door. \u201cRoom service!\u201d</p><p>Tessa folded her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I do because I\u2019ve had to. I\u2019m wired that way. And not you or anyone else is going to take that away from me.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head, grumbled something about another Meara under his breath, and opened the door. As soon as he did, he hesitated to let the man enter with the food. To Tessa\u2019s surprise, Hunter tried to shove the door closed in the man\u2019s face. But the metal cart blocked him and with a hard push, the server rammed it into Hunter\u2019s stomach.</p><p>He stumbled back, cursed, and tried to regain his footing.</p><p>But what happened next, chilled Tessa to the bone. Two wolves charged into the room, while the man with the cart brandished a large carving knife and taunted Hunter with it.</p><p>\u201cDamn it to hell. They\u2019re royals,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>The heavier-set wolf jumped onto the bed. Tessa grabbed one of her crutches. Swinging it at the wolf, she hit him in the side of the head with a whack. He yelped and jumped off the mattress and landed with a thud on the carpeted floor.</p><p>The other leapt up next, while Hunter seized hold of the food cart and rammed it into the knife-wielding menace. Tessa swung her crutch at the white-faced wolf, the one who had bitten Ashton, but he dodged her blow. And then he dove in again.</p><p>Unable to move the crutch fast enough, she dropped it and instinctively threw her hands to block him from ripping out her throat. She grabbed hold of his neck, his teeth snarling and snapping, but she was losing her grip.</p><p>Leidolf threw open the adjoining door when the wolf bit Tessa\u2019s arm. Hunter yanked the knife out of the gray\u2019s hand and plunged it into his neck.</p><p>For an instant, everyone seemed to stop in mid-motion. The man collapsed, holding his jugular, blood spilling all over the carpeted floor. The two wolves dashed out of the room. Hunter turned to Tessa.</p><p>Tears blurred her eyes and she held her bloodied arm.</p><p>He hurried to her and gave her good arm a squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll get a towel. Call 911, Leidolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Leidolf said, feeling the man\u2019s pulse.</p><p>Hunter let out his breath, grabbed a towel from the bathroom, and wrapped it around Tessa\u2019s arm. \u201cDo you feel any differently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick to my stomach.\u201d Tears trailed down her cheeks. \u201cMy arm hurts. And I twisted my ankle some more.\u201d But what distressed her the most was the sight of the dead man in their room. Why couldn\u2019t the men have left her alone?</p><p>Sirens sounded as emergency vehicles headed down the street toward the hotel.</p><p>\u201cGuess someone else called the crisis in,\u201d Leidolf said. He pulled some yellowed newspaper clippings out of the man\u2019s pocket. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to give her up to me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>AS SOON AS HUNTER SMELLED THE GRAY WHO\u2019D BEEN wielding the dinner cart, he knew they were in for trouble. But he never expected the three brothers were royals.</p><p>\u201cHe might not have changed Tessa,\u201d Leidolf said, as Hunter paced in the jail cell across from him. \u201cYou can\u2019t worry about things you have no control over. Besides, she\u2019ll be all right anyway since there\u2019s no moon out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the brothers of the gray I killed? What if they locate her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police said they\u2019d watch her. So quit worrying.\u201d</p><p>Quit worrying. Like that was a possibility.</p><p>\u201cWhen you called your lawyer, how long did he say it would take to get us out of here?\u201d Hunter still couldn\u2019t believe the human police arrested them. It was clearly self-defense, but some witness, probably one of the brothers, had stated otherwise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSoon. Don\u2019t worry. My people will be at the hospital with Tessa and they\u2019ll take good care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding the two bachelors who want her? Admit it, Leidolf. You want her. What were those newspaper clippings about? Anything important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. One was a news story written in 1865 about a confrontation between Caleb McKnight and Seth Greystoke, stating Seth had stolen his gold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCaleb McKnight?\u201d Hunter rubbed his chin, then swore. \u201cHell, that was the other man in the photo with Seth, my great-grandfather, and great uncle when they were panning for gold in California.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf leaned against the wall and peered out the bars at Hunter. \u201cThe other news article was written twelve years ago about a John Anderson who had killed Caleb McKnight in self-defense over a gold dispute. Said John\u2019s grandfather had stolen the gold from Caleb\u2019s grandfather. But of course, it would have been Caleb himself. Guess who he left behind? Three sons by the name of Yoloff, Ren, and Andreas.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head. \u201cThe three brothers who have been stalking Tessa. So there was more to it than Yoloff just wanting Tessa for a mate. The possibility he\u2019d get her land and the gold supposedly hidden somewhere on the property. How much you want to bet the other three grays are all tied into this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a pack from La Grande. If they could get rid of you so the one could have your sister and your property, possibly have killed Bethany to have hers, and now are trying to take Tessa and consolidate her lands\u2014 they\u2019d have amassed quite a bit of expensive property. Not to mention the gold, wherever it is, and two females to add to their all-male pack.\u201d</p><p>The sound of footsteps distracted them, and Hunter let out his breath when he saw the guard walking toward them. It was about damned time. He didn\u2019t want Tessa alone without his protection for one more minute.</p> <p>The guard unlocked Leidolf\u2019s cell. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go. The other one...\u201d The hefty man shrugged. \u201cYour lawyer said it\u2019ll take more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeidolf,\u201d Hunter roared. \u201cWhat did you tell your lawyer?\u201d</p><p>Leidolf waved at him as he headed down the hall with the guard. \u201cWe\u2019ll take good care of her until you\u2019re sprung.\u201d</p><p>Hell, Hunter should never have trusted a red pack leader. But he didn\u2019t have a gray lawyer in the area yet either. \u201cI want to make a phone call!\u201d he hollered to the guard as he led Leidolf out. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Her skin frigid with fresh apprehension, Tessa sat in the waiting room of the hospital where she had gotten her ankle x-rayed earlier. After a couple of stitches, her arm was bandaged. She was beginning to look like Hunter after he fought his battles.</p><p>Supposedly, some of Leidolf\u2019s pack were coming to get her and watch over her until Leidolf and Hunter could come for her. Damned police! Why wouldn\u2019t they listen? Hunter killed the gray in self-defense!</p> <p>But what if the people coming to get her were not Leidolf\u2019s people? What if it was her stalker pretending to be one of his pack members? She had no way of telling.</p><p>She closed her eyes as the pain in her ankle and arm intensified. Had she been turned? She didn\u2019t feel any differently. Wouldn\u2019t she feel like stripping off her clothes and turning into a wolf? But then again, Meara said there was no moon so they couldn\u2019t do that. Or maybe she wouldn\u2019t feel any different until then either. But her stalker and his one brother had turned into wolves. How?</p><p>The one whose leg had been broken was all healed up, too. Although she wasn\u2019t sure who was who.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and looked up at the fatherly looking cop, Allan Smith, his hair salt and pepper, his cheeks round and jovial, and his eyes the prettiest crystal green she had ever seen. Thankfully, he was guarding her until someone came for her. He handed her his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cHunter Greymere wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the phone and tried to steady her voice before she spoke. \u201cHunter, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJail, still. I can only make a quick phone call. Leidolf\u2019s on his way there to pick you up. His people will be there soon also. I may be here for a while, unless I can get hold of someone on my own to get me out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou killed the man in self-defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m not sure what Leidolf told his lawyer. In any event, I\u2019m going to need help getting out. Meara\u2019s number is 431-110-5629. Don\u2019t go with Leidolf. Tessa, I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d</p><p>The phone died. She felt like her lifeline had just been ripped away from her. \u201cHow can I get Hunter out of jail? He\u2019s innocent,\u201d she said to the cop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a friend I can call.\u201d He winked, then punched in the number. Holding the phone to his ear, he waited for someone to answer and said to Tessa, \u201cI don\u2019t think the wolf turned you.\u201d</p><p>Tessa closed her gaping mouth.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know I\u2019m one, and if you\u2019d been changed, you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre... are you a gray or a red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray. I don\u2019t know Hunter or Leidolf either, but I wouldn\u2019t let a red have a gray\u2019s selected mate.\u201d He paused. \u201cHey, Charlie? It\u2019s Allan Smith. Got a problem. Need to get a gray out of jail who was defending his chosen mate. Another gray was killed in the fight. The name\u2019s Hunter Greymere. No, not from around here. Alpha leader from the coast.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cIt gets worse. A red alpha leader from Portland is trying to claim her for his own. You ever hear about the gray devil wolf, Seth Greystoke? Hell, his grandson claims the little lady is his distant cousin, and he wants her.\u201d</p><p>The cop looked at Tessa and smiled. \u201cNo, human still,\u201d he said into the phone, then laughed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d say she\u2019d be worth it, but then you\u2019d have three alpha leaders at your throat. Better leave her well enough alone. Hurry it up though. I\u2019ll conveniently tuck Miss Tessa Anderson away somewhere safe at the hospital. Call me when you have Hunter released. Well, you owe me for getting your brother off for drunk driving\u2014how many times? And you know me\u2014I\u2019m a sucker for beautiful, redheaded damsels in distress.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cTalk later.\u201d</p><p>He clicked off the phone, lifted his nose and sniffed the air. \u201cShit. They\u2019re coming.\u201d He lifted Tessa up and hurried down the hall.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Tessa whispered. \u201cThe reds or the brothers of the gray Hunter had to kill?\u201d</p><p>Hunter wasn\u2019t often impressed with bureaucracy when he had to deal with it, but whatever Tessa had done had worked. And he was damned proud of her.</p><p>He considered the cop as he drove him to the hospital, who looked like he was suffering from ulcers or a very bad day, older man, graying temples, sandy brows, very big scowl.</p><p>\u201cWhen will we get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes.\u201d The cop glanced at him with a frown splitting his forehead in two. \u201cWhat? You want me to run the sirens, too? Who the hell are you? The judge rarely changes his mind on a case. But just like that, one call and you\u2019ve got half the force hopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI acted in self-defense when the man came at me with a knife. But I guess it pays to have friends in high places in any event. Been a cop long?\u201d</p><p>The man smiled as if reminiscing about the good old days. \u201cTexas Ranger when the first unit was formed. Worked my way west into this lawless territory in the early ages. Changed my name numerous times, retired several times, had to \u2018die\u2019 a number of times to keep up appearances. But yeah, I\u2019ve been one of the good guys for a few years. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the army for a number of years, different sides, different countries, different wars, time periods, trained in some of the more specialized forces later, Navy SEALs for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d The cop shook his head. \u201cI always wanted to be one of those.\u201d His face turned stern again. \u201cSo how come you have to change the woman? Judge says she\u2019s one of us, kind of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story, major nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. It\u2019s better when you both are willing. Happened to me, too, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still giving me grief.\u201d The cop gave Hunter a smirk. \u201cAs soon as they allowed women on the force, she became a cop also. Said she wanted to see what I did all day. But don\u2019t you believe it. She just wants to make sure I don\u2019t turn another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNinety-eight years and counting.\u201d The cop pulled into the back of the hospital. \u201cLet me call Allan Smith. He\u2019s a buddy of mine who\u2019s taking care of the little lady.\u201d He punched in some buttons on the phone and said, \u201cHey, Caruthers here. You got her?\u201d He looked at Hunter. \u201cThe guy\u2019s here with me. He\u2019s a Navy SEAL. Yeah, that\u2019s why he got the jump on the gray with the knife. I\u2019m sending him in the back way. The reds are there?\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him. Gotta go. See you this weekend to go fishing?\u201d He laughed. \u201cOkay, when it warms up a bit.\u201d</p><p>Caruthers shut off his phone. \u201cTake the back stairs, third floor, Room 301. Let me tell you, pal, if I had it to do all over again, I\u2019d turn my Greta in a heartbeat. There aren\u2019t enough females in the world to go around. Sometimes we\u2019ve just got to take a chance and hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>Allan Smith tucked his phone into his belt. \u201cI\u2019ll wait in the hall for your mate. All my best to you, young lady.\u201d The cop left Tessa alone and closed the door.</p><p>Sitting in a vinyl chair, she clenched and unclenched her hand. Now what would they do? She didn\u2019t think Hunter would want to return to the hotel. Not after the killing there. She sure didn\u2019t want to go there either. She shuddered. The look of death on the gray\u2019s face would haunt her forever.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Hunter Greymere,\u201d Allan said beyond the door.</p><p>Her heart gave a jump to hear that he\u2019d arrived, and although she was relieved he found her before anyone else did, her stomach fluttered with apprehension. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d claim her nice and official-like to set things straight with the red and before some distant relation tries to take her home with him, if I were you. The other gray didn\u2019t change her, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, officer, for the advice, and the news,\u201d Hunter said, his voice gruff.</p><p>\u201cNavy SEAL, eh? The guy must have been crazy to mess with you. I\u2019ll be right here, so take all the time you need.\u201d</p> <p>Now that he had his memories back, had Hunter remembered truly being a Navy SEAL? It definitely suited his character. Or was he continuing the tale, enjoying it too much to give it up?</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Hunter opened the door, closed it behind him, stalked across the floor to join her, looking like a warrior with a mission, his harsh expression a mixture of sternness and worry, and she had an inkling he intended to turn her. She definitely had mixed emotions about the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cNavy SEAL? You really were one?\u201d she whispered, raising her hands to offer herself to him, to take the plunge, to become something she couldn\u2019t begin to imagine being. Part of her welcomed the change, the chance to be with the man who heated her blood like no other had ever done, yet part of her wanted to remain as she was, still wanting Hunter for her own, but without the life-altering change.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You were right all along, Tessa honey. Meeting on the beach like we did was... karma. Although if I\u2019d been more with it, I would have acted a lot more like one of the SEALs.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth slightly gaped. \u201cHow could you have been a SEAL as a werewolf?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can be anything we want, if we\u2019re so inclined and have the aptitude.\u201d He winked at her and the sexy look slid a volley of heat through her.</p><p>And then she gave him a half smile. \u201cWonder what your SEAL friends would have thought if they\u2019d known how we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would\u2019ve been cursing my fortune that a beautiful woman had come to rescue me and not them.\u201d He lifted her from the chair, hugged her to his chest, tighter than need be as if he\u2019d feared losing her and wanted to prove to himself she was all his\u2014which suited her just fine\u2014then carried her to the bed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to talk.\u201d</p><p>Talk? She felt the tension in his muscles, saw the way his eyes darkened with need, smelled the subtle change in him, indicating he was becoming aroused. She wanted him with all her heart. So why didn\u2019t his heated embrace make her melt against him? She stiffened instead, unable to hide a nagging concern. What if he changed her, then gave her to a beta wolf? \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m enough of an alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an alpha all right. After you clobbered that gray with the fireplace tongs and tonight again with your crutch?\u201d He gave her a small smile, set her on the bed, and tucked some of her hair behind her ear with a tender touch. \u201cA beta female would have tucked tail and run. With your sprained ankle, if you\u2019d been a beta, you would have easily given up. I saw you trying to keep Yoloff from biting you. If I could have, I would have ended his miserable life, too.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s fingers shifted to the buttons on her blouse, his urgent struggle making her smile.</p> <p>But she still had to know\u2014was he defying Devlyn? Taking her for his own? What were his intentions? Yet even so, she didn\u2019t stop him. She couldn\u2019t. Whenever he wanted her, she had no power to hinder him, just as she had no control over her own craving to have him. \u201cI thought we were going to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t deny I\u2019m uncomfortable doing this to you, Tessa. I don\u2019t want you to regret it. But I also don\u2019t want to bite you. Wolves do bite in playfulness, but as a wolf to human?\u201d He shook his head and pulled her blouse off her shoulders.</p><p>So he was changing her. But that didn\u2019t mean he was taking her for his mate. Despite wanting to know the truth first, her body instantly responded to his touching her, flames stoking her insides, a wet readiness preparing her for sex\u2014not change. Want and need replacing common sense. His gaze focused on her face\u2014watching for any sign of hesitation?</p><p>The change. That\u2019s what he was concerned about. \u201cI used to play tug-of-war with my Irish Setter when I had one. She\u2019d sometimes go for my hand by accident.\u201d She hoped her lighthearted response would ease his concern.</p><p>Hunter smiled. \u201cWant to play tug-of-war?\u201d He pulled her blouse off the rest of the way. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do this. We don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>She seized his hands and looked into his eyes. In that instant, he looked even more concerned, his mouth tightening, jaw clenched, brow furrowing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, which isn\u2019t being alpha like, is it? But I worry I\u2019ll change too much. But more than that, what are you going to do with me afterwards?\u201d</p><p>Still looking stern, a hint of relief flitted across his expression. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p> <p>She should be ecstatic to have that question resolved, shouldn\u2019t she? But she couldn\u2019t quit worrying about the change. Instead of addressing his claim, she said, \u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t shapeshift unless the moon was out.\u201d Yet she recalled the look Meara had given him.</p><p>His sensual lips curved upward just a little as he started pulling off his clothes, revealing his beautiful body, rough hewn, rugged, capable of enduring great hardships, or giving her carnal pleasure. \u201cI\u2019m a royal and can do anything I want.\u201d He gave an arrogant smile. \u201cAlmost anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo as a royal, you can shapeshift anytime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you could be a SEAL. No worry about shifting while under water.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo. And the group I was with\u2014all royals, just for that reason.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. No scars marked his smooth as silk skin, every bit of toned muscles from his wide shoulders to his well-developed chest, flexing in anticipation. She looked lower, from his narrow waist and hips down to his full blown erection standing at attention amidst dark curls.</p><p>\u201cI have to shift, but if you keep looking at me like you want to eat me all up...\u201d</p><p>Her eyes riveted back to his lusty gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to look away when I begin to shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you shapeshift. You\u2019re gorgeous. What if I\u2019m motley?\u201d Again, she tried to make light of the situation, although her stomach churned with renewed apprehension.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be beautiful. But Leidolf and Devlyn will want you unless we\u2019re mated. Ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He looked like he wanted to kiss her, his gaze lowering to her mouth again and lingering there... but then he took a deep breath and began to shift into his wolf form. She couldn\u2019t get over how fast the transformation was. Would she shift just as quickly? If Ashton was any indication of a newly turned lupus garou, then yes, she\u2019d change just as swiftly. Probably of a necessity, to avoid humans catching sight of them between forms.</p><p>She watched in awe, how his body changed gracefully, effortlessly, painlessly, from the muscled hunk to the healthiest specimen of a wolf she\u2019d ever seen. Beautiful almond eyes captured hers and then before she could say a word, the wolf that was Hunter jumped on the bed and nuzzled her cheek.</p><p>She stroked his head. \u201cHurry and do it before I change my mind.\u201d Her skin perspired lightly and in the cold hospital room, she shivered.</p><p>His amber eyes remained fixed on hers and then he dipped his head and nipped her uninjured arm.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cJeez, Hunter. That hurt like a hard pinch and you didn\u2019t even break the skin. But I\u2019ll have a bruise for sure there now.\u201d</p><p>If a wolf could look contrite, he did and tried again. His second bite was as lame as his first.</p><p>\u201cAh for heaven\u2019s sakes, Hunter. Another bruise. Hurry and do it right or I\u2019m calling it quits.\u201d She hoped her words would make him stop worrying about hurting her. She\u2019d heal quickly anyway, wouldn\u2019t she?</p><p>He bit again and broke the skin this time. Her eyes watered and she bit her lip. Blood trickled from the bite on her arm, and he licked it away. And waited.</p><p>Self-doubt filled her. Maybe he didn\u2019t turn her either, just like Yoloff hadn\u2019t. What if she was some strange anomaly and couldn\u2019t be turned? Maybe her great-grandmother couldn\u2019t be either and that\u2019s why she died of the fever? A sadness filled Tessa with the notion neither her ancestor or she could forever be with the one she loved.</p><p>But if the change had taken effect, what was she supposed to feel like? Except that her swollen ankle and arm where Yoloff had bitten her were tingling with the strangest sensations, nothing else was different.</p><p>Hunter continued to watch her, not shapeshifting. She hoped to hell he wouldn\u2019t have to bite her again.</p><p>\u201cToo bad with all of your enhanced abilities, you can\u2019t talk when you\u2019re in your wolf form, too.\u201d She glanced at the door. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming. You\u2019d better hide under the bed.\u201d</p><p>Hunter didn\u2019t budge, just continued to observe her.</p><p>\u201cI mean it. I... I hear several people.\u201d Her heart pumped harder.</p><p>\u201cHowdy, folks,\u201d Allan said at the door.</p><p>\u201cDid he do it yet?\u201d Leidolf asked, his voice guardedly amused.</p><p>Leidolf. Her heart took a dive.</p><p>\u201cIt remains to be seen. I\u2019m taking care of things here. Why don\u2019t you run along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Hunter four of his people want to return with him. The fifth wants to stay with one of my widowed males to be his mate. When Hunter\u2019s through here, he and Tessa can meet me at the hotel. Different set of rooms. Just check at the front desk. Dinner\u2019s on me.\u201d</p><p>Tessa relaxed. Leidolf didn\u2019t want her, thank God for small miracles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him know.\u201d</p><p>Tessa took a deep breath, smelled the air, and looked at Hunter in his feral wolf form, her eyes widening. \u201cYou\u2019re a gray. I mean, I smell a special scent that surrounds you. A wildness, like a fresh spring day, the woods, the great outdoors.\u201d</p><p>She swore his mouth curved up just a hair, before he began to shapeshift\u2014his body straightening, his rich fur pelt vanishing, leaving behind bronzed skin over hard muscles. Until he stood before her, one gloriously built male stud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He touched her face, his amber eyes gazing into hers, his expression concerned. \u201cHow do you feel, Tessa?\u201d</p><p>She loved him for it, for being concerned about her welfare above all else. No one but her mother had ever treated her that way.</p><p>Tessa took his hand and kissed it. \u201cBetter. My ankle feels strange. Prickling and numb, but not sore any longer. And where you bit me, the skin\u2019s already sealed up. The bruise you gave me has gone away. Where Yoloff tore the skin feels ticklish, like when injured skin is scabbing over and new skin is created to take its place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you feel in here?\u201d Hunter said, still frowning as he reached for her forehead with a whisper-soft touch.</p><p>\u201cOh. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll know the answer to that question until I\u2019ve experienced more of the changes.\u201d</p><p>He unbuckled her belt and then unzipped her jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re not upset?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew big. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make love to me in a hospital bed?\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and kissed her lace-covered breasts, stirring her craving to make love to him.</p> <p>\u201cYou bet, alpha mate of mine. We do it often, whenever and wherever we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, Hunter. Why didn\u2019t you tell me that before?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled darkly. \u201cYou\u2019ll fit right into the pack, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d She motioned to the room. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we go somewhere more private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe room\u2019s well guarded with our police friend at the door. It\u2019s up to you, but until I\u2019ve mated you, you\u2019re available to any unmated male out there who\u2019s willing to fight me for you. So yeah, I\u2019m sure about this. You can\u2019t be out of my sight until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve already made love. Doesn\u2019t that count?\u201d Not that she didn\u2019t want to make love to him and like now, but it made her realize she didn\u2019t know all the rules of Hunter\u2019s world yet, and she could get herself into a lot more hot water. Well, more than she was already, until she understood what was going on better.</p> <p>He shook his head, then brushed a kiss against her lips, mouth-watering, mind-numbing. Everything about him made her bones and muscles melt like lava beneath his heat. She knew he\u2019d take her for another sensual ride like she\u2019d never known with any man before him, and she was past ready for everything he could give her.</p><p>Wanting her like no other, Hunter quickly removed her clothes, desiring to claim her like any wolf would its chosen mate, male and female alike. He wanted the first time to be slow and leisurely now that she was a lupus garou. Making love to her all night long would have sufficed, but not with a bunch of reds breathing down their necks. Or Yoloff and his brother still on the loose. And Devlyn would soon be a problem.</p><p>Tessa had already covered herself with the thin hospital blanket, her skin raised with chill bumps. As usual, the hospital room felt like a refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cNext time I make love to you, we\u2019ll have a well-heated room and no huddling under the covers,\u201d he said, his brow raised.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s infectious smile heated his blood, sparking his desire.</p><p>He jerked the cover aside and climbed on top of her, then pulled the blanket over them and molded to her soft body, pressing his arousal against her mound. \u201cNot much room, but it should suffice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, yielding to him, wrapping her arms around his back, her embrace every bit as possessive as he felt about her. \u201cSeems like the right amount of room to me. You just need to put that well-honed lance somewhere where it\u2019s not so dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled darkly.</p> <p>Everything seemed to fade in the room, the noises in the hospital, the cold air circulating about them, the odor of antiseptics.</p><p>Take me, her expression silently pleaded. She moved her legs apart, giving herself completely.</p><p>\u201cI know just where to sheathe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo.\u201d She licked his lips. \u201cMate with me so I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>That was all Hunter wanted to hear, yet he couldn\u2019t help saying what he knew was in his heart. \u201cYou\u2019re all mine, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She cast him one of her impish smiles that said he was being full of himself as usual, which stirred his compulsion to have her even more. He pressed his lips against her sensual mouth, his hand kneading her soft breast and then ran his thumb over her nipple, the rosy crown peaking. Not enough. He could never get enough of tasting or touching her. Of breathing in her subtle arousal.</p><p>Her gaze soft and sultry, she turned her head toward the door.</p><p>He wanted to groan out loud at her distraction. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn to ignore the sounds that aren\u2019t important,\u201d he whispered, then turned her head back to his, lost himself in the exotic sparkles of blue against green in her languid eyes.</p><p>He slipped his erection into her wet folds, the heat of her body sparking flames in his. Wanting to fully mate her, possess her, claim her like he\u2019d craved from the first moment he\u2019d seen her checking on Uncle Basil, her determination, her concern for him, her friendliness toward his sister even when the feeling wasn\u2019t reciprocated. No matter how much he\u2019d tried to reconcile himself with the notion that he couldn\u2019t have a human for his mate, he\u2019d wanted her.</p><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d she said, pressing her pelvis against him, working him as he deepened his thrusts. Her eyes closed, her tongue licked her swollen lips, and he captured it, sucked on it, making her mew.</p><p>Claiming her felt more than right, like they had been meant for each other since the dawn of time. He\u2019d worried he would notice a difference, that she wouldn\u2019t be feral enough, not lupus garou enough to satisfy some primal need. But she was perfect, her hot, supple body molding with his, her moves every bit in sync, deepening the bond, the feelings, the ecstasy. Just as driven to satisfy her sexual needs\u2014and his\u2014to consummate their relationship, to delve into the unknown and conquer it.</p><p>She was alpha all right, but not in the same way as others were. Better\u2014his.</p><p>His fingers fanned through her hair, the satiny mass a tactile delight as she stroked his back with greedy fingers, her heart pounding, her body trembling with the adrenaline rush of passion and arousal and sex racing through her veins.</p><p>Her nails dug into his back, and he silenced her moans with a kiss, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about the darned creaky hospital bed. Every time he thrust, he figured all of the hospital staff would hear and know what was going on in the room. He hadn\u2019t expected that. But then again, his attuned hearing picked up what humans couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Thankfully, Tessa was so caught up in the heat of the moment, she didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re heaven-sent,\u201d she mouthed softly against his lips, \u201c... a god from Mt. Olympus, my gold, my treasure.\u201d</p><p>And she was more to him, a priceless gem, the mother of his future offspring, his legacy, his unwavering and loving companion for life.</p><p>He thrust into her tightness, her body stroking him, drawing him to the zenith of pleasure. He groaned as he found release deep inside of her hot, tight body and sank against her. Kissing her mouth, he loved the feel of her velvety lips, but seeing tears glistening in her eyes, he abruptly stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Tessa?\u201d he asked, too gruffly.</p><p>Already he was mad at himself for being overly zealous, too damned rough, pushing her when he should have seen she needed more time to absorb all the changes she was sure to be experiencing. Hell, what was the matter with him? He loved her more than life itself, and this is how he showed it?</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t have me now, can he?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Uncomprehending, he stared at her. \u201cWho? Leidolf?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and rubbed her hand over Hunter\u2019s arm.</p><p>And he relaxed some, figuring her upset wasn\u2019t with him. \u201cYoloff? No, he can\u2019t have you.\u201d</p><p>But he could if the gray somehow managed to kill Hunter, although he hadn\u2019t planned on that ever happening.</p><p>He maneuvered in the narrow bed until Tessa was lying on top of him. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Tessa. Now and for always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my brother?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted to bring up that scenario yet, hoping with the change she would understand how important it was not to let humans know of their existence. But he and most of the others were born with the knowledge that their kind\u2019s safety came first. Some of the wolf\u2019s wariness was instinctive, but dealing with the brother, that was another matter. Her blood ties were apparently as strong as the wolf\u2019s instincts. On the other hand, her brother had lupus garou genes also.</p><p>\u201cHey folks,\u201d Allan said, knocking on the door. \u201cI hate to interrupt, but I just got word the hospital staff is moving someone in here in just a few minutes. You can stay at my place if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Allan. We\u2019d love that.\u201d Tessa scrambled to get off Hunter. As soon as her bare feet hit the floor, she yanked on her clothes.</p><p>Not ready to give up the relaxed and satiated feeling that cloaked him, Hunter climbed out of bed, kissed Tessa\u2019s lips, and then jerked on his own clothes.</p><p>Just as they emerged from the room, an attendant wheeled a gurney toward them, carrying an old man buried under blankets.</p><p>\u201cPatrol car\u2019s parked this way.\u201d Allan led them down the back stairs. \u201cI\u2019ve got tons of security on the house. \u2018Brother-in-law\u2019 sells the stuff so I get it wholesale. No one will bother you. Jacuzzi\u2019s in an enclosed porch. Great for unwinding after a hectic day.\u201d He winked at Tessa and sighed. \u201cNever could find a mate after mine died ten years ago. You wouldn\u2019t happen to have a widow or two looking for a mate in your pack, would you?\u201d he asked Hunter.</p><p>\u201cOne, but she\u2019s pretty cantankerous,\u201d Hunter warned.</p><p>\u201cThe red\u2019s got your people at the hotel. Some of his people brought them with them when they came to get Tessa. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll drop by there and say hello. Anything you want me to tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have three newly turned lupus garous in the pack, and they have an alpha female pack leader now, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allan smiled. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you meant when you mentioned having a heap of trouble. Not concerning the little lady, of course. Three new lupus garous, you say?\u201d</p><p>Allan grew quiet for the rest of the drive to his place. Tessa cuddled with Hunter in the backseat. Now that they were mated, he seemed different somehow. Less anxious, more... well, like he was riding on top of the world.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t need a cop in your area, would you?\u201d Allan pulled into the driveway of a neat, little red brick suburban home.</p> <p>\u201cI know the sheriff. If you\u2019re interested, I could put in a good word for you,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>Tessa wasn\u2019t sure the sheriff would want anyone working for him that Hunter recommended.</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019s about time I left this area. I\u2019ve been here ten years already. Maybe Caruthers could come, too. He and his mate, Greta. That way if anyone from your pack gets in trouble, we can circumvent the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn California, we lived away from civilization. But I can see where having backup in a more developed area can be beneficial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. We have another four on the force here, so we wouldn\u2019t be leaving the department shorthanded as far as the grays go. Although Judge Graydon might be a little perturbed with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe one who got me out of jail,\u201d Hunter said, squeezing Tessa tighter.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m always bailing his brother out on brawling charges. The judge will just have to train another gray cop to take care of his brother.\u201d Allan went to the car door and opened it for them. \u201cI understand you\u2019re off to see your brother at the prison tomorrow. I\u2019ll put in a word for you before you get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrays work there, too?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>Allan laughed. \u201cNo. But some of the guards were former police officers and friends of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your ankle, Tessa?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>\u201cA little sore still, but much, much better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll need a lift.\u201d He carried her out of the patrol car and she smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not usually the type who likes to be babied, but when you\u2019re doing the babying, it\u2019s awfully nice.\u201d</p><p>Preceding them to the door, Allan unlocked it and turned off the security alarm. \u201cWine, music, guest towels are by the Jacuzzi. Make it a honeymoon. Knock yourselves out. See you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, for everything,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Allan reset the security, locked up, and left.</p><p>Hunter headed straight for the enclosed back porch with Tessa cradled in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m feeling like a nice hot soak in the tub. You?\u201d His eyes sparkled like the devil.</p><p>\u201cYou bet, as long as it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they entered the room, a blast of steamy air hit her and she sighed. Perfect for sultry, heated sex.</p> <p>Hunter flipped on the enclosed patio lights with his elbow, although neither of them needed the illumination to see now, which made her think back to when she gave him the lantern when the electricity was off at her house. Cad.</p><p>The soft glow of light caressed the dark edges of the room, soothing and seductive. In sharp contrast to the silky ambience created by the soft light and warm wet air, Hawaiian trinkets dangled from the ceiling: plastic purple palm trees, orange flamingos, floral leis, rainbow-colored parrots. The rest of the room was outfitted with silk palm trees, ferns, and bamboo chairs and tables, making it feel like a retail store\u2019s version of the tropics. But it didn\u2019t matter as long as the hottest male around was firmly entrenched in the scene.</p><p>Hunter set her on a chair.</p><p>She grabbed his hand and helped herself up. \u201cMy ankle\u2019s fine. Just a little sore, but I can walk on it.\u201d</p><p>He drew her into his warmth in a bear-tight embrace and kissed the top of her head. \u201cSo you just wanted me to get more of a workout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter you than me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, his eyes already smoldering with deep-seated desire. \u201cSit, while I get some wine for us.\u201d</p><p>She loved how husky his voice grew when she turned him on. She tilted her nose up and breathed in deeply. And his sex, hmm, she could smell his arousal. She could really get used to her enhanced senses. Well, most of them. The chlorine in the Jacuzzi was a little overwhelming. \u201cI\u2019ll get the music.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another squeeze and shook his head. \u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>As if any man, even one as sexy as Hunter, was going to dictate her every move.</p><p>He released her, crossed the tile floor to a full-sized bar, the glass shelves behind it covered in liquor bottles of every kind, then pulled out two wine decanters. \u201cWhite or red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed.\u201d To go with hot-blooded men, a fiery sunset, and heated exchanges.</p><p>\u201cFuller-bodied, light, medium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, the fullest.\u201d She glanced down at his crotch and smiled to see his arousal straining against the soft fabric of his sweats. \u201cDefinitely the heaviest.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved up as he shifted his gaze from the way her tongue swept over her lips to the bottle, and then he hurried to open it.</p><p>She flipped a switch, turning on music with a sensuous beat. The flute and drums surrounded them in a tantalizing instrumental rhythm.</p><p>Hunter handed Tessa a glass of wine, took a sip of his, then leaned down to kiss her lips.</p><p>\u201cI really like this wine on you.\u201d She licked his lips and slid her fingers down his sweatshirt, found the ties to his pants and gave a little tug.</p><p>He chuckled, drank a couple more swallows of his wine, and reached out to take her glass. She took another sip and handed him hers. Once he set them on one of the glass-covered tables, he ran his hands over her arms in an amative way. \u201cYou can tug on something else if you get the urge.\u201d He wiggled his brows.</p><p>\u201cOhh?\u201d She trailed her finger down lower, until she traced his rock-hard erection through the soft sweats, making his arousal jump.</p><p>Pulling her back against his chest, he began to dance slow to the music, molding his body to hers, his groin pressing against her backside, his large hands caressing her breasts through her blouse, his heat warming her. She closed her eyes as her nipples tingled with his sensuous touch, her body sliding against his in a teasing caress.</p><p>He nuzzled his face against her neck. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, you know.\u201d He reached up to splay his fingers through her hair. \u201cEvery bit of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, too,\u201d she whispered, caught up in the magic of the moment, pressing her butt harder against him, rubbing, tantalizing him to take it further.</p><p>He slipped his hands up her shirt, caressed her lace-covered breasts, tormenting the nipples straining for release. The crotch of her panties was already wet in anticipation, and she was ready to ditch her clothes.</p><p>His hands shifted to her belt, and he struggled to unbuckle it. \u201cReady to get wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, already there.\u201d</p><p>No more belts, she made a note to herself, wanting to shove his hands away and yank off the annoying leather hindrance herself.</p><p>He finally managed to unfasten the belt, unzipped her jeans, and slipped his hand into her panties, down lower until his fingers reached her cleft. And stroked.</p><p>She shuddered with need, the bones liquefying in her legs, and she slumped slightly against him, ready to collapse.</p><p>\u201cHmm, yes, nice and wet,\u201d he murmured against her neck, his arm wrapped around her waist to keep her from sinking to the floor as he continued to stroke her. \u201cJust right.\u201d</p><p>Wriggling against his fingers to get maximum penetration, she rubbed against his arousal, and he groaned. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cVixen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move this to the hot tub,\u201d she said, her voice drenched with lust. \u201cBut the water better be hot enough. After all the cold weather we\u2019ve been through, I\u2019m not getting in unless it\u2019s super heated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll warm you right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the water if it\u2019s not soupy.\u201d</p><p>He released her. \u201cI guess you\u2019re not willing to take a swim in the Pacific with me from time to time then.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and traced his nipples through his sweatshirt. \u201cNot unless it\u2019s by mistake.\u201d</p><p>Hunter laughed under his breath and walked over to the Jacuzzi and poked his hand in. Hot, but not as hot as Tessa was. He shook the water off his fingers and turned on the jets.</p><p>\u201cPerfect temperature.\u201d He reached his hand out to her. \u201cJoin me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I already had,\u201d she said, her voice like smooth satin.</p><p>She rested her small hand in his, and he pulled her close. He leaned down and kissed a corner of her sensual mouth, then brushed his lips across hers, and kissed the other corner.</p><p>\u201cYou realize you have to keep Meara and Cara in line whenever I\u2019m not around, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He slipped her blouse off and held her arms hostage. Dipping his head, he kissed her mouth, deepening the experience. Wet, wild, tasting of fermented grapes, sweet and delectable, rich and full-bodied.</p><p>Her heart beat harder and she barely breathed, enraptured with his touch as much as he was with her.</p><p>But then her fingers tackled his sweatshirt, and she hurried to wrestle it over his head. And he smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me all the details about what I have to do and can\u2019t do,\u201d she said, nipping his bare shoulder. \u201cNot that it means you can tell me what I have to do and can\u2019t do, and I\u2019ll blindly serve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can handle it. I have every faith in you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her jeans down to her ankles, then ran his hands over her silky panties trimmed in lace. Her eyes were bright and expressive, her brows slightly elevated, her lips rosy and swollen. Already he was at full mast, ready to mate her again.</p><p>She yanked off his sweatpants and he kicked them free. \u201cI believe,\u201d he said, stripping off her bra and panties, \u201cyou\u2019ve had control over me since you dragged me from your beach.\u201d</p><p>She let out a lusty chuckle. \u201cDragged you. Right. It was only a show so you could get your hands all over me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWorked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d From the moment she\u2019d rescued him on the beach, he\u2019d wanted just that.</p><p>He lifted her hot little body and carried her into the Jacuzzi, the steam enveloping them in a warm, wet caress.</p><p>\u201cHmm, after having been so cold, this feels just right.\u201d She sank into the tub, the bubbles bumping against the swell of her breasts.</p> <p>\u201cBetter than right.\u201d He crouched at her knees and spread her legs, opening her up to him.</p><p>A smile percolated on her lips.</p><p>If anyone had told him he would\u2019ve taken a human as a mate, that she would have been a siren in disguise, or he would be sitting with her in a gray cop\u2019s Jacuzzi for his mating night, he would never have believed it.</p><p>He licked the water off her neck, and she trailed her fingers across his muscles making his erection dance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all healed. No scratches, bruises, cuts\u2014 nothing but blemish-free, golden skin stretched over rock hard muscles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d he said, taking her hand and kissing it.</p><p>\u201cYoloff didn\u2019t bite me hard enough. Nor did you. Nothing remains of the bite marks.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand down her leg to her ankle, his chest touching the water, his eyes focused on hers. \u201cAnd your ankle is all right now?\u201d</p><p>Tessa took a deep breath. \u201cMiraculously, yes.\u201d She kissed Hunter\u2019s neck, her tongue licking a trail down his skin, her warm breath caressing as he gave in to the erotic sensation. His fingers played in her hair while she licked his nipple, then her lips pulled on it gently.</p><p>\u201cTessa,\u201d he moaned, trying to hold onto his last thread of restraint, wanting their lovemaking to last.</p><p>She looked up with the most innocent expression, and he cast her a devilish grin back. She was no innocent, the vixen, knowing damn well what she did to him with that sweet mouth of hers.</p> <p>He bent his head and ran his mouth across her bare shoulder, and then the other, loving the feel of her water-speckled skin against his lips. She arched her head back, her lips parted, and moaned, offering herself to him, baring her throat, her body. He took advantage of her need, loving her eagerness that only matched his own, pulled her off the seat and switched places, settling her on his lap, her knees spread, readied for his penetration. And he was damned ready to oblige.</p><p>She leaned down and kissed his upturned lips, her hair falling around his face, his shoulders, the strands floating on the surface of the water like a mermaid\u2019s silky tresses.</p><p>He smiled inwardly\u2014the Navy SEAL had ensnared his mermaid, or maybe just the opposite.</p><p>Their tongues mated in a ritual dance as he lifted her onto his rigid erection. Sweet torture as he penetrated her deeply.</p><p>With a seductive moan, she closed her eyes and rocked on top of him, her hands kneading his shoulders, her mouth and teeth nibbling his ear. Blazing desire raced through him, making him lose control of his measured moves.</p><p>Unable to last much longer, he kept his hands on her hips, directing her, every thrust he made, bringing him closer to climax. She was everything he\u2019d ever wanted in a mate: clever, strong, determined, loyal. And sexy as hell\u2014even in her pajamas and especially bared to him, skin to skin.</p><p>She arched her back and he sensed she was near completion, her lithe body attempting to rock harder, her breasts bouncing with a mesmerizing rhythm. He gave into her, drew her to the top.</p><p>\u201cOh, Hunter,\u201d she called out, no longer worried that anyone might hear her cry of jubilation.</p> <p>He quickly followed, filling her with his seed. \u201cTessa,\u201d he groaned, unable to say anything further. Sweet ecstasy, she was perfect for him\u2014and his forever, this, only the beginning.</p><p>She sank down on top of him, her head resting against his neck, and he kissed her flushed cheek. \u201cTime to get some rest, sweet Tessa.\u201d He hit the button on the Jacuzzi, turning off the jets, then lifted her off his lap, her body limp with satisfaction, soft, wet, and sensuous.</p><p>The sly smile she gave him assured him they wouldn\u2019t get much sleep tonight.</p><p>Early the next morning, Tessa turned her head toward the front of Allan\u2019s house as she and Hunter grabbed a hasty breakfast. \u201cA car door just shut.\u201d She seized her bagel and headed for the front window as Hunter poured himself another cup of coffee.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe how she could hear the slightest sounds, everywhere and anywhere. The heater turning on, a school bus picking up kids, although the bus never came down Allan\u2019s street, the whisper of a breeze stirring an oak\u2019s branches out front. She hoped she would soon get used to it because for now it was wreaking havoc with her sleep. Not that Hunter\u2019s wanting to make love with her throughout the night hadn\u2019t something to do with it also. Ahem, well, some of it was her fault also.</p><p>\u201cA patrol car just arrived. It\u2019s Caruthers.\u201d</p><p>Hunter joined her at the window and rested his hand on her shoulder in a comforting way. \u201cTime to see your brother.\u201d</p><p>Trying to squash her nervousness at seeing her brother in prison, she finished her bagel and looked up at Hunter. \u201cDo you always get that much exercise at night?\u201d</p><p>His sexy smile hinted he was ready for more. \u201cNot usually.\u201d</p><p>She gave a ladylike snort. \u201cThen you were just lonely and wanted to cuddle really bad, but things got out of hand?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and ran his hands through her hair. \u201cNot usually, as in with other women. But with you, I couldn\u2019t keep my hands to myself. Besides, your pheromones are a total aphrodisiac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, well, yours drive me crazy, too, but jeesh, Hunter, I\u2019ll be walking bowlegged today, and I\u2019ll be yawning the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take a nap later.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYeah, but will we sleep?\u201d</p><p>His grin said that she would have a fat chance at that.</p><p>Caruthers knocked at the front door, and when Hunter opened it, the policeman offered them a big smile. \u201cGreta and I are agreeable about leaving here and working on the coast. You might need some backup with three new lupus garous in your pack. Allan and the little lady who\u2019s widowed in your pack really hit it off last night. From the sounds of it, job or no job, he\u2019s joining you, too. I\u2019ll drive you to the prison.\u201d He relocked Allan\u2019s place and then escorted them to his car.</p><p>Hunter wrapped his arm around Tessa in a loving gesture.</p><p>She glanced up at him, her body warming with his touch, gladdened also that Caruthers and the others would join her mate. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about your wayward pack. Looks like you\u2019ve got a whole new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others will come back.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see how he could be so complacent about it. To her way of thinking, they were too disloyal to trust any further. But then again, she hadn\u2019t been a lupus garou long enough to understand their way of thinking.</p><p>\u201cI run a fairly democratic pack,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI\u2019m not an autocratic leader like some are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept when it comes to your sister.\u201d</p><p>Hunter grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s my blood relative. And you are my mate. Our offspring will have to mind also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so those you love best you keep under your rule.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek and sighed heavily. \u201cIn a pack, it\u2019s called being protective.\u201d</p><p>Tessa glanced at Caruthers. \u201cIs that what your pack would call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Whatever the boss says.\u201d Caruthers winked at her. \u201cMan, does this bring back memories of when I turned Greta.\u201d</p><p>Tessa folded her arms and Hunter chuckled.</p><p>When they arrived at the prison, Caruthers parked in front and gave Tessa a compassionate look. \u201cJust tell them Allan Smith and Jim Caruthers sent you. I\u2019ll wait out here for you.\u201d</p><p>Tessa shuddered. To think her brother was incarcerated in the massive place without any chance of escape unless she could bring the real killer to trial and make him pay for the crime. She hoped to god her brother could shed some light on the case.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE PRISON\u2019S VISITING ROOM, Tessa introduced Hunter to her brother. She tried to keep the tears at bay, but Michael\u2019s eyes were as misty as hers, which didn\u2019t help. And he looked thinner than before, the orange jailhouse jumpsuit clashing with his red hair.</p><p>He scowled at Hunter. \u201cWhy the hell is he wearing my jacket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in an accident, but needed a change of clothes. I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d Tessa pulled out Rourke\u2019s phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat news do you have?\u201d Michael took a seat at the table, opposite them, his voice threaded with hope and despair, although he glowered at Hunter again.</p><p>\u201cHunter is looking into the killing. We\u2019ve got some pictures to show you.\u201d She handed Michael Rourke\u2019s phone. \u201cDo you recognize any of these guys?\u201d</p><p>Michael considered the photos of the three grays. He pointed to Butch, who had been at his trial, and at the one called Redmond. \u201cThey came to our house to check out the circuit breakers.\u201d He looked up at Tessa. \u201cThey knew what they were doing. They replaced the bad switch and charged us a hefty bill like electricians always do, and left.\u201d He rubbed his chin and stared at the table. \u201cAlthough, they were interested in your photographs.\u201d He looked up at Tessa, his expression annoyed. \u201cNot my paintings though. The one asked if you had ever taken a picture of a wolf in the wild.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hitched. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the wildlife refuge, but never in the wild. You would have told me if you had.\u201d</p><p>Like she didn\u2019t. But as usual he had been too busy painting to pay any attention to her artistic endeavors.</p><p>\u201cDid these guys have anything to do with Bethany\u2019s murder?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>\u201cThis one was at your trial when the verdict was read,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cThis guy called him Butch. The other you named was Redmond. And the one you don\u2019t recognize was Jessup. Butch came to the house with the two other men, and I asked him why he was at your trial. He denied having been there. His hair was long, but I know it was him. Why deny it? Why be there in the first place?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wondered why he looked different. Why were they at the house?\u201d</p><p>Hunter tensed and she figured he was worried she might say the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cOne of them is interested in Hunter\u2019s sister. So he tracked her to my place and that\u2019s when I met all three of them.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you this, but you have to know in case anything can shed light on who the real murderer is. A man by the name of Yoloff has been stalking me. Hunter had a run-in with one of his two brothers and in self-defense, Hunter killed him.\u201d</p> <p>Michael\u2019s gaze turned to Hunter, and he swore softly under his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an ex\u2013Navy SEAL,\u201d Hunter said, \u201ctrained to do work like this. The guy didn\u2019t have a chance even though he was armed with a knife. But his brothers went after Tessa, and I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s eyes grew big. \u201cThanks for taking care of my little sister.\u201d</p><p>She grunted. He was her younger brother, but because he was several inches taller than she was, he called her little.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Hunter took hold of her hand and squeezed. \u201cWe\u2019re married. I\u2019ll always protect her.\u201d</p> <p>Michael shifted his attention to Tessa.</p><p>\u201cUhm, yeah, whirlwind romance.\u201d She hadn\u2019t thought Hunter would bring that up right now. Besides, they weren\u2019t really married as in the marriage license, wedding ring, or marriage vows kind of arrangement. Her cheeks heated and she tried to muddle through. \u201cI found him washed up on the beach after the guy who was stalking me pushed him off a cliff and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, back up to the guy that was stalking you. I worried someone was, but have you learned who it is?\u201d</p><p>She noted her brother\u2019s concern for her, but not about Hunter\u2019s near-death experience. Michael was probably still pissed off because Hunter was wearing his favorite jacket.</p><p>\u201cHe broke into our house the day you were taken to prison. Hunter protected me from him. Anyway, Hunter thought maybe this guy wanted you out of the way, and so he murdered Bethany so you would be found guilty of the crime.\u201d</p><p>Michael pointed to the third man in the photos. \u201cThis other guy looks familiar also.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJessup\u2019s the one who\u2019s after Hunter\u2019s sister. Where do you remember him from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe driver of the electric truck.\u201d Michael frowned and then looked up at Tessa. \u201cI saw him at a number of my art exhibits. Of course, you begin to see the same people at the parties. Avid collectors, people who like mingling with others who enjoy the paintings, philanthropists, novice painters who want to learn how to sell their own works. I remember him because he kept watching Bethany. Do you think he was seeing her behind my back?\u201d</p><p>Tessa gritted her teeth. She hadn\u2019t wanted to tell her brother Ashton was the traitor. But if any detail could help them solve the case, he had to know.</p><p>\u201cAshton...\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cAshton\u2019s the one who was seeing Bethany when you were at your shows.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou knew? Why didn\u2019t you say so at the trial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? The sheriff would have covered for his son. Ashton would have gotten away with it, as usual, and it would have looked like I was lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if Ashton killed Bethany?\u201d</p> <p>Michael rubbed his forehead, then shoved his hands in his lap. \u201cI sure as hell considered it. What if she\u2019d wanted to come back to me? Make it up to me? We\u2019d fought that night. She said she\u2019d done some things she wasn\u2019t proud of, although she wouldn\u2019t admit she was seeing someone else. I tried to get her to confess, but she wouldn\u2019t. She just kept protecting the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you could have been angry enough to kill her,\u201d Hunter said softly.</p><p>\u201cI was angry, but I didn\u2019t murder her. I could have thrashed the guy who\u2019d been seeing her. But I wouldn\u2019t have hurt Bethany. I understood how she felt. I really loved her, but I didn\u2019t know how to remedy our relationship because the more popular my work was becoming, the more despondent she became over it. To sell, I have to promote. To keep my relationship alive with her, I\u2019d have had to give it all up. But it was my livelihood, my worth.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill her. She always walked along the cliffs when she was angry or frustrated. Supposedly, she went there after I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Ashton might have done it?\u201d Tessa asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He was always getting away with his petty crimes. What if she had told him she wanted to go back to me and he was so angry, he killed her? He didn\u2019t say anything to me about it, but I knew he was jealous of my success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew she was seeing Ashton, did you know if she was seeing anyone else?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>Michael\u2019s eyes clouded with fresh tears and his shoulders slumped.</p><p>Ohmigod. Had Bethany been seeing someone else? A bunch of different guys?</p><p>Running his hand through his hair, Michael stared at the table and nodded. \u201cAshton wasn\u2019t the only one. At least one other guy was seeing her. Maybe two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I don\u2019t have any real proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you said the place was haunted?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand why her brother had come up with such a ludicrous story.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Michael admitted. \u201cI felt like a couple of people were watching her house. I thought I saw a man in the shadows of the trees one day at dusk. I wanted to check, but Bethany insisted I was seeing things. Later, I wondered if the guy was her lover, and she didn\u2019t want me catching him. It happened again a couple of weeks later. And then another time, I swear someone was actually in the house. A drawer opened in the kitchen. I was half-dressed, but even so I charged into the room and the back door was standing wide open. Bethany said we probably hadn\u2019t shut it all the way. So what could I say? Ghosts infested the place? I didn\u2019t want to make love to her there anymore. Let her stay with her damned ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the guy or guys come to your house while she visited you?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>\u201cNot that I knew of. Why bother? They could see her anytime they wanted to at her place when she wasn\u2019t working her shifts at the Lobster Tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf some other guy wanted Bethany and didn\u2019t like it that Michael was seeing her, why wouldn\u2019t he kill Ashton for seeing her also? Why only frame Michael for the crime?\u201d Tessa asked.</p><p>No one had an answer.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what about my stalker? He and his brothers pushed Hunter off the same cliff that Bethany had fallen from. Too much of a coincidence?\u201d</p><p>Michael looked back at Hunter. \u201cHow in the hell did you survive?\u201d</p><p>Finally, some reaction to poor Hunter\u2019s ordeal.</p><p>\u201cNavy SEAL training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Tessa cast Hunter a look of admiration, then focused on her brother. \u201cCan you think of anything else? Anything that would help us figure out who did this?\u201d</p><p>Michael snorted. \u201cYeah, the treasure hunters.\u201d</p><p>Tessa made a disagreeable face at her brother. Here he was incarcerated, they were trying to get him out, and he was being flippant about ghosts and nonexistent gold.</p><p>Hunter leaned back in the chair. \u201cTreasure hunters?\u201d</p><p>Tessa folded her arms. \u201cYou know how oral history goes. Supposedly, our great-grandparents had a huge stash of gold, and they hid it somewhere on our land. But it\u2019s just a myth, or if it really existed at some time someone else stole it. Our grandparents searched for it, so did our parents. And truth be told, even when Michael and I were younger, we dug all over the place out there, but none of us ever found it. Over the years, we\u2019ve had tons of offers to take the house off our hands. I figured it had to do with the rumors about the gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you think it was a coincidence our grandparents died in a car accident only a year after our parents did?\u201d Michael asked, one red brow cocked.</p><p>\u201cDad was drunk as usual. And Granddad shouldn\u2019t have been driving, although we know Grandmother hated to drive so she was always giving him the wheel. The coroner said his heart had given out before they went off the cliff. So yeah, it\u2019s a coincidence, but totally explainable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men who came to the house said they were looking to steal from Bethany\u2019s place. If they thought gold was hidden somewhere on your land, maybe that\u2019s the reason they were there,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>Tessa couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d even be considering it, but then she wondered if he knew about the gold rumors all along. \u201cDid Uncle Basil think there was gold on our property?\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s lips parted.</p><p>Hell, he had. So was that why Hunter had turned her?</p><p>To get her property? \u201cHe kept trying to buy me out.\u201d She bit back the bitterness, making it difficult to swallow. Hunter reached for her hand, but she pulled away from him. \u201cIs that why he wanted our property so badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeidolf found a couple of newspaper clippings on the guy I killed, pertaining to a dispute Caleb McKnight had with your grandfather over stolen gold. The other was about John Anderson and his killing Caleb McKnight, father of triplets, Yoloff, Ren, and Andreas. So what if they had to do with your family\u2019s deaths?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill them,\u201d Michael said, his face turning as red as his hair.</p><p>The blood rushed from Tessa\u2019s face, and she reached across the table and took Michael\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t even talk like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always thought Uncle Basil had some ulterior motive,\u201d Michael said. \u201cYou sure get to know who your friends are. And here he was insisting we didn\u2019t need to stay there because young people our age needed to be closer to the city, especially because of the work we do. Couldn\u2019t he see that nature is what inspires our work? Not city buildings and urban sprawl? Not people? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves?\u201d Hunter asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michael looked from him to Tessa and she quickly said to her brother, \u201cI didn\u2019t show him the paintings.\u201d</p><p>He glowered at Hunter. \u201cDon\u2019t you know not to look at an artist\u2019s work that\u2019s not finished?\u201d He ran his hands through his hair and stared gloomily at the table.</p><p>\u201cI just came across them, by accident. Beautiful work, by the way. But back to Bethany\u2019s murder, tons of people had been in her house\u2014the three guys who had to do with trying to take off with my sister, and of course the sheriff and his men, the coroner\u2019s office, Tessa, Ashton...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sheriff,\u201d Michael said, emphasizing him over all the rest.</p><p>Tessa straightened. \u201cSure, because he\u2019s investigating a murder.\u201d</p><p>Michael shook his head. \u201cHe was always cleaning up after Ashton, remember? He\u2019s the one who reported the murder, except because he\u2019s the sheriff, no one considered he might have known who had done the real killing. A sheriff would be above suspicion. Hell, look at how that policeman killed two of his wives and because he was a cop, no one believed there was any foul play. Not until the second one came up missing. But even then, the police force denied he had anything to do with her suspicious disappearance. The family had to have their loved one\u2019s body exhumed so the coroner could determine if there was foul play. And of course, this time, the coroner said yes, she was murdered. So you don\u2019t think a sheriff could cover up his son\u2019s murder and get away with it? Especially when they have me\u2014the perfect patsy for the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked Ashton to watch over me, even knowing what you did about him?\u201d Tessa asked.</p><p>Michael took a deep breath. \u201cI figured I kind of deserved it. Sticking with him when I knew he was bad news\u2014getting me into scrapes, causing all that trouble for you. But I also know deep down, the guy\u2019s got some decency in him. Hell, our dad was bad enough with being the town philanderer and drunk. But after Ashton\u2019s mother took off with another man, his dad changed. Ashton kept reaching out, trying to get his dad to pay attention to him, in a negative way. In any way he could. He didn\u2019t have an older sister like you to help him out. And he\u2019s damned good with a rifle. He could protect you if need be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you knew there was a stalker. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to worry you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at her brother. \u201cYou could have told me. And you could have warned me that Ashton was going to be gunning down anything that moved out by our house. He shot Hunter!\u201d</p><p>Michael quickly looked at Hunter. \u201cOh, hell, I\u2019m sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. It was just a graze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you realize there was a stalker?\u201d Tessa asked her brother.</p> <p>\u201cI saw footprints outside your window when I was clipping the hedges. And another time I saw someone peeking in the house when I came up with a load of wood, but I was too far away to catch him.\u201d Michael looked back at Hunter. \u201cHell, he looked a bit like you. Long dark hair, same approximate height and build.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Ashton said he shot him. But Hunter was with me when the man broke into the house on a couple of separate occasions.\u201d</p><p>Michael considered them both and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. But I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got someone who\u2019s combat trained to watch over you. I never thought you\u2019d get married.\u201d He rose abruptly from the chair. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. Write, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back. We\u2019ll get you out, Michael. You just take good care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a warm hug and she broke into tears, despite struggling not to. \u201cYou... you just take care of yourself,\u201d she reiterated.</p><p>Michael kissed her wet cheek. \u201cI will.\u201d He shook Hunter\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone hurt her. Take care of that stalker.\u201d</p><p>Hunter bowed his head slightly. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Michael straightened his posture and gave a half smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, but all of a sudden I began getting some special treatment in here. So don\u2019t worry, little sister. Things are already looking up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would Michael be getting special treatment in prison?\u201d Tessa asked, as Hunter helped her into Caruthers\u2019s police car.</p><p>She was holding up pretty well, and he was damned proud of her.</p><p>\u201cThe judge had something to do with it. Maybe Allan and me, too.\u201d Caruthers shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually mess with humans who are incarcerated in the prison system. Most are there because they deserve it. But since you\u2019re one of us, we pulled some strings. Of course, no one in the place really knows why, just that there\u2019s a sneaking suspicion the kid\u2019s innocent, and he\u2019s got some pretty powerful friends in high places.\u201d</p><p>Tessa brushed away tears and smiled. \u201cTell Allan and the judge thanks for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that. While you were inside, that red, Leidolf, came by. He said he\u2019d meet you at The Olive Groves for lunch. He said the rest of your people would be there also. Want me to take you there now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what Leidolf has to say.\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked at him.</p><p>He cast her an abbreviated smile. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tear into him.\u201d Too badly. Then he let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you took a picture of a wolf in the wild and that he was shapeshifting at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say so.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThe look on your face revealed the truth. I told you that you couldn\u2019t play poker with me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never get anything past Hunter unless she wore a ski mask, and probably even then her eyes and voice would give her away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what it was. I thought it was a wolf. It was really foggy out. And then I saw a man. Or at least I thought so. The photo wasn\u2019t clear and no matter how much I tried to enhance it...\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThe man was naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t look like he was wearing any clothes. But it was a long ways off. I just figured my mind was playing tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Hunter. He was looking in my direction, but I was using a telescopic lens. He couldn\u2019t have seen me as far away as I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Caruthers said. \u201cif he hadn\u2019t wanted you so badly, he would have killed you.\u201d</p><p>The thought she had been living a life of danger all this time without his protection stirred Hunter\u2019s blood. \u201cHe saw you, Tessa. Believe me. How long before Bethany had been murdered had this taken place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days. I showed her the photo and asked her what she could make of it. All Bethany saw was mist. I showed it to Michael also, but preoccupied with his painting, he didn\u2019t pay any attention. Said it looked interesting, but barely glanced at it.\u201d</p><p>But had Bethany\u2019s witnessing the photo led to her death?</p><p>In Caruthers\u2019s patrol car, Hunter and Tessa soon arrived at the Italian restaurant, although Hunter regretted that Tessa was so tense. She would have to see for herself that the pack would accept her as one of their own.</p><p>When they arrived at the restaurant, the hostess tried to seat them, but Caruthers motioned to a group of people, both Leidolf\u2019s reds and the rest of Hunter\u2019s pack, at a large rowdy table. \u201cI\u2019ll sit with them.\u201d</p><p>The waiter escorted Tessa and Hunter to a private booth, and Tessa looked back at the table with his pack mates as if she wished they could sit with them and not have the confrontation with Leidolf. So that was what was worrying her.</p><p>Hunter gripped her hand tighter. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t kill him for leaving me behind in the jail and going after you.\u201d</p><p>The smell of oregano, garlic, Italian sauce, and onions wafted in the air, and Hunter\u2019s stomach grumbled. Dishes and glasses clinked as servers cleared tables and conversation and Italian music drifted overhead. Nice setting for a romantic dinner for two if Hunter and Tessa could have enjoyed the meal without Leidolf chaperoning.</p><p>Leidolf leaned back against the burgundy vinyl seat in the booth at the end of the section, looking self-satisfied and smiled at them. \u201cMy lawyer was trying to have you released, but he told me you got yourself out by contacting someone who had a lot more clout. Pays to have a judge back you.\u201d</p><p>Unable to let go of the irritation, Hunter gave him a dark look.</p><p>\u201cI missed you at the hotel last night, but I guess you found a safe place to hole up. Your people are returning with you, and they\u2019re dying to meet your new mate. You\u2019ve got three cops leaving here to watch your backs on the coast, one who wants one of your widowed females, and she\u2019s ecstatic. Sounds like your pack is off to a good recovery. Not bad considering the mess you\u2019ve been in recently.\u201d Leidolf unfolded his napkin and placed it on his lap. \u201cOther packs usually don\u2019t mix it up much, but I\u2019ve grown attached to yours, considering one of your people is joining mine. If you need my help any further, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Hell, he was attached to Hunter\u2019s pack because Tessa still interested him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to the lawyer about me?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>Leidolf laughed. \u201cHe holds a grudge, Tessa. Remember that.\u201d He sipped his water. \u201cI told him just what had happened. You were wielding the knife that killed the guy. That\u2019s why he released me so quickly. I was only a witness to the whole thing. I\u2019d planned to watch over Tessa until you arrived at the hospital. Imagine my surprise to find you had beat me to it.\u201d</p><p>Hunter squeezed Tessa\u2019s hand in her lap. \u201cSo you\u2019re returning to Portland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to. I\u2019ve got problems of my own. A red from Texas is stirring up trouble. Thinks he might have what it takes to run my pack. Can you imagine the nerve of the guy?\u201d He winked at Tessa and turned his attention back to Hunter. \u201cBut I mean it. If you need my help, just say. I\u2019ll come to the coast and give you a hand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunter bowed his head. \u201cLikewise, Leidolf.\u201d</p><p>Tessa took a deep breath and her shoulders relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cI would have gone to see your brother, Tessa, but thought you might like to spend the time with him alone. With Hunter, of course. Are you any closer to solving the murder mystery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two who were in the house when you and Hunter came home after cutting up the tree had done some work on our circuit breaker. And Michael said that the guy called Jessup had been driving the truck, and he\u2019d seen him at a number of his art exhibits.\u201d Tessa looked over at Hunter. \u201cWhen Jessup said they\u2019d been casing Bethany\u2019s house for valuables, I didn\u2019t think they were really thieves, but maybe they were. And maybe they were planning on ripping off the art gallery, but it had too much security so they hoped to find some of Michael\u2019s paintings in the house. Easier to break into. Butch was at Michael\u2019s trial. Why? To see if he really got time or if he was going to be released? If Michael had been found not guilty, we would have been home and it would have been harder for them to steal anything from the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr,\u201d Leidolf said, \u201che was calling ahead to the others, who were breaking into your house while you were at the trial. Once you left, he would warn them you were on the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas anything missing from your house besides the gun?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t look. I figured Yoloff had only stolen the gun. I never thought anyone would be running around in that weather stealing paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything else of value?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>\u201cComputers, electronics. My photographs. But again, I would doubt they\u2019d be interested in any of that because of the weather. The ice storm hadn\u2019t started yet, but it was on its way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSearching for evidence of wrongdoing? Maybe they\u2019d been involved in Bethany\u2019s murder, and they were afraid Michael had some proof against them that he didn\u2019t know about,\u201d Leidolf said.</p><p>\u201cMichael mentioned the sheriff could have been covering up for his son, Ashton, also,\u201d Tessa mentioned.</p><p>Leidolf shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m glad all I have is a simple case of knocking some sense into a red\u2019s head if he thinks he\u2019s taking over my pack. Keep in touch, and I\u2019ll help any way I can if you need me. Your new cops won\u2019t be returning with you for a couple of weeks until they settle their affairs here. Your widow is staying with the one cop, but the rest are taking the Ford Escape, making it kind of crowded. I\u2019m gifting you my Humvee, travels in any kind of weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Tessa said.</p><p>Leidolf held up his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got another back at the ranch. I\u2019ll ride home with my people. Maybe Hunter won\u2019t hold a grudge against me about the jail situation for too long then.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThe last time I had to deal with a gray pack leader, Devlyn Greystoke had targeted a red he mated who reminded me of you. She was a redhead also. Bella was her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevlyn changed a human, too?\u201d Tessa asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Leidolf looked at the table for a second, then back up at them. \u201cI was too late for her. She should have mated a red.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOnly a lupus garou would do, isn\u2019t that right, Leidolf?\u201d Hunter asked.</p><p>Leidolf managed a smile. \u201cSure, that\u2019s right, Hunter.\u201d</p><p>But Hunter suspected it wasn\u2019t so. If he had given Leidolf the chance, he might have claimed Tessa for his own, especially since she reminded him of the last one he\u2019d lost.</p><p>They finished their meals in silence, and then Leidolf paid the bill. Hunter kissed Tessa\u2019s cheek. \u201cAre you ready to meet the rest of my pack?\u201d</p><p>No, not now. But that wouldn\u2019t be very alpha of her. Yet, Tessa shivered internally anyway. What if they put her to the test? Tried to prove to her that she couldn\u2019t be their pack leader\u2019s mate? She didn\u2019t have a clue what she was supposed to do.</p><p>She stiffened her spine as she walked between Leidolf and Hunter. At least while she was wedged between the two alphas, she almost felt alpha herself.</p><p>Caruthers and a pretty brunette on his arm Tessa figured was Greta, both in their midforties, were sitting at a long table with several others. Allan, the other cop, and the woman he was interested in, a woman with chestnut hair curled on top of her head in swirls with a quick smile and sparkle in her amber eyes, sat next to them. And three other males, maybe in their late twenties, early thirties, all tall. one with black hair and eyes, who seemed too interested in Tessa, but quickly changed his posture to a contrite expression when Hunter gave him a quelling look. The other two had light brown hair cut short, dark brown eyes and appeared to be twins, except the one was slightly taller.</p> <p>\u201cKenneth,\u201d Hunter said, motioning to one of the twins, \u201cand Kensington.\u201d He waved at the black-haired man. \u201cAdam.\u201d He smiled at the woman. \u201cThis is Genevieve who seems to have found her new mate. Everyone, this is Tessa, my mate.\u201d</p><p>All bowed their heads slightly.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d Genevieve said, and hurried forth to give her a hug.</p><p>Greta did the same. The men didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>Hunter shook Leidolf\u2019s hand. \u201cThanks for the Humvee and the offer to help. We\u2019ll keep in touch. If you need any of my aid, likewise, give me a call. We have a long drive ahead of us, and I don\u2019t want to leave my sister in charge of a couple of new lupus garous much longer, so we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook hands with the police officers who would join them in a couple of weeks. Greta whispered to Tessa, \u201cI\u2019ve been where you are, honey. I\u2019ll show you the ropes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the same.\u201d Caruthers kissed his mate on the cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s an alpha leader\u2019s mate.\u201d</p><p>Greta grinned. \u201cLike I said, Tessa, I\u2019ll help you all I can.\u201d</p><p>Caruthers shook his head, and Tessa gave Greta and Genevieve a hug, already feeling like one of the pack and it was a damned good feeling, too, but for her brother\u2019s continued incarceration. \u201cI look forward to seeing you both soon.\u201d</p><p>Once Hunter\u2019s people were packed into the Escort, Hunter led them in the Humvee.</p><p>\u201cI thought they might want to eat me alive, but they were really nice,\u201d Tessa told Hunter as he drove out of town.</p><p>\u201cA couple of my males would have eaten you all up, but not the way you mean.\u201d He gripped the steering wheel tighter, then released it, but still seemed as tense as before. \u201cWhat do you know about your great-grandfather?\u201d</p><p>Here they went around about the gold again. \u201cHe was from Colorado originally, but got the gold fever. First he went to California and made it big, then came here. He met my great-grandmother who was working for her father\u2019s mercantile. Supposedly, he found a lot of gold here, too. Just had a real nose for it. But all the money in the world wouldn\u2019t buy him happiness. Shortly after finding the gold, my great-grandmother died of a fever, and he returned to Colorado. I couldn\u2019t find out what happened to him after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was just an infant when her mother died. Her father couldn\u2019t take care of her. She went to live with her mother\u2019s brother and wife. But my grandmother said her father was generous and had left her aunt and uncle all the gold, enough to make them wealthy. Much of it was put into the bank later on, but some of it was hidden. They never had any children, and Grandmother eventually inherited it all and married a wealthy merchant. They settled where the house is now, where my great-grandparents had once lived in a shack. What happened to Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was killed in a rock slide. Apparently, he must have left your great-grandmother, returned to Colorado, but then rejoined my great-grandfather in California. Three of them died. My great-grandfather, Seth, and my father\u2019s twin brother. A fourth man, Caleb McKnight, was the only one who survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one in the news clippings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Did your grandmother have any special abilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you do? Everyone used to tease her that there was no sneaking around Grandmother because she heard everything. She knew things, too. Like when the weather was changing. She explained it was due to her arthritis. As for her sense of smell? She definitely smelled things more acutely than we did. She seemed to always sense people\u2019s emotions also, whether they were scared or angry, even when they were hiding their feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could smell their fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, although I thought it was because she was super-observant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the gold?\u201d</p><p>Tessa frowned at him. \u201cThere is no gold on the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth told my father he\u2019d stockpiled it somewhere in Oregon for people who needed it more than he did. Never in a million years would we have thought Seth had a child by a human. Did you ever find a marriage certificate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Lots of records are pretty difficult to locate. No birth record for my grandmother either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently in rare cases a human can conceive a child with a lupus garou. But in all the years I\u2019ve lived, I\u2019ve never met anyone like that, and Leidolf had only met one during his lifetime.\u201d</p><p>But what if her line had an affinity for getting pregnant by a lupus garou?</p><p>Hunter must have realized what she was thinking because he smiled at her and patted her leg. \u201cSeth must not have changed your great-grandmother and that\u2019s why she died of a fever. Maybe she didn\u2019t want to be changed, or maybe he couldn\u2019t do it. But you\u2019re already one of us, and the babies you have will fully be lupus garous.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never thought about that. How was she to deal with being a lupus garou and raising offspring like that when she was totally clueless about herself still? Tessa sighed.</p><p>Hunter slowed down as wrecking crews waved them past a rock slide. Tessa glanced back to see if the red Escort was behind them.</p><p>\u201cHeavy traffic. About five vehicles slipped in between us, but I\u2019ve given my pack directions if we get separated.\u201d He pulled back into their lane past the rock slide. \u201cSo what else do we know about Bethany\u2019s murder? How come the sheriff found her? Was there a 911 call made?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBethany had made a call to the sheriff, stating that Michael had become violent and she was worried he might return. She said she was taking a walk along the trail by the cliff. The sheriff stopped by to check on her, but when he couldn\u2019t find her at the house, he went down the trail and discovered her body at the bottom of the cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone records verified the call was made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if Ashton had made the call from Bethany\u2019s house, told his father he\u2019d killed her by accident, and his father covered up for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully, I don\u2019t think Ashton killed her.\u201d Tessa rubbed her clammy hands on her jeans. \u201cGut instinct.</p><p>I think he really cared for her and if he murdered her in a fit of passion, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d let Michael go to prison for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, he let him take the rap for minor crimes he was responsible for. On the other hand, what if your brother really did it?\u201d</p><p>Tessa glowered at Hunter.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if he did? We can\u2019t discount that he might be guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t! What if it\u2019s one of your kind?\u201d Tessa choked on the thought. \u201cYou... you couldn\u2019t have a lupus garou convicted, could you? Once the moon appeared, he\u2019d change and you can\u2019t have one incarcerated, can you?\u201d Hell, even Ashton was one now.</p><p>\u201cIf we find one of them is guilty, we\u2019ll figure out a way.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d figure out a way. If she could just turn into a wolf and bite her brother in prison, the judge would have to have him released.</p><p>When they finally reached Hunter\u2019s house, Tessa figured someone would greet them, but nobody did and her heart began to race.</p><p>\u201cStay in the Humvee. Do not leave until I say so,\u201d Hunter ordered, his face dark and threatening.</p> <p>Before she could respond, he slammed the door shut and strode to the front porch, then disappeared inside. She concentrated on the front door standing wide open and wanted to join him rather than worry about what was happening.</p><p>And then his face stormy, he stalked out to the Humvee and jumped in. \u201cJessup and his pack have taken them.\u201d</p><p>She hoped Hunter couldn\u2019t smell her fear, but she couldn\u2019t hide how she was feeling.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re to meet them at that burned out pine tree. I\u2019m to hand you over to Yoloff and they\u2019ll release my sister and the rest.\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked behind them, but still didn\u2019t see any sign of the Escort.</p><p>\u201cI left directions.\u201d Hunter pulled out of the drive and headed south on the coastal road.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t face all five of them, Hunter. We should wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want us alone. I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p> <p>Stubborn damn alpha male. He was going to get himself killed and then where would she be? Just when she\u2019d found the man she wanted to love forever. And what about Michael also?</p><p>Her skin crawling with anxiety, she looked into the backseat. No weapons. \u201cWhat about the rifles at the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must have taken them. None were there.\u201d</p><p>The closer they got to where the pine tree was, the more Tessa felt she could lose Hunter for good. She looked into the backseat again. Nothing. Leidolf was a neat freak. Not even a hint of dust. But what about the trunk? A tire iron?</p><p>\u201cNo matter what, you\u2019re staying in the vehicle. If they get the best of me, you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your sister, and the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t harm them until they\u2019re assured they have you. You return to my place, gather the forces, call Leidolf. Hell, have him notify Devlyn of the problem. These guys won\u2019t be able to handle all that heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t charge in there and kill them all. Why can\u2019t you wait for the others?\u201d She studied the tension in his face and frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Jessup and the others will wait, do you? You think they\u2019ll kill some of them. Rourke and Ashton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have left you at my place, but I was afraid that they\u2019d be watching and take you. So do as I say, Tessa. You\u2019re no match for any of them without having a gun.\u201d</p><p>They drove the rest of the way in silence and when they reached the designated place, Tessa couldn\u2019t stop shivering. She wasn\u2019t being an alpha, but she couldn\u2019t change into a wolf, which even if she could probably wouldn\u2019t have helped much against them. And without a gun, she was totally defenseless and useless.</p><p>Hunter pulled up and stopped. Yoloff and his brother stood as wolves near the burned up pine, watching them, waiting. Jessup stood farther away as a human, unable to shapeshift. He didn\u2019t have a weapon that she could see. Where were Redmond and Butch? Probably guarding Meara and the others somewhere else.</p><p>Hunter squeezed Tessa\u2019s hand. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you targeting first? Jessup? He\u2019s their leader. If you take him out, maybe the others will tuck tail and run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoloff and his brother. They\u2019re the most dangerous in their wolf forms.\u201d Hunter opened the door. \u201cLock it after me.\u201d</p><p>Tessa climbed into the driver\u2019s seat and locked the door. Jessup motioned to her to come out of the vehicle, but she ignored him and watched Hunter strip off his clothes, sure of himself, muscular, ready.</p><p>Even though Yoloff and his brother stood their ground, she thought they looked a little nervous, their ears flattening and their tails drooping slightly. Hunter didn\u2019t take his eyes off Yoloff the whole time while he removed his clothes. Yoloff would die. She knew Hunter wouldn\u2019t allow him to live this time. Maybe his brother, too. But she was certain Jessup didn\u2019t intend to let Hunter rip him to shreds, if Hunter managed to best the brothers.</p><p>And then she saw the rifle leaning against one of the trees. Damn him. What if she could get to it while Jessup watched Hunter\u2019s fight?</p><p>Hunter shapeshifted, but no one moved until he targeted Yoloff. Then Jessup made a move toward the Humvee. He motioned for her to get out. Like she\u2019d listen to him. Then she had another idea. Could she run any of them over? Probably not because of all the trees. Jessup could easily duck out of her path, she\u2019d ruin the Humvee, and be stuck.</p><p>The tire iron. Surely, Leidolf would have one to use in case he got a flat and had to change a tire. Had to be in the trunk.</p><p>Hunter ran at Yoloff and Jessup\u2019s attention switched to the fight. Typical male. Forget the girl when there\u2019s a good fight going on.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to take her eyes off the fight either, but she climbed into the backseat and looked into the trunk. Hell, if there was a tire iron, it must be hidden. She glanced back at the windshield.</p><p>Hunter and Yoloff clashed, their teeth bared and connecting, the growls reverberating through the woods. They fell to their pads and separated. Her skin prickled with anxiousness, her heart racing. She thought Yoloff\u2019s brother might attack next, but he seemed to be waiting for the fight to be decided first. He was probably thinking he wouldn\u2019t have to participate if Yoloff killed Hunter first.</p><p>But then Hunter did the unexpected. He whipped around and attacked Yoloff\u2019s brother, startling him so badly, he dashed off in the wrong direction, close to the edge of the cliff with nowhere to back up, nowhere to run. Hunter rose on his hind legs, his teeth snapping at the gray and with no room to maneuver, the brother slipped off the cliff with a yelp.</p><p>Shocked, Tessa stared out the window. Everyone else seemed as stunned. Yoloff didn\u2019t make a move toward Hunter and Jessup stood frozen in place. Yeah, bastard. After Hunter finishes off Yoloff, you\u2019re next.</p><p>She climbed into the trunk and began lifting the carpet, looking for the tire iron she hoped was here.</p><p>But then Hunter targeted Yoloff, and Jessup went for the gun. Oh, hell. Not finding a tire iron, Tessa scrambled over the backseat and then into the front and started the Humvee.</p><p>As soon as Hunter bit Yoloff in the face, Jessup aimed the rifle. Tessa couldn\u2019t reach him with the Humvee the way he was standing protected between the trees, but if she rammed the pines, she might be able to distract him enough. She threw the vehicle in drive and roared toward Jessup. He swung around and for a moment, she thought he might shoot her. But instead he jumped back, realizing he was protected by the trees, and turned the weapon on Hunter.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed, and ran the Humvee into the pine. Because of the constant rain in the area, the roots were shallow enough that when she hit the tree, it toppled, but Jessup got off a round right before it fell.</p><p>Hunter yelped this time and she saw the blood on his hip. Ohmigod, no, Hunter. If nothing else, she\u2019d wrestle with Jessup until Hunter destroyed\u2014 Yoloff bit at Hunter and he retaliated, but they were too close to the cliff\u2019s edge. Back up, back up!</p><p>Jessup aimed the rifle again, and Tessa jerked the door open and lunged at him, throwing her body at him, trying to knock him off balance to give Hunter time to take care of Yoloff.</p><p>And then her heart nearly gave out when she and Jessup stumbled over the felled pine, falling to their knees as Hunter took another bite at Yoloff\u2019s face. Yoloff suddenly went for Hunter\u2019s leg. They were both too close to the cliff edge! She wanted to warn Hunter away from the drop-off, drag him from the danger herself. But everything happened so fast she couldn\u2019t react quickly enough to do anything.</p><p>Yoloff bit into Hunter\u2019s leg, and Hunter snapped at Yoloff\u2019s neck. But Yoloff\u2019s back paws lost purchase on the crumbling soil. He slipped off the edge, pulling Hunter with him.</p><p>\u201cHunter!\u201d Tessa screamed and ran for him, but Jessup grabbed her arm and yanked her back. She kicked and thrashed back and forth, trying to break free, to save Hunter.</p><p>\u201cButch will be pleased,\u201d Jessup darkly said, and jerked her toward the edge of the cliff.</p><p>Only when she saw the direction he was going did she go willingly to see Hunter, to ensure he was all right. She prayed he was.</p><p>Down below, both Hunter\u2019s and Yoloff\u2019s wolf forms lay still as death. Yoloff\u2019s brother was gone. Her heart splintering, she stifled a sob.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Time to clean up the last of the loose ends. You\u2019ll tell us where the gold is hidden on your property, and we\u2019ll let the others go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With tears streaking down her face, she didn\u2019t believe it for a minute, although it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference because she didn\u2019t have a clue if there was any gold anyway. All that mattered was whether Hunter had made it or not.</p><p>Jessup tugged her in the direction of Bethany\u2019s house, but she fought him every step of the way, wanting to climb down the cliff to Hunter. He had to have survived the fall like before. He had to have. And she had to go to him.</p><p>But Jessup tightened his grip on her, cutting the circulation off in her wrist, her hand numbing. He hurried her faster to the house, forcing her to run to keep up. What about Hunter\u2019s pack? Where were they when they needed them most?</p> <p>Jessup shoved the front door open and yanked her into the house. \u201cShe\u2019s yours, Butch. Just like you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others?\u201d Butch asked, offering Jessup a beer.</p><p>Jessup forced Tessa onto the couch next to Meara and Cara, their hands and mouths bound, their eyes wild. Ashton and Rourke were bound, but unconscious on the floor. Meara looked at Tessa, trying to read her expression, but Tessa sobbed, attempting to appear so inconsolable that she was useless, and so that they wouldn\u2019t tie her up also, while she looked for another weapon. Not that her tears and upset weren\u2019t genuine, but she tried to keep a clear head until they were able to destroy the men before they harmed anyone else. And then she had to go to Hunter.</p><p>She spied a poker next to the cold fireplace as Redmond took a seat at the dining table. If she could just slip over to it.</p><p>\u201cHunter took care of Yoloff\u2019s brother first. Although he worked on Yoloff in the beginning. His tactics threw all of us. Especially, when Hunter forced Andreas off the cliff.\u201d Jessup took a swig of beer.</p> <p>But then Tessa worried that if she got the poker, Jessup still had the rifle and three men against one woman wouldn\u2019t do. If she could free Meara, she could shapeshift, whereas no one else could. Tessa had to chance it. She moved closer to Meara and began working on her bindings.</p><p>\u201cBut Yoloff\u2019s gone also?\u201d Butch asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Hunter got him, too, only he had the last laugh. He pulled Hunter off the cliff and both hit the rocks below.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure Hunter was dead? He survived before,\u201d Butch warned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he was dead. Last time, he hit the water and managed to swim to Tessa\u2019s beach. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>Her heart in her throat, Tessa felt the ties loosen on Meara\u2019s wrists. Meara quickly yanked them free, then tugged her clothes off. Tessa dove for the fireplace poker and Meara shapeshifted.</p> <p>As a wolf, Meara targeted Jessup, the leader, and Tessa went for the rifle, poker in hand.</p><p>But no sooner had Meara\u2019s teeth clamped down on Jessup\u2019s arm, making him drop the can of beer, than Butch dove for the rifle.</p><p>No, no! Tessa swung the poker at Butch\u2019s head and knocked him out cold. But somehow Redmond had managed to slip by her in the shuffle and went for the rifle.</p><p>Growling furiously, Meara lunged for Jessup\u2019s throat, while he grabbed onto her muzzle to keep her from killing him. Tessa froze as Redmond grabbed the rifle and pointed it at her. He could shoot her, but she wouldn\u2019t die. Yet, Tessa couldn\u2019t let go of the fear that Meara could. Meara was their only real chance at survival, and Tessa had to protect her. She prayed her lupus garou genetics would save her and leapt forward, swinging the poker at the rifle.</p><p>Her hands and mouth still bound, Cara had managed to slip behind Redmond and gave him a shove. The bullet fired into the carpeted floor.</p><p>Before Tessa could take another swing at Redmond, a different wolf growled low. She turned and saw Hunter, his hip bleeding. Alive! Tears filled her eyes and she wanted to rush to him, to hug him, proving he was really real.</p><p>His fur smelled foul, like he\u2019d rolled in a bed of rotting kelp. He quickly targeted Jessup, and Meara swung around to get Redmond.</p><p>But even over the growling and the sound of a porcelain lamp crashing, Tessa heard a vehicle driving up. Finally, Hunter\u2019s people had arrived.</p> <p>She ran to help untie Cara, but Butch came to and grabbed Tessa\u2019s ankle.</p><p>Redmond slid down next to her, his throat ripped out. Hunter didn\u2019t hesitate to make short work of Butch. Jessup was already dead.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d a man called out.</p><p>Hell, it was the sheriff.</p><p>Still in their wolf forms, Hunter and Meara looked in the direction of the front door, then raced out back.</p><p>Tessa continued to work on Cara\u2019s bindings.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d the sheriff said, his gun drawn.</p><p>\u201cA pair of wolves saved us from these men,\u201d Tessa said, her voice and hands shaking.</p><p>\u201cAshton?\u201d The sheriff ran over to help his son.</p><p>\u201cThese men knocked Ashton and Rourke out. They planned to kill the whole lot of us.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff stared at Butch and Redmond. \u201cHell, those two were seeing Bethany.\u201d</p><p>Staring at the sheriff in disbelief, Tessa untied Rourke. All the time he\u2019d said Michael had lied and Bethany hadn\u2019t been seeing anyone. What if one of these guys had killed her?</p><p>Ashton moaned and rubbed his head. \u201cI thought you said no one had been seeing Bethany, that Michael had made it up. How do you know they\u2019d been here?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff appeared flustered.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Ashton asked his dad again, his eyes slightly glazed, his tone threatening.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell do you think you are, questioning me?\u201d The sheriff glanced at the men and added under his breath, \u201cThe little whore.\u201d</p><p>Ashton\u2019s face lost all its color. \u201cYou were the one who discovered her body. No one questioned you because you were the sheriff. You said she\u2019d called you because she worried Michael might kill her he was so angry. But she didn\u2019t, did she? You used her phone to make the call. You killed her. Why?\u201d</p><p>Tessa\u2019s skin chilled.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Hunter said, stalking in through the back door with a limp, his pants leg bloodied, blood on his sweatshirt, his face bruised, his expression deadly, \u201cBethany reminded him of his unfaithful wife. Isn\u2019t that right, Sheriff? Didn\u2019t want a two-timing woman to hurt your own son?\u201d</p><p>Dying to hold Hunter tight, Tessa\u2019s eyes filled with tears of joy that Michael could be exonerated. But the menacing look Hunter gave the sheriff warned her to keep her distance.</p><p>What about Meara? Her clothes were lying on the floor next to the couch. Cara\u2019s gaze followed where Tessa looked, and Cara left Rourke, grabbed Meara\u2019s clothes, and headed outside.</p><p>\u201cYou must have staged the phone call,\u201d Hunter said.</p><p>The sheriff reached for his revolver.</p><p>His look feral, dangerously challenging, Hunter asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do? Kill all of us? It\u2019s over, Sheriff. Time to be a man and face the judge and jury.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>SEARCHING FOR THE GOLD IN THE AREA BEYOND the house, Tessa tried to settle the way her stomach flip-flopped. Thankful Judge Graydon had obtained Michael\u2019s release and agreed to try Sheriff Wellington for Bethany\u2019s murder, she still felt badly for Ashton, who was torn between hating his father and still loving him. But now Devlyn Greystoke was speaking privately with Hunter inside her house about Hunter making Tessa his mate without her cousin\u2019s permission, and he was pissed.</p><p>Tessa hoped to god the two could settle the matter without bloodshed, but she was annoyed they\u2019d dismissed her like she didn\u2019t have any say in the matter.</p><p>Although, secondary to all that was the fact Hunter was still perturbed with her for biting her brother and changing him. As if she\u2019d go through life without sharing it with her brother.</p><p>She took a deep breath of the salty air and of the sea kelp rotting on the beach she normally despised. But if it hadn\u2019t blanketed the rock where Hunter had fallen, he probably wouldn\u2019t have survived. Where Yoloff and his brother had fallen, the tide had cleaned the rocks, leaving them bare and deadly. The police had eventually found Andreas\u2019s body on a different beach, thank god.</p><p>She poked around the tree roots of a massive pine, the water and unusually high winds having washed away a ton of soil, the snow long since melted away and something had drawn her attention. Metal? Something shining in the pale light of the moon.</p><p>The gold!</p><p>Footsteps approached, crunching on the fallen leaves and she looked up to see him\u2014Devlyn. Their mutual great-grandfather, Seth Greystoke, was known in these parts as the gray devil wolf, and Devlyn had taken after him. Right now, he looked fearsome enough to hold the title. A strap of leather tied back his coffee-colored, shoulder-length hair, his equally dark brown eyes studying her, no hint of a smile on his stern face, as rugged as Hunter\u2019s, and he had the same kind of sturdy jaw. Tall and just as broad-shouldered, his unyielding posture gave her the impression he was a commanding alpha, not one to disobey.</p><p>His eyes raked over her and his gaze focused on her hair, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. But then the scowl returned. \u201cIt appears I\u2019m too late to take you under my wing, dear cousin.\u201d His words were tight and terse.</p><p>She stood and brushed the dirt off her hands, faced him, her chin tilted up, although to look him in the eye, she had to anyway. \u201cI\u2019m Hunter\u2019s mate,\u201d she declared to make it very clear she had no intention of leaving him. Not that she guessed she could, according to what Hunter had said about their kind.</p><p>\u201cIn our way, I\u2019d be compelled to deal with Hunter, wolf to wolf, for taking you without receiving my permission when he knew damn well I\u2019d ordered him to keep his hands off you.\u201d</p><p>The thought anyone would have ordered that of Hunter made her smile inwardly, but outwardly with Devlyn, she steeled her expression. \u201cI\u2019m sure Hunter took your order under consideration, but my life was in peril and you weren\u2019t here to protect me.\u201d</p><p>Devlyn bowed his head slightly. \u201cIn truth, I didn\u2019t believe either Hunter\u2014after what Leidolf told me about him\u2014or you, would mind me. And now Hunter tells me you\u2019ve turned your brother?\u201d He raised a brow, his look still feral. He tsked. \u201cI don\u2019t envy the task Hunter has cut out for him. But Bella is dying to meet you when she can travel. With triplets on the way, she\u2019s confined to her greenhouse and home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before Tessa could respond, Devlyn stalked toward her and hugged her soundly. \u201cYou and Michael are my cousins. If you ever need me or my pack for anything, we\u2019re family and you only have to call. Come see us. You\u2019re welcome anytime.\u201d</p><p>Family. The sound was like the caress of the waves stroking the beach, comforting, encompassing. First, Hunter and his family, and now Devlyn. \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to visit with Bella and the rest of your pack.\u201d</p><p>Even though she hadn\u2019t been sure that she could fit in with the world of werewolves and their ilk, as long as her brother was along for the ride, and Hunter was her mate, she was one happy lupus garou. She glanced at the kitchen window and saw Hunter watching her, protective as ever. She guessed he and Devlyn had made tentative amends, but she could tell Devlyn wasn\u2019t totally satisfied.</p> <p>Hunter kept an eye on Devlyn through the kitchen window, not liking that he\u2019d hugged Tessa in a warm embrace, even if they were cousins. The word \u201cdistant,\u201d came to mind. Very distant. And his own mate was a redhead... so, Hunter just didn\u2019t care for it one bit.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Meara. Change into the wolf so I can paint you,\u201d Michael said, following her into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHunter,\u201d Meara said, waving a magazine, \u201cUncle Basil advertised in this and said that\u2019s where he gets most of the reservations for the cabins. There\u2019s nothing in the advertisement encouraging alpha males to come here. I mean, there\u2019s no indication that they\u2019ll find me here. Hunter, are you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>Hunter continued to watch Devlyn as he spoke further to Tessa. He\u2019d expected Devlyn to be madder about him taking Tessa for his mate without first getting permission. But Devlyn had revealed how he\u2019d gone after Bella, the alpha leader\u2019s chosen mate, and for the most part, understood Hunter\u2019s feelings. Although an undercurrent of misgiving was still evident.</p><p>\u201cWas he very mad?\u201d Meara asked Hunter.</p> <p>\u201cDevlyn? No. Everything is as it should be.\u201d As long as Hunter had Tessa, nothing else mattered.</p><p>\u201cNot until you find me a mate, dear brother.\u201d She shoved the magazine at his chest. \u201cFix the ad or else I will. And you never know what I might offer.\u201d</p><p>Michael said, \u201cMeara, just shapeshift for a little while. Please? An hour or two? I\u2019ve never seen a wolf who\u2019s as beautiful as you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cMichael, give it a rest. I\u2019ve got better things to do than pose for a painting for several hours. Take a picture of me the next time I shapeshift and paint that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p><p>Ashton, Rourke, and Cara entered the living room and Michael whipped around, targeting them. \u201cWill you change into wolves so I can paint you? Just think, immortalized forever and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Cara,\u201d Ashton said. \u201cMy father\u2019s home is mine now. I need to take care of some business there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Cara asked him, her hand stroking his arm.</p><p>\u201cLike it\u2019s all so unreal. I guess deep down I suspected Dad knew I was seeing Bethany, but I didn\u2019t realize how much he hated her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat day when you ran after Hunter and Rourke and left us alone\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI had to know if they\u2019d discover who the murderer was. I felt terrible I left you, Tessa, and Meara to fend for yourselves, but I had to know.\u201c He glanced at Michael and raised his brows. \u201cBring your paints.\u201d</p><p>Michael grinned from ear to ear. \u201cYou bet.\u201d He hurried off to the office.</p><p>\u201cWatch them, Cara,\u201d Hunter warned.</p><p>Hell, having so many new lupus garous under several different roofs... He shook his head. Yet, with Ashton\u2019s father\u2019s arrest, Ashton had finally become more of a man. The notion of being a Navy SEAL was forgotten though. Cara liked his long blond hair way too much, but he was looking into becoming a police officer. And Cara seemed to love him all the more.</p> <p>Rourke joined Hunter and Meara as the others left the house. \u201cI\u2019ve got to run by the newspaper office and leave off some reports. We\u2019re taking Devlyn to the airport, right, Meara?\u201d</p><p>Meara nodded. \u201cHe says four of his male cousins are unmated and might like to vacation here.\u201d She cast Hunter an interested look.</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>She stood straighter and folded her arms. \u201cHe said they manage his affairs when he\u2019s away. Although, Tanner, the one he mentioned most, prefers redheads.\u201d</p><p>Hunter took his eyes off Devlyn. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming here.\u201d</p><p>Meara gave him a devilish smirk. \u201cUncle Basil called and said he\u2019d heard about our bad storms, but couldn\u2019t get through. He wanted to know if you took care of Tessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliminated the threat. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. To her. He figured once the two of you met, you\u2019d keep her safe. Not like he could.\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head. \u201cUncle Basil could have been less cryptic.\u201d He yanked open the back door and headed for Tessa and Devlyn.</p><p>Devlyn stepped back, a knowing look on his face, acknowledging the possessive alpha male who wants another to stay clear, no matter the familial connection.</p><p>\u201cI found the gold,\u201d Tessa said, her face beaming, her green eyes sparkling like crystal gems. \u201cBut the greatest treasure of all is finding family and becoming your mate.\u201d She reached to take Hunter into her arms, but he moved to do so first.</p><p>And with one fell swoop, he lifted her in his arms and headed back to the house. \u201cMeara says your flight leaves soon,\u201d Hunter said over his shoulder to a bemused Devlyn. \u201cBetter not miss it. And by the way, if your cousins are alphas, they\u2019re welcome to stay at our resort. All except for Tanner.\u201d</p><p>A small smile brightened Devlyn\u2019s face, and he even managed a dark chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhy not Tanner?\u201d Tessa asked.</p><p>\u201cHe likes redheads.\u201d</p><p>Tessa said her good-byes to Devlyn, although Hunter hovered nearby, menacingly threatening. But once everyone was gone, the house was nice and quiet\u2014time to show Tessa how important she was to Hunter.</p><p>She headed for the heater and turned it on. No response.</p><p>She rubbed her arms while Hunter flipped on a light switch. \u201cElectricity\u2019s working.\u201d He opened the closet and checked the circuit breaker. \u201cCircuit breaker\u2019s tripped.\u201d He flipped it back, but as soon as Tessa tried the heater again, it tripped the circuit breaker. Hunter growled. \u201cThe brothers Grimm fixed it, right? So much for their being electricians.\u201d Hunter lifted Tessa into his arms and stalked toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cShoot, Hunter, at this rate you\u2019ll never get me out of those pajamas\u2014not until spring at least.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle was deep and dark and silkily seductive. \u201cIn your dreams, sweet Tessa. In your dreams.\u201d</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
