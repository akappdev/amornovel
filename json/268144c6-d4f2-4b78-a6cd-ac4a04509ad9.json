Pain swept from his body like a rolling wave, numbness swallowing him whole. Everything blurred, sights and sounds distorted, as reality twisted and the world around him faded away.</p><p>And then there was nothing.</p> <p>No bright lights. No gentle voices. No angelic presence. Only blackness. He heard nothing, he saw nothing, and he felt nothing. After everything Corrado had done in his life, he had expected hellfire and brimstone.</p><p>He was a bit disappointed, to say the least.</p><p>A few minutes later, at exactly midnight, Corrado was violently shocked back to life. His heart beat once again as oxygen saturated his body, but his newfound peace was instantly destroyed: The moment they brought him back into the world, ripping him from the darkness of afterlife, he was transported to a time he had long ago wished to forget.</p><p>It was a decade earlier but only a few feet away from the small, dingy hospital room he now lay in, soiled with blood, sweat, and bitter tears. The room from ten years before had been filled with the same feeling\u2014heartbreak and misery, the harsh stench of imminent death thick in the air.</p><p>Corrado stood quietly in the doorway that warm October day, his eyes fixed inside the sterile room. Carmine DeMarco had always been slightly small for his age, but he seemed so minuscule in the large hospital bed. Tubes and wires ran from his frail body to various machines surrounding him, their humming and beeping not enough to drown out the strangled voice in the corner.</p> <p>Vincent DeMarco sat near his son, rocking and frantically muttering to himself. Corrado had never seen him so out of control before, agitated and deranged almost like a feral animal. His sanity was slipping, his hair a dirty mess and his shirt soiled with blood. Vincent\u2019s wife\u2019s blood, to be precise . . . blood that had been spilled less than twenty-four hours before.</p><p>The sight of it sickened Corrado. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d seen Maura\u2019s blood, but it would certainly be the last. She was dead and never coming back, but Vincent was clearly struggling to accept the truth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s can\u2019t be gone.\u201d The words caught in his throat. \u201cThis is my fault.\u201d</p><p>Corrado wanted to tell him to stop being absurd, but it would be a waste of breath. He couldn\u2019t comfort him. No words would take his pain away. And, truthfully, Corrado couldn\u2019t imagine the anguish his brother-in-law felt. He didn\u2019t fear death, didn\u2019t fear jail or eternal damnation, but one thing he couldn\u2019t fathom was losing Celia. He\u2019d vowed to honor her, to cherish her, to protect her . . .</p><p>It was no wonder Vincent was so quick to take the blame. He had failed at that\u2014he had failed to protect Maura.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Vincent repeated. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, and it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p> <p>Sighing, Corrado glanced back at his nephew. Carmine had been found near death behind Tarullo\u2019s Pizzeria. They didn\u2019t know what had happened yet, but one thing was clear: whoever ambushed them intended for the boy to die, too.</p><p>That fact made Corrado feel even sicker. He had never been particularly fond of children, with their needy ways and grubby little hands, but one thing he treasured was innocence. He envied it. He had murdered many men during his years with La Cosa Nostra, but he prided himself on never killing anyone he felt didn\u2019t deserve his wrath.</p><p>And staring at his nephew, so helpless and vulnerable, Corrado couldn\u2019t imagine what would possess someone to harm him. It was unheard of. Some things even the wickedest of men didn\u2019t tolerate, and killing a kid in cold blood was one of those things.</p><p>Things were different now, though. As much as it infuriated him, times were changing, and he wondered what that meant for Carmine. At only eight years old, he had been thrown headfirst into the lifestyle. When he woke up\u2014if he did\u2014his world wouldn\u2019t be the same. Whether Carmine liked it or not, he couldn\u2019t escape the life. Not after this. He was now a part of it, and Corrado knew he would spend the rest of his life trying to make sense of the chaos.</p><p>Hatred brewed in Corrado\u2019s gut, hot like molten lava. The longer he stood there, listening to the babble of a devastated man, the angrier he grew. All he could think about was getting revenge on the people who had hurt them. Not only did his vow to the organization demand it\u2014an eye for an eye\u2014but so did his weary heart.</p><p>Corrado\u2019s heart, a decade later miraculously holding steady on the cardiac monitor, grew stronger every passing day. He would survive the shoot-out in the Chicago warehouse. The Kevlar Killer would live to see another day.</p><p>On December 1, after being comatose for six weeks, Corrado Alphonse Moretti opened his eyes.</p><p>2</p> <p>The black Mazda RX-8 sped along the worn gravel road, twisting and turning as it penetrated deeper into the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Haven clutched the passenger seat as the car haphazardly weaved through the dense forest.</p><p>\u201cAre we lost?\u201d she asked hesitantly as she stared at her boyfriend. Carmine was slouched in the driver\u2019s seat, fiddling with the radio. Sunglasses shielded his eyes from her, so she couldn\u2019t tell if he was paying any attention to the road.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced out the windshield, squinting from the early morning sunshine. Things looked the same in every direction\u2014nothing but endless trees surrounding them. How could he know? \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Stubborn. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>She started to grow frustrated when he jerked the wheel to the left, nearly skidding off the narrow road. Her seatbelt locked in place, tightly confining her in the seat, as she inhaled sharply. Before she could let out the scream that bubbled up in her chest, Carmine pulled beside a fence along the road and cut the engine, turning to her with a satisfied smile. \u201cSee, not lost.\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head and surveyed the area. At first it appeared to be nothing unusual, a small gap in the trees with a cabin set a few yards away, until she spotted the faded white sign in the distance. LANDELL CHRISTMAS TREE FARM, it said in green hand-painted letters. Excitement stirred inside of her, but it was quickly crushed when she read on: OPEN NOVEMBER 22 TO DECEMBER 22.</p><p>Although it felt as if time had stopped for the two of them, the calendar told a different story. It was December 23 already, a month since they had returned to the small North Carolina town of Durante in an attempt to get back to their lives . . . in an attempt to regain a bit of normalcy and piece together their relationship. Dealing with the fallout of her kidnapping had been a struggle, but they took it day by day . . . minute by minute . . . second by second.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re closed, Carmine,\u201d she said, frowning as they got out of the car. She shivered and wrapped her coat tighter around her to ward off the cold. \u201cYesterday was the last day.\u201d</p><p>Carmine opened the trunk and pulled out an ax, slinging it over his shoulder. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She watched, mouth agape, as he climbed the wooden rail fence surrounding the property and leaped to the other side. \u201cIsn\u2019t that breaking and entering?\u201d</p><p>He held his free hand out to help her over. \u201cMore like trespassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s a misdemeanor,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other\u2019s a felony.\u201d</p><p>Haven sighed and started to respond, but his look pleaded with her not to argue. Hesitantly, she conceded and took his hand. Carmine helped her across the fence, lacing their fingers together and squeezing gently.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s Christmas, and this is what Christmas is all about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrespassing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, picking out trees and decorating them with colored balls and other frilly shit. It\u2019s about mistletoe and presents and lights and stars and family and eggnog. A lot of fucking eggnog, but without the egg and the nog and the other shit they put in with the alcohol. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the meaning of Christmas is . . . rum?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought it had something to do with religion.\u201d</p><p>Carmine slid his eyes to her. \u201cTechnicalities, tesoro. Just technicalities.\u201d</p><p>Together, they walked through the tree farm. Haven would occasionally stop and point one out, but each time Carmine seemed to find some fault with it. Too short or too tall, too thick or too thin, too many branches or not enough needles. He disregarded them because of their color, refused trees because of their shape, and simply scoffed when she suggested they look at the pile of leftover precut evergreens.</p><p>\u201cHow about this one?\u201d she asked after a while, stopping in front of a tree a few inches taller than her. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>Carmine hardly even looked. \u201cIt\u2019s too bare.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s brow furrowed, unsure as to what he was talking about. The branches appeared full to her. \u201cSo finicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDo you see any others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d She glanced around, randomly motioning toward another tree a few feet away. \u201cWhat about that one?\u201d</p><p>Carmine scanned it. She awaited his complaint, sure he would find a flaw in it, but he smirked instead. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why? Don\u2019t you like it?\u201d</p><p>Haven shrugged. Every single one of them looked the same to her\u2014just like the hundreds of others they had passed along the road on the way. \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>Letting go of her hand, Carmine studied the tree, deciding how to go about taking it down. Haven watched him for a moment, the scene surreal, and burst into laughter when he took his first swing. It barely even sliced the thick bark.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s groaned. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to take you all day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should\u2019ve just picked one that was already chopped down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because it\u2019s the easy way doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best way. Sometimes it\u2019s better to put in the work.\u201d</p><p>Haven thought coming to a tree farm was cheating itself, considering they could have taken one of the small ones from the backyard, but she thought better of pointing that out. His frustration mounted with each swing of the ax, and she didn\u2019t want to make it any worse.</p><p>He whacked the trunk repeatedly, the blade eventually cutting through the wood. Despite the cold temperatures, by the time the tree tilted Carmine was huffing and drenched with sweat. It gathered along his forehead, ran down the side of his face, and dripped from his chiseled jaw. Haven watched him struggle in silence, a familiar pang of guilt deep down inside of her gut. It was always subtly there, lurking, violently striking when she least expected it to, like a startled viper fighting for its life. It viciously gnawed at her, poisoning her insides and conjuring up intense feelings of shame when she was reminded of what he had done.</p><p>This boy\u2014this stubborn, selfless, stupid boy\u2014had given himself to the Mafia. He had handed control of his future over to the men they hated most in exchange for her life. For her safety. And he had done it so easily, so quickly, like he didn\u2019t have to think about it at all . . . like sacrificing for her came just as naturally as breathing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The act had left him fractured, and Haven was still trying to come to grips with the fact that it might be a long time before he was whole again. And as grateful as she was to be alive, as blessed as she felt to be standing there, picking out a Christmas tree with the boy she loved, she was also angry. Not at him\u2014not anymore. That anger had been unfounded. She was mad at herself now, and at the universe, because no matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t help Carmine. She was helpless to his plight. There was no way for her to end his torment. No way for her to save him.</p><p>Once again in her life, Haven felt powerless.</p><p>So she stood by silently, continuing to watch, terrified of looking him in the eyes one day and seeing regret. Frightened that someday, he would turn to her and she would see her worst fear playing out in his face: that she hadn\u2019t been worth it.</p><p>Eventually, the evergreen toppled in Haven\u2019s direction. She jumped out of the way at the last second, the tree nearly hitting her.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, tesoro.\u201d Carmine dropped the ax and pulled his black long-sleeved shirt up, exposing his toned stomach as he wiped the sweat from his brow. \u201cThat was a lot harder than I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>He grinned proudly as he lugged the tree toward the car. She picked up his ax, surprised by how heavy it was, and followed behind. He threw the tree over the fence like it was no trouble at all and helped her to the other side.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTie it to the car and take it home,\u201d he replied, taking the ax from her. He tossed it in the trunk and pulled out a coil of rope, holding it up to show her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked as Carmine grabbed the tree and shoved it on top of the car. The branches scraped against the shiny black paint. She couldn\u2019t imagine they would get it home without causing some damage.</p> <p>He sighed exasperatedly. \u201cOf course I\u2019m sure, Haven. What is it with you and that damn question today? Don\u2019t you trust me anymore?\u201d</p><p>She was taken aback by his question. She hadn\u2019t realized she had been repeating it. \u201cOf course I trust you! I was just . . . double checking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess questioning me is always better than saying okay,\u201d he replied, positioning the tree and tying it down. It hung over all sides of the small vehicle, blocking half of the front windshield and most of the back. \u201cI still mean everything I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine tugged on the evergreen, making sure it was secure. Satisfied with the job he had done, he motioned for Haven to get in the car, but she didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s theft?\u201d she asked. \u201cA misdemeanor or a felony?\u201d</p> <p>Carmine stared at her for a moment before the question sunk in. Instead of answering, he pulled out his wallet and counted out some money. He hopped the fence and jogged over to the building, slipping the cash under the door for the tree they had cut down.</p><p>\u201cTheft?\u201d he asked when he returned, smiling sheepishly. \u201cWhat made you think we were stealing something today?\u201d</p><p>Haven had been right.</p><p>Tiny scratches sprinkled the roof of the car, a more noticeable jagged gash down the center. Carmine ran his pointer finger along it. \u201cFucking tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it easily fixed?\u201d Haven asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cI just hate seeing my baby abused. We should\u2019ve taken my dad\u2019s Mercedes. The scratches would match the mark you put on his side mirror.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled at the memory of her first driving lesson. \u201cI prefer riding in yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Carmine asked, looking at her with genuine curiosity. \u201cYou like the Mazda?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice. Feels warm and familiar. Besides, I\u2019ve never been thrown in the trunk of yours.\u201d</p><p>Carmine blinked rapidly, gaping at her, before turning without a word to where the tree lay in the front yard. He grabbed it by the trunk and dragged it toward the house, leaving a trail of fresh pine needles behind him.</p><p>The next few hours were a flurry of activity. Vincent joined them in the family room with a tree stand and a box of decorations, and the rest of the family started showing up later in the day. They had just gotten the tree up straight and the lights strung on it when Carmine\u2019s brother, Dominic, burst through the front door, home for winter break from Notre Dame. He threw his bags down in the foyer and rushed right for them, tackling Carmine to the hard wood floor. He playfully ruffled his hair before scooping Haven up in a hug. \u201cTwinkle Toes!\u201d He swung her around in a circle. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just saw her a month ago,\u201d Carmine grumbled, standing back up. Pain shot down his spine as he stretched, and he cringed. \u201cAnd hello to you too, motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughed, setting Haven on her feet before shoving his brother. Carmine stumbled again, falling into the tree and knocking it crooked. \u201cI missed you, too, bro. Glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rolled his eyes, feigning annoyance at his brother\u2019s antics, but a small involuntary smile tugged at his lips. He couldn\u2019t deny he missed the lightheartedness that usually accompanied Dominic\u2019s presence. Carmine always envied that\u2014his brother\u2019s ability to ease any situation. They could have certainly used it the past month as everyone tiptoed around, walking on eggshells and ignoring reality, in fear of accidently hitting the red button that set off a nuclear disaster.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s future, Haven\u2019s past, Vincent\u2019s charges, Corrado\u2019s health . . . the words Carmine longed to say were always there, on the tip of his tongue, but they never made it through the meaningless chatter. They were always talking, but no one ever fucking said anything.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t stay that way, though, and Carmine knew it. As long as the rest of the family was around, their bubble invaded, the issues wouldn\u2019t be ignored. They were about to be thrust front and center, whether they liked it or not.</p><p>Half filled with relief, the other half of Carmine was terrified. Rocking the boat opened up the risk of it capsizing, and if that happened, he couldn\u2019t guarantee that someone wouldn\u2019t drown the second they hit the water.</p><p>He just hoped it wouldn\u2019t be him and Haven.</p><p>Celia and Corrado weren\u2019t long behind Dominic. Carmine had placed the last ornament on the tree when there was a light tap on the front door. Before anyone could react, it opened and Celia\u2019s voice rang through the house. \u201cKnock, knock!\u201d</p><p>They, too, dropped their bags right inside the foyer. Celia swiftly made her way into the family room, hugging the boys and Haven before focusing on her brother. Her voice was loud and cheerful, love pouring from her words as she greeted each one of them. Corrado, on the other hand, only made it as far as the doorway, where he watched them interact in stone cold silence.</p><p>Carmine eyed him warily. He hadn\u2019t seen Corrado since the warehouse, when he watched him collapse in a pool of blood. He had never felt particularly close to his uncle, fearing him more than genuinely caring for him, but something else existed now. Something bigger. Something stronger. There was a deeper respect, almost an admiration.</p><p>For the first time in his life, Carmine felt like he could relate to the man.</p><p>Corrado, however, showed no sign of it being mutual. His continued muteness, even after being greeted by Vincent, relayed a deeper message than any words could say. He remained motionless and aloof, as if he had nothing to say to any of them. His skin was paler than usual, his body frail to the point he was almost skeletal, but there was still darkness in his features that seemed to have grown harsher during the weeks.</p><p>If anything, he was more terrifying.</p><p>Corrado\u2019s eyes found Carmine\u2019s after a moment, so dark they were nearly black, with not a single flicker of emotion registering. It sent an uncomfortable chill down Carmine\u2019s spine, the affection he had started to feel quickly replaced once more with apprehension. Carmine wondered if Corrado could sense it too, because he turned away. He limped slightly as he grabbed their bags again and disappeared upstairs without having uttered a single word.</p><p>Carmine had no idea what to say, and Vincent and Haven appeared just as speechless, but as expected, Dominic let nothing slip by. \u201cDamn, we can\u2019t even get a hello?\u201d</p><p>Celia smiled sadly. \u201cDon\u2019t take it personally. He\u2019s still getting his bearings. Give him some time and he\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>From the look on Vincent\u2019s face, Carmine suspected his father didn\u2019t believe that.</p><p>3</p><p>The sun had started to set when they settled into the family room that evening to watch a movie. Long shadows stretched across the floor, accented by the colored lights twinkling from the tree. Dominic ordered Chinese food before calling his girlfriend, Tess, to come over. She, too, was in town from Notre Dame and arrived within a matter of minutes, squeezing beside Dominic in a chair with a bowl of popcorn in her lap. Haven and Carmine lounged on the couch, sitting so close their arms touched. Celia had excused herself to join her husband, while Vincent claimed to have some work to do upstairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Dr. DeMarco doing?\u201d Haven asked quietly, leaning closer to Carmine. \u201cHe\u2019s never around anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think he\u2019s up to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew,\u201d he said. \u201cBut desperate times call for desperate measures, so whatever it is has gotta be drastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think there\u2019s trouble?\u201d she asked, a tinge of panic in her voice.</p><p>He laughed dryly. \u201cWhen isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>A string of loud knocks vibrated the front door. They all glanced around at one another, nobody making a move to answer it. Carmine stood, shaking his head. \u201cDon\u2019t everyone get up at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve gotten it,\u201d Haven said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have any money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, DeMarco,\u201d Tess said, tossing a piece of popcorn across the room at him. \u201cAt least you\u2019re good for something.\u201d</p><p>He flashed his middle finger at her.</p><p>Tess scrunched up her nose. \u201cYou can shove that finger up your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine headed for the foyer and pulled out his wallet to sort through his cash. The person at the door banged impatiently, loud and forceful. \u201cChrist, I\u2019m coming. Who do you think you are, pounding like the fucking\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He froze abruptly when he opened the door, his gaze falling on a shiny gold badge held up at eye level. \u201cPolice,\u201d the officer said stoically.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s response was immediate. \u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I want,\u201d the officer said with a sharp laugh, amused by Carmine\u2019s reaction. \u201cI\u2019m Detective Jack Baranski. Is there a girl named Haven here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Carmine asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to her about a boy named Nicholas Barlow.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s muscles immediately seized up, his heart pounding aggressively as a brutal vision of his former friend forced its way to the front of his mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The loud bang of a gunshot ringing out in the distance.

He had to have heard wrong. Vincent DeMarco would never willingly invite law enforcement into his home. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Vincent descended the last few steps into the foyer. \u201cLet him ask his questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Carmine spat. He was about to ask his father if he had lost his mind when his brother interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cWhere the hell\u2019s the food? I\u2019m starving here,\u201d Dominic hollered, stepping out of the great room and glancing toward the front door. His eyes went wide when he saw the police officer. \u201cWhoa, definitely not the delivery guy! What did you do now, bro?\u201d</p><p>Carmine groaned. Why did he have to assume it was him?</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t here for Carmine,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cHe just has a few questions for Haven, and then he\u2019ll be on his way.\u201d</p><p>Begrudgingly, Carmine moved aside so Vincent could lead the detective into the family room. Dominic excused himself, bolting upstairs and dragging Tess along with him. Carmine went to close the door when a car pulled up, the Chinese delivery guy parking behind the unmarked police cruiser. Carmine shoved some money at the guy, then snatched the food and slammed the door, dropping their dinner off in the kitchen before hurrying to the family room.</p><p>Carmine sat on the arm of the couch beside Haven, not wanting to be far from her, as the man cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to speak to her alone, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately for you, I do mind,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI invited you in, but I won\u2019t be put out by you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d Detective Baranski pulled a small notebook from his pocket and flipped it open. \u201cHaven, do you know Nicholas Barlow?\u201d</p><p>Haven picked at her fingernails as she started stammering. \u201cYes. Well, I know who he is, but I didn\u2019t really know him that well. Or, I mean, I don\u2019t . . . not didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her panicked eyes darted toward Carmine briefly before settling on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you saw him?\u201d Detective Baranski asked.</p><p>\u201cThe end of September,\u201d she said. \u201cCarmine had a football game that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did anything out of the ordinary happen at the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kicked his ass,\u201d Carmine chimed in, wanting to spare her from having to recount it. \u201cThat\u2019s not really out of the ordinary, though. We fought all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, what happened after the fight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe ran off,\u201d Carmine said, \u201cjust like every other time we fought.\u201d</p><p>The officer eyed Carmine suspiciously. \u201cWas that the last time you saw him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I saw him a week after that,\u201d Carmine admitted. \u201cI was taking the SAT at the high school when he showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor shits and giggles. Why does anyone take the SATs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you why you took the test,\u201d Detective Baranski said impatiently. \u201cI\u2019m asking why he was there.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged, knowing what he meant the first time but not wanting to answer that question.</p><p>\u201cDid anything happen then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what happened every other time the two of us got together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother fight.\u201d The officer nodded as if it were no surprise. \u201cAnd the last time you saw him, Haven, was at the football game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hesitated before shaking her head. \u201cWell, no. I saw him later that night at Aurora Lake. We talked and then I went home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was the last time you saw him?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes quickly scanned the room as Vincent nodded, the movement so slight Carmine barely caught it. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. Lying.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what might\u2019ve happened to him?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate this time. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tensing, Carmine looked at her incredulously. What the fuck?</p><p>\u201cThe night at the lake, he said there was nothing left here for him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe talked about leaving, just disappearing, to start over somewhere where nobody knew him. I thought he was venting, but I wonder if that\u2019s what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d The officer closed his notebook and returned it to his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s my fault,\u201d she continued. \u201cMaybe I could\u2019ve stopped him, or helped him. Maybe then he wouldn\u2019t be . . . gone.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s chest tightened with guilt at her words.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself for decisions other people make, miss,\u201d Officer Baranski said, standing to leave. \u201cI appreciate your time. If you think of anything else that might help us find Nicholas, give me a call.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a business card and Haven gingerly took it from him. Vincent showed the officer out and Haven sat still for a moment before crumpling the officer\u2019s card up in a tight fist.</p><p>The tension in the room mounted. Carmine couldn\u2019t stand the silence and turned to her as soon as the front door closed. \u201cYou really think this is your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he interrupted, not giving her a chance to explain. \u201cYou didn\u2019t cause any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? All of it was me, Carmine, all because I\u2019m some Princi\u2014whatever! A stinking princess! Your mother and Nicholas died, Corrado got hurt, and you gave your life away like it didn\u2019t even matter! What\u2019s next? How much more is going to happen because of me?\u201d</p><p>Carmine knew it then, seeing the tears flooding her sorrowful eyes, tears she had been holding back for weeks. The button had been pushed. The nuclear bomb had been ignited. Their fragile bubble of contentment was about to fucking explode.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you take that burden,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare feel guilty for what I did. If you wanna blame anyone for it, blame me. I did it because I wanted to, not because I had to. I did it because I love you, Haven, and you didn\u2019t force me to fucking love you. I did that shit all on my own. And I don\u2019t regret any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? You\u2019re finally safe. You\u2019re finally free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Haven shook her head with frustration. \u201cAm I safe? Am I free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d His brow furrowed. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, tears running down her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this,\u201d he said, throwing up his hands in exasperation. \u201cIt means you can do anything you want\u2014go where you wanna go, be what you wanna be, do what you wanna do. Fuck, be who you wanna be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>The question caught Carmine off guard. \u201cUh . . .\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracked from distress. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Carmine? How can I ever be free if you aren\u2019t? How can I do those things if you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think . . .\u201d A ringing cell phone in Carmine\u2019s pocket shattered his train of thought. He trailed off, pulling it out, and didn\u2019t have to look at the screen to know it was Salvatore. Haven stood up without a word and started out of the room, but he called after her. \u201cWait, Haven. We need to talk about this so just . . . wait, okay? This will only take a minute.\u201d</p><p>She stopped near the foyer and turned to him, tears still falling from her eyes. She said nothing.</p><p>His phone continued to ring in his hand and he groaned, knowing he needed to answer it. Taking a few steps over to the couch, Carmine sat down, his back to her. \u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you were going to take my call,\u201d Salvatore said.</p><p>\u201cOf course I was,\u201d he muttered, dropping his head and running his hand through his hair. He spotted the cop\u2019s business card in a ball on the floor and snatched it up, frowning. \u201cIt\u2019s just hectic here. I didn\u2019t hear my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, I\u2019m just calling to see how your holiday\u2019s going. I assume Corrado has arrived, but I can\u2019t get him to answer a phone, either.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed. A social call? \u201cYeah, he\u2019s here. I think he\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Sal said. \u201cHe\u2019s still recuperating, so I\u2019m sure he needs his rest. It hasn\u2019t been the same without him. It\u2019ll be wonderful to have both of you on the job after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>The color drained from Carmine\u2019s face. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrado didn\u2019t tell you yet?\u201d Sal asked. \u201cI\u2019ve requested he bring you back with him. I\u2019ve been more than accommodating with your, uh, situation, but it\u2019s time you build your life here. Chicago\u2019s your home now. It was always supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s only been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a month,\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left there for you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine knew there was no arguing with Salvatore. He had made his decision and nothing would change his mind. \u201cYeah, okay. Fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s settled,\u201d Sal said. \u201cI look forward to having you close by, Principe. Tell Corrado to call me when he wakes up. Buon Natale.\u201d</p><p>Carmine hung up and glanced out of the room, wondering how much Haven had heard, and frowned when he saw the deserted foyer.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t waited for him, after all.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>Vincent looked up from the papers on his desk, peering through his reading glasses at his son. Carmine strolled into the office, throwing himself down in the leather chair across from him. He slouched, his body language one of nonchalance, but Vincent could see the genuine concern in his eyes. \u201cYour uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s, uh . . . he\u2019s still recovering,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cHe\u2019s only been conscious for a few weeks. He shouldn\u2019t even be traveling yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will he be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard your aunt Celia. She said he\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carmine cut him off. \u201cI know what she said, but I\u2019m not asking her. I\u2019m asking you.\u201d</p><p>Vincent set the files down and leaned back in his chair. He removed his glasses, rubbing his tired eyes while his son quietly awaited a response. Carmine rolled a small ball of paper in his palm, tossing it from hand to hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, Corrado was clinically dead. The human body is resilient, but the brain is vulnerable. It\u2019s rare for someone to make a full recovery if they\u2019re down for more than three minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was Corrado down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>Carmine seemed speechless, his mouth open but no words coming out.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying he won\u2019t be fine,\u201d Vincent continued, not wanting to alarm his son, but he couldn\u2019t lie. He couldn\u2019t sugarcoat it. \u201cI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s too soon to tell. There\u2019s no way to say what type of long-term effects Corrado will endure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like brain damage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not just that.\u201d Vincent absentmindedly fumbled with the case file on his desk again. \u201cDeath has a way of changing people, son. When faced with our own mortality, we tend to start seeing the world differently. What once mattered may not be a priority anymore, and that\u2019s not always easy for others to accept. We rejoice when people are saved, when lives are spared, but sometimes you have to stop and think, At what cost? Are we just prolonging the inevitable? Are we intervening when we have no right? Are we tampering with fate? We want them to live, but we have to consider that maybe they\u2019re better off . . . not.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Vincent looked over at his son that he realized he had said too much. Carmine\u2019s eyes were wide yet guarded, his mouth once again agape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just rambling,\u201d Vincent said, backtracking. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted and stressed and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. Your uncle is going to be perfectly fine, Carmine. He defied medicine by even waking up, so there\u2019s no reason to believe he won\u2019t continue to do so. After all, according to the media, the man\u2019s made of Kevlar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cMom tried to keep us from it all, but Dom and I used to see the newspaper headlines in Chicago. Corrado Moretti, the Kevlar Killer . . . arrested dozens of times but never convicted for any of his crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlleged crimes,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI lost count on how many times he\u2019s walked away from things that should\u2019ve taken him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cSince he has a record of beating charges, the two of you will probably get off of this RICO shit. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice thought, but there\u2019s a problem with that theory,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThe prosecution filed to have our cases tried separately, so I think I\u2019m on my own.\u201d</p><p>Carmine started to respond, but a voice stopped him before he could even get two words out. Vincent stiffened as he glanced past his son, seeing Corrado in the doorway to the office.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be perfectly fine,\u201d Corrado said, his voice flat.</p> <p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Vincent asked.</p><p>Corrado nodded slightly. \u201cWe both will be.\u201d</p><p>Vincent would have said more had he not been alarmed by his brother-in-law\u2019s sudden presence. He had showered, his slightly curly hair still damp, his face smooth from a fresh shave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d Carmine muttered, standing up and bolting out of the room before Vincent could wish him a good night. Corrado stood in place for a moment before strolling into the office, sitting down in the chair Carmine had just vacated. He said nothing, but his eyes stared into Vincent intently.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d Vincent asked.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think you\u2019re right about people changing,\u201d Corrado replied, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think you were talking about me.\u201d</p> <p>4</p><p>The shrill sound of a familiar ringing phone shattered Carmine\u2019s light slumber. He forced his eyes open, slapping beside the bed to find the offending object. He cursed as he accidentally knocked it off the stand, sending it crashing to the bedroom floor.</p><p>\u201cTurn it off,\u201d Haven mumbled, not even opening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m trying,\u201d he said, snatching his phone off the floor. He groaned as he answered it. Salvatore. Again. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like to answer promptly, do you?\u201d Salvatore asked with a hard edge to his voice. Definitely not a social call this time.</p><p>He glanced at the clock, seeing it was a few minutes past four in the morning. Haven had been asleep when he made it upstairs . . . or pretending to be asleep, more likely. He could still feel the tension between them, the conversation she was obviously avoiding having with him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir,\u201d he said, covering his burning eyes with his forearm as he lay back down. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of fucking early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of excuses, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Sal asked. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t have Corrado call me like I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was asleep, and I, well . . .\u201d He had forgotten. \u201cI fell asleep, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re awake now, because you need to pick up a package in Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Carmine asked incredulously. Charlotte was two hours away, and it was Christmas Eve. The last thing he wanted to do was leave Haven alone all day.</p><p>He laughed bitterly and Carmine clenched his free hand into a fist. The sound grated on his nerves. \u201cYes, now.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore rattled off an address. Carmine jumped out of bed and rooted through his desk for something to write with, grabbing a cheap BIC pen with a chewed-up cap. He spotted one of Haven\u2019s notebooks and grabbed it, flipping it open to the back and scribbling down the address as Sal hung up.</p><p>\u201cJust great,\u201d he muttered, staggering over to the closet. \u201cJust what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Haven asked.</p><p>He glanced at her, seeing her eyes were open now. She watched him with confusion, and he spouted off the first thing that came to his mind. \u201cI need to finish Christmas shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she asked with disbelief. \u201cIs anything even open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will be by the time I get there,\u201d he said, hoping she wouldn\u2019t press him about it. He dressed and kissed her quickly, running his hand across her cheek as he brushed some wayward hair out of her face. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>Haven mumbled incoherently, her eyes closing once again.</p><p>Carmine grabbed his things and the notebook, heading out of the house as quietly as he could, and climbed into the Mazda to start the trip to Charlotte. He had a hard time focusing on driving, his vision hazy from exhaustion, and ran off the road a few times. He cursed, agitated, and turned up the music while rolling down the windows, hoping the noise and cold air would keep him awake.</p><p>He arrived in Charlotte shortly after dawn and drove around for twenty minutes to find the address. It turned out to be a dingy hole-in-the-wall barbershop, the bricks crumbling and the barber pole barely hanging on to the ancient building.</p><p>Carmine grabbed the gun he kept tucked under the seat and stuck it in his waistband before getting out of the car. He headed toward the building and grabbed the door but it wouldn\u2019t budge, so he pressed the square black doorbell underneath the mailbox. A loud buzzer went off and he cringed at the obnoxious noise, hearing commotion inside before the door opened.</p><p>A light-skinned black man stood before him, a tattoo on his neck and his hair halfway braided. Carmine could see the gleam of gold teeth in his mouth, his neck and ears framed with diamonds. He didn\u2019t look to be someone Salvatore would ever do business with. He briefly wondered if he had the wrong address.</p><p>The man stepped to the side before Carmine could consider fleeing, motioning for him to come in.</p><p>The interior was just as raggedy as the outside, everything covered in wretched-smelling filth. Carmine surveyed it with disgust as the guy slammed the door behind them and staggered across the room. He reached into his pocket for a pack of cigarettes, sticking one in his mouth and another behind his ear before crumpling the empty pack and tossing it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cDeMarco\u2019s kid, right?\u201d the man asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like your daddy, though. You sure you\u2019re his? I think your mama might\u2019ve fucked around.\u201d</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Carmine\u2019s hands violently shook as he reached for his gun.</p><p>The guy caught on and put his hands up defensively. \u201cDamn, you might be his boy, after all. Neither of you can take a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about my mother,\u201d Carmine spat as the man turned his back to him and opened a cabinet.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d he muttered. \u201cTell me something . . . do you have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking deaf?\u201d he asked, turning back around. Carmine tensed when he saw him grab a Glock 22 from the cabinet and point it without hesitating. Carmine aimed his gun quickly, his heart racing wildly in fear as they locked in a showdown. The amusement had faded from the guy\u2019s expression, his eyes sparking with anger. \u201cI asked if you had a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Carmine said, trying to keep his composure, but the guy was clearly unstable. The thought that it could be a setup ran through Carmine\u2019s mind but he pushed it back, not wanting to consider that Salvatore would do that to him. Not now. Not like this. He hadn\u2019t done a damn thing to deserve any punishment.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d the guy asked. \u201cAnd don\u2019t lie to me. I can find out on my own, but I don\u2019t think you want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven,\u201d he said. \u201cHer name\u2019s Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The guy lowered his gun and grabbed a duffel bag from the cabinet. Carmine took it from him hesitantly, keeping his gun aimed just in case. \u201cYou have twelve hours to bring me my money. If it isn\u2019t here by seven tonight, at a minute after seven I\u2019m gonna be in my car and on the way to visit Haven to make her pay me for it. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever fucking touch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said do you understand?\u201d he snapped, raising his gun again.</p><p>Carmine took a step back on instinct. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now get out of my fucking shop before I shoot you for the hell of it.\u201d</p><p>Shoving open the door, Carmine bolted outside in haste, the duffel bag feeling like it weighed more than him. He tucked the gun back away as he sprinted to his car, fumbling with his keys and cursing as he got the door unlocked.</p><p>He heaved the duffel bag over to the passenger seat and sped off, wanting to get away from there. A few miles away, he glanced in the bag curiously and saw it was full of guns and ammunition. Slamming the breaks, stunned, he whipped the car into the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. He stared at the bag, wondering what he was supposed to do. He wasn\u2019t sure if Salvatore had told him, considering he hadn\u2019t paid attention, and he suddenly worried he was missing something.</p><p>Carmine grabbed his phone and scanned through the list of contacts, stopping at his father\u2019s name. He hit the call button and waited as it rang.</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d Vincent answered, sounding concerned. \u201cWhere are you? I saw your car was gone this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . I think I need some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Charlotte,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a call this morning to pick up something from some guy. He gave me this bag and said he wanted his money by tonight, but I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m supposed to do about any of it. What money?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve met Jay,\u201d Vincent said, sighing. \u201cJust pull some cash out of your account and pay him for it. We have a set arrangement, fifty grand each visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the damn bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a storage unit here in town, at the place beside the grocery store. I\u2019ll leave the key for it at the desk. Unit nineteen-B.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stood in front of the storage unit, the duffel bag the only thing inside. He stared at it for a moment, shaking his head, before slamming the metal door and putting the lock back on it.</p> <p>He pocketed the key and strolled next door to the grocery store for something to drink, the place empty except for the lone cashier. She barely looked at him, her nose stuck in a cheap gossip magazine as he tossed her some cash for a bottle of Cherry Coke and a Toblerone.</p><p>On the way back out, Carmine\u2019s footsteps faltered when his eyes fell upon the crinkled paper taped to the glass near the exit. He snatched it off, studying it as he strolled through the parking lot in the dark. The word MISSING was written along the top, ominously black and bold, while a familiar picture of Nicholas Barlow covered most of the page. He was wearing his favorite camouflage cargo pants in the shot, his baseball cap pulled down low.</p><p>Carmine could remember the day the photo had been taken. Straining his eyes, he could even faintly make himself out in the background. They had been out at Aurora Lake a mere few days before their friendship had fallen apart . . . before their lives took a dramatic turn. They had both ended up in the emergency room later that day after roughhousing\u2014Nicholas with a sprained ankle and Carmine with a gash in his eyebrow. It was the day Carmine had dared his best friend to sleep with the nurse at the hospital, Jen.</p><p>The only dare the boys had made that they never saw through, since Nicholas was dead now, and the nurse was, too.</p><p>The subtle glow from the streetlight illuminated Carmine\u2019s car in the back of the lot. Sunset had come and gone, the entire day fading away. He had missed Christmas Eve with his family.</p> <p>Climbing into his car, Carmine turned on the interior light to get a better look at the flyer. Guilt nagged him when he saw they were offering a reward, Haven\u2019s earlier words running through his mind. How much more is going to happen because of me? she had asked, but Carmine wondered exactly how much more hurt he would cause. How many more families would he ruin, how many more lives would he fuck up? He felt like a curse, devastating anyone who dared to get close to him.</p><p>He had gotten his best friend killed. Who would be next?</p><p>Sighing, he tossed the paper onto the passenger seat and grabbed Haven\u2019s notebook, hoping to put those thoughts out of his mind. After the day he had had, he just wanted to forget for a while. He glanced through the scribble, looking for a distraction, but the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach only grew as he took in Haven\u2019s frenzied words. She wrote a lot about the pain she had been through, the writing growing more frantic the further he got. There were dozens of sketches accompanying her words, some so vague he couldn\u2019t tell what they were, while others were so in depth it was like seeing it with his own eyes.</p><p>Turning to a page about halfway through, Carmine\u2019s name jumped out at him, and his eyes cautiously scanned the surrounding paragraph. Haven mused about what kind of future they would have together, disheartened by their situation. He read it all with anxious eyes, tensing when he came upon the very last sentence: What do you do when the thing you want most suddenly feels like it\u2019s beyond your fingertips?</p><p>As much as Carmine didn\u2019t want to let that get to him, her question stung. After giving her freedom, he had yanked it back away. He hadn\u2019t meant to, but she was right . . . as long as she was with him, she would never be in control of her life.</p><p>He flipped through a few more pages, barely able to pay attention to them, and was about to toss it aside when a drawing caught his eye. It was startlingly in depth, the man\u2019s features perfectly detailed. One side of his face was pristine, while the other half was severely disfigured. His skin appeared to be made of melting candle wax, drooping and dripping from his grotesque face. The word monster was scribbled along the page, the handwriting frantic and barely legible.</p> <p>It may not have been as horrifying had Carmine not recognized the man.</p><p>The house was silent when Carmine made it home, the notebook tucked in the crook of his arm. He headed upstairs, mentally exhausted from the day, and hesitated on the second floor when he saw the door to his father\u2019s office open. Carmine strolled over to it, curiously pausing in the doorway.</p><p>Vincent sat at his desk with his phone to his ear, unaware he was no longer alone. He impatiently drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair, periodically huffing as he listened to whomever was on the line.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d he said, his expression severe. \u201cI understand your situation, but you need to understand mine. I have a family to consider, and you may not care about them, but I do. This is my life we\u2019re talking about so don\u2019t patronize me! I don\u2019t need you to make this out to be something it isn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t appreciate being lied to. Find another way.\u201d</p><p>Another brief pause ensued, followed by a sharp, angry laugh from Vincent. \u201cThen count me out.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shifted position, caught off guard by the serious conversation. The movement drew his father\u2019s attention. Panic sparked in Vincent\u2019s eyes. He hung up without giving the person a chance to respond and eyed Carmine carefully, but he offered no explanation.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Carmine asked.</p><p>\u201cLawyer.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat were you doing, bribing your way out of trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like settling things before they tie the knot on my noose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d They may not have been close over the years, but Carmine didn\u2019t like the thought of losing his father.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s that bad, son,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cWe used to be able to talk our way out of anything, but our power has even less influence than our money these days.\u201d</p><p>Curious about his father\u2019s bitterness, Carmine took a seat without waiting to be invited. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>Vincent leaned back in his chair. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you regret getting involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . and no. I\u2019ve made plenty of mistakes, and those I do regret, but taking the oath for your mother . . . I can\u2019t regret that. I wish I wouldn\u2019t have had to, but I did. And I\u2019d do it again.\u201d Vincent paused. \u201cYou know, I was furious when I found out what you\u2019d done, and as much as I still hate it, I get it, son. It\u2019s genetic, I guess\u2014ingrained in your DNA. You would\u2019ve sacrificed for her eventually, someway, somehow. You are your mother\u2019s child, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m apparently yours, too.\u201d</p><p>Vincent smiled sympathetically. \u201cIs there a reason you asked? Are you regretting\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, Christ . . . I know it was necessary, but I feel like I fucked everything up by doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt that way, too,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI initiated to free your mother, and all I did was take her from one dangerous world to another. It was dressed up pretty and called another name, but it wasn\u2019t much different. Your mother never got a chance to live a life where no one knew her . . . where no one knew what she\u2019d been. She never got to invent herself.\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Vincent drummed his fingers again. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I wouldn\u2019t trade the years I had with your mother for anything, and I surely wouldn\u2019t give up you boys. You\u2019re the only thing I ever did right in life. But I\u2019ll never forgive myself for not giving her a chance. I know she loved me, and having a family made her happy, but I don\u2019t think she even realized she had another option. I did it all to give her choices, and then I never told her she had them. I can\u2019t help but wonder, all these years later, how different things would be had I let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom wouldn\u2019t have left you,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know any better,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the point, really. She never got to choose to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I feel like I fucked up,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI figured I could keep those parts of my life separate, do what I had to while still giving her everything she wanted, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible anymore. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do about it and I\u2019m running out of time, considering I\u2019m expected in Chicago after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Vincent said, reaching into a drawer and pulling out a gold key. He fiddled with it for a moment before pushing it across the desk to Carmine. \u201cThe key to the house in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Carmine carefully picked it up. \u201cWhy are you giving it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need somewhere to stay, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to argue, to give the key back, but he couldn\u2019t. It was true. He hadn\u2019t thought about what he would do once he got there. \u201cUh, yeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he replied. \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s Haven I\u2019m worried about. I grabbed this notebook of hers today, and I can tell you after reading it that she\u2019s a fucking mess.\u201d He flipped through pages haphazardly, shaking his head when he reached the drawing titled monster. Laughing bitterly, he held up the sketch for his father to see. \u201cLook at this shit.\u201d</p><p>The drumming of Vincent\u2019s fingers ceased instantly, his posture rigid as his expression went blank. Carmine\u2019s hair bristled at his father\u2019s posture. Vincent stared at the notebook intently, like he was memorizing the mangled face.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Vincent said after a moment. \u201cShe has nothing to fear from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but she calls him a monster, like he\u2019s the fucking Chupacabra. She\u2019s terrified, and that\u2019s the kind of people I\u2019ll have her around. Monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlo\u2019s a friend of ours.\u201d</p><p>Carmine scoffed. \u201cHe\u2019s no friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, son . . . he is. He\u2019s been in the organization for years. Salvatore initiated him right after your grandfather passed away.\u201d</p><p>It struck Carmine then why he recognized the guy. He remembered exactly where he had seen him. \u201cWe have to tell Sal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one of his men is dirty,\u201d he spat. \u201cHe was involved in the kidnapping. He was in that warehouse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think he was there?\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at his father incredulously. \u201cHaven saw him. He had to be there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d Vincent shook his head. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was. I saw him! They were arguing in Sal\u2019s office, but when I showed up, he left.\u201d</p><p>Vincent hesitated. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he was in on anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how the fuck did she draw him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sighing, Vincent flipped the page in the notebook and paused, holding it up. The color drained from Carmine\u2019s face as he stared at another drawing, this one just as in depth as the other\u2014except, instead of a monster, he was staring at an angel.</p><p>The drawing of his mother struck something deep inside him, seizing his heart in a vice grip and constricting his chest.</p><p>\u201cThe same way she drew Maura,\u201d Vincent said quietly. \u201cFrom memory. She\u2019s already told me she hallucinated in the warehouse, and Carlo has a face no one would forget\u2014clearly, considering you remember him and you rarely notice anyone except for yourself. It\u2019s not a far stretch to say she saw him as a child.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rolled his eyes, not buying that explanation. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>\u201cBut what if you are?\u201d Carmine asked again. \u201cWhat if he was in on it all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be. His loyalty to Sal is unwavering. He\u2019d do anything for the Boss, would never betray him, and Sal feels the same way about him. It\u2019s just not plausible. You can ask Corrado if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can ask Haven,\u201d Carmine said, his father\u2019s unwillingness to even consider the idea annoying him. It was certainly nothing new, but it grated on his nerves now more than ever. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone now so you can call back whoever it was you were really talking to. I have my own shit to figure out.\u201d</p><p>He stood to leave when his father cleared his throat. \u201cAscoltare il tuo cuore, Carmine. Just remember that, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do the right thing . . . whatever that may be. Like I said, you are your mother\u2019s child.\u201d</p> <p>Ascoltare il tuo cuore. Listen to your heart.</p><p>If it weren\u2019t so distressing, Carmine might have seen the irony of what his mother had always said. A person couldn\u2019t escape fate, because what was meant to be would always be. No matter how hard Carmine tried to avoid the Mafia, he came back to it in the end.</p><p>And Haven had been destined for freedom . . . his mother made sure of that.</p><p>Carmine stepped out of his father\u2019s office and pulled his cell phone from his pocket, scrolling through his contacts until he came upon his friend, Dia. He dialed her number, listening as it rang and rang, and let out a deep breath when her voicemail picked up. \u201cCall me when you get this.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>Merry Christmas!\u201d</p> <p>Haven jumped at the unexpected voice and spun around from the kitchen window. Celia stood just inside the doorway, smiling warmly, her eyes bright and awake with enthusiasm, even though the sun had barely started to rise outside.</p><p>\u201cUh, Merry Christmas,\u201d Haven said. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Strolling over to the pantry, Celia rooted around, pulling out what she would need to make Christmas dinner. She was dressed in a gray long-sleeved dress and a pair of matching heels, her shiny dark hair cascading down her back and her makeup freshly applied. It was the complete opposite of how she had appeared when Haven last saw her in Chicago a mere month ago. Her glow was back, compassion and love radiating from her like warm sunlight.</p><p>Longing struck Haven\u2019s chest. It made her think of her mother. Oh, how she missed her, especially on days like this, days when she needed someone to talk to, someone who truly knew her and would know what to say.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it awfully early for you to be awake?\u201d Celia asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Haven turned back to the window. The darkness gradually faded with every second that passed, making Carmine\u2019s car more visible in the front yard. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I had a lot on my mind last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike everything.\u201d</p> <p>Celia laughed. \u201cWell, that certainly clears it up.\u201d</p><p>Haven managed a smile as she peeked at Celia, her good mood infectious. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Carmine got back really late last night. He was gone all day, told me he had shopping to do, but he didn\u2019t bring any bags home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shopping.\u201d Celia sighed knowingly. \u201cCorrado used that one. Of course, he knew enough to stop by a store and buy something before coming home\u2014usually throwing in some flowers to butter me up. I kind of miss those days, believe it or not. He doesn\u2019t bother anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith flowers?\u201d</p><p>Celia laughed again. \u201cWith excuses, kiddo . . . although, flowers again would be nice. It\u2019s been ages.\u201d</p><p>Haven toyed with the hem of her shirt, mulling over Celia\u2019s words. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you to be lied to, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first it did. I would get so angry with him, thinking it meant he didn\u2019t trust me. I told him I wanted us to have the kind of relationship where we told each other everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me everything one day. I never asked him again.\u201d She closed her eyes at the memory, pausing to shake her head. \u201cI think it\u2019s easier for them to not bring that stuff home. It helps to know they have a sanctuary, that one place they can go and not have to be Mafiosi for a while. I\u2019ll never be able to forget the things he said that day, the look on his face as he talked, as much as I wish I could. I don\u2019t like my husband killing, and while I selfishly prefer it to him being killed, I learned that day that I don\u2019t want to hear about it, either.\u201d</p><p>Haven wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cI can\u2019t even think about Carmine being that way. That\u2019s not him. That\u2019s not the boy I know. He doesn\u2019t . . . kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Vincent, either, believe it or not. Maura was afraid the man she loved would disappear, but they won\u2019t if they have a reason not to. Carmine will always be the same person deep down inside. He\u2019ll see things he\u2019ll wish he could forget, and he\u2019ll have a lot of guilt over things he can\u2019t control, but don\u2019t we all? Your love will still save him at the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>Haven frowned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re scared,\u201d she said, wrapping her arms around Haven in a hug. She stroked Haven\u2019s hair with her hand, just like her mother had when she was younger. The ache in her chest intensified. \u201cNeither of you seem to realize fear can be a good thing. It\u2019s healthy and keeps us safe, warns us of danger. When you stop fearing things, you stop fighting. You lose motivation. You lose perspective, and you never want to do that.\u201d</p><p>A throat cleared behind them. Celia let go of Haven and turned to look, tensing. Corrado leaned against the door frame, his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>Haven dropped her gaze to the floor. She hadn\u2019t seen him since they had shown up. He had remained upstairs, secluded from the family. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Celia said. \u201cWe were having girl talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought we agreed you would stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought you knew me better than that,\u201d Celia replied. \u201cYou really can\u2019t be that dense, Corrado.\u201d</p><p>Haven gaped at Celia, stunned anyone would speak to him that way.</p><p>\u201cPardon me for hoping you\u2019d listen to common sense for once,\u201d he countered. \u201cMeddling in other people\u2019s affairs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly gets people hurt,\u201d she said, cutting him off. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve heard you say it a million times, but they\u2019re just kids, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re adults,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cWhat they choose to do in their private lives is none of our concern.\u201d</p><p>Celia laughed dryly. \u201cNone of our concern? Have you forgotten you vouched for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I own her!\u201d Corrado snapped, shooting Haven a quick glance that sent a chill down her spine. She had never heard him raise his voice before.</p><p>Celia narrowed her eyes. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s your job to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what my duties are,\u201d he responded coldly. \u201cI\u2019ll watch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Maura was watched?\u201d Celia raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou told me to stay out of it, to mind my own business. A lot of good it did then, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaura was not my responsibility. She was Vincent\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Celia responded, \u201cbut Haven is yours.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stood silently and stared at her, his expression blank. Celia stared right back, her gaze unwavering. The tension in the room mounted with each passing second. Uncomfortable, Haven fidgeted, feeling dizzy as the blood rushed furiously through her.</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . I probably shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she whispered, turning for the door. She made it as far as the foyer before Corrado\u2019s firm voice rang out, the sound of it halting Haven in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>She turned around as Corrado stepped into the foyer, glancing at her briefly and nodding before heading for the great room. She watched him for a second, unsure of what to do, before following slowly behind.</p><p>The sun started to peek over the trees outside, but the room remained eerily dim. Haven was as quiet as a corpse as she took a seat on the couch and picked at her brittle fingernails, purposely avoiding Corrado\u2019s powerful gaze.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it means to vouch for someone, Haven?\u201d he asked, breaking the tense silence that quickly enveloped the room like a thick, toxic cloud.</p><p>Without looking at him, Haven nodded stiffly. \u201cCarmine said it meant if I ever told about where I came from, you\u2019d get in trouble, but I swear I never will.\u201d</p><p>He held his hand up to silence her before she could really start pleading her case. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s not just what you say and who you say it to . . . it\u2019s what you do, too. People like me\u2014we vouch for others every day. Associates, friends, family. We swear they\u2019re good people, that they\u2019ll never bring us any harm. We swear they\u2019re trustworthy. If we\u2019re wrong, it means we lied. It means they don\u2019t benefit us by being out there in the world, by being alive, and frankly, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be either. Your life may be your own now, but I can\u2019t have that doubt lingering over my head, so there are some limitations because of the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Haven tensed. \u201cLimitations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, limitations,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to stay with Salvatore,\u201d he said. \u201cOr death. I\u2019m not sure which you\u2019d find worse, but neither would be pleasant. So limitations it is. Besides, everyone has them. Most people are ruled by petty laws\u2014wear your seat belt, don\u2019t take what\u2019s not yours. Catholics follow the Commandments\u2014don\u2019t covet thy neighbor\u2019s wife or take the Lord\u2019s name in vain. Nuns commit themselves to celibacy, lawyers and priests rely on confidentiality, and we, Haven, take a vow of silence and loyalty. We all live through the same Hell, just with different devils.\u201d</p><p>Pausing, Corrado tinkered with his wedding ring. Haven wasn\u2019t sure what she was supposed to say, so she said nothing. He continued after a moment. \u201cOur devil doesn\u2019t give the benefit of the doubt. Our devil shoots first and asks questions later, if at all. One look, one wrong move, and you\u2019re guilty. They\u2019ll carry out your punishment before you even know you were accused. Our devil shows no mercy. He can\u2019t. You got that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to stay safe, stay out of the limelight,\u201d he said. \u201cMind your own business, lay low, and never associate with the police. If a cop ever tries to question you, ask for your lawyer and call me. I don\u2019t care what it\u2019s about. And never invite one inside your home. Never.\u201d</p><p>The color drained from her face, coldness running through her as she immediately thought of Officer Baranski. \u201cI, uh . . . I didn\u2019t know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn officer came by to ask about Nicholas. I didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t supposed to talk to him. Dr. DeMarco said I should answer his questions so he\u2019d go away.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stared at her. \u201cVincent told you to talk to the police?\u201d</p><p>She nodded hesitantly. \u201cHe invited him inside.\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s mask slipped, his brow furrowing briefly before he straightened it back out. \u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days ago,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were upstairs. It was right after you arrived.\u201d</p> <p>Silence permeated the room for a few minutes. Haven did nothing, terrified of what his reaction would be. He just stared straight ahead, unmoving, and if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was blinking she might have wondered if he were even still alive.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know any better,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNo one explained it to you, but now you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stood and without a word started to walk away. He made it as far as the doorway before his footsteps faltered. He lingered there for a moment as Celia approached from the foyer, smiling proudly. She had clearly been eavesdropping.</p><p>\u201cStay out of it,\u201d he warned her again. \u201cI don\u2019t want you meddling anymore.\u201d</p><p>Christmas morning passed in a blur. Carmine seemed distracted, distant, his eyes watching everyone as if he were waiting for something to happen, lost somewhere in his mind instead of being there at home.</p> <p>Haven would occasionally catch him casting angry glares and hear heated whispered conversations when she was out of earshot. Confused, she asked a few times what was going on, but he merely smiled and told her not to worry.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry. She had heard it so many times the past week that the phrase alone was starting to worry her.</p><p>They watched holiday movies and exchanged gifts in the evening. Haven got some books and art supplies, clothes, and a new pair of pink-and-white Nike\u2019s. The festivities were quiet, almost gloomy in a sense. Something lingered in the room with them, infecting the air they all had to share. She wouldn\u2019t call it misery, but it was certainly close\u2014guilt mixed with sadness, confusion, and morose thoughts.</p><p>They sat down at the dining room table when dinner was ready, Carmine pulling out the chair beside him for Haven as Celia and Corrado took seats across from them. Dr. DeMarco cleared his throat and Carmine immediately grabbed Haven\u2019s right hand as Corrado reached across the table, holding his out to her. She blanched as she stared at it, studying his extended hand. Other than a long jagged scar diagonally on his palm, nearly camouflaged by the natural creases and lines, it appeared unscathed. His nails were freshly manicured, the skin smooth with not a single cut or callus. She wasn\u2019t sure what she had expected, but it surprised her\u2014his hands appeared awfully clean for a man with a lot of blood on them.</p><p>Taking it carefully, so not to cause a scene, Haven bowed her head.</p><p>\u201cLord, thank you for the blessings on the table today, and for all the people gathered around it,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cWe ask that you help us to remain mindful of the needs of others and continue to bless us with love and forgiveness, happiness and peace, and most of all we ask that you help the innocent among us find the freedom they deserve. In Jesus\u2019s name, we pray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d they all murmured, letting go and raising their heads. Haven glanced at Dr. DeMarco curiously, surprised by his words, and he smiled softly when they made eye contact.</p><p>\u201cDai nemici mi guardo io dagli amici mi guardi iddio,\u201d Corrado muttered under his breath as he picked up his fork.</p> <p>Carmine laughed dryly. \u201cAmen to that.\u201d</p><p>They started eating but Haven merely pushed the food around on her plate as a tense silence once again overcame the room. Everyone cast glances at one another while avoiding her gaze. It was as if they all shared a common secret, one Haven was certainly not aware of. She fidgeted nervously as she listened to the forks clanking against plates, her appetite dissipating as her stomach churned from anxiety.</p><p>Haven was so uncomfortable with the stillness she briefly considered leaving the room. Before she could act, Dominic cleared his throat. It seemed to be magnified, echoing off the barren walls. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been ten years.\u201d</p><p>Carmine went rigid, his fork stopping midair. Realizing Dominic was referring to their mother\u2019s death, Haven looked around cautiously, waiting for the imminent explosion of rage.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco\u2019s head dropped, his eyes drifting closed as he set his fork down. \u201cSeems like just yesterday we lost her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t lose her,\u201d Carmine spat, the edge of anger stabbing his words. \u201cThat makes it sound like we were negligent. It\u2019s not our fault that shit happened. She was taken from us . . . from all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Dr. DeMarco conceded. \u201cShe was unfairly taken from us.\u201d</p><p>The atmosphere was suddenly lighter after he said those words, as if that one simple phrase had lifted a heavy weight from their shoulders. Everyone chatted casually, laughing as they shared stories of the past. They spoke about Maura, and instead of clamming up, Dr. DeMarco chose to chime in.</p><p>\u201cShe loved Christmas,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cShe\u2019d get the boys dozens of presents, so many we\u2019d hardly be able to fit in the den Christmas morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cShe spoiled the shit out of Carmine.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Carmine picked up a green bean with his fork and flung it down the table at his brother. \u201cYou were just as fucking spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were,\u201d Dr. DeMarco confirmed. \u201cAnything either of you wanted, you got, and not just on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never got that bike I wanted,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cRemember it? It was that little camouflage Mongoose with that wicked horn on it and the wooden basket. I begged and begged for it.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco sighed. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t know. It was delivered to the house after . . . well, after she was taken from us. She bought it for you because Carmine was getting the piano. She wanted to be fair.\u201d</p><p>Solemn silence festered in the room until Dominic spoke up again. \u201cDo you still have it?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco shook his head. \u201cI gave it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cI\u2019d still ride it, you know.\u201d</p><p>Laughter escaped from Dr. DeMarco\u2019s lips. \u201cI know you would, son.\u201d</p><p>They went on to talk about trips they had taken, things she had taught them, and books she had read, every memory accompanied with smiles instead of tears. It was heartwarming to witness, the love for Maura still just as strong even though she had been gone for more than a decade.</p><p>After dinner, Haven offered to help Celia with the dishes. The two of them worked silently, Celia\u2019s attention elsewhere as she went about it in a daze. They were finishing when Celia let out a resigned sigh, taking a plate from Haven\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019ll finish here. You should go enjoy the rest of your Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she mumbled, drying her hands before quietly heading for the family room. She made it halfway there when she heard Dominic\u2019s boisterous voice, his words catching her off guard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake, Carmine,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you mean that. You\u2019re not thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand the situation unless you\u2019ve been in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cI do understand, and he\u2019s going to regret it! It\u2019s not too late to change your mind, and for all of our sakes, please change your mind. I\u2019m begging you, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is too late,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI get that you don\u2019t agree, but you don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m the one who has to live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d Dominic asked incredulously. \u201cCan you seriously live with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Dominic said, the passion in his voice startling. \u201cI can\u2019t believe anyone would actually think this is a good idea!\u201d</p><p>Haven finished the last few steps in their direction, pausing at the entrance to the family room. Dominic paced the floor, frenzied, as Carmine stood off to the side, clutching his hair in aggravation. Vincent and Corrado merely watched the boys, the atmosphere so tense she could feel it pressing on her skin.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cI\u2019ll support him any way I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit!\u201d Dominic spat.</p><p>The force of his words startled Haven. She flinched. Heads instantly turned her way, four sets of eyes now boring into her.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cWe are just having a disagreement, but this isn\u2019t the time or the place for it.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around, dread running through her as she took in their expressions. Despite what he had said, something was definitely wrong. She turned to Carmine, raising her eyebrows, expecting him to offer some sort of real explanation, but he shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t worry about it.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go lie down,\u201d she said, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Carmine said, shooting Dominic an angry glare as he stalked past. He took her hand and she mumbled good-bye to everyone as he pulled her toward the steps, not saying a word.</p><p>\u201cAre they mad about what you did in Chicago?\u201d she pressed when they reached the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he muttered. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to talk about it right now. I\u2019d rather just . . . be. Just for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, trying to push back the sick feeling in her stomach. He plopped down on the bed and she followed his lead, lying down beside him.</p><p>\u201cLa mia bella ragazza,\u201d he murmured, pulling her into his arms. She tilted her head to the side as he leaned in and kissed her neck, humming against her skin. \u201cI was hoping today would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were together,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat makes it perfect to me.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>Haven hadn\u2019t intended to fall asleep, but her exhaustion was deeper than she anticipated. Emotionally drained, she drifted into unconsciousness within a matter of minutes.</p><p>Rolling over in the middle of the night, her arm dropped on the other side of the mattress. She felt around for Carmine in the darkness, sighing when she realized she was alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Climbing out of bed, she quietly made her way to the door, the faint sound of \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d meeting her ears. The disjointed notes washed through her, the familiar broken melody forcing a frown onto her lips.</p><p>Carmine sat in his usual chair in the library, casually strumming his guitar. A sliver of light filtered in from the large window, illuminating his somber expression in the darkness. She called his name but he remained still, continuing to pluck at the strings almost as if he hadn\u2019t heard her. She took a step toward him and was about to say his name again when he let out a long, deep sigh. \u201cI had a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother nightmare?\u201d she asked, walking over to him. He glanced up at her as his fingers stilled, the music stopping, but Haven barely noticed. She couldn\u2019t focus on anything but the green eyes boring into her. Once so alive with passion, she saw nothing but deep sadness marring the bright color.</p><p>Carmine set the guitar aside and moved his legs to make room, motioning for her to join him. She climbed into his lap and he wrapped his arms around her.</p> <p>\u201cNot a nightmare this time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou made a painting\u2014some abstract shit, I don\u2019t know\u2014but it was so good they hung it in a museum and raved about how talented you were. It was like you were the next fucking Picasso, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to paint, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could learn,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you want to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe, but I don\u2019t know how good I\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d be good,\u201d he said confidently. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t doubt yourself. You can do anything you set your mind to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for play the piano,\u201d she said playfully. \u201cOr the guitar.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYeah, for the sake of everyone\u2019s ears, we ought to leave music to me, but the rest is all you. You can probably do all of that, you know. Draw, paint, sculpt shit into weird shapes and tell people it\u2019s something it doesn\u2019t look anything like. That takes talent.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd you think I have that kind of talent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be no stopping you once you get started.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, a swell of emotion surging through her at his words. \u201cIt means a lot that you believe in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be an idiot not to,\u201d he said, kissing the top of her head. \u201cYou know, we never finished our conversation from the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one about your freedom.\u201d</p><p>Haven sighed, snuggling closer to him. \u201cWhat else is there to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna hear what it really means to you.\u201d</p><p>They spent the next hour sitting together in front of the window in the dark library, digging into each other\u2019s minds. They didn\u2019t talk about the torture they had endured or the hurt they still felt, instead focusing on the things that made them happy. He asked about her deepest desires, wanting to know what kind of things she would do if she woke up tomorrow with a clean slate. What would she do, if someday, she could start over, brand new?</p><p>She talked of friends and a family, a house full of books and half a dozen pets. The American Dream, complete with two-point-five kids and a freshly painted white picket fence, weekend barbecues with neighbors and summer vacations to Disneyland.</p> <p>It felt like everything else faded away that long moment, the reality of their situation taking a back seat as they considered an alternate future, one Haven had always wanted but never believed she could have. A future away from it all. A future with no strings.</p><p>Freedom.</p><p>\u201cI just want people to see me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to walk into a room and have them know I\u2019m there. It doesn\u2019t matter where it is, really. I\u2019m just don\u2019t want to be invisible anymore.\u201d</p><p>Carmine ran the back of his hand along her warm cheek. She hummed contently, leaning into his touch.</p><p>\u201cI see you, hummingbird,\u201d he whispered, a twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know what else I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded toward the window. \u201cSnow.\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced over, spotting the thick white flakes fluttering down from the sky. Before she could comment, Carmine jumped up and yanked her to her feet. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as he pulled her into the bedroom. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she asked with disbelief, glancing at the clock when he let go of her hand. The red numbers shone brightly in the darkness: one in the morning.</p><p>He shoved open the bedroom window. It groaned, but offered little resistance. Cold air entered the room in a whoosh, stirring the thick curtains and making Haven shiver. Wrapping her arms around herself, her brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cDidn\u2019t Dr. DeMarco nail that down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he did a shitty job,\u201d Carmine replied. \u201cI pried it back open.\u201d</p><p>Haven wanted to ask when he had done it, or even why he bothered, but she didn\u2019t have a chance. Carmine had his shoes on and was already preparing to leave.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said again, tossing her coat to her. He was halfway out the window before she could think to object.</p><p>Haven quickly bundled up before joining him on the long balcony that wrapped around the house. It was the third time she had navigated it, but this time was more difficult than the other two. A light sheen of frost covered everything, making Haven slip a little as she walked along the narrow wooden path toward the massive tree on the corner. It was barren, the leaves long gone as winter settled in, but the thick branches were as sturdy as ever.</p><p>\u201cIs this necessary?\u201d Haven asked as she started climbing the tree. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we have gone out the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could\u2019ve,\u201d Carmine said, jumping down to the ground, \u201cbut where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>Haven managed to scale the first few obstacles easily, but her foot slipped when she neared the bottom of the tree. She lost her grip on the branch and screeched, closing her eyes when she started to fall. She braced herself for sudden impact, but Carmine reacted quickly. He grabbed her, attempting to gracefully catch her, but the blow knocked them both down.</p><p>Carmine groaned as the air was brutally forced from his lungs. Haven pulled away from him, rolling over. The frozen earth felt like solid concrete against her back. \u201cThat was sure . . . fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t think that shit through,\u201d Carmine said, standing up. He brushed at his clothes before grabbing Haven\u2019s hand and pulling her to her feet. \u201cMaybe we should\u2019ve just used the damn door.\u201d</p><p>The cold night air felt like pins and needles, stabbing against Haven\u2019s flushed face, but she smiled regardless as she took in her surroundings. The flakes were starting to settle on the ground, dotting the lifeless grass with small patches of white. Thick clouds covered the sky, blocking the stars from view, but the vibrant moon continued to shine through. There were no animals or birds out at that hour, no fireflies flickering in the night\u2014no sign of life except for the two of them.</p><p>It was as if they were alone in the world, and as terrifying as that was to Haven\u2014the thought of nothing else existing anymore\u2014she felt secure knowing at least he was still out there.</p><p>She took a few steps out into the yard, glancing up into the sky as snow rained down on her. Wetness hit her skin, coldness seeping through her clothes. A chill ran through her body as she closed her eyes and opened her mouth, capturing some of the bland flakes on her tongue.</p><p>Despite the fact that it was bitterly cold, warmth spread through her.</p><p>Haven opened her eyes and peeked over at Carmine to find him staring at her. Flakes stuck to his thick, dark locks, and she reached up, running her fingers through his hair to wipe them away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, tesoro,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Heat rose to her cheeks at his words. \u201cSuch a charmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun away with me,\u201d he continued, leaning down to softly kiss her lips. \u201cWe can disappear before the sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>Pressing her hand against his chest, she pushed away from Carmine with a laugh. \u201cWe can\u2019t run away.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice dream, though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how nice it would be,\u201d she replied. \u201cHow would we ever feel safe if we constantly had to watch our backs? I don\u2019t want to run from anything anymore. I\u2019m tired of running. I want to be able to walk away, just stroll away somewhere together, hand in hand, nothing else mattering. I want to stand at an intersection and choose which way to go without having to worry about what happens if it leads us somewhere someone else doesn\u2019t want us to be. Now that\u2019s a nice dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, still staring at her. \u201cBeautiful and smart.\u201d</p><p>She timidly ducked her head, peering at the ground as her blush deepened. She started kicking around at the small accumulation, her toe digging into the frozen dirt. \u201cDoes it snow a lot in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>Carmine was quiet for a moment. She glanced back at him, seeing he wasn\u2019t watching her anymore. He stared off into the distance, a dazed look on his face. \u201cToo much,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cI like snow and all, but they get blizzards. I\u2019m not looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut think of all the snowmen and snow angels and the snowball fights.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved into a smile, but she could see the sadness back in his eyes. She felt guilty for bringing up Chicago, not wanting to ruin his mood. It wasn\u2019t often they had carefree moments anymore.</p><p>\u201cIt snows in New York, too,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as much as it snows in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Central Park is beautiful when it\u2019s all white,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, I bet it\u2019s beautiful all year round. I\u2019d love to see it someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he said, turning back to her. His smile faded. \u201cYou look cold.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were numb already, the tips of her ears stinging, but she just shrugged, not wanting the moment to be over yet.</p><p>Carmine pulled her into his arms, his body heat instantly warming her. Snuggling into his chest, she wrapped her arms around him as she hugged him tightly. He leaned his head on top of hers, a soft hum vibrating Carmine\u2019s chest as the snow continued to fall, covering them.</p><p>The melody was sweet and vaguely familiar. It took a minute for it to register with Haven. \u201cBlue October,\u201d she whispered, recalling the song they had made love to on Valentine\u2019s Day.</p><p>\u201cYou remember,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d she whispered as he continued humming, the sound slowly turning into words as he began to sing. A chill ran down her spine, her heart aching when his voice cracked on the words.</p><p>A strange feeling brewed in the pit of Haven\u2019s stomach, longing and desperation mixing with fear. Fear\u2019s healthy, she tried to remind herself, but it didn\u2019t feel like it at the moment. It felt crippling, like the fortress walls she had built that kept her safe and at home were on the verge of collapsing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, pulling back as her body shuddered. Haven nodded, her eyes starting to well up with tears as she avoided his gaze, once again terrified of seeing that look in his eyes, the look of regret.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go inside?\u201d he asked when she didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>He grabbed her hand, leading her to the back door instead of the tree. He pressed the code in the keypad, unlocking it, and ushered her inside.</p><p>Haven took her coat off as soon as she made it upstairs to the bedroom, kicking her shoes off right inside the door. Her pants were damp and she stripped them off, pulling her shirt off next and tossing all of her clothes on the floor in a pile. She turned to Carmine, watching as he took his coat off and carefully hung it on the back of his desk chair.</p><p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. He turned his head and froze when he saw her standing there in her bra and underwear, his eyes scanning the length of her like it was pure instinct.</p><p>His gaze reached her face and their eyes connected, goose bumps dancing across her skin at the intensity of the green shining back at her. He stared at her curiously, the sadness still there, but more than anything she could see the love he had for her.</p><p>Thank God, she silently pleaded in relief.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>It came out a strangled whisper, the words catching in her throat. She needed him in that moment. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure why, but she could feel it deep down to the bone. She didn\u2019t want to just see his love\u2014she wanted to feel it. It had been months since they had been intimate, since before the devastation had taken hold, and she desperately needed to be consumed by Carmine DeMarco once again.</p><p>He appeared torn as he stared at her, but the agonized expression on his face faded away. He slowly took a few steps toward her but didn\u2019t say anything, no words necessary. They both knew they would give in to the need, unable to resist the pull between them that had been there since the moment they first touched.</p><p>He paused in front of her, his hand running the length of her arm as he leaned down to kiss her. Reaching around and unclasping her bra, he pulled it off slowly and allowed it to drop to the floor. A moan escaped Haven\u2019s throat as he gently caressed her breasts, her nipples pebbling under his gentle touch.</p><p>His hands drifted down to her hips as he slowly backed her up to the bed. She scooted back onto it and he hovered over her, not once breaking their kiss.</p><p>Haven closed her eyes as his mouth moved to her neck, his shaky breath hitting the wet spots left behind. Shivers ripped down her spine as he trailed kisses down her stomach, and she inhaled deeply as his tongue dipped inside her belly button. It tickled, her body tingling from head to toe.</p><p>Carmine took his time, kissing and caressing every inch of exposed skin, before slowly pulling off her panties. She clutched the sheets tightly as he kissed along her inner thighs, gripping her hips, holding her in place as his tongue gently caressed her flesh.</p><p>Haven\u2019s noises grew louder and her legs trembled as the pressure built inside her. Writhing, she let go of the sheets, reaching out for him. She ran her hands through his hair and moaned his name, a groan vibrating in his chest at the sound of it. He pulled away from Haven quickly and she opened her eyes as he sat up, watching as he grabbed the bottom of his shirt to pull it off.</p><p>Reaching out, Haven ran her fingers over the ridges of his stomach, tracing the lines of the tattoo on his chest as he unbuckled his pants. He pulled them off and Haven\u2019s breath hitched at the sight of him already erect. She ran her fingers down the light trail of hair on his stomach before grasping him and stroking a few times.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked, placing his hand on top of hers.</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s second guessing?\u201d she asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, amused she would turn his words around on him, and pulled her hand away. She held her breath as he pushed inside of her, filling her completely with one deep stroke.</p><p>\u201cOf course I trust you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m just giving you a chance to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never change my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cNot when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>His thrusts were slow and gentle at first as he kissed her softly, whimpers escaping her throat. She wrapped her arms around him, clinging to him as her hands roamed the sculpted muscles of his back.</p> <p>The pleasure was intense as it swept through her, and it didn\u2019t take long before the pressure built again, her body quivering.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s movements grew more frantic after a while, his thrusts harder and deeper. His breathing grew labored, his body trembling in her arms as he slid in and out of her body with fervor. She could feel the desire seeping from his pores as he gave himself to her. The love, the need, the yearning . . . the raw passion between them was enough to take her breath away.</p><p>Skin soaked with sweat, Haven felt as if she were on fire, every inch of her aching for all of him. She could hear his pants and gasps, his hands gripping her firmly as he challenged logic by pulling her closer than she had ever been before. It was as if they had melted into one, where he ended and she began nothing but a blur.</p><p>Bodies pressed together, she could feel his pulse, blood furiously rushing through his veins. \u201cYour heart,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel it?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou hear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it saying?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her eyes fluttering closed. \u201cIt\u2019s saying you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what. Sempre.\u201d</p><p>That word washed through her. \u201cSempre.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s body shook as his climax hit. He smashed his lips to hers as he thrust a few more times, holding Haven so tightly it was as if his life depended on it.</p><p>He stilled his movements, nuzzling into her neck, and let out a shaky breath as a shudder ran through his body.</p><p>\u201cGood night, my hummingbird,\u201d Carmine whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you in my dreams.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>Sitting at the bottom of the stairs, Carmine dropped his head low as his hand gripped his unruly hair, his eyes fixed on the black duffel bag full of clothes near his feet. His old acoustic guitar was carefully balanced against it\u2014half teetering on the bag, half on the foyer floor.</p><p>A chime echoed through the downstairs from a clock in the family room, an eternity seeming to pass with each tick of its hand. Time was a merciless bitch, taunting him as it slipped away. One second; two seconds; twenty minutes; an hour. A century could have gone by, or no time at all.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s chest ached. He wished it would just fucking stop.</p><p>Footsteps on the stairs behind him made him feel like he was going to be sick. He was afraid Haven would wake up and catch him sitting there alone\u2014part of him treacherously hoping she would find him and stop him, even though he knew it was too late.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still here,\u201d Vincent said, stepping past. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be gone by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d he said, his voice shaking as he continued to stare at the bag on the floor. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna hate me. She\u2019s gonna regret ever letting me into her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll understand someday.\u201d</p><p>Carmine clenched his hands into fists as his eyes burned with unshed tears. \u201cThis is gonna fucking devastate her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it probably will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he spat, glaring at his father. \u201cThanks for making me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to lie to you?\u201d Vincent asked, raising his eyebrows. \u201cOf course it\u2019s going to hurt her, Carmine. There\u2019s no getting around that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is fucked up,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how it\u2019s supposed to be. It wasn\u2019t supposed to end up like this. We\u2019re supposed to be together, get away from all of this bullshit and just be. For once in our fucking lives, we were going to just be, and now look at everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you rethinking this?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt isn\u2019t too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is too late,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moment I went to Sal, it became too late. She\u2019s better than the life I can offer her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want me to say, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to say she\u2019s better off without me, that we\u2019re better off apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Vincent said, \u201cbut who\u2019s going to convince you of that?\u201d</p><p>His question caught Carmine off guard. He stared at his father pointedly, awaiting some answer to ease his concern, but the mere thought of stepping out of that front door without Haven hurt worse than Carmine ever imagined it would.</p><p>Before he could come up with something to say, the front door opened and Dominic stepped inside. He froze when he caught sight of Carmine and narrowed his eyes as he slammed the door. Dominic rarely lost his temper, but when he did another side of him came out that was unpredictable, his words often hurting just as much as Carmine vaguely recalled his fists did.</p><p>\u201cI see you haven\u2019t walked out on her yet,\u201d he said, his words cutting deep.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone, Dom,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou\u2019re just making it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making it worse?\u201d he asked with disbelief. \u201cSomeone has to try to talk him out of this before he makes the biggest mistake of his life. She\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Carmine snapped. \u201cShe deserves to be free to do what she wants!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you taking that from her?\u201d Dominic asked. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this so she\u2019ll be free to do what she wants, but you\u2019re making the choice for her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let her first decision be whether she follows her dreams or me. What kinda bullshit is that to ask of her? She always worries about everyone else because assholes have beat her down, and I\u2019d be no better than them if I asked her to put me first! She deserves to find out what\u2019s out there for her, whether she realizes it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cDo you even hear yourself? What gives you the right to decide for her\u2014because you know better than she does? Could you be more condescending?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you! I may be what she wants, but I\u2019m not what she needs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to you,\u201d Dominic spat, stalking forward and getting in Carmine\u2019s face. \u201cBut like I said, you didn\u2019t even ask her. You just assumed. Who cares what Haven wants, right? We\u2019ll all just claim to know better than her and make her decisions and pretend it\u2019s what she needs when only she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants a future, Dominic. She wants to be free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNot as long as people like you are making decisions for her. I thought you were better than that, Carmine, but maybe I was wrong. Maybe you don\u2019t love her, after all.\u201d</p><p>The moment the words came from his mouth, rage ran through Carmine. He jumped up, drawing his arm back, and hit his brother with as much force as he could. Carmine\u2019s fist connected with Dominic\u2019s jaw, which made him stagger a few steps, but he lunged for Carmine the moment he gained his balance. Carmine tripped over the duffel bag, his foot tramping on the guitar and smashing through it as Dominic shoved him into the nearest wall. Vincent tried to come between them, but Dominic was too strong. He pinned Carmine there with his left hand as he drew his fist back. Carmine waited for the blow, blindly striking back at his brother, but before Dominic could follow through, a firm voice echoed through the downstairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough!\u201d</p><p>Corrado started toward them from the kitchen. He shoved Dominic away, physically coming between the two brothers.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying,\u201d Carmine spat.</p><p>\u201cMe? You\u2019re the one fucking up!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said enough! Neither of you know what you\u2019re talking about! Are you boys so dumb that you can\u2019t grasp the concept of cause and effect?\u201d</p><p>Dominic scoffed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just some unfortunate side effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what Carmine does\u2014Haven will always have choices taken from her. I\u2019ve taken choices from her! It can\u2019t be helped! Certain things were determined the moment she was conceived and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do to change that. You can\u2019t rewrite history!\u201d</p><p>The commotion drew Celia\u2019s attention. She slowly descended the stairs to the foyer, carrying her luggage. Her eyes scanned the room, frowning when she saw Carmine\u2019s things on the floor.</p><p>\u201cAll of us are forced to sacrifice,\u201d Corrado continued, turning to Dominic, staring at him pointedly. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t this how most breakups go? One walks away while the other has no say. Or are you insinuating Carmine has no right to end the relationship? Isn\u2019t that hypocritical, given your rant? The fact is, Carmine isn\u2019t deciding Haven\u2019s future. Carmine\u2019s deciding his own.\u201d</p> <p>He turned to Carmine, the anger in his expression staggering. \u201cAnd you need to grow a backbone. You\u2019ve been sitting here all morning feeling sorry for yourself, and it\u2019s wearing on my nerves. You either go back up those stairs or you walk out that front door, but there will be no more wavering in between. You belong in Chicago now, so be a man and do what\u2019s expected of you. Either take her along or don\u2019t, Carmine. She\u2019s going to lose something regardless. The only question that remains is what she loses.\u201d</p><p>The foyer grew quiet as everyone stared at Carmine, whose stomach churned with nerves. \u201cI can\u2019t bring her to Chicago. Those people fucked up her life enough.\u201d</p><p>Dominic threw his hands up in exasperation as Corrado nodded. \u201cThen pull yourself together and meet me in the car in five minutes. If you aren\u2019t there, I will come back in here for you, and I assure you\u2014you don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d</p><p>Corrado pulled his keys out of his pocket and headed for the door, motioning for Celia to follow him. She smiled sadly at her brother before giving Dominic a quick hug, merely casting Carmine a look as she followed her husband outside.</p><p>Carmine took a deep breath and glanced at his father as he reached into his pocket for his keys. He took the key for the house in Chicago off before holding the rest of them out. \u201cGive my car to Haven. She\u2019s gonna need one. If she doesn\u2019t want to keep it she can sell it or trade it in or fucking burn it, whatever she wants to do. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grabbed his bag, leaving the smashed guitar laying on the floor, and turned for the front door. He came face-to-face with his brother as he blocked his path. \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to be there for you when you fall apart,\u201d Dominic said, nostrils flaring. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019ll ever hear from me is I told you so.\u201d</p> <p>Haven peeled her eyes open and glanced at the clock, surprised to see it read noon. A chill ran through her and her throat ached as she tried to clear it, an uncomfortable tickle deep inside her chest. She clung to the blanket for warmth, covering her nude body as she looked around.</p><p>No sign of Carmine anywhere.</p><p>Begrudgingly climbing out of bed, Haven took a hot shower before dressing in some comfortable clothes, feeling worse and worse as time trickled past. Her head started pounding, her eyes burning and body sore. Although she shivered, unable to get warm, her skin felt hot to the touch, like flames coursed through her bloodstream.</p><p>She spotted a piece of paper laying on Carmine\u2019s pillow and eyed it suspiciously, seeing her name written across the front. That feeling Haven had fought hard to push back the night before hit her again. Picking up the paper, her hands shook as she opened it, seeing it was a letter written in Carmine\u2019s messy scrawl.</p><p>Haven,</p><p>FDR said freedom couldn\u2019t be bestowed, it had to be achieved. I think I was in fifth grade when I heard about him, and I remember being pissed because I didn\u2019t see the point in learning history when it was over. I was an ignorant little shit, but I guess that\u2019s the point. I took a lot for granted in life and didn\u2019t appreciate the little things\u2014things you missed out on. It\u2019s not okay what happened to you, and it\u2019s only from knowing you that I understand that. I wish more people could see it. More people need to see you. Maybe then the world wouldn\u2019t be such a fucked-up place.</p><p>I should\u2019ve known telling you that you were free wouldn\u2019t make you so. Freedom has to be achieved, and that\u2019s exactly what you have to do, tesoro. You have to go out there and achieve that shit. You have the world at your fingertips, a life waiting for you full of opportunities you can\u2019t have if you stay with me. And I know they\u2019re dreams you want, dreams you\u2019ve always had, and you shouldn\u2019t sacrifice them for me. You\u2019ve sacrificed enough of your life because of selfish motherfuckers, and I\u2019m not that selfish . . . not anymore. You made sure of that.</p><p>By the time you read this, I\u2019ll be gone. I can\u2019t stay here. It\u2019s not fair to you, and I\u2019d never forgive myself for denying you a real life. A life away from all of this bullshit, where you can just be Haven. Go be you and not what people tried to make you. You have to go show those motherfuckers what they\u2019ve been missing by not knowing you. Show them they can\u2019t hold my girl down.</p> <p>And don\u2019t you be fucking scared. You\u2019re ready for the world, Haven, and it\u2019s been waiting eighteen years for you. Don\u2019t make that shit wait any longer.</p><p>Carmine</p><p>Haven jumped up, the letter falling to the bedroom floor as she bolted down the two flights of stairs, tripping over her feet along the way. Tears flowed from her eyes as she burst into the foyer, hesitating briefly when she accidently kicked Carmine\u2019s broken, discarded guitar.</p><p>After fumbling with the keypad, furiously pressing numbers until she got the code right, she opened the front door. Cold air blasted her and stole the breath from her lungs, her bare feet slapping against frozen wood as she ran out onto the icy porch.</p><p>The Mazda was still parked out front, the windows covered in a thin layer of frost. Last night\u2019s snow had already started to melt, but a few white patches remained on the car. It was untouched, unmoved, and the sight of it made hope sweep through her.</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d she called, her shaky exhale a cloud of fog. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left.\u201d</p><p>She swung around at the sound of the voice, her heart beating wildly. Dr. DeMarco stood in the doorway, sympathy shining from his eyes. Haven\u2019s stomach churned ruthlessly at the sight of it. No. No way. Nuh-uh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she yelled. \u201cHe\u2019s still here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to change his mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His voice lacked all trace of emotion, the words coming out as if there was simply no room for argument, but she couldn\u2019t accept them. It couldn\u2019t be too late.</p><p>She waved frantically toward the Mazda. \u201cHis car\u2019s still here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t leave it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way! He loves that car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you more.\u201d</p><p>Haven lost her composure at those words. Tears streamed down her cheeks as a loud sob ripped from her chest, echoing through the quiet yard. Her knees buckled and she collapsed on the porch, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt can\u2019t be right. He wouldn\u2019t just leave!\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco continued to stand there, not moving from the spot in the doorway. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d she asked with disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry?\u201d</p><p>Before he could respond, he was shoved out of the way as Dominic burst past him. He crouched down on the porch and pulled Haven into his arms, softly shushing her as he glared at his father.</p><p>\u201cDominic,\u201d Haven said. \u201cMake him come back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cI tried, Twinkle Toes, I really did, but he wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>Haven started sobbing harder, hiccupping as she tried to catch her breath. She was splintering, her heart ripping from her chest as she shattered into a million tiny jagged pieces.</p><p>\u201cYou need to calm down,\u201d Dominic said, stroking her hair softly. \u201cTake a deep breath, will you? It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d she asked desperately. \u201cI need him!\u201d</p><p>Dominic squeezed her tighter. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I know it feels like it, but you don\u2019t. You\u2019re strong. You\u2019ll be just fine on your own.\u201d</p><p>Those words didn\u2019t have the impact Dominic seemed to think they would. Instead of comforting her, consoling her, she felt all remnants of lingering happiness fade away, like the last bit of water from a faucet swirling down a narrow drain.</p><p>On your own. The words seeped into her skin, inciting the same terrified feelings she once had in Blackburn when she ran through the desert, desperate for her life to be spared. Everything she knew disappeared into the night, leaving her alone with a cloudy future.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>\u201cHow can he be gone?\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even give me a chance to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>Carmine stood in a pile of slush along the street. His socks clung uncomfortably to his feet as wetness seeped through the soles of his old Nike\u2019s, but he couldn\u2019t move from that spot. He was as frozen as the ice that coated the sidewalk.</p><p>The house stood only a few feet away from the curb, the blue door illuminated by the glow of a nearby streetlight. It was just after sunset, but the cloud-covered Chicago sky made it feel much later.</p><p>They had been traveling all day since leaving Durante, two hours in the car before quite a few more on a plane. There hadn\u2019t been any arguing, no judgment or pity\u2014in fact, no one said much of anything at all. He was left alone to his thoughts, and while he usually appreciated it, today was an entirely different case.</p><p>Because Carmine\u2019s thoughts were about as calm as a fucking hurricane.</p><p>When they had landed, Corrado had asked him where he wanted to go. Not thinking, Carmine muttered the lone word home. He had meant Durante, back where he yearned to be, but his uncle took him literally.</p><p>And an hour later, he stood in front of the house he grew up in, his soaked feet refusing to budge. A chill ran the length of him as a car sped by, hitting a small puddle and spraying his back with filthy frigid water. He immediately took a big step forward, out of the way, and shook his head as he moved onto the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cQuit being such a pussy,\u201d he muttered to himself, reaching into his pocket for the key his father had given him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fucking house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clutching his duffle bag tightly, he made his way to the porch and unlocked the front door. The air was just as cold inside, his teeth chattering from the dampness. He reached for the light switch upon instinct and groaned when nothing happened.</p><p>No electricity.</p><p>He strolled through the downstairs in the darkness, coming upon empty room after empty room.</p><p>No furniture.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He dropped his bag in the middle of the living room and stood there for a moment, peering around at the barren walls, before closing his eyes.</p><p>There was nothing there anymore.</p><p>He could faintly remember the last time he stood in that spot. The room had been cluttered, lived in and loved, every bit of space filled except for the back corner. It had been bare; reserved for the one thing Carmine wanted most. He had been asking for months and finally . . . fucking finally . . . it was the day.</p><p>\u201cHow are they going to get it in the house, Mom?\u201d he\u2019d asked. \u201cIt\u2019s too big to fit through the door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019ll find a way,\u201d Maura had replied, stepping into the room as she slipped on her jacket. \u201cEven if it\u2019s piece by piece, they\u2019ll get the piano in here.\u201d She ruffled his messy hair, beaming at him. \u201cNow come on, sole. We have things to do, and we don\u2019t want to be late for your recital! The new piano will be here when we get home tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine smiled fondly at the memory of his mom\u2019s sweet voice, but his expression fell once he reopened his eyes. His gaze drifted to the back corner of the living room. They never made it home that night.</p><p>Tears burned his tired eyes for the second time that day, but this time, he didn\u2019t fight it. There was no one to hold them back from, no reason to keep it in. No reason to be strong. Tomorrow he would pick himself up and move forward, walk out the door with his head held high, but not tonight. Tonight he was alone in a cold, dark house, surrounded by nothing but fuzzy painful memories.</p><p>Vincent DeMarco sat alone in his office, drumming his fingers against the wooden desk. The sun had set hours ago, the room enshrouded in total darkness. His eyes slowly adjusted so he could view his surroundings, but he didn\u2019t bother trying to look at anything. He\u2019d seen all he needed to see.</p><p>Haven\u2019s notebook lay open in front of him to the page Carmine had shown him days before. He had studied the drawing of Carlo intently, taking in every line of his face, every distortion in his grotesque scar. His skin crawled at how chillingly accurate her rendering of his appearance was, every crack and ripple, down to the small oblong shaped mole under his left eye.</p><p>A mole, Vincent knew, that had only appeared in the past year.</p><p>He had run his finger over the spot on the page when he noticed it, wondering if it was just an ink smudge, trying to convince himself it was a crazy coincidence. There was no way she could have known it was there. She couldn\u2019t have seen it before.</p> <p>Unless . . . she had.</p><p>His stomach was in tight knots as he considered that.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that the house was deathly silent\u2014no laughter, no chatter, no ruckus upstairs. No yelling, no fighting, no nothing at all. Dominic had stormed out after Carmine left, and soon both of his boys would be hundreds of miles away. Vincent felt like he was alone, although Haven was technically still there. She was above him on the third floor, passing the hours like a ghost as she lurked around in a trance.</p><p>He wanted to say something to her, but he couldn\u2019t find the words.</p><p>Soon she would be gone, too. She would step out the front door within a matter of days and likely never look back. Vincent felt a sense of accomplishment deep in his chest, but pressing upon it was something heavier.</p><p>It was the knowledge that his work was still not done, and he was beginning to wonder if it ever would be.</p><p>Pulling out his cell phone, he squinted from the harsh bright light as he dialed the Chicago phone number. It rang twice before it was answered, the familiar voice on the line simply saying, \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Vincent took a deep breath as his gaze settled on the notebook, Carlo\u2019s menacing eyes staring back up at him.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>No one bothered Haven as she locked herself away on the third floor. The days passed quickly, one after another morphing into the next, as the winter clouds drifted away, the sun again making itself at home in the sky. She read the letter Carmine left countless times, the words stinging as much the twentieth time as they had the first. She sought out some hidden meaning, some little nugget of information that could explain how it was all a misunderstanding, bordering on delusional as she waited . . . and waited . . . for him to return.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>She heard people moving around the house and could hear their voices on the floor below, but it wasn\u2019t until the end of the week that someone finally came upstairs. Dia didn\u2019t bother to knock, just walked in and sat on the edge of the bed. Haven remained in her seat near the window, staring out at the barren back yard.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Haven asked without even looking at her, her voice scratchy from not speaking in days. \u201cHow long ago did he tell you he was leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas Eve,\u201d Dia answered. \u201cHe called, asked if I\u2019d watch out for you.\u201d</p><p>Haven blinked rapidly. Christmas Eve? \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d Dia said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave if he did. Walking out the front door was probably the hardest thing he\u2019s ever done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all of you knew it was going to happen?\u201d she asked, finally turning to her. The quirky Dia looked uncharacteristically subdued in jeans and an oversize sweater. Her hair was nearly completely blonde, her natural shade, the ends tinged a faded light pink. \u201cEveryone knew Carmine was leaving and no one told me?\u201d</p><p>Dia sighed. \u201cHe only told me. He didn\u2019t want anyone to know because he didn\u2019t want it to ruin Christmas, but I let it slip to my sister and she told Dominic. I don\u2019t think anyone told the others. They just put the pieces together. His aunt Celia was the last to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides me,\u201d Haven said bitterly, turning back away. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go on,\u201d Dia said. \u201cYou can come to Charlotte with me if you want, or we can find you a place around here. Whatever makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes me happy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dia said, \u201cbut it\u2019ll get easier. In time it won\u2019t hurt as bad, and eventually, the day will come when you\u2019ll be ready to move on.\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head, brushing away a few wayward tears. \u201cIt may not hurt as much, but I\u2019ll never move on.\u201d</p><p>She stood up and glanced around at the room, taking in all of Carmine\u2019s possessions. It all appeared to be exactly where it had been weeks, even months earlier when he\u2019d still been there. \u201cDid he take anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClothes,\u201d she said. \u201cMoney. He left you an envelope of cash, you know, to get you through. He said you could have anything else you wanted, too. Whatever\u2019s left is going to be shipped to him in Chicago after . . .\u201d</p><p>Dia trailed off as Haven walked over to the desk and started sorting through things, separating her belongings from Carmine\u2019s. \u201cAfter I leave,\u201d she said, completing her friend\u2019s thought.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that now,\u201d Dia said. \u201cTake as much time as you need. They said you\u2019re welcome to stay here as a guest as long as you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuest.\u201d The word sounded so foreign on Haven\u2019s tongue. Once upon a time she had been a slave within these very same walls, trapped like a prisoner behind bulletproof windows and locked doors. After that, she had almost felt at home, like she had finally found somewhere she belonged, somewhere she was wanted. But now she was a guest, a visitor passing through on her way to God knows where.</p><p>It\u2019s strange how those things work. One minute you\u2019re the servant, the next you\u2019re Cinderella, and then . . . then the story is over and you\u2019re forced to close the book.</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to make it?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us really know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Dia replied. \u201cWe just go out there and do it and have faith it\u2019ll turn out okay.\u201d</p><p>Haven thought over those words as she continued to separate their belongings, unsure of what to say. Dia got up when she realized Haven had no intention of stopping, leaving the room and returning with some empty boxes. She silently worked alongside Haven, helping her pack up her things.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until then, as they filled box after box with belongings, that Haven realized exactly how much she had acquired while living there. A little more than a year before, she had walked through the front door for the first time barefoot and empty-handed, with nothing she could call her own except for her name. Haven. It was the only thing her mother had given her, the one thing, she thought, no one could ever take away. But now she was preparing to walk out the door for the last time, half a dozen boxes already packed full of material things.</p><p>Just thinking about it made her uneasy. She suddenly wanted to leave it all behind.</p><p>It took nearly two days for her to sort through everything\u2014two days of wavering, two days of packing and unpacking and repacking again. She took some necessary clothes but left most of it hanging in the closet, hoping Dr. DeMarco would donate it to charity so someone who needed it would have something to wear. She packed some books and notebooks and all of the drawings she had done during the past year. She took the basket from their Valentine\u2019s Day picnic, but she left all of Carmine\u2019s things untouched.</p><p>Dominic and Tess appeared long enough to say good-bye before leaving for school again. Neither one mentioned Carmine, both of them feigning happiness about the future that lay ahead of her, but she wasn\u2019t na\u00efve\u2014she could tell they were concerned.</p><p>As the time slipped away, Haven\u2019s sadness gave way to anger, before guilt set in once again. It was because of her that Carmine had given himself to the organization; because of her he had had to go to Chicago. She obsessed about the unknowns, wondering how she could have missed the signs.</p><p>Looking back, it seemed so obvious he\u2019d been saying good-bye.</p><p>Dia appeared around dawn on New Year\u2019s Eve, while Haven was already awake and waiting. She sat in the library with her knees pulled up to her chest, her arms wrapped around herself as she stared out the window. She wondered if it was what Carmine had been doing that last night, contemplating leaving just as she was.</p><p>Had he been frightened? She wasn\u2019t sure. He made leaving seem so easy.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Dia asked, having already placed Haven\u2019s things in Carmine\u2019s car the day before.</p><p>Haven nodded, unable to say the words. The truth was she felt like she would never be ready, but she got up and slipped on her coat anyway. Dia handed her Carmine\u2019s car key before heading for the stairs, and Haven hesitated in the library. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you downstairs. I need a minute.\u201d</p><p>Stepping into the doorway of the bedroom, Haven\u2019s eyes scanned the room slowly, her chest aching. A tear slipped down her cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood-bye,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>9</p><p>Haven walked blindly down the long hallway, the boxes in her arms obstructing her view. She shifted them around, trying to catch a glimpse in front of her, and ran straight into Dia.</p><p>Haven smiled apologetically but Dia simply waved it off as she pulled out a set of keys and opened her door. Haven juggled the boxes once more, careful not to run into anything else as she walked into the small, quiet apartment. Her footsteps faltered when Dia flicked on the light, illuminating the room surrounding her. Photos covered every surface, blanketing the paint like wallpaper.</p> <p>Haven had been here before, once, on her eighteenth birthday. She forgot Dia wanted to be a photographer.</p><p>Her eyes scanned the pictures instinctively, recognizing some of the faces, but they all felt foreign to her except one. Straight in front of her, on the wall above the couch, was an old photo of her and Carmine. His face was all over, infiltrating the sea of colorful memories, but this one was different. This one called to her, silently screaming her name above the others. Neither had even known the photo was being taken as they stared at each other that Christmas day more than a year before. Their love had been new, untainted and na\u00efve. Blissful ignorance shone from their eyes, two souls completely unaware of the anguish on the horizon.</p><p>Dia kicked the door shut, the slam echoing through the room and making Haven flinch. It suddenly felt as if the memory-clad walls were closing in on her. The boxes slipped from her arms, hitting the floor with a thud.</p><p>Stepping around them, Haven walked over to the couch and grabbed the photo, wordlessly yanking it off the wall.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dia said, setting the other boxes down. \u201cI should\u2019ve reminded you . . . warned you.\u201d</p> <p>Haven closed her eyes. Warning her they were there would have done nothing to dull the ache. It resided deep inside her, infecting her tissues and seeping into her bones, clenching her heart as it took over her chest. Her lungs felt stiff, like brand-new leather, stubbornly refusing to expand as she took a deep breath. She was suffocating from the pressure of what could have been.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered, forcing the words out. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Dia said something else, but Haven didn\u2019t wait to hear. She walked away, slipping into the spare bedroom and closing the door, pressing her back against it as she clutched the photo to her chest.</p><p>Sleep evaded Haven that night as she lay in bed, ringing in the New Year by staring out the foggy window. Fireworks went off in the distance, noise permeating the air as people in Charlotte celebrated, but Haven did nothing.</p><p>She hardly even moved.</p><p>When the early morning sun started to peek through, she gave up on finding sleep and quietly crept to the living room. The photos were all gone, the cream-colored walls vacant except for the subtle orange glow enveloping the apartment from the sunrise. Dia had taken them down sometime in the night, a few stray pieces of tape remaining. Haven pulled them off, rolling them together in a ball in her palm.</p> <p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>Haven turned, watching as her friend strolled out of a bedroom behind her. Dia wore a pair of orange polka-dotted pajamas, her hair knotted at the top of her head. She rubbed her eyes and yawned as she made her way toward the tiny kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Haven said quietly, glancing back at the empty walls. \u201cYour pictures are gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I thought it would be easier if you didn\u2019t have to see them,\u201d Dia mumbled sleepily, opening the fridge and pulling out a jug of milk. She poured herself a glass and saturated it with a mountain of chocolate syrup. \u201cAre you hungry? I think I have some cereal around here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head as Dia started toward her again. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you get hungry, help yourself to anything in the kitchen,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have much right now, but I\u2019ll grab some groceries on my way home.\u201d</p><p>Haven eyed her curiously. \u201cWay home from where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchool,\u201d she replied, sipping from her glass. \u201cI have to register for my classes today and buy my books.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stay with you, but I technically already missed registration, so it\u2019s my last chance,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t want to be alone, I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Haven said, cutting her off. She didn\u2019t want to be a burden. \u201cI have things to do today anyway. You know, like unpacking and . . . things.\u201d</p><p>Haven forced a smile, but Dia didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cWe can do something together when I get home. Maybe order a pizza and watch a movie? It\u2019ll be fun. We can have girl talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Haven said. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>Dia smiled warmly, giving her a quick hug before going about her morning ritual. Haven lingered in the living room, absentmindedly rolling the small ball of sticky tape between her fingers. Once Dia left, Haven headed back into the bedroom and shut the door, leaving her things in the boxes in the living room.</p><p>There was no pizza that night. No movie. No girl talk. There wasn\u2019t even sleep.</p><p>Days passed in a blur of insomnia and exhaustion, thrusting Haven deeper into depression. The nights were tortuous but the days weren\u2019t much better as Haven walked around in a stupor. She felt like she was drowning, slowly slipping away as she grasped desperately to the surface, just waiting for something to pull her back up.</p><p>Pain was something Haven knew well. She had always had a high tolerance for it, keeping her head held high as she faced unimaginable torture, but this feeling brewing inside of her now was different. The heart-clenching, suffocating dread was enough to knock her off her feet. She had been frightened before, certainly, but this was the first time she truly felt lost. Until then, her life had been an endless cycle of do-this-and-do-that; there was always a task, always a purpose, always a point. But not anymore. Her future was empty. A blank canvas. There was nowhere for her to escape from. There was nobody looking for her.</p><p>She was free, she realized, and freedom terrified her.</p><p>Luna Rossa sat back off the highway, partially shielded by rows of trees. The brick building, massive in size while subtle in style, blended into the surroundings of the quiet south Chicago neighborhood. The rustic tan sign above the door displayed the name in deep red cursive letters, the only indicator of its true nature the word lounge below it in gold. No flashing lights or neon signs attempted to lure passing visitors inside.</p><p>While it appeared welcoming, almost quaint at first glance, Luna Rossa catered to a certain crowd. The dark sedans spread throughout the parking lot hinted it was the type of place you didn\u2019t visit unless someone invited you to.</p><p>Carmine always found it strange that his uncle owned a social club, but standing in front of it for the first time, it made sense to him. The place was low-key, a lot like Corrado.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Carmine opened the door and stepped inside the building. The bouncer eyed him peculiarly, taking in the sight of his faded jeans and Nike\u2019s, but he didn\u2019t move or say a word as Carmine strolled through the crowd. It was a Thursday, and men in suits lingered around with a few younger women clinging to their sides. Goomahs, he realized. Mob mistresses. Luna Rossa was La Cosa Nostra\u2019s hideaway, their home away from home. It wasn\u2019t a place where a man took his wife\u2014it was a place he went when he had something to hide.</p><p>And it was easy to hide there. The dark wood with red trim, the lighting dim, concealed secrets and masked sins. Cigar smoke infused the air as Frank Sinatra crooned from tall speakers positioned along the side, blending with the sound of friendly chatter and laughter in the club.</p><p>Carmine felt completely out of place as he made his way to a large corner booth in the back. The noise coming from it was louder than the others, the table covered in an array of bottles of alcohol. Sal sat in the middle of the group, a young brunette woman snuggled up to his right. Beside her was another girl, a blonde no older than twenty, while half a dozen men surrounded them on both sides.</p><p>Carmine cleared his throat nervously as he approached. \u201cSalvatore.\u201d</p><p>Sal looked at the sound of his name, his face lighting up. \u201cPrincipe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, dear boy.\u201d Sal grinned widely as his hand swept across the table. \u201cJoin us. Have a drink.\u201d</p><p>Instead of squeezing in with the mass of bodies, Carmine grabbed a free chair and pulled it to the other side of their table. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not old enough to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even finish before Sal\u2019s mocking laughter cut him off. \u201cNonsense!\u201d He motioned for the waitress. \u201cGet my godson whatever he wants. Put it on my tab.\u201d</p><p>The waitress paused beside him, smiling politely. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, vodka,\u201d he said. \u201cStraight up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring him the whole bottle,\u201d Sal chimed in. \u201cSomething from the top shelf, sweetheart. Nothing but the best for young DeMarco.\u201d</p><p>Carmine forced a smile, but he got no satisfaction from Sal\u2019s words. The waitress returned after a moment with a bottle of Grey Goose and a thick glass, setting it in front of Carmine before walking away. He wordlessly poured himself a shot, feeling Sal\u2019s eyes on him as he swallowed it to ease his frayed nerves.</p><p>The burn was familiar. Warm. Numbing. He savored the sensation.</p><p>Sal\u2019s focus shifted back to the others, the conversation at the table flowing freely between the men. It made little sense to Carmine so he sat back quietly, sipping on the liquor as he tried to disappear into the background. His mind wandered, his eyes drifting toward the two girls. They giggled, hanging on to Sal\u2019s every word as if the bullshit he sprayed was made of pure gold. Carmine wondered what they saw in him, why they stuck around. Money? Presents? Did they get off on his power? Was it just for kicks? It sure as fuck couldn\u2019t have been attraction.</p><p>\u201cSo, Principe, are you settling in?\u201d Sal asked, capturing Carmine\u2019s attention again. He tore his eyes from the girls and looked to his godfather, who stared at him with his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He poured another drink. \u201cI\u2019m moving into my parents\u2019 old house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have all of your things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey arrived today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the girl?\u201d Sal asked. \u201cHas she arrived?\u201d</p><p>Carmine tensed, his glass to his lips. He set it down after a moment without taking a drink, afraid the liquor wouldn\u2019t make it past the lump in his throat. \u201cUh, no. She\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Sal\u2019s expression fell as concern clouded his face. Pulling his arm from around the brunette, he leaned closer to the table, his high-pitched voice uncharacteristically low. \u201cWhat do you mean she\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not coming,\u201d Carmine clarified.</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s, uh . . . not with me now.\u201d</p><p>Tension swept over the table. Sal remained strangely still, just staring at Carmine. Anger brewed in his dark eyes. The others sensed the shift in atmosphere and grew quiet, watching the two of them cautiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou broke up?\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded.</p><p>\u201cAfter what everyone risked for that girl, you\u2019re not even together anymore?\u201d</p><p>Again, he nodded.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s off on her own? Free to do as she wishes?\u201d</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Not a question that time, but Carmine nodded anyway.</p><p>After a bout of strained silence, Sal broke the tension by laughing once again, abruptly loud and genuinely amused. \u201cWell, I believe there\u2019s a lesson to be learned in there somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d someone else asked.</p><p>\u201cNo matter how beautiful you think a woman is,\u201d Sal said, \u201cshe\u2019s never worth the trouble.\u201d</p><p>The men erupted in cheers, toasting Sal\u2019s words, while Carmine remained silent. Picking up his glass, he sipped the hot liquor, absorbing the bitterness into his bloodstream. He watched as Sal turned back to the young brunette, putting his arm around her again. He pulled her to him, whispering, \u201cNot you, baby.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and giggled, while Carmine grimaced. Fucking sick.</p><p>\u201cThere is an upside, though,\u201d Sal declared, glancing back at Carmine. \u201cYou can join in the fun around here. There\u2019s no reason for you to have to go home alone tonight. I\u2019m sure Ashley\u2019s friend, Gabby, would be happy to show you a good time.\u201d</p><p>Carmine looked to the blonde when Sal motioned toward her. She smiled devilishly, her blue eyes scanning him slowly, surveying, and judging. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p> <p>Shaking his head, Carmine looked away from her. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your type?\u201d Sal asked. \u201cThere are plenty more around here\u2014redheads, blondes, brunettes, girls in all shapes and sizes. Just pick your poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just . . . not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy godson, not interested in a woman? Unheard of! Pick one. My gift to you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine tried to think of a way to explain it that didn\u2019t make him look susceptible. The last thing he wanted to do was expose his biggest weakness in front of so many. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in the mood,\u201d Sal said. \u201cThese ladies know what they\u2019re doing. Ten minutes alone with one and you\u2019ll be begging for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to remember you begging me once, Principe. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but wasn\u2019t it because of a girl? A girl you\u2019re no longer with, at that. Maybe you should\u2019ve just left her where she was. Maybe we\u2019d all be better off.\u201d</p> <p>Anger swept through Carmine. He clenched his hands into fists in his lap but fought to keep it from showing on his face. Sal stared at him, challenging him to react.</p><p>\u201cCome on now, Boss,\u201d Corrado\u2019s voice rang out directly behind Carmine, startling him. Heavy hands clamped down on his shoulders, keeping him locked in place so he couldn\u2019t turn around. \u201cCut the boy some slack. Even you know what it\u2019s like to make mistakes. He\u2019s just being cautious so he doesn\u2019t make another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s admirable.\u201d Sal relaxed again as he took a sip of his drink. \u201cThe last thing I want is another careless man on my team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially one that\u2019s careless with a woman,\u201d Corrado said.</p><p>Sal laughed bitterly. \u201cLike his father. Vincent\u2019s only flaw was his choice in females. Talk about a man who made mistakes . . .\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s calm mask slipped, his eyes narrowing. He shifted forward a fraction of an inch at the insinuation about his mother, preparing to pounce without a second thought, but Corrado\u2019s grip on Carmine tightened.</p><p>\u201cYou live and you learn,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cCarmine here will do both, hopefully . . . as long as he remembers his place. And I think right now, his place is at home. He hasn\u2019t even unpacked and he\u2019s already partying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, true.\u201d Sal waved his hand dismissively at Carmine. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p><p>Corrado let go of Carmine, stepping to the side so he could stand up. He glanced around the table one last time before nodding his head. \u201cGood night, sir.\u201d</p><p>He briskly walked away, relief soothing his nerves as he bolted for the exit. As he approached the bouncer, the man suddenly jumped from his seat and stood at attention. Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed at the reaction until he heard Corrado tell the man to relax. His uncle was right on his heels, walking out behind him.</p><p>\u201cThanks for that,\u201d Carmine said quietly once they were outside, taking a deep breath of the cold night air. A cloud surrounded him as he exhaled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, but I won\u2019t always be around,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cYou have to learn to control yourself, no matter what he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I just didn\u2019t expect that. I mean, fuck, he flipped on me quick. It caught me off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s testing you,\u201d Corrado said, \u201cand based on the little bit I saw, I have to say you\u2019re going to fail.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>After two weeks of fleeting hunger and fits of insomnia, Haven\u2019s grip started to slip. Every time there was a knock at Dia\u2019s door, a swell of hope ran through Haven that it was Carmine, but each time she would end up crushed all over again. She grew anxious, conjuring up wild scenarios of where he was and what he was doing. She couldn\u2019t understand how he tolerated being away from her. If he loved her as he claimed, he had to feel the same pain she did.</p><p>Didn\u2019t he?</p><p>She started imagining things that weren\u2019t there again, whispered voices in the night calling out to her as she struggled to find solace in sleep. She heard noises in the apartment, footsteps outside her door, and loud bangs that sent her heart wildly racing. It got to the point where it felt like someone was always there, lurking around the corner, watching, waiting. She could hear them moving around but they were always out of sight, never within her reach. He was haunting her, his memory lingering everywhere she looked, while his absence cruelly taunted her.</p><p>Until, suddenly, one day, she saw him there.</p><p>Haven stood in place, staring at the vision in front of her. Carmine sat in a dark room in nothing but a pair of gray sweatpants, hunched over his piano with his fingers ghosting across the ivory keys. He didn\u2019t press down on them. There was no music, no sound at all\u2014nothing but strangled silence.</p><p>Nothing but him.</p><p>She reveled in the sight, the contours of his muscles and the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed deeply. His hair was a mess, overgrown and unkempt, sticking up in every direction and falling forward into his eyes. She could even make out the scar on his side, shining a shade lighter than his naturally tanned skin. She longed to touch it, to trace the old wound with her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cTesoro.\u201d He whispered the word in a shaky voice, as if saying it any louder would hurt too much. \u201cTi amo.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out. She clutched her throat, startled, unable to find her voice. It was gone.</p><p>I love you, too, she thought. I always will.</p><p>\u201cOnly you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSempre.\u201d</p><p>Sempre.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d die without you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m yours. I always have been.</p><p>His shoulders slumped. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>For what?</p><p>\u201cI destroy everything I touch.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Not me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not you, yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will . . . if you let me.\u201d</p><p>You won\u2019t. She took a step closer. You wouldn\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>\u201cI hurt you when I left,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut I had to do it. I had to.\u201d</p><p>He slowly turned in her direction as he lifted his head, and Haven\u2019s heart pounded furiously as he looked straight at her. Instead of the bright vibrant green she had expected, there was nothing but darkness. There was no life, no light, no spark. His words were just as cold. \u201cI would\u2019ve destroyed you had I stayed.\u201d</p><p>A violent shiver tore down her spine as she frantically shook her head.</p><p>Over his heart, where the words Il tempo guarisce tutti i mali were inked on his skin, a small black circle appeared. She watched, horrified, as it expanded rapidly, his face twisting in anguish as the blackness took over his body.</p><p>A loud crack shook the walls as he vanished into the darkness.</p><p>Haven sat straight up in bed, her heart pounding erratically. It was pitch black, no streetlights shining through the window, not even the glow from the alarm clock nearby. She rubbed her burning eyes, disoriented, and colored splotches sprung up in her line of sight like splatters of translucent watercolor paint.</p><p>A severe storm waged outside, rain splattering against the building as the wind screeched. The noises echoed through the room as a prickly sensation danced across Haven\u2019s feverish skin, almost like there was an electrical charge in the air.</p><p>Glancing toward the bedroom door, her panic flared as a thump rang out in the living room. \u201cDia?\u201d she called out, her voice gritty. She swallowed harshly, trying to get a grip, and pushed the comforter away. Her legs shook as she tiptoed toward the door, pressing her ear against the crack to listen.</p><p>A gust of wind whipped by, violently rattling the window, and Haven turned to look. Confusion rocked her as her eyes fell upon the glass, and in the blurry reflection she caught a glimpse of a pair of eyes. Not just any eyes . . . familiar eyes, ones that had beckoned to her since the first time she gazed into them.</p><p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d she whispered, the pain in her chest intensifying at the sound of his name. Tears formed and she blinked, trying to force them back. When she reopened her eyes, the image was gone. \u201cCarmine!\u201d</p><p>Another strong gust of wind hit and the tears slipped past as she started to tremble. She hit the light switch, frantically flicking it up and down, but nothing happened. No electricity.</p><p>Flinging open the bedroom door, she gasped as shadows swept across the living room. She heard the click of the front door and panicked, looking up to see the chain lock dangling, swinging from having been disturbed.</p><p>\u201cDia,\u201d Haven yelled, running to her friend\u2019s bedroom. She pushed open the door without knocking and blinked to clear her vision, dread running through her when she saw the bed was empty. She quickly searched the house in the darkness, finding Dia nowhere.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d Haven said, panicking. Running back into the bedroom, she slipped on some shoes and grabbed her things in a frenzy before heading out of the apartment. In too much of a rush to wait for the elevator, she descended the six flights of stairs as fast as she could. She nearly tripped when she reached the second floor, pausing when she heard footsteps in front of her. A moment later they stopped and the outside door opened, a crack of thunder echoing through the building as whoever it was disappeared into the storm.</p><p>Rain pelted Haven the moment she stepped outside, the water startlingly cold against her skin. Stepping off the curb, she started to dart across the street for the Mazda when a yellow taxicab pulled up in front of her. A man climbed out from the back seat and was about to shut the door when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cYou need the taxi, lady?\u201d he asked. She stared at him, debating his question. She had no idea what she was doing, her confusion deepening as she took in his concerned expression. \u201cHello? Are you all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh, yes,\u201d she said, not sure if it were true or not. She brushed by him, mumbling thanks as she slid into the backseat. Her heart pounded rapidly and she fought back the sickness that built in her stomach as the guy slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere you headed?\u201d the driver asked, glancing in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cChicago.\u201d The word rolled from her lips before she processed what she was saying.</p><p>The driver laughed. \u201cCan\u2019t go that far, but I can drop you at the bus station.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded in a daze. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled onto the road. The rain bombarded the car, wind gusting and thunder cracking, making Haven jump every so often. She zoned out and couldn\u2019t focus, slipping further and further into a trance. She was too exhausted to stop and think, acting on impulse out of desperation.</p><p>When the cab stopped, she handed some cash to the driver without counting it first. She got out, standing on the curb in the pouring rain as the vehicle pulled away. The brick building in front of her was shabby, the blue GREYHOUND sign barely visible through the storm. Buses idled in the side parking lot while a few people lingered inside the brightly lit lobby, waiting.</p><p>Haven didn\u2019t have the slightest clue where to start. Her body shook as she approached the thick glass window in the building, dripping water all over the grimy tile floor.</p><p>The lady sitting in front of a computer eyed her peculiarly. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI, uh . . . I need to go to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Reaching into her pocket, Haven pulled out a wad of cash\u2014twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a ball of fives and ones, and a handful of loose change. She laid it all out on the counter, everything she had left in her pocket.</p><p>The lady counted it out, carefully unfolding the damp bills. \u201cThere\u2019s a bus that leaves here in about four hours for Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have enough?\u201d</p><p>The lady smiled, punching it into her computer and printing out a ticket. \u201cWith ten cents to spare.\u201d</p><p>Haven took the ticket, dropping the spare dime in an empty coffee cup that a homeless man held as he sat against the wall nearby. She quietly walked over to an empty metal bench, lying down on it as she waited. Four hours, she chanted in her head as she closed her tired eyes. Just four more hours.</p> <p>Sleep viciously pulled her away, deep in the throes of another surreal dream. The lightning that crashed outside the bus station translated as gunfire, pulling her into the middle of the warehouse shootout again. On and on it went, a cycle of violence she couldn\u2019t escape. She thrashed around on the hard bench, whimpering in her sleep, until someone shook her awake.</p><p>She sat up abruptly and her eyes fell upon the familiar man beside her. She scanned him quietly for a moment, blinking a few times, thinking if she waited he would fade away with the dream. \u201cDr. DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>He sat back against the hard bench with an exasperated sigh. He, too, was drenched from the storm, his wet hair slicked back on his head. His eyes, dark and expressive, avoided her for a long moment.</p><p>His proximity put her on edge, his presence alarming. Her heart pounded furiously as confusion set in. \u201cHow did you know . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaura and I tried to run away once,\u201d he said quietly, shaking his head. \u201cWe made it as far as the bus station, too.\u201d</p><p>Haven eyed him warily. \u201cI\u2019m not running away.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her declaration. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is dangerous. So many things could\u2019ve gone wrong . . . could still go wrong. You have the right to go where you want to go, but this just isn\u2019t smart.\u201d</p><p>Haven moved over a bit, settling on the bench a few inches from him. Her eyes scanned the building for a clock, finding one above the ticket window. Three and a half hours had passed. Her bus was scheduled to leave in thirty minutes.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember the day I took you to the hospital?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe sat in my office. I told you Carmine was na\u00efve and impulsive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrrational and volatile,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCarmine\u2019s always done things without thinking, and I was worried he\u2019d do the same with you. I honestly thought he\u2019d take you and run, because he\u2019s my son. Because he\u2019s so much like me. But he didn\u2019t. For probably the first time in his life, he considered the consequences.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot, you know. I lost my wife, but before that I lost my life. I gave it away by initiating. That\u2019s the world Carmine belongs to now. They tell him where to go and what to do, and if he doesn\u2019t . . . well, you know what happens when people disregard orders. He doesn\u2019t want you subjected to that, and I agree with him. I believe Chicago\u2019s the last place you should go, but if you decide you really want to, I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help.\u201d</p><p>Haven looked at him with surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not today,\u201d he said, his expression serious. \u201cCarmine needs time to figure things out, and quite frankly, so do you. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, unsure of how to answer. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you\u2019ve given life a chance, if you still want to go to Chicago, I\u2019ll make sure you get there, even if it\u2019s the last thing I do. But before you can choose to be with Carmine, you have to understand what you\u2019re giving up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco raised his hand to silence her. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do it for yourself, at least do it for Carmine. Show everyone he was right about you, that you\u2019re the person he believes you are. Prove everyone wrong who threw you aside, and prove Carmine right, because he needs it.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, standing. \u201cNow let\u2019s get you back to Dia\u2019s. She was terrified when she called me, thought you\u2019d been kidnapped again.\u201d</p><p>Shivering, Haven wrapped her arms around herself, guilt running rampant. She was chasing a ghost through the city, risking everything out of desperation, and scaring the few people who truly cared for her.</p><p>She followed Dr. DeMarco outside and slipped into the passenger seat of his Mercedes, which was parked haphazardly along the curb. He started it, cranking the heat to get her warm. She laid her head against the foggy side window, frowning as she faintly heard the intercom announce boarding for the bus to Chicago.</p><p>11</p><p>Things change.</p><p>Sometimes it\u2019s abrupt, knocking you off your feet as life throws a curveball nobody expected, turning worlds upside down and leaving those left behind to pick up the pieces. But other times, it happens slowly, an hour, or a minute, or a second at a time, so immeasurable no one can pinpoint exactly when it happened. You find yourself somewhere you\u2019ve never been, doing things you\u2019ve never done, being a person you never imagined you would ever be.</p><p>Because Dia was busy and everyone else she knew lived hundreds of miles away, Haven was often left on her own in the small Charlotte apartment. She ventured outside on the days she was alone, the fresh air and change of scenery helpful in clearing her mind. She would walk across the street to a small park and sit on one of the swings, the place deserted in the mornings because the weather was still cold. Haven welcomed the temperature, the icy air stinging her cheeks and reminding her she was still alive\u2014that no matter how much it hurt, or how much she felt like she was dying inside, she wasn\u2019t. She was still breathing, each exhale reaffirming that with a cloud of warm breath lingering in the air around her.</p><p>As long as she was still breathing, she was okay.</p><p>Dia helped guide Haven through the simple things, things Carmine had never gotten around to showing her, like how to mail letters and use a computer. Haven bought postcards at the store to send to Tess and Dominic across the country, and she set up an email account to keep in touch with them.</p><p>The sensation of seeing something in the mailbox addressed to her was indescribable. Most people took it for granted, communicating freely, but it was a big deal to her. It was proof she had an identity, that she was real.</p><p>The first time she received junk mail, a flyer from a local business about a sale, Haven was elated. She wasn\u2019t sure how they got her name and Dia shrugged it off, telling Haven to trash it, but she refused. She had been acknowledged as existing, like she was just another person in the world. She wasn\u2019t Haven Antonelli, former slave; she was Haven Antonelli, potential customer.</p><p>To her, that was everything.</p><p>Things went smoother after she decided to give life alone a chance, but she still had her moments. She missed Carmine immensely, her love never wavering. She often wrote him letters, too, but she never mailed them. Whether it was pride, or anger, or straight-up fear, something kept her from reaching out to him again.</p><p>Haven awoke one morning to sunlight pouring into the Charlotte apartment. Winter had faded away, January turning to February before March blossomed before her eyes. She climbed out of bed and opened the window, breathing in the fresh morning air as she looked out at the street below. The trees were full of lush green leaves, small flowers starting to bloom and freckle the landscape with color that hadn\u2019t been there the day before.</p><p>After getting ready for the day, Haven strolled out to the living room. It was quiet and still, Dia having already left. Where her books had been strewn out the night before lay a single pamphlet, a yellow sticky note attached to the front. Haven picked it up curiously before strolling into the small kitchen.</p><p>Thought you might be interested in this.\u2014Dia</p><p>Pouring a glass of juice, Haven sipped some as she opened the brochure. Charlotte Academy of Arts Spring Schedule was written along the top, followed by a list of upcoming workshops. She scanned them, stopping at one halfway down.</p><p>Painting 101</p><p>This free workshop will help students loosen up and see the world in a different light. Participants will experience the joy of painting, learning to express themselves in a new creative way. No experience needed. All materials included.</p><p>Mon\u2013Fri, March 12\u201323, noon\u20133 P.M.</p><p>March 12. Haven glanced at the calendar, realizing it was today.</p><p>She read the pamphlet three times before setting her glass on the counter. She debated for a moment, wondering if she could really do it, before shrugging away her doubts and grabbing her things. She headed out of the apartment, finding the Mazda parked in the lot across the street.</p><p>Hesitating, she ran her hand along the sleek hood before climbing into the driver\u2019s seat and starting it up.</p><p>She was nervous as she drove across town, chanting to herself the entire time: If not for you, do it for Carmine.</p><p>It took Haven a while to find the place and just as long to figure out where to park. By the time she stepped into the Charlotte Academy of Arts, it was already a quarter after twelve. Discouraged, she walked up to a lady sitting at a desk in the front lobby, clutching the pamphlet in her hand. \u201cI know it\u2019s probably too late, but I was wondering about the art class that started today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainting?\u201d the lady asked.</p><p>Haven nodded. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in luck,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s one opening left.\u201d</p><p>Haven filled out the paperwork, trying to keep her hand from shaking as she wrote her name. Once she registered, the lady showed her to the classroom. The lighting was dim, soft classical music playing from speakers in the ceiling. Art stations were set up in rows as a man stood in the front, sitting on top of a desk with his arms crossed over his chest as he scanned the class. His eyes settled on her and he smiled, walking over to the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have another student,\u201d the lady said, handing him the paperwork. \u201cHaven Antonelli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasure to meet you,\u201d he said, shaking her hand. \u201cLet me show you to your place.\u201d</p><p>He situated her at the last empty station and instructed her to just explore today. She sat there for a moment, staring at the blank canvas when he walked away. A smile tugged her lips as she picked up a paintbrush, dipping it into a container of red paint.</p><p>She started off by drawing a simple heart in the center.</p> <p>For the first time, Haven arrived home after Dia that night. She headed up the stairs to the sixth floor apartment close to dusk, her first painting tucked under her arm. Dia was sitting on the floor in the living room, stacks of freshly developed photos sprawled out around her. She looked up when Haven walked in, her eyes darting straight to the wrapped canvas.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d she asked, her voice guarded.</p><p>\u201cIt was good,\u201d Haven said. \u201cI liked it.\u201d</p><p>Dia took the painting from her, unwrapping it and holding it up, examining the streaks of color and distorted hearts. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing! Let\u2019s hang it up!\u201d</p><p>Haven laughed. \u201cIt was just practice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d Dia waded through her sets of photographs on the way to the closet to find a hammer and nails. She jumped up on the couch with it and crookedly hung the canvas in the center of the wall above it. She leaped down when she was finished and surveyed her handiwork. \u201cIt\u2019s your first painting! You should be proud.\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at it for a moment, a smile tugging her lips. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><p>Every night that week, after Haven arrived home from her class, another painting joined the first one on the wall. Soon dozens of photographs surrounded them, new ones that Dia had taken over the few months Haven had been there. Their surroundings, once stripped bare to avoid facing pain, were again alive with vibrant color and happy memories.</p><p>La Cosa Nostra in Chicago runs differently than the factions in the east. In New York, the five families maintain separate entities within the city while still belonging to a bigger organization as a whole. The bosses, the commission, meet regularly to discuss business and hash out solutions, maximizing profit while lowering the infighting. It\u2019s a committee, a congress of elected Mafia officials, voting and drafting and governing with their guidelines.</p><p>It\u2019s a democracy, in other words. Bloody and violent and entirely illegal, but still a democracy, nonetheless.</p><p>Not in Chicago. For decades, Chicago has been a strict dictatorship. They often try to give the illusion of fairness within the ranks, and the men play along to feel important, but nobody is truly fooled. One man runs it all. One man makes all the rules. One man decides whether you live or die.</p> <p>Because of this, New York and Chicago have had a rocky relationship from the beginning. Sometimes they love each other, sometimes they hate each other, but there is always a bit of lingering jealousy. For the bosses in the east crave the independence the Chicago Don holds, while the men in the Windy City yearn for more control.</p><p>Under Antonio DeMarco\u2019s reign, the cities maintained open communication, but that had since fallen apart. They had taken to calling on each other for favors whenever one needed something, strained allies in a bigger war, but the last time someone in New York called, Salvatore ignored their pleas.</p><p>And if you aren\u2019t friends, you may as well be enemies.</p><p>Bitter blood simmered and deals were kept off the record, money passing between the cities under the bosses\u2019 noses. No one knew if they were fully aware of what went on, if they got a taste when all was said and done, but one thing was undeniable: the respect was dead.</p><p>Because of that, everyone was fair game, and they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to turn against each other. They found themselves in tumultuous times . . . another source of contention Corrado didn\u2019t want to have to deal with.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we with this casino deal?\u201d Sal asked, swirling scotch around in his glass as he casually lounged in a chair in his den. Men sat around quietly, some steadily drinking while others, like Corrado, were just biding time until they could go.</p><p>Silence strangled the room. Nobody answered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like that?\u201d Sal asked, bitterness lacing his voice. \u201cNone of you have anything to say? You\u2019re supposed to be the best, but none of you can talk? None of you can make this happen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d a Capo muttered from the other side of the room. \u201cIt can\u2019t be done, Boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Sal said. \u201cNothing\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>With so much heat on the organization, the Fed\u2019s attention focused on their dealings close to home, Sal was shifting business elsewhere. But while they had been busy maintaining control of a chaotic Chicago, clashing with the Russians while dealing with a long-standing Irish feud, their New York counterparts had spread throughout the country. The problem with that, however, was those factions held a grudge, so all Sal faced were roadblocks and swift denials when trying to expand.</p><p>Nobody wanted to do business with the Salamander.</p><p>\u201cThe guy who owns the casino grew up in Manhattan,\u201d the Capo explained. \u201cHe\u2019s under protection. We can\u2019t funnel money through there without approval, and they ain\u2019t giving it. Not to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake them,\u201d Sal said. \u201cDon\u2019t let them say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart another war? Over a casino?\u201d</p><p>Sal shook his head, taking a small swig from his glass. \u201cIt\u2019s principle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s suicide.\u201d</p><p>A dry, unmistakable laugh cut through the room. Corrado turned his head to where Carlo stood, casually leaning against the wall. \u201cSince when are we cowards? We don\u2019t back down or ask for permission. We take what we want.\u201d</p><p>Sal nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad someone here gets it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Carlo said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about it, Boss. You need their cooperation? I\u2019ll get it. I have ways. You know these kind of deals are my specialty.\u201d</p><p>A sinister smile twisted Sal\u2019s mouth. \u201cI know I can count on you.\u201d</p><p>Murmurs filtered through the room in waves, but Corrado remained silent, waiting until Sal dismissed them with a flippant wave of the hand. He stood up, nodding to the boss before heading out of the mansion.</p><p>Corrado drove straight home, finding his house dark and quiet. There was no sign of Celia anywhere, and for once, Corrado was grateful to return to an empty home. He packed a bag, not even bothering to turn on a light, and scribbled a quick note to his wife.</p><p>Don\u2019t wait up for me.</p><p>Celia wouldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t anymore. She knew if he hadn\u2019t arrived by a certain hour, he likely wouldn\u2019t make it home that night, so she would go to bed with nothing but hope in her heart that she would see him the next day\u2014alive and well and about as whole as a man like him could possibly be.</p><p>Corrado headed to the airport that night, buying a ticket on a red-eye flight to Washington, D.C. His plane landed close to dawn and he rented a car, driving to a small diner on the other side of Arlington, Virginia. He had been there twice before, years ago, in the company of the man he was looking for that morning.</p><p>The quaint diner was fairly empty at that early hour, all of the booths vacant, with a few customers scattered along the stools around the bar. A bell above the door chimed when Corrado walked inside, everyone casually turning to look at him except for the one he was there to see. Corrado slid onto the stool beside him, their elbows ever so slightly brushing. The man tensed, a cup of coffee halfway to his lips, as his eyes slid toward Corrado.</p><p>Corrado tipped his head slightly in greeting. \u201cSenator Brolin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Mr. Moretti.\u201d He set his cup down before glancing behind him, cautiously surveying their surroundings. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to speak to you,\u201d Corrado said.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where to find me?\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head as he peered at the man. \u201cYou come here every morning for coffee, two creams but no sugar, and a wheat bagel with a bit of strawberry cream cheese before heading into the city for work.\u201d</p><p>Shock registered on the man\u2019s face. \u201cHow . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, give me some credit, Senator. You think I don\u2019t do my homework?\u201d</p><p>Senator Cain Brolin hailed straight from New York City, born and raised near Hell\u2019s Kitchen in Manhattan. He hung with the wrong crowd growing up, had befriended some unlikely men before running for office, and it was through those men that he had crossed Corrado\u2019s path. He, along with another senator from Illinois, had been involved in a labor scheme years before with the New York and Chicago families, rigging bids on government construction sites so Mafia-controlled companies got the jobs for a hefty profit.</p><p>They still did it, as far as Corrado knew, but Salvatore had been cut out of the scheme long before, deemed too much of a risk.</p><p>A waitress walked up before Senator Brolin had a chance to respond, interrupting their conversation. \u201cWhat can I get you, dear? Coffee?\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cJust water. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t drink coffee,\u201d Senator Brolin said. \u201cIt upsets his stomach.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stared at the man as the waitress walked away. \u201cI see I\u2019m not the only one who pays attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Mr. Moretti.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet until the waitress returned with Corrado\u2019s water. The two men moved to a booth in the back, away from nosy ears and prying eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want?\u201d Senator Brolin asked, picking at his bagel but eating none. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a man who makes social visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want something . . . I need something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, if it\u2019s about your pending case, I\u2019ll tell you the same thing I told Dr. DeMarco. I can\u2019t really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about that,\u201d Corrado cut him off, his eyes narrowing. \u201cDeMarco? You spoke to Vincent about the RICO case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a few weeks ago. He contacted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know, really. We didn\u2019t get that far. He asked what kind of influence I had within the justice department, if any. I told him my hands were tied there and the conversation ended.\u201d</p><p>That made absolutely no sense to Corrado but he shook it off, making a mental note to come back to it later. He didn\u2019t have time to be concerned about what his brother-in-law was up to. There were more immediate things needing to be dealt with. \u201cWell, like I said, this isn\u2019t about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a new place in Connecticut Salvatore wants to do business with\u2014Graves Resort &amp; Casino. Guy named Samuel Graves owns it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of it,\u201d Senator Brolin said. \u201cGraves grew up with the underboss of the Calabrese family. He\u2019s a friend of mine. They both are, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that much. And the Calabrese family isn\u2019t our biggest fan these days. The Amaro family, the Geneva family, sure . . . I still have connections. But the Calabrese family?\u201d Corrado shook his head. Sal had offended them one too many times. \u201cWithout their approval, no deal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to get this partnership to go through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Corrado scoffed, leaning back against the booth. \u201cBecause they\u2019re going to push for this to happen one way or another, whether it is done amicably or otherwise. They\u2019re already making plans to escalate the matter. And I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to tell you, Senator, what might happen if a war breaks out between New York and Chicago.\u201d</p> <p>Senator Brolin continued to pick at his bagel, his eyes downcast as he quietly sat deep in thought. \u201cWhy this casino?\u201d he asked finally. \u201cYou have men down in Vegas already. Why not focus there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much attention in Vegas,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cThe gaming commission is all over us. Half of us can\u2019t legally step foot inside a casino there, myself included. We have to look elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He shoved his plate aside, glancing at his watch before meeting Corrado\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to some friends and see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll owe me,\u201d Senator Brolin said, tossing some cash on the table before standing. \u201cYou know how it goes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Corrado said. He would expect no less. \u201cA favor for a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d Senator Brolin put on his coat, shaking his head. \u201cAlthough, to be honest, keeping the peace is a favor to all of us . . . and it seems to be getting harder and harder as the years go by. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into that boss of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Corrado said to himself as the man walked away. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>Corrado was back home by dusk that night. He walked into his house to find his wife fast asleep in their bed, her cell phone clutched tightly in her hand. He pried it out, setting it on the small wooden stand beside the bed, and kissed her warm forehead before leaving for his club to do some work. It was a Thursday\u2014the busiest night of the week for his business. The weekends were usually reserved for family dealings for Mafiosi, celebrations and obligatory dates with wives, whereas Thursday night was when the men let loose.</p><p>He stepped into Luna Rossa, waving off the security guard when he jumped to attention, and strolled toward his office in the back. His footsteps faltered about halfway there when the Boss\u2019s high-pitched voice called his name.</p><p>\u201cCorrado!\u201d Sal gestured for him to join them at the booth. \u201cCome, have a drink. Celebrate with us!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we celebrating?\u201d Corrado asked, pulling a chair up as he motioned for his favorite waitress. \u201cBring me my usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re celebrating the casino deal,\u201d Sal said. \u201cIt\u2019s finally gone through.\u201d</p><p>Corrado raised his eyebrows. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>The waitress walked over, holding out a small glass full of clear liquid to Corrado. \u201cHere you go, sir. Top shelf. Chilled, just as you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d Corrado reached into his pocket and pulled out some cash, holding it out to her as a tip. She took it and scampered away as Corrado took a sip from his glass. The cold liquid soothed his throat, going down smooth.</p><p>FIJI Natural Artesian Water. No one ever asked him what he drank. They all preferred dark liquor\u2014scotch, brandy, sometimes even bourbon\u2014so they didn\u2019t bother inquiring about what was in his glass.</p><p>\u201cCarlo didn\u2019t even have to do, uh . . . whatever it is he does.\u201d Sal motioned toward Carlo sitting off to the side, his arm around a young blonde woman. \u201cSeems they came to their senses on their own. Called about an hour ago and said the deal was on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Corrado said, taking another drink. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know who we can count on these days.\u201d</p> <p>12</p><p>The black dress shoes, half a size too small, made it difficult for Carmine to wiggle his toes. The suit, crisp and brand new, was stifling, the material scratching his skin as he rode in the passenger seat of Corrado\u2019s Mercedes.</p><p>Uncomfortable, he tugged at his blue silk tie. It suffocated him, like a noose tied around his neck. He wanted nothing more than to loosen his collar and take off the coat, maybe even kick off the damn shoes, but he was pretty sure that would only irritate his uncle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Corrado asked as if on cue, cutting his eyes to him from the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cStop fidgeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d Carmine shifted in the seat and pushed the small switch to lower the automatic window, but nothing happened. Corrado had them locked. \u201cIt\u2019s a furnace in this car. I\u2019m sweating like I\u2019m in a fucking sweat box here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a way with words,\u201d Corrado deadpanned. \u201cI advise you to keep your day job.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rolled his eyes. Like he had a choice. \u201cDo you have the heat on or something?\u201d</p><p>Corrado shrugged him off. \u201cIt\u2019s just your nerves.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to argue, but he couldn\u2019t. They were heading to a party at Sal\u2019s house and Carmine was on edge. He hadn\u2019t wanted to go, making excuses to get out of it, but even the social gatherings were mandatory.</p><p>\u201cStay away from the alcohol tonight,\u201d Corrado warned him.</p><p>Carmine looked at him incredulously. Not drink?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be in a room with some of the most dangerous men in the country,\u201d Corrado said, noticing the question in his expression. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to be coherent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Carmine asked bitterly. \u201cI thought we were all family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are family,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cAnd you saw what I did to my only sister.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s stomach lurched at the memory.</p><p>By the time they reached Sal\u2019s mansion, Carmine was pouring sweat. He took a deep breath, trying to relax as he followed his uncle to the door. A young girl swiftly opened it for them. She didn\u2019t speak, nor did her eyes move from the floor.</p><p>Once they were inside, she closed the door and positioned herself against the wall out of the way. She couldn\u2019t have been older than seventeen, a skinny girl with blonde hair and pale skin.</p><p>Carmine eyed her cautiously, knowing what she was right away. Her body language, the way she slinked into the background like a chameleon blending in with its surroundings, told him a story no words would ever say.</p><p>The pressure in his chest nearly bucked his knees as he thought of Haven.</p><p>\u201cCarmine! Corrado!\u201d</p><p>Sal\u2019s voice drew Carmine\u2019s attention away from the girl. His godfather approached, his arm around his wife\u2019s waist. She scowled, sipping a glass of champagne, refusing to lower herself by speaking to any of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you gentlemen could make it,\u201d Sal said, pulling away from her to hold his hand out. Carmine fought a grimace as he pressed his lips to the back of it, near the man\u2019s massive gold ring.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p><p>Sal raised his eyebrows, dramatically looking over Corrado\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd your wife? Where is Celia this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s feeling under the weather tonight,\u201d Corrado replied.</p><p>\u201cAh, such a pity. Send her my well wishes, will you?\u201d</p><p>Corrado nodded, and it took everything in Carmine not to roll his eyes. There was nothing wrong with Celia. She had just refused to spend her evening with them.</p><p>They delved into conversation and Carmine lingered there, knowing it was expected of him. People sought out Sal all evening long as they arrived, and he always made a point to introduce them to Carmine. He plastered a smile to his lips as he played along with the game\u2014pretend to like them, pretend to have fun, pretend there\u2019s nowhere in the world he would rather be.</p><p>Pretend he didn\u2019t want to fucking punch somebody in the face.</p><p>Each minute felt like forever, the two hours that passed an entire lifetime in his mind. Sal constantly chattered, boasting and bragging as he showed off for Carmine. He was being groomed, he realized. Sal was already trying to mold him into one of them, a puppet, a soldier, by poisoning his mind with thoughts of money, power, and respect.</p><p>He waited until Sal was drunk before slipping away from the group, hoping he would be forgotten. The smile fizzled from his face as he strolled through the house, heading straight for the drink table. He grabbed a small glass and filled it from an open liquor bottle, disregarding Corrado\u2019s warning. The burn lessened the pressure in his chest, unwinding the knots and loosening his taut muscles.</p><p>He leaned against the table as he drank, his attention shifting to the front door. Hours had passed, yet the girl still stood there, as silent and still as ever. He studied her, wondering where she had come from and how long she had been trapped in Sal\u2019s home. He couldn\u2019t recall her ever being there before.</p><p>She snuck a peek after a moment, tipping her head up slightly so her blue eyes met his. Her brow furrowed when she saw him watching her, and she dropped her gaze again quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Carmine asked curiously.</p><p>She peeked up once more but didn\u2019t have a chance to respond before laughter sounded out behind him. Carmine turned at the noise of a clinking liquor bottle and froze, the glass nearly slipping from his hand as he stared at the badly scarred face. The familiarity took his breath away.</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Annie, I think,\u201d Carlo said, casually pouring a glass of scotch.</p><p>\u201cAbby,\u201d the girl whispered, her voice shaking as she corrected him.</p><p>\u201cNot that it matters,\u201d Carlo continued, shrugging. \u201cYou can call her anything you want.\u201d</p><p>Carmine couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from him. Everything about the man screamed vile, from his callous words to his horrid face. \u201cI prefer to call her by her name.\u201d</p><p>Carlo looked over at him, studying him carefully. \u201cDeMarco\u2019s kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d Carlo brought his glass to his lips. \u201cShe\u2019s your type.\u201d</p><p>Anger swept through Carmine. He fought to control himself, forcing his feet to stay where they were. He wouldn\u2019t be provoked. Not here, not now. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no reason to be ashamed,\u201d Carlo said. \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019ve always liked to sample the help, too. Little Annie over there is a sweet thing. Submissive. Didn\u2019t even put up a fight. Not that any of them do. Well, except yours. Feisty one, isn\u2019t she? Didn\u2019t get that from her mother.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s rage spiraled over. \u201cYou son of a\u2014!\u201d</p><p>Before he could leap over the liquor table and pound his fists into the man\u2019s grotesque face, the noise in the room grew louder as a slew of guests filtered in. They scattered through, some heading for the door while others made their way to the back den. Carlo took a step back, tipping his glass at Carmine with a menacing smile. \u201cNice to officially meet you, kid. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>He sauntered away as Corrado approached, grabbing the glass from Carmine\u2019s hand and slamming it on the table. \u201cYour ability to listen is astounding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what that motherfucker just said to me?\u201d Carmine asked, clenching his hands into fists. \u201cHe just\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrado cut him off. \u201cI don\u2019t care. He\u2019s made, Carmine. You don\u2019t disrespect a man who earned his button.\u201d</p><p>Those words did nothing to lessen his temper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to leave,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cParty\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Carmine remained in place, looking to his uncle as he started walking through the house. Corrado clearly planned to stay. \u201cHow am I going to get home?\u201d</p> <p>Corrado grabbed a guy as he strolled past, clutching the collar of his shirt to stop him from leaving. \u201cTake DeMarco here home, will you?\u201d</p><p>The guy nodded tersely. Corrado posed it as a question, but they all knew it wasn\u2019t open for negotiation. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how,\u201d Corrado said before disappearing into the den.</p><p>Carmine followed the guy outside, finally loosening his tie and pushing his sleeves up as he went. The guy was fairly young, mid-twenties at most, with bushy eyebrows and short brown hair. He wore a pair of baggy jeans and a plain white t-shirt that made Carmine bitter. Why had he been forced to put on a suit?</p><p>He expected to be led to yet another Mercedes, but was surprised when the guy stopped beside an old gray Impala. Carmine eyed it peculiarly. \u201cThis is yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the guy said, unlocking the doors so they could climb in. \u201cSomething wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just thought . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I\u2019d drive one of those?\u201d he asked with a laugh, nodding toward the row of black cars. \u201cI wish I could afford one. Maybe someday. But for now, this baby will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d Carmine said, settling into the cracked leather passenger seat. The interior was stained and it smelled like a combination of oil and sweat, but he felt more at ease in it than he had in Corrado\u2019s car.</p><p>Laughter cut through the air, nearly drowned out by the engine roaring to life. It rumbled as the car shimmied, violently shaking as it almost cut off. \u201cShe\u2019s a piece of shit, man, but she\u2019s paid for.\u201d</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t say much during the drive, but the guy\u2019s endless chatter filled the car the entire time. It was distracting and consuming\u2014exactly what he needed. When Carmine was busy listening, he had little time to think, little time to dwell on the things that kept him awake at night.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until they had pulled onto his street and the car slowed near his house that it struck Carmine\u2014he never gave the guy directions. \u201cHow do you know where I live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re a DeMarco. Your family is like royalty, and even a fucking British hobo knows where Buckingham Palace is.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head. He should have known. \u201cThanks for the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, man. I\u2019m Remy, by the way. Remy Tarullo.\u201d</p><p>Carmine opened the car door but froze when that name struck him. \u201cTarullo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like the pizzeria over on Fifth Avenue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny relation?\u201d Carmine asked.</p><p>Remy nodded. \u201cMy pops owns the place.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine\u2019s mouth went dry. He suddenly felt like he couldn\u2019t swallow. He hadn\u2019t been there in a long time, but he knew the place well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go around there much, though,\u201d Remy continued. \u201cPops doesn\u2019t really agree with my life, if you know what I mean. Well, hell, never mind. I guess you don\u2019t know. Yours is a part of this. You don\u2019t have to deal with him looking at you like you\u2019re a disappointment, like you\u2019re fucking up everyone\u2019s life being a part of this.\u201d</p><p>Carmine said nothing, because Remy was wrong. He knew that feeling well.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m rattling on here,\u201d Remy said, tinkering with an old gold watch around his wrist. \u201cSorry, man. Just a sore spot, especially since what happened to my little brother.\u201d</p><p>Those words made his heart rate spike. Dean Tarullo. Carmine nearly forgot all about the boy from the warehouse. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got mixed up with the wrong people, I guess. Disappeared months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s missing?\u201d</p><p>Remy\u2019s voice was quiet. \u201cYeah, but not the kind of missing that\u2019ll ever be found, if you get what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>Gunshots flashed in Carmine\u2019s mind, the memory of Corrado silencing the boy forever infiltrating his mind.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carmine muttered. \u201cI know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Haven sat on the green metal park bench, watching the activity all around her. She had just gotten out of her last art class and her final project lay beside her, the canvas carefully wrapped and secured in brown paper.</p><p>It surprised Haven how therapeutic painting turned out to be, two weeks of art doing what three months of waiting and crying couldn\u2019t begin to touch. It opened up a part of her, exposing her nerves for the world to touch. Drawing was technical, the lines and details needing to be precise, but she could let go while painting and pour her emotions into it. Each piece of artwork held special meaning, but she knew others would look at it and see something entirely different.</p><p>She enjoyed that about art, like it held a hidden code only she had the key to. She was telling her story, getting out every gritty detail of her tortured life, but people were none the wiser. She could never tell the world, but there was nothing that said she couldn\u2019t show them . . . as long as they didn\u2019t know what they were looking at.</p><p>Haven sat there for a while, enjoying the peaceful spring evening, before gathering her things and heading across the street to the apartment. It was approaching dusk, and Dia would already be home from her classes. They had made plans to go out to commemorate the end of her workshop, but Haven didn\u2019t feel much like celebrating. She felt another void deep inside now that it was over.</p><p>She reached their building, walking into the lobby as the elevator opened. A man stepped out of it wearing a black baseball cap and spotted her, holding the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, smiling politely.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>She stepped into the elevator and pushed the number 6 button, humming to herself as the elevator dinged with each floor. She strolled down the hallway to the apartment, finding the door wide open with Dia in the living room. She held a small brown box up, shaking it zealously before holding it to her ear. Her hair was a soaked mess of colored streaks sculpted on top of her head, chemical fumes from hair dye potent in the air.</p><p>Haven shut the door behind her and dropped her canvas beside the door. \u201cWhat in the world are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Dia swung around, startled, and smiled sheepishly for having been caught. \u201cJust trying to figure out what\u2019s inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not mine,\u201d Dia said, holding it out. \u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Haven gaped at the box. \u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy just dropped it off a second ago.\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times. \u201cThe mailman?\u201d Who would send her a package? Dominic? Tess? Maybe Celia?</p><p>\u201cActually, I think he was a police officer.\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at her as those words sunk in. \u201cDid he tell you he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t say much, just asked if you lived here and left the box. I should\u2019ve asked him, but I didn\u2019t think about it. He would\u2019ve had to tell me, you know. They can\u2019t lie when you ask them.\u201d Dia thrust the box forward. \u201cI need to go wash my hair. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Haven looked over the cardboard box, seeing no labels, nothing but a piece of packaging tape securing it closed. She cut the tape with a knife and opened the flaps, her brow furrowing.</p><p>Inside was a large clear plastic bag labeled EVIDENCE, holding a normal-looking notebook. Haven picked it up, along with a piece of paper addressed to her from the Department of Justice office in Chicago.</p><p>Miss Antonelli,</p><p>We send our sincerest regrets for the inadvertent seizure of your journal. It was done in error and has been returned to you in the same condition as when it was confiscated. Again, please accept our apologies. We appreciate your understanding.</p><p>Special Agent Donald Cerone</p><p>U.S. DOJ</p><p>She blinked in shock and tore the notebook from the bag. She couldn\u2019t breathe as she scanned the pages of jumbled writing, her deepest, darkest secrets on display in front of her eyes. They had seen them. They had read them. They knew where she had come from. They knew what she was.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dia asked, returning from her room within a matter of minutes. She rubbed her wet hair with a white towel, streaks of color now staining it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, uh . . . a notebook,\u201d Haven replied. \u201cThey took it when Dr. DeMarco was arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, damn. I thought it was something cool.\u201d Dia pouted for a second before perking back up. \u201cSo, are we going out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d Haven said, still staring at the notebook. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day. Maybe tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow I\u2019m going to go to Durante for spring break, remember? You can come along if you want. We could hang out down at Aurora Lake.\u201d</p><p>The thought of going back to Durante made her head pound even harder. She wasn\u2019t ready to see that place again. \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRain check, then,\u201d Dia said. \u201cAfter I get back, we\u2019re going to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>A strong breeze blew through the abandoned ranch house in Blackburn from an open window on the first floor. Desert sand swirled along the wooden walkways like mini cyclones, sullying Corrado\u2019s dress shoes. His nose tickled as he breathed in the soiled air, the scent of festering mildew mingling with the dust. It blanketed everything visible like a dull, gray shield, tarnishing colors and hiding the otherwise obvious flaws in the house\u2014the old bloodstain on the floor in the foyer, the gashes in the wood from where someone had once been chained to the banister like a dog.</p><p>It appeared like just another forgotten stop along the desolate highway\u2014nothing special, nothing out of the usual hidden beneath the layer of filth\u2014but Corrado knew the truth. He had heard the stories and witnessed enough first hand to know the seemingly innocent house was practically a portal straight to Hell.</p><p>And the gatekeeper, he knew, had been his own sister.</p><p>The place hadn\u2019t been touched in months, not since the day three people had died in the adjacent stable. He had done a quick clean-up job, ridding the grounds of everything incriminating, but the rest was to be left to Haven, the next of kin.</p><p>The estate was nearly settled, every penny of the Antonelli\u2019s money transferred to an account for the girl. All that was left to deal with were the possessions, Katrina\u2019s love for material things evident in the clutter.</p><p>Corrado wasn\u2019t a superstitious man. He would often have to restrain himself from mocking Gia DeMarco during one of her delusory outbursts, but being there, strolling through the dead-silent house, he could feel the evil that still resided in it. It suffocated him, the air thick with hatred and bad intentions. It clung to everything, desperate and unyielding, trying to find its way inside him so it could live on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was too strong, too stubborn, to let it seep into his lungs or burrow in his chest. Instead it skimmed the surface, bristling his hair as it crawled across his skin, unforgiving and stifling. He had killed his sister, disposed of her, but the demons that possessed her, the pride and envy and vengefulness and bitter rage, remained. And he could feel it all around him, shoving against him, trying to force him back out with each step he took.</p><p>Doing his best to ignore the sensation, he spent the next hour going through the house, sifting through desk drawers and scouring rooms, looking for anything the girl might want. He thoroughly tossed the place, turning furniture upside down and destroying things with no regard in his search. He came up empty in the way of personal effects, but he found a bit of hidden cash and some jewelry he could sell for her. The rest wasn\u2019t salvageable in his eyes, nothing worth saving.</p><p>No photographs. No mementos. No nothing in the way of admitting she was family or that anyone who ever lived in that home cared she existed.</p><p>He was in a downstairs closet, throwing things around, when he hit a wall panel and knocked it loose. He kicked it aside, peering into the hole, and caught a flash of something silver. He reached inside, felt around, and grabbed a handle, having to use some force to yank it out, a heavy cloud of dust coming with it. Corrado coughed forcefully as it infiltrated his lungs, his eyes stinging.</p> <p>After stepping back out of the closet, Corrado surveyed the object with puzzlement. It was a vintage Halliburton aluminum briefcase, heavy and expensive. Age had dulled the outside, but it held sturdily together.</p><p>He tried to pry it open to no avail, striking at the lock, before conceding and throwing it to the floor. He considered leaving it there, frustrated, but something nagged him not to. It had clearly been hidden away for years, maybe decades. He couldn\u2019t fathom what the briefcase contained that warranted such protection.</p><p>It was a riddle to him, a puzzle . . . a mystery he needed to solve.</p><p>Giving up, he snatched it from the floor again and headed outside, tossing it into the back seat of his rental car. He stared at the house, still feeling his skin trying to slink away. Dusk had come upon him, nighttime approaching fast as the sun dipped behind the desert cliffs. After debating for a long moment, he went back inside and gathered some books and clothing in the room with the open window. Finding a container of paint thinner in the cellar, he splashed a bit on the belongings before pulling a book of Luna Rossa matches from his pocket. He struck a single match and stared at the flame briefly before tossing it onto the pile.</p><p>It ignited swiftly as Corrado made his way back out to the car, leaving the front door wide open. He pulled away from the property, heading for the highway out of Blackburn. There was enough wind blowing and dirt in the dry air to cover his tire tracks, enough oxygen in the house to be certain the entire thing would go up in flames. Given the isolated location and the darkening sky, it would be hours before someone spotted the smoke, sufficient time for it to burn to the ground.</p> <p>An orange glow lit up the bottom floor of the house when Corrado glanced in the rearview mirror. Mixing with the burn of sunset, it illuminated the ground surrounding it. The tension in his muscles receded as he watched it, the clawing at his skin fading away.</p><p>A small smile lifted the corner of his lips. What better way to send the evil back to Hell than a fiery grave?</p><p>13</p><p>While Dia was on her way to Durante to visit her parents, Haven awaited a visitor of her own. She sat in the living room of the quiet apartment, the notebook from the federal agent laying on her lap. She had flipped through it countless times, rereading passages as she hoped the words would somehow change.</p><p>They weren\u2019t, though. Every time she looked at them, they seemed to get worse. It was all there in black-and-white, everything she had promised to never tell spelled out with utter simplicity.</p><p>She felt like she was going to be sick.</p> <p>There was a knock after a while, firm and determined. Haven set the notebook down and opened the door, her heart hammering against her rib cage. Dr. DeMarco walked in without a word and she closed the door behind him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not bothering me,\u201d he said, pausing in the living room. His eyes lingered on the wall splattered with art and photos before he turned to her. \u201cI\u2019m glad you called. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>She pointed to the table where the notebook lay. \u201cI had no idea they had it.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco picked it up and sighed. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Cerone showed it to me. He thought I would crack if I knew what you\u2019d written.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach dropped so hard it was like she had taken a ten-story fall, stopping just shy of slamming into the concrete. She swayed, needing to sit down. \u201cYou read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe read a few passages to me, but I couldn\u2019t help that.\u201d</p> <p>Her head swam as she ran through possibilities of what he might have heard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I really am. I was upset when I wrote some of it and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cYou have every right to feel how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they know the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government knows about me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but there\u2019s nothing they can do about it. You have an expectation of privacy with your diary. They can\u2019t use any of it without your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>Those words sent waves of relief through her. \u201cThey can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll forget about it either. The journal may be inadmissible legally, but there are other ways for them to utilize it. And trust me when I say they will. They already are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat can they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what they\u2019ve done.\u201d He held up the notebook. \u201cHe didn\u2019t drop this off out of the kindness of his heart. He did it to get to me . . . to prove a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s between me and him.\u201d</p><p>His voice was quiet, his tone clipped. She didn\u2019t ask any more questions. She knew she wouldn\u2019t get any more information from him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any more notebooks?\u201d he asked. \u201cAny more diaries?\u201d</p><p>She nodded hesitantly. \u201cA few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet them for me.\u201d</p><p>A few turned out to be closer to a dozen. She lugged them out from her room and set them on the small table in front of Dr. DeMarco. He eyed them thoughtfully, surveying the covers, but he didn\u2019t open a single one. \u201cThese will need to be destroyed. They\u2019re too dangerous to keep laying around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said they can\u2019t use them,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but it\u2019s not just the police you have to worry about. Some of this information, if it falls into the wrong hands, would be like handing an atomic missile to a deranged man.\u201d He paused, shaking his head. \u201cCompletely catastrophic.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue. She wouldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco turned away from the journals after a moment and strolled over to the window. He looked out at the street below, the early evening sunshine bright on his face. \u201cThey know where you\u2019re living now, so I suspect this is just the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how they found my address,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to lay low like Corrado told me to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Vincent assured her. \u201cIt was all me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Vincent pointed at his foot. \u201cI forgot they were monitoring me.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s gaze drifted toward the GPS monitor around his ankle, the small scar on her back weirdly itching as she thought of the chip she used to have under her skin. \u201cThey tracked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they know you\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey\u2019ll be keeping an eye on this place now that they know for certain you live here. Dia confirmed it when they dropped off the box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . why? Why can\u2019t they leave me alone? I haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I have.\u201d</p><p>His explanation made little sense to her.</p><p>\u201cWe should think about moving you,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe choice is yours, obviously, but I think Corrado will agree with me when I say you\u2019ll be in much better shape if you drop far off their radar until all of this blows over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t move?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>He waved her over to him. Slowly, she stepped in his direction, hesitating beside him at the window. He motioned across the street at a man lingering near a tree, a cell phone to his ear as he casually kicked some acorns on the sidewalk. It was nothing out of the ordinary to her. The guy was vaguely familiar, a neighbor she assumed\u2014the one with the hat who held the elevator for her.</p><p>\u201cMeet Agent Cerone,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t move, expect to see a lot more of him.\u201d</p><p>The vast RICO indictment was neatly arranged on the desk, the small bold typeface spelling out more than twenty years of criminal conspiracy. There were thirty-two counts total, hinting at involvement in dozens of crimes. Murder, assault, kidnapping, extortion, gambling, loansharking, theft . . . the list formally and apathetically detailed the violence and mayhem that had ruled the windy Chicago streets for decades, as if they were outlining something as simple as a shopping list.</p><p>On or about March 20, 1988, in Chicago, the defendant, Corrado A. Moretti, together with others, intentionally caused the death of Marlon J. Grasso. On or about April 13, 1991, in Chicago, the defendant, Corrado A. Moretti, together with others, intentionally caused the death of . . .</p><p>On and on it went for forty-eight pages.</p><p>Corrado had spent the good part of the past hour silently reading through the charges, reliving the moments he could easily remember and a few he wished he could forget. He took it all in, absorbing the summarized case, and felt nothing even close to distress except for a simple phrase on the first page that troubled him:</p><p>Trafficking in persons for servitude . . .</p><p>\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d he said, glaring at the words. \u201cI never did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>Looking up from the pile of papers, Corrado eyed his lawyer across the room. Rocco Borza sat at a small round table, studying the hundreds of documents and photographs sprawled out in front of him. Three others worked alongside him, silently and studiously sifting through the stacks. Mountains of evidence surrounded them like thick fortress walls, threatening and mocking, the only thing standing between Corrado and his future.</p><p>Somewhere in their midst, tucked into the boxes or hidden in the audiotapes, lay the final nail that could be pounded into his coffin, taking his life away. Their job was to find it and make it disappear.</p><p>Exasperated, Corrado stood and strolled to the window, peering down at the street below. The office was located on the fifteenth floor of a newly remodeled skyscraper in the heart of downtown Chicago. People appeared to be little more than flecks of colored dust at this distance, tiny pests doing their best to not be squished as they went about their days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d Corrado muttered. \u201cEvery bit of it is wrong.\u201d</p><p>A sharp, sudden laugh echoed through the room, cutting off as quickly as it had sounded. Corrado didn\u2019t turn around or try to figure out which man it had come from. It wasn\u2019t worth it. He would only want to kill them for mocking him, and the last thing he needed was another death on his hands.</p><p>Besides, if his life hadn\u2019t been on the line, he would have likely laughed, too.</p><p>Corrado had little hope of finding help anywhere in that room. The indictment, while vexing, mostly rang true. The government had done their homework. His only saving grace would be sabotaging their case.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to take these audio recordings home to listen to them?\u201d Mr. Borza asked after a moment.</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><p>His question was met with silence. Corrado turned around, glancing at his lawyer, and saw the man peering into a massive box. \u201cTwo hundred and twenty CDs, I believe.\u201d</p><p>Corrado blinked rapidly as he took that in. Two hundred and twenty, each one eighty minutes long. \u201cThat\u2019s almost three hundred hours of recordings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is,\u201d Mr. Borza said. \u201cHad they included Vincent\u2019s, it would be double that.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution had been granted its request to separate Vincent\u2019s and Corrado\u2019s cases under the assumption they had a better chance of a conviction that way. Mr. Borza opted to defend Corrado, likely because he was terrified of rejecting the man. And while Corrado sympathized with his brother-in-law, having to start over on a defense with his life on the line, he certainly wasn\u2019t upset about the new development.</p><p>For Corrado suspected Vincent was a man who had already given up hope.</p><p>Corrado let out a deep sigh as his cell phone started ringing. He pulled it from his pocket, shaking his head when he saw it was his brother-in-law. Speak of the devil . . . \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a bit of a predicament with the girl,\u201d Vincent said, pausing before adding, \u201cagain.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, Corrado rubbed his hand down his face. She had turned out to be more of a problem than he originally thought she would be. \u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as possible. Tomorrow, maybe, or the next day. Keep her out of trouble until then.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, turning back to his lawyer. \u201cGet them to throw out the recordings. There\u2019s too many for me to go through.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Borza shook his head. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it would be,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cBut do it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Drops of rain trickled from the overcast sky, just enough moisture to annoy Vincent. He sat behind the wheel of his car, listening to the rubber of his wipers scraping against the mostly dry windshield. Wincing, he turned them off, only to turn them right back on again. Back and forth he went\u2014on and off, on and off, until he finally said the hell with it and turned them off for good.</p><p>His car idled in a vacant section of the park in Charlotte, tucked in along some trees that led to a jogging path. Even with his headlights off, Vincent could see the rugged dirt trail weaving past, disappearing into a dark section of woods.</p><p>Perfect place to hide a body, he thought.</p><p>After a few minutes, a bright glow turned the corner nearby, a car slowly driving straight toward him. He cringed as the headlights shone right through his windshield, blinding him temporarily until they turned off. Vincent blinked a few times, trying to clear the sudden colored splotches from his vision, as the car came to a stop a few feet in front of him.</p><p>Vincent didn\u2019t hesitate, anger and frustration fueling the adrenaline rushing through his veins. He climbed out of the driver\u2019s seat, the evidence bag containing Haven\u2019s notebook gripped tightly in his hand. His feet carried him briskly toward the other vehicle as the door opened, a man stepping out. The guy started to speak, a single syllable barely escaping his lips before Vincent was upon him, shoving him back against his car. He thrust the notebook against his chest so hard he nearly knocked the wind from the man. \u201cYou have some nerve, Agent Cerone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Vincent, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d he spat, cutting him off immediately. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before\u2014it\u2019s Doctor DeMarco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent,\u201d he said again. There was no humor in his eyes, no yielding in his expression. \u201cI don\u2019t think assaulting a government official is in your best interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now you want to play by the rules?\u201d Vincent asked. \u201cYou never seemed very concerned about that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Agent Cerone pushed Vincent\u2019s hands away, shoving the notebook into his chest in return. \u201cLet us act like real men, shall we? Use our words and not our hands? Or is that too difficult for the likes of you?\u201d</p><p>Vincent glared at him in the darkness as he took a step back, putting necessary space between them. \u201cLeave my family alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily?\u201d Agent Cerone let out a bitter laugh. \u201cStrange choice of word given the circumstances, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a part of my family\u2014always has been and always will be,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cJust because you can\u2019t comprehend that, because you can\u2019t get it through your thick skull that we actually care about her, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Agent Cerone scoffed. \u201cThe fact that you actually think you\u2019re right\u2014that you think this situation is okay\u2014astounds me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about things you know nothing about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know plenty. I read the journal, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou invaded her privacy! You stole her thoughts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he replied. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any of it less true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Vincent countered, \u201cbut tell me something, Agent Cerone. Do you have any deep, dark secrets that you\u2019d do anything to keep the world from finding out? Even kill to keep it from being exposed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you have to leave her alone,\u201d Vincent said, taking a step forward again, getting right in the special agent\u2019s face. \u201cYou won\u2019t get her. You can\u2019t have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . .\u201d Vincent\u2019s eyes instinctively darted toward the dirt path. \u201c. . . Because if you do, she\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>Agent Cerone stared at him blankly. \u201cNow that\u2019s a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Vincent shook his head as he turned away from the man, wiping the stray raindrops from his face. \u201cBut it is a guarantee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to do this?\u201d</p><p>Haven stood beside the Mazda later that week, staring down at the faded lines of the parking lot. She could feel Corrado\u2019s piercing eyes from the other side of the car, stabbing through her with his doubt. He looked exhausted, but judgment was clear in his tone. He didn\u2019t believe she could do it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cI can make alternate plans if you\u2019re not sure about this. I have the resources to keep you hidden away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure.\u201d She shook her head. The last thing she wanted was to drop out of civilization again. There was no point going forward if she couldn\u2019t live. \u201cI want to go. It\u2019s my choice, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, still staring at her with skeptical eyes. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be leaving then.\u201d</p><p>Haven avoided his gaze as she climbed into the passenger side of the car. All of her belongings were in boxes stacked along the back seat, her entire life once again packed up in the car. She had left a note on the kitchen table for Dia whenever she got home, saying her good-byes. She didn\u2019t say where she was going, no other explanation except she thought it was time for her to set out on her own. She promised to stay in touch but as Corrado pulled the car out on the road, heading toward the highway to leave Charlotte, she wondered just how plausible their friendship could be.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to get comfortable,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve hours, maybe.\u201d</p><p>She settled back into the seat and turned her head to gaze out of the window. \u201cThe trip to California last year took three days.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>Carmine stood in a dank hallway, leaning against the wall beside a door. It was cracked open, the flimsy wood barely hanging on its rusted hinges. Muffled screams of agony rang out of the apartment, keeping Carmine locked in place. Whatever was going on inside of there, he didn\u2019t want to see it.</p><p>The prepaid cell phone in his pocket vibrated with a message for the second time that day. He slowly pulled it out, not having to look to know who it was. Sal had given it to him so la famiglia could constantly be in touch, the name untraceable and messages safe from wiretaps. It had gone off for the first time less than an hour ago with nothing but an address. He had dressed, slipping out in the middle of the night, and ran the few blocks to where he was needed.</p><p>But getting there and going inside were two different things.</p><p>He glanced at the new message on the phone.</p><p>Where are you?</p><p>He started to type a reply when the apartment door was ripped open from the inside. It slammed into the wall and Carmine jumped as a man stepped out. He was short and husky, a stern expression on his round face and a pair of bolt cutters slung over his shoulder. He said nothing, stalking away as Salvatore stepped out behind him.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Sal said, eyeing Carmine.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I, uh . . . just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, you missed the fun!\u201d Sal said. \u201cIt\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Carmine slipped the phone back in his pocket, relief washing through him. \u201cI got here as fast as I could, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear boy,\u201d he replied, throwing his arm over Carmine\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou missed the demonstration, but you can still take notes.\u201d</p><p>He pulled Carmine into the apartment before he could object.</p><p>The place was vacant of furniture, the old wooden floor covered in grime. Sal led him to the bathroom and Carmine froze in the doorway the moment he caught sight of the body in the bathtub. The man\u2019s arm was slung over the side, his hand secured to the nearby sink with a pair of metal cuffs. He was stark naked and covered in blood, his brown eyes wide open and a look of sheer terror covering his pale face. Duct tape was wrapped around his head, completely covering his mouth.</p><p>A blue tarp carpeted the floor, catching the excess blood splatter, but most of it coated the bathtub and sink, the white porcelain wet with bright red. It smelled like metal, the sickening taste of copper tingling the back of his throat.</p><p>Carmine averted his gaze, trying to avoid the dead man\u2019s eyes, and Sal laughed at his reaction. \u201cFirst dead body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, Maura. How could I forget?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carmine flinched. He hadn\u2019t meant her at all. He had been referring to the incident in the warehouse but suddenly the image of his mother flashed in his mind.</p><p>Sal pulled him away from the bathroom when the other man returned with another guy in tow. Silently, the man removed the handcuffs and pulled the body from the bathtub, wrapping it in the tarp. The two of them picked it up and carried it from the bathroom. It was quick, done within a matter of minutes, with the precision of an expert craftsman.</p><p>\u201cIt helps to remember they\u2019re not people,\u201d Sal said. \u201cThey\u2019re vermin. Pests. We\u2019re just exterminating the cockroaches, Principe. Nobody wants to live in filth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awfully messy,\u201d Carmine said, his voice cracking.</p> <p>\u201cThat it is, dear boy,\u201d Sal replied. \u201cIt isn\u2019t always, but some prefer it that way, and who am I to deny a man his indulgence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Boss,\u201d a stern voice said behind them. \u201cIf you prefer it cleaner, cleaner you\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>Carmine turned, eyeing the man from earlier. His eyes were yellowing, his skin ashy. There was hardly any life left in him.</p><p>\u201cAh, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d Sal said, glancing back at the bathroom. \u201cIt\u2019ll give DeMarco something to do.\u201d</p><p>The color drained from Carmine\u2019s face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClean it up,\u201d Sal ordered, letting go of him. \u201cMake sure it\u2019s in tip-top shape before you leave. We\u2019ll be out on my yacht. Feel free to join us when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Sal walked away, leaving him standing alone in the apartment. He headed out after a moment, going to the corner store to buy cleaning supplies. He stocked up on rags and gloves and bleach, and spent the next hour scouring the bathroom in the abandoned apartment.</p><p>When finished, Carmine disposed of everything in a nearby Dumpster before making the trek home, feeling more and more disgusted with himself with each step he took.</p><p>Carmine stripped out of his clothes the moment he stepped in his house, discarding them without another look. He made his way upstairs and turned on the shower in the bathroom, waiting for it to turn hot before stepping under the spray. Steam consumed the room, his skin turning pink as the scalding water scorched his skin. He scrubbed every inch of his body, his chest aching as he fought with everything he had to bottle in his emotions. He forced it down, swallowing the feelings as he rubbed his outside raw, trying to wash away the filth that lurked beneath the surface.</p><p>Afterward, Carmine put on some fresh clothes and headed downstairs. The place was furnished now, the piano having been delivered just the previous morning. It sat in its place in the corner of the living room, a black vinyl cover safeguarding it. Boxes were scattered amongst the rooms, belongings strewn all over. It was a disaster, takeout containers layering the kitchen counters as trash piled up on the floor.</p><p>He opened the freezer door, ignoring the growl of his empty stomach as he reached for the bottle of Grey Goose vodka he had stashed there. Popping the top off, he brought it to his lips and took a swig, savoring the burn as it coated his throat. He needed it, hoping the alcohol would numb his body and clear his mind of what he saw that night. He wished it would kill the ache that had resided in him for what felt like forever, but he knew deep down nothing would make that go away. Part of him was missing, a gaping hole where his heart had once been. It was the part he had left behind with her, the part she carried with her wherever she went.</p> <p>Charlotte? he wondered. Was she living with Dia? What was she doing with her time? The questions nagged him night after night, but he kept them to himself. Where Haven went and what she did was her business. He had no right to ask anymore. He had given that up when he walked away.</p><p>The crimson flower design stood out strikingly against the gold background of the massive banner. Haven stood on the sidewalk below it, staring up at it, fascinated by the way it swayed in the gentle breeze.</p><p>SVA, the logo said. School of Visual Arts. According to Corrado, it was one of the best art schools in the country. Haven had never heard of it, but that wasn\u2019t surprising\u2014she only vaguely knew about New York City itself.</p><p>It\u2019s the largest city in the United States, she silently reminded herself. It\u2019s the city that never sleeps. It was the first place she thought of when contemplating leaving Charlotte. If she had to go elsewhere, she thought it should be there. After all, Carmine had said it was where people followed their dreams.</p><p>And dreams, at that moment, were all she had anymore.</p><p>The crowd moved around her as she stood in the way, but she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes off the school banner. Half of it was out of admiration, the other half sheer terror, because looking away from it meant having to look somewhere else.</p><p>Haven had gotten used to being around others over time, slowly adapting to living in society, but the atmosphere in the city intimidated her. She had encountered more people the past twenty-four hours than she had seen her whole life before then. People were everywhere\u2014walking, running, riding, driving\u2014a continuous flow of bodies rushing past her like a fast-moving river. And she could do nothing but stand still in the center, hoping with everything inside of her that it didn\u2019t sweep her away.</p><p>She said she could do it, that she was sure, but doubt crept in further the longer she stood there. The noise, the lights, the smells . . . her senses were on overload as she tried to take it all in.</p> <p>Corrado stepped out of the building in front of her, a folder of papers tucked under his arm. He forced his way through the crowd and stopped in front of her, his presence drawing her attention. \u201cYou\u2019re enrolled for the fall.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat gives you about four months to settle in.\u201d</p><p>Four months . . . it seemed so long, but it was no time at all. She had already survived that long since Carmine had left her.</p><p>The thought of him made her chest ache. She glanced back at the banner with a frown, wishing she could hear his voice. She wondered what he would think, what he would say if he were there with her.</p><p>Don\u2019t you fucking be scared, tesoro, was the likely culprit.</p><p>She got lost in that moment, sinking deep into her thoughts, but Corrado\u2019s next words pulled her right back to the surface. \u201cI enrolled you under the name Hayden Antoinette.\u201d</p><p>Haven blinked rapidly. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s close enough to your real name for you to recognize it, but further enough from it that hopefully nobody else will.\u201d</p><p>She started to argue, but Corrado silenced her with a pointed look. The ache in her chest grew. He had taken away her identity.</p><p>Time moved swiftly, days passing in an unyielding blur. Corrado rented a place for her on Eighth Avenue in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, a one-bedroom apartment on the first floor of a newly renovated brownstone. The other residence in the building, an identical apartment on the second floor, stood vacant.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you,\u201d Corrado said one afternoon about a week after arriving in New York, handing her a small package. Haven opened it, dumping it out onto her new kitchen table. He had furnished the place with the necessities, nothing fancy, but better than she imagined she would have. The couch, the tables, the lamps, the chair\u2014every bit of it belonged to her, even though Corrado told her not to get attached.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep anything you wouldn\u2019t be willing to walk away from,\u201c he had said. \u201cWhen people are looking for you, you might have to run.\u201d</p><p>Run. If Haven was tired of anything, it was running.</p><p>She focused her attention on the contents of the package: a credit card, some identification, and a small black cell phone.</p><p>\u201cMy number\u2019s the only one programed into the phone,\u201d Corrado said as she picked it up and eyed it warily. \u201cCall me directly if you need anything. I\u2019ll handle your bills, but you can use the card for any other expenses. It\u2019ll come straight out of your inheritance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy inheritance,\u201d she whispered, picking up the credit card and the driver\u2019s license, both adorned with her fake name.</p><p>\u201cYes, I finally settled the estate,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere was an unfortunate accident with the house, though.\u201d</p><p>She peered up at him suspiciously. \u201cAccident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burned to the ground. Quite sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d she mumbled, shaking her head.</p><p>A small smile tugged his lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t need it, though. You have a nice place here. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll settle in fine.\u201d</p><p>The apartment was equally spaced between the two buildings that would hold her classes, a few minutes walk in either direction for her to get where she needed to go. Everything surrounded her, so she didn\u2019t need to venture far from her apartment, and there was no reason for her to drive anywhere.</p><p>She did venture outside, though, after Corrado departed for Chicago again. She spent the afternoons wandering the area, memorizing streets, getting to know the neighborhood. It was monotonous and predictable, the same routine again and again, but to her every day sort of felt like a new adventure. There were different people, different street vendors, and different activities going on all around. And she infiltrated the chaos, mingling amongst it all, completely unnoticed and out of the limelight.</p><p>It admittedly wasn\u2019t what she had expected. Even standing in the center, she still felt as if she were on the outside of it all, looking in. It was a familiar sensation that oddly put her at ease, numbing her anxiety as she faded once more into anonymity.</p><p>At least, when invisible, she remained safe.</p><p>15</p><p>The docks, Third and Wilson</p><p>Carmine stared at the message, heaviness in the pit of his stomach. He wanted nothing more than to delete it, pretend it never arrived, but he knew Sal would never accept that excuse.</p><p>And neither would Corrado, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big shipment coming in by boat in a few days,\u201d Sal had said about a week ago. \u201cThey\u2019ll load it onto trucks then leave. The trucks will stay parked there, just sitting there all night, begging to be stolen. A crew comes in and takes their pick. Easiest job there is.\u201d</p><p>Carmine had blown it off at the time, figuring it had nothing to do with him. He hadn\u2019t been integrated into their hierarchy, hadn\u2019t been put into a street crew or assigned a Capo. Since the moment he had arrived, Sal had just used him for odd jobs, taking him wherever he went and involving him in his personal schemes, but this was different. This simple message\u2014The docks, Third and Wilson\u2014changed everything.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t just Carmine being dragged into other people\u2019s messes\u2014this was him creating the mess. He was no longer the accessory after the fact. He was about to be the goddamn perpetrator.</p><p>Pulling a chilled bottle of vodka from his otherwise empty freezer, Carmine tore the top off and took a long swig, letting the burn make its way through his system. Liquid courage, people called it, but he was starting to think of it as Stupid Shit Serum. Grey Goose got him through quite a few rough nights since arriving in Chicago, giving him the strength to do things he was certain only an idiot would truly enjoy doing.</p><p>Tonight, he ventured to guess, would be one of those times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed his gun from the top of the kitchen cabinet where he stored it and slipped it into the waistband of his jeans before leaving the house. His brand new Mercedes was parked in the driveway, shining under the gleam of the streetlight. He had leased it a week before, the same night he had had the conversation with Sal.</p><p>Carmine slid into the driver\u2019s seat, taking a deep breath before starting the car. The drive through town was quick\u2014too motherfucking quick\u2014and he pulled up at the docks just a few minutes later. It was dark there, barely lit by moonlight, but he could make out the rows of white delivery trucks parked behind a flimsy chain-link fence. The gate was secured with a chain and lock, but there was no sign of any security beyond that.</p><p>Carmine parked and surveyed the trucks, unsure of what to do or where to start. There had been no planning, no instructions, no explanations, but he knew without a doubt there were expectations. And if he didn\u2019t deliver, he would be the one to pay.</p><p>He climbed out of the car and started toward the gate when a car wildly whipped from behind a nearby building, sending gravel flying as it headed for him. The headlights were blacked out. Through the darkness, Carmine couldn\u2019t see who was driving.</p> <p>Jumping back, his heart thumped violently against his rib cage as fear coursed through his body, fueled by strong adrenaline. He reached for his gun, terrified, as the car came to a sudden halt and the doors flew open. Two guys jumped out, one from the passenger seat and one from the back. The doors had barely closed again when the car was thrown into reverse, skidding backward before speeding away.</p><p>It happened fast, mere seconds passing before the two guys approached. Carmine had his gun by his side, his finger hovering on the trigger, when a voice cut through the night. \u201cDeMarco? That you?\u201d</p><p>Carmine loosened his grip on the gun, his shoulders relaxing a bit. \u201cRemy?\u201d</p><p>Remy Tarullo stepped out of the shadows and into a sliver of moonlight. He was dressed all in black, a ski mask loosely sitting on his head. \u201cHey, man! Good to see you again! Mr. Moretti said they were gonna be sending you out, you know, having you join the crew. Told us to show you the ropes.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed through Carmine, rinsing away his unnerving fear. He slipped his gun back away. \u201cMy uncle sent you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s our Capo, you know . . . guess he\u2019s yours now, too.\u201d Grinning, Remy slapped him on the back. \u201cYou aren\u2019t nervous, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say. He was nervous, but he couldn\u2019t admit that. \u201c. . . I figure it\u2019s better to not go at it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Remy said, pulling out a pair of gloves from his back pocket and slipping them on. He pulled his mask down, covering his face, before reaching into his coat for an extra set of both. He tossed them to Carmine, who put them on as Remy\u2019s friend did the same. \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have any bolt cutters in your car, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d Carmine said, slipping the ski mask over his face. He suddenly felt short of breath, suffocated by the thick material. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d need any.\u201d</p><p>Remy shook his head slightly. \u201cYou really did come unprepared.\u201d</p><p>Understatement of the fucking year, Carmine thought. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever stolen anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo big deal,\u201d Remy said. \u201cYou probably never had to, being a DeMarco and all. You even get to shadow the Boss all the time . . . man, you don\u2019t know how many of us would kill for that chance.\u201d</p><p>There was no hostility to Remy\u2019s voice, but the words made Carmine\u2019s hair bristle. He didn\u2019t doubt there were people out there who would kill him if they thought it might get them closer to the top.</p><p>Remy looked around briefly, as if searching for something, before pulling some small tools out of his back pocket. He jogged over to the fence, easily and methodically picking the single lock. He ripped the chain off before shoving the gate open, him and the other guy running inside. Carmine was right on their heels, dashing inside the lot behind them.</p><p>\u201cSplit up,\u201d Remy ordered, waving at the two of them. \u201cCheck those trucks and tell me what you find. Make it quick.\u201d</p><p>The men scattered to different sides of the lot, gunshots cutting through the night air as they shot off the locks on the back of the trucks. Carmine followed their lead, pulling out his gun and aiming it. He winced when he fired his first shot, his hand shaking and throwing off his aim. He had to shoot it three times before he hit his mark, hearing shouts through the lot as the men shared their loot.</p><p>Carmine flung open the back of his first truck, squinting in the darkness to read the boxes. \u201cUh, laptops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry the next one,\u201d Remy ordered. \u201cToo risky. A lot of them can be traced.\u201d</p><p>Carmine moved on to the second truck, getting the back of it open with the first shot. \u201cTVs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHot-wire it.\u201d</p><p>Carmine blanched. He didn\u2019t know the first thing about hot-wiring anything.</p><p>The third man found a load of DVD players and broke a window to climb in the front of the truck. Remy looked over, seeing Carmine just standing there.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, grabbing Carmine\u2019s shirt and pulling him to the front of the truck. \u201cBreak the window and get in.\u201d</p><p>Carmine did as he was told, having no time to argue. He smashed the glass and unlocked the door, climbing inside. Remy pulled a flat screwdriver from his back pocket, passing it through to him. \u201cCarefully put it in the ignition and see if it\u2019ll turn.\u201d</p><p>The truck on the other side of the lot came to life a few seconds before Carmine\u2019s did. Remy let out a laugh as the engine roared and shoved Carmine humorously. \u201cSee, man? Let me drive it to the spot. Follow us in your car.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, Carmine jumped out of the truck and ran back to his car. He ripped the mask off, taking a deep breath to steady himself as the two trucks tore out of the lot. Carmine followed them into traffic, staying right on Remy\u2019s bumper.</p><p>Sirens blared in the distance. The trucks pulled off the main road as the flashing lights rapidly approached, weaving through traffic. Carmine was on edge, watching his rearview mirror as he pulled into the alley behind them. Three cop cars flew right by after a moment and kept going.</p><p>Carmine exhaled sharply. Too fucking close.</p><p>They drove down some back roads deep into the south side, coming to a stop at a large warehouse. They pulled the trucks inside, out of view, and Carmine parked his car behind them.</p><p>\u201cWoo!\u201d Remy hollered, jumping out of the truck. His friend joined him, the two of them cheering and sharing fist bumps, before Remy turned to Carmine. \u201cYou feel that, man? That high?\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded and smiled, although it was a lie. All he felt was nervous energy surging through him. He was on the verge of being sick.</p><p>The three men spent the next hour watching the trucks being unloaded before taking their payment and driving away. The stolen trucks would be discarded at a chop shop, nothing going to waste. Every bit of it was salvaged and sold, melted down and concealed, so not a fragment of evidence remained.</p><p>\u201cWhat a rush,\u201d Remy said, fidgeting excitedly in the passenger seat. \u201cThat\u2019s what I live for. The violence I could do without, but the stealing . . . there\u2019s nothing like it. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna be able to sleep tonight. I mean, fuck! It was a close one! Just a minute later and we would\u2019ve gotten caught. Ain\u2019t that shit great?\u201d</p><p>Carmine found nothing great about it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get a drink,\u201d he continued, not giving anyone else any time to speak. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I need something hard after the night we just had.\u201d</p><p>Finally something Carmine agreed with.</p><p>Luna Rossa was busy for a Friday night. Unlike the last time Carmine had been there, black sedans were merely sprinkled within the sea of other vehicles, cars and trucks of all types crammed into the lot. It looked almost like an entirely different place, loud hip-hop music blaring from the building.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been here,\u201d Remy said. \u201cLived in Chicago my whole life, been involved in this shit for years, and until tonight I never stepped foot in this place.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t feel right just walking in. Guys like us only get invited here when we\u2019ve done something to piss Mr. Moretti off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got invited by the Boss as soon as I moved here,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cLooked like a different place that night. It was old school.\u201d</p><p>Remy laughed. \u201cYou know how the saying goes: When the cat\u2019s away, the mice will play.\u201d</p><p>The guard looked at them when they entered, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the three men, but he said nothing, merely tipping his head in greeting. They walked through the club, bass from the music vibrating the floor beneath their feet, sending energy spiking through Carmine\u2019s body. He found it relaxing, the chaos and noise so loud he could hardly think.</p><p>A booth in the back was empty. He slipped into it, barely having enough time to sit down when a woman stopped right in front of him. He looked up at her, their eyes connecting right away as her serious expression shifted with a smile. \u201cDeMarco, right?\u201d</p><p>It took him a moment to place her face . . . the same waitress who had served him last time. \u201cUh, yeah. Hey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want your usual?\u201d she asked. \u201cVodka?\u201d</p><p>He was stunned she remembered. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your friends?\u201d She turned to them. \u201cWhat can I get you fellas?\u201d</p><p>They rattled off their orders\u2014scotch for Remy and a beer for the other guy. The waitress walked off, returning with their drinks in a matter of minutes, and Carmine downed his before she even had a chance to walk away. She let out a laugh, holding her finger up to silently tell him to wait, and retrieved the whole bottle of Grey Goose from behind the bar. \u201cAnything else you need, just let me know. My name\u2019s Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Eve,\u201d Remy said, winking. \u201cYou can call me Adam.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rolled his eyes as the girl laughed before walking away. \u201cThat was fucking terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, girls love that cheesy shit,\u201d Remy said. \u201cI know my girl does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a girlfriend?\u201d Carmine asked, pouring himself another shot.</p><p>\u201cYeah, her name\u2019s Vanessa. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Carmine downed his second shot. \u201cNo, no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Remy took a swig of his scotch. \u201cLucky for you, Eve seems interested.\u201d</p><p>Remy pointed with his glass and Carmine turned his head, spying the waitress leaning against the bar. Her eyes were focused directly on him.</p><p>Sighing, Carmine turned back around and said nothing.</p><p>The night wore on in a haze as the alcohol flowed freely to their table. They drank the hours away, laughing and yelling and carrying on. Girls came by their table, flirting and giggling, mooching off their drinks instead of buying their own. Carmine hardly noticed, too drunk to even care.</p><p>Too drunk, in fact, to care about much of anything.</p><p>It was after midnight when the atmosphere suddenly shifted. The thumping bass from the speakers abruptly cut off, and the chaos of the crowd dulled to a murmur. Carmine looked around, tensing as his uncle casually strolled through the club, his hands in his pockets. He headed to his office but stopped at the entrance to the hallway when Eve yelled his name. She said something to him, pointing directly at their booth, and Carmine blanched as he turned around. Fuck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrado diverted then, bypassing the hallway to head straight for them. \u201cCarmine,\u201d he said, his eyes scanning the three of them. \u201cGentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Remy,\u201d Carmine muttered, pointing at him. \u201cAnd this is . . .\u201d He hesitated. He didn\u2019t even know the other guy\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cI know who they are,\u201d Corrado said tersely.</p><p>\u201cMr. Moretti, sir,\u201d Remy said. \u201cGreat club you have here.\u201d</p> <p>Corrado nodded, but offered no response to the compliment.</p><p>\u201cWe were just getting a drink,\u201d Carmine slurred. \u201cYou know . . . or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys just be careful getting home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Remy said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s eyes lingered on Carmine for a moment before he walked away, disappearing down the hallway.</p> <p>Remy shook his head, gulping the last of his drink. \u201cMan, he\u2019s intense as fuck.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed bitterly. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d</p><p>Thump. Crash. \u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes shot open at once at the noise. Disoriented, she stared at the low ceiling above her bed, surveying the textured white paint as if it could somehow tell her what happened. Sunlight streamed in the small window across the room, sweeping across the faded wooden floor. It was warm, almost peaceful, and all was silent for a long moment.</p><p>Had she imagined it?</p><p>She started to close her eyes again when another bang rang out. Following it was the clicking sound of high heels against wood, accompanying a woman\u2019s frustrated growl. Confused, Haven\u2019s stomach twisted as she threw the covers off and climbed out of bed. She walked through the apartment at the same time the high heels started along the floor above her, following her direction as they made their way to the staircase.</p> <p>Quietly, Haven unlocked her front door and peeked out as the woman started down the stairs. She was tall and curvy, her long hair an unnatural burgundy shade. She lugged two empty cardboard boxes with her and dropped them in the small foyer right outside of Haven\u2019s door.</p><p>Haven didn\u2019t want to be caught spying, but the woman saw her before she could slip back away.</p><p>\u201cHey there!\u201d she said enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019m Kelsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHav\u2014uh, den.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cHayden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you live here, Hayden?\u201d Kelsey asked, pausing to take a breath but not long enough for Haven to actually answer. \u201cThank God you\u2019re a she and not a he. I was totally convinced I was going to be living above some creepy bald dude with a potbelly who smelled like beef jerky and cheap beer. Yuck. Could you imagine? Ugh, I bet you were worried about the same thing, some pervert tromping through here all day and night. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled timidly. She hadn\u2019t even considered it. The thought of someone moving into the vacant second floor never crossed her mind. She had assumed Corrado rented the entire building.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do?\u201d Kelsey asked, raising a perfectly arched eyebrow. \u201cAre you a student or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes,\u201d she replied. \u201cI go to the School of Visual Arts.\u201d</p> <p>Kelsey\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNo shit? Me too!\u201d</p><p>Haven was taken aback. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2019m majoring in graphic design. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine arts? Ugh, I could never do that.\u201d Kelsey waved her off dismissively. \u201cSo have you gone to orientation yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Haven frowned. She had been putting it off, her nerves getting the best of her. \u201cI should probably do that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI was about to head over there myself. We can go together! Everyone needs a walking buddy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Haven glanced down at herself, still wearing her plaid oversize pajamas. She hadn\u2019t even brushed her hair yet. \u201cI need to change first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Kelsey said, scrunching her nose in disgust. \u201cI can\u2019t go out looking like this. I broke a sweat and didn\u2019t even enjoy myself doing it.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey immediately turned, leaving the empty boxes where she had discarded them as she bolted back up the narrow stairs.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Haven sat on the bottom step in the foyer, freshly showered and dressed in a pair of jeans and a red tank top. She tinkered with her keys as she waited, listening to the noise from above as Kelsey stomped around her apartment. Her loud footsteps echoed through the old building, the flimsy floorboards creaking and groaning. The building, although freshly remodeled, showed signs of its age.</p><p>Haven waited, and waited, and waited some more. Another twenty minutes passed, and she was about to give up, when the sound of Kelsey\u2019s high heels started clicking her way. Haven stood and glanced up the stairs, studying the girl as she approached. Her clothes were pristine, vibrant and crisp as if they had never been worn before. Her lips shone brightly from gloss, her eyes masked with dark makeup. She was a pretty girl, but Haven thought she looked much better without all of that covering her face.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>Haven nodded. She had been ready.</p><p>Although she wore six-inch high heels, Kelsey walked confidently, her steps effortless, her stride long. Haven strolled along beside her, listening as the girl prattled on and on about everything. By the time they reached the school a few blocks away, Haven knew all she needed to know about Kelsey\u2014an only child, the daughter of a congressman, she had failed out of NYU and decided to give art school a chance after her parents forced her to move out to teach her responsibility.</p><p>\u201cSo, yeah . . . my dad says I only get three strikes before he cuts me off, and failing out of NYU was number two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the first strike?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cBeing born?\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s expression fell as she blinked a few times, those words striking her hard. She certainly could relate. \u201cYou really feel that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Kelsey replied. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a strained relationship with my parents. My dad\u2019s never here in New York and my mom, well . . . if I\u2019m not on the bottom of a wine bottle, she\u2019s not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s, uh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPathetic?\u201d Kelsey laughed. \u201cI know it is. And first strike was actually probably when I almost failed graduating from high school. I was boy crazy and skipped too much. That\u2019s over with, though. I\u2019m committed now. I don\u2019t have time for a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>The two of them stepped inside the building on 23rd Avenue, following the signs to the busy registrar\u2019s office to have their student IDs made. Haven stared at hers when it was finished, ignoring the wrong name and instead focusing on the fact that her picture was prominently displayed on a badge granting her admission.</p><p>For the first time in her life, she was a student at a school.</p><p>The afternoon was chaotic as she went from building to building, meeting the administration and other students. Overwhelmed, Haven\u2019s palms sweated and heart raced as they showed her the studios and enrolled her in classes, explaining the requirements as they took her around to the various galleries. Mandatory volunteer hours, optional summer sessions, semi-annual galas, and monthly counseling sessions . . . her anxiety skyrocketed, but it seemed to melt away the moment she stepped into the school\u2019s library.</p><p>Tall stacks of books surrounded her, towering above her, welcoming her in to their familiar embrace. It reminded her of life in Durante, a time and place she had tried not to dwell on during the weeks as she settled into New York. Her life was starting anew\u2014new people, new places, new things, new chances\u2014but the old seemed to still have a strong grasp on her heart, squeezing and constricting, forcing her to hold back, longing and yearning for the love she had left behind, instead of looking ahead.</p><p>She lost Kelsey somewhere in the bustle of the day and ran into her again hours later as the sun was setting, the long day coming to an end. Kelsey stood in the lobby of the fine arts building next to a guy with spiky blond hair, her hand pressed against his chest, her face lit up with intense fascination.</p><p>They separated after a moment, the guy jogging past Haven and out the door. Kelsey stood there, silently fidgeting as she bit down on her bottom lip, but she let out a squeal when she spotted Haven. \u201cMy God, did you see him? Wasn\u2019t he gorgeous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sure,\u201d Haven said, glancing out the massive glass windows at the boy standing on the sidewalk with a group of friends. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Peter something-or-other. He\u2019s a senior! He asked me for my number, so of course I gave it to him. God! Do you think he\u2019ll call? I hope he calls.\u201d</p><p>Haven looked at her incredulously. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t have time for a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said, waving her off with a laugh. \u201cI can date, though. No harm in that. Besides, a girl has to have some kind of fun, right?\u201d</p><p>Rhetorical question, but Haven shrugged in response anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Kelsey asked as the two of them headed out on their way back home. \u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>The innocent question, asked offhandedly, was like a sucker punch to Haven\u2019s chest. It was the first time someone had asked her that. \u201cNot anymore. I did, but . . . not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s elated expression dimmed. \u201cAh, bad breakup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re better off without him, whoever he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d Haven mumbled. Something about saying his name aloud, acknowledging he existed . . . that they had once existed together . . . loosened the tight knot in her gut just a bit.</p><p>\u201cBreakups suck,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been a one man kind of woman because of that. My dad always says \u2018don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket, honey,\u2019 so I figure, why put all my hope in one man? I like to play the field a little, see what\u2019s out there.\u201d</p><p>Haven would come to learn during the next few weeks, as she got to know Kelsey more, exactly how much of an understatement that was.</p><p>Every few days there was a new love interest, boy after boy coming in and out of the apartment above hers. Peter, Franco, Josh, Jason . . . Haven stopped keeping track eventually. She would hear them tromping along upstairs behind Kelsey, the sound of their heavy footsteps echoing through the connected apartments, and she would smile politely if she ran into them in the foyer, but she didn\u2019t bother to say hello.</p><p>The faces all blurred together over time, a mash-up of a man Haven had no interest in getting to know.</p><p>School started during those few weeks. Classes and studio sessions swallowed up Haven\u2019s time\u2014painting, drawing, and art history taking up most of her days. After school was over, instead of heading home, she would go to the library and lose hours inside those thick walls, drowning in books and studying text. It monopolized her attention, but she flourished under the stress.</p><p>For yet again in her life, she had a strict schedule. Yet again, she had a list of things to do, and if it wasn\u2019t done she knew there would be consequences. Failing wasn\u2019t an option because, in Haven\u2019s world, failing was as good as giving up on life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>16</p><p>The knock on the office door was so timid Corrado barely heard it over the music in the club. He ignored the faint tapping, his gaze trained on the dingy briefcase on the desk in front of him.</p><p>After a minute or so, another knock sounded. Still weak. Hesitant. Again, Corrado ignored it.</p><p>Mafiosi knew they were supposed to carry themselves with confidence, especially when dealing with the most dangerous of men. He didn\u2019t care if his men were staring down Lucifer personally, surrounded by brimstone and hellfire leading them straight to eternal damnation. They needed to keep their composure, be prepared to fight, and never ever let their fear show. The streets were ruthless and their rivals wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make a move at the first sign of weakness. Vulnerabilities were exploited, and the worst thing they could do was come off as uncertain. It didn\u2019t matter if they were wrong\u2014they needed to always appear right.</p> <p>And Corrado, most certainly, was not convinced.</p><p>It took a while for the third knock to come. It was louder, more determined. \u201cCome in,\u201d he yelled, sitting back in his chair and glancing at his Rolex as Remy Tarullo entered, tentatively shutting the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he stated. \u201cI told you to be here at nine. It\u2019s nine oh three. You\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was here,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cI was out in the hall.\u201d</p> <p>Corrado raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou have the audacity to make excuses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I, uh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in what you have to say. It\u2019s meaningless to me. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re run down in the parking lot. You had better drag your mangled body in here with enough time to be in my office when I tell you to be in my office. Nothing short of death is reason enough to be late. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Corrado could smell his fear. It reeked, filling the office with the sickly-sweet scent of sweat and panic. Remy was tall and skinny with shifty eyes, but they were more about his sudden fear and less about deception. Was he hiding something? Maybe, but he didn\u2019t let it show. He had been called into a Capo\u2019s office\u2014a wise man knew those situations didn\u2019t often end well. But he came, shoulders square, head held high.</p><p>What he lacked in brains he made up for in guts.</p> <p>Remy was a decent earner and good at what he did, never once getting caught, which was why he had entrusted Carmine to his crew.</p><p>\u201cWord around is you\u2019re the best at picking locks,\u201d Corrado said.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to brag or anything, but I\u2019ve yet to find a lock I couldn\u2019t pop on the first date.\u201d</p><p>Remy grinned, trying to break the tension, but Corrado didn\u2019t find it funny. He just stared him over, pondering whether he was the right one for the job.</p><p>Tense silence ensued. Remy stood in place, making no move to sit. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to have a seat?\u201d Corrado asked.</p><p>Remy\u2019s eyes darted to one of the empty chairs, but he still didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou didn\u2019t invite me to sit down, sir.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he was smarter than Corrado originally thought.</p><p>\u201cCan you get this open?\u201d he asked, turning the briefcase around to face the boy. Remy took an immediate step forward, his eyes narrowing as he studied the small lock.</p> <p>\u201cUh, yeah, I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so or know so?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cIf you\u2019re not certain, turn around and walk out that door. I\u2019ll find someone better equipped to do the job for me.\u201d</p><p>Remy cleared his throat. \u201cWith all due respect, sir, there is no one better equipped. If I can\u2019t get it open, nobody will.\u201d</p><p>Touch\u00e9. Corrado nodded, motioning toward the briefcase, silently permitting him to prove his worth. Remy eyed the lock for a moment before reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small tension wrench and a pick. Corrado watched, fascinated that the boy carried them with him. \u201cDo you make it a habit to keep tools in your pocket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou never know when you might need to pick a lock or hot-wire a car, so I try to keep what I\u2019d need on me just in case. Same reason you always carry a gun, I\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you carry a gun also?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI tend to only have it when I think my life might be on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have one with you now?\u201d</p><p>Remy hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Corrado smiled at that and relaxed back into his chair, tapping his foot to the beat of the music from the club. Two songs from Sinatra\u2019s Greatest Hits passed before Remy made any progress, a smile lighting the boy\u2019s face as he finally jimmied the lock. The briefcase cracked open, not wide enough to see inside, but enough for Corrado to take over.</p><p>Remy returned his tools to his pocket and took a step back. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to ask me what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not at all curious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, but it\u2019s none of my business,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf you wanted me to know, you would\u2019ve told me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Corrado stood up, motioning for the boy to follow him as he stepped out of the office and met up with one of the security guards in the hallway, standing watch outside the office door. \u201cTell the bartender Tarullo\u2019s drinks are on the house. Anything he wants, he gets\u2014no questions asked.\u201d</p><p>The guard nodded. \u201cYes, Boss.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stepped back into his office, shutting the door and locking it before strolling over to the desk. He pried the briefcase open and blinked rapidly as he eyed the contents.</p><p>A lone VHS tape.</p><p>Corrado had considered a lot of things\u2014guns, money, gold, even body parts\u2014but an old movie had never crossed his mind.</p><p>The worn carton encasing it crumbled as soon as he picked it up. He tossed that part aside and surveyed the black tape, finding no label. It was seemingly blank, but Corrado knew better. Someone had gone to great lengths to hide that videotape.</p><p>Stepping back out of the office, he looked at the security guard again. \u201cFetch me a VCR.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cA VCR?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Corrado waved him off impatiently. \u201cMake it fast.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes passed, then thirty, and finally forty-five before the guard returned with a used VCR cradled under his arm. He passed it off to Corrado, who took it into the office and closed the door. Plugging it in, he hooked it up to the small television on the corner of his desk that displayed the security feed.</p><p>Immediately a movie started playing, a cartoon with a princess and an obnoxiously catchy tune blaring in the background. Corrado grimaced and ejected the tape, throwing it aside before carefully inserting the one from the briefcase.</p><p>Nothing happened for a moment; the numbers on the VCR counted away, but the screen remained as black as night. Corrado was about to give up, feeling duped, when the screen flickered and up popped a face he hadn\u2019t seen in years.</p><p>Frankie Antonelli.</p><p>The footage jumped and rolled. Corrado pushed the tracking button, trying to straighten it out, but nothing helped. He gave up and sat back in his chair as Frankie started to talk, the sound cracking and buzzing when he turned up the volume.</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . I\u2019ve never been a religious man. I come from a religious family, my pop\u2019s a devout Roman Catholic, just like my granddad back in the old country, but me? Naw, I never believed it. I don\u2019t believe in prayer or salvation, don\u2019t believe in Heaven, but I do believe in Hell. I got to. I live in it.\u201d</p><p>Frankie ran his hands down his face as he paused. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in confession . . . you know, asking for forgiveness and all that . . . but I get why the guys do it. We ain\u2019t never gonna be forgiven for the shit we do, but it eases the conscience. It\u2019s hard to walk around every day, carrying so many secrets. And I got secrets. I got plenty of sins in my book. And I ain\u2019t asking to be forgiven for them, I ain\u2019t asking to be saved, but I gotta get them out. I can\u2019t carry them around anymore . . . not when I spend every day in this Hell, staring at them in the face.\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s stomach dropped, coldness creeping through him. He felt the urge to eject the tape, throw it in the trashcan and set it on fire. What kind of wise guy\u2014what kind of man of honor\u2014breaks his vow of silence on video? He was disgusted, disgruntled, and downright angry.</p><p>But another part, deep down inside, rendered him immobile. Maybe it was curiosity, or maybe instinct, but something forced him to keep watching the tape.</p><p>For the next thirty minutes, Corrado stared at the screen, stunned speechless as a man he once considered a mentor, a friend, a brother, who turned into a traitor, a coward, a rat, spilled a secret that shocked even him. He had seen it all, he had done it all, but the words Frankie spoke, the horrific truth that spilled from his lips, was something Corrado couldn\u2019t begin to fathom.</p><p>Unimaginable. Appalling. He felt sick.</p><p>Corrado\u2019s disgust only grew with each word, his contempt now unwavering. Everything he believed, everything he knew, had been put into question by a shaky half hour of spineless confession.</p><p>\u201cSo, yeah, that\u2019s the truth,\u201d Frankie said quietly, shaking his head as if in disbelief at his own words. \u201cI have to live with what I did . . . what I helped do. I ain\u2019t gonna apologize for it, or like I said, ask forgiveness. I had to do what I had to do. But I carried it with me for a long time, and I couldn\u2019t carry it anymore.</p><p>\u201cIf someone\u2019s watching this, I\u2019m probably long dead. I won\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s this that gets me killed. I\u2019ve been feeling it lately, the feeling that something\u2019s going down that I don\u2019t know about, so maybe it\u2019s only a matter of time before this comes out. And maybe I deserve to die for this, but I ain\u2019t the only one. No, if this is how it ends, if this is how I escape from this Hell to go to the next, I hope the devil goes down with me, too. It\u2019s only fair, since he controlled it all.\u201d</p><p>Frankie leaned forward and shut off the camera. Corrado stared at the black screen, the office swallowed in uncomfortable silence.</p><p>Shell-shocked. It was the only word to describe how Corrado felt.</p><p>Getting his bearings straight, he ejected the tape and locked it in a desk drawer. He unhooked the VCR and grabbed the cartoon, meeting the security guard in the hallway once more. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStole it,\u201d he said. \u201cBroke into a few houses down the block until I found one.\u201d</p><p>Corrado shoved it back to him. \u201cReturn it.\u201d</p><p>The guard blanched. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind of jackass steals from a little girl?\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>Time heals all wounds. Il tempo guarisce tutti i mali. It\u2019s been said time and time again, but what they don\u2019t talk about are the jagged scars left behind. What they don\u2019t tell you is that sometimes, when ignored, the wounds fester.</p><p>What started as a scratch, barely scraping the surface, will turn into a gaping gash, ripping and tearing at the flesh, until all that is left is a jumbled mess of frayed nerves and broken organs. The pain demands to be felt, and you don\u2019t even notice until it is too late. Until it cripples you, bringing you to your knees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carmine drank every night as the heartache lingered, sometimes consuming so much that he blacked out. His days were full of agony, his nights no better as he relived everything in his dreams. The only time he escaped was when he got lost in the blackness. Every night as he slipped into unconsciousness, he prayed that if he did wake up, he would finally forget everything. He just wanted to fucking forget.</p><p>It never worked, though. Every morning he would awaken and feel even worse than the night before, the cycle starting all over again. He was spiraling out of control, but he didn\u2019t care. It didn\u2019t matter what happened to him anymore . . . all he wanted was some peace, no matter the cost.</p><p>He went out almost every night to Luna Rossa with Remy, the loud music and crowds distracting him from his thoughts long enough for the alcohol to take hold. He met others, some that might have been good friends under other circumstances, but none of them could get past that wall he had built. And seeing Remy with his girlfriend, a thin redhead with blue-green eyes, didn\u2019t help Carmine ward off his grief. It reminded him of what he had lost, what he had left, what he needed, but what he could no longer have.</p><p>Carmine kept it together in public, playing that part expected of him, but when he was alone the crack in his fa\u00e7ade deepened.</p> <p>It was early evening when Carmine staggered out of his bedroom, bare chested with his baggy jeans hanging loosely from his hips. He tightened his belt, moving it down another notch, as he made his way downstairs. He stepped over some clothes laying in the hallway as he headed to the kitchen. The air-conditioner wasn\u2019t working, the house stifling and air hazy. It burned his chest to take a deep breath, his head pounding as he poured sweat.</p><p>His stomach growled loudly, pangs of hunger striking his sides. Opening the fridge door, he pulled out a carton of leftover Chinese food. He eyed it suspiciously, trying to remember when he had ordered it, before shrugging it off and grabbing a fork.</p><p>He grabbed a stack of mail from the counter as he ate and sorted through it: bills, notices, junk, shit that wasn\u2019t even addressed to him. He picked up a cream-colored envelope, seeing his name written neatly in cursive on the front. Tearing it open, he pulled out the card, reading the gold inscription on the front.</p><p>Dominic DeMarco and Tess Harper request the honor of your presence at their wedding on October 27 . . .</p><p>There was a knock on the front door, fierce pounding that echoed through the silent house. Carmine didn\u2019t bother to investigate. Instead, he leaned against the counter as he stared at the invitation, hardly tasting the cold noodles he forced down. A wedding. His brother was getting married.</p> <p>The pounding continued, harder and louder, before the front door thrust open. Sunlight streamed through the foyer briefly and then the door slammed.</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d Celia shouted.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d he mumbled, his mouth full of food. Footsteps veered in the direction of the kitchen, Celia appearing in the doorway within a matter of seconds.</p><p>She paused, staring at him with wide eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating.\u201d He held out the carton. \u201cWant some?\u201d</p><p>Celia let out a frustrated groan as she reached for the switch on the wall. The bright light was harsh and Carmine squinted, trying to shield his eyes. \u201cChrist, is that necessary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNecessary?\u201d Celia\u2019s voice was laced with bitterness and disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s called electricity, Carmine. It\u2019s a part of civilization. Of course it\u2019s necessary! But honestly, I\u2019m surprised the lights work around here. The telephone certainly doesn\u2019t seem to.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sighed but kept his mouth shut. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to argue.</p><p>\u201cLook at this place,\u201d she said, crinkling her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting! It reeks!\u201d</p><p>Again, Carmine said nothing. He watched as his aunt started tearing apart the kitchen, throwing away trash and gathering dirty dishes. His feet stayed planted in one spot as she cleaned, muttering under her breath in frustration.</p><p>After the kitchen was decent, she turned to him with a glare. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you have nothing to say. When did you stop caring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what I did?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cStopped caring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it seems.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her. The ache in his chest, dull when he had woken up, grew stronger as they stood there. \u201cI wish that were true.\u201d</p> <p>She scoffed, but the sound of a cell phone going off in another part of the house silenced her. Carmine pushed past her and strolled to the living room, snatching it off the couch cushion where it lay.</p><p>\u201cSo the phone does work,\u201d Celia said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d Carmine shook his head. \u201cJust . . . not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the whole house destroyed?\u201d she continued, ignoring him. \u201cIf the downstairs in this bad, I\u2019d hate to see upstairs. Do you at least have clean clothes? Are you doing laundry? Are you bathing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he snapped, unable to take her questioning on top of everything else. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go nag someone else? I\u2019ve had more than enough of you interrogating me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interrogating you,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this place is a disaster! It feels like an oven in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo busy to pick up after yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo busy to open a window?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, not satisfied with his answers. \u201cWhat\u2019s really going on, Carmine? What\u2019s happening with you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed dryly. \u201cI have things to do, Celia. I don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she conceded. \u201cThis conversation isn\u2019t over, though.\u201d</p><p>After Celia left, Carmine threw on a shirt and shoes before heading back into the kitchen. He glanced in the freezer, frowning when he saw it was empty\u2014no food, not even any ice, and more importantly, no vodka. He entertained the thought of stopping by the store to grab a bottle when his phone beeped, reminding him he had an unread message.</p><p>Hit Sycamore Circle tonight.</p><p>Carmine stared at it with dread. Sycamore Circle was in the north side of the city, an area he knew vaguely but only by name because it was well-known Irish territory. La Cosa Nostra respected the boundaries in Chicago, imaginary or not.</p><p>Carmine grabbed his gun before heading out of the house. He hopped in his car and started on the road to the north side of the city when his phone rang, Remy calling and telling him to pick him up along the way. Carmine detoured a few blocks to Remy\u2019s house, honking the horn as he pulled into the driveway of the modest sky-blue house with the large porch and flimsy chain-link fence. A pit bull puppy ran in circles in the grass, yapping frantically at the intruding car.</p><p>Remy came out right away, flying off the porch and leaping over the fence before stealthily sliding into the passenger seat. The smell of marijuana lingered on his skin and clothes, the man\u2019s eyes completely bloodshot.</p><p>\u201cMan, this is crazy,\u201d Remy said, relaxing into the seat as Carmine pulled away from the house. \u201cIrish \u2018hood? Shit\u2019s about to get real.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s hope not.\u201d</p><p>The sun set as they drove to Sycamore Circle, meeting up with the other guys about a block away. They scoped it out, lounging in Carmine\u2019s car with binoculars as music played from the speakers. Remy pulled out a blunt, lighting it and taking a long hit. He held it out and Carmine promptly grabbed it from him, dropping the binoculars. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had smoked, the drug infiltrating his system and relaxing his taut muscles. Relaxing back into the seat, he closed his eyes, all of his worries leaving in a slow exhale of smoke.</p><p>The job was quick and easy, in and out in minutes. Not a single shot was fired, not a drop of blood spilled as the men surrendered the trucks without a fight. They had caught them off guard and completely unprepared. The last thing they had expected was for Sal to make a move in their territory.</p><p>Night had fallen long before, the air stifling from the late summer heat wave that had been tormenting Chicago for days. Corrado was sweating profusely, his back completely soaked, but he didn\u2019t dare remove his suit coat until he was safely inside his residence. He let it drop to the floor right inside the door, exposing his white button-down that was splattered with fresh blood. He quickly unbuttoned it, wanting to dispose of the offensive material before anyone saw, but the light gasp from the stairs told him he was too late.</p><p>Busted.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be in bed,\u201d he said without even looking at her, more to explain than apologize.</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Celia said softly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>He removed his shirt before making his way to the living room. He lit the fireplace swiftly, tossing the garment in. Burning soiled clothing and disposing of incriminating evidence was something he did so often he could accomplish it in his sleep.</p><p>He could sense Celia behind him, following, watching. He could also sense her trepidation, and he didn\u2019t like it. Celia always found a way to understand.</p><p>\u201cIs something bothering you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t usually wait up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried.\u201d She paused. \u201cWell, I am worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous for you to lose sleep,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not you I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>Corrado watched as the flames consumed the shirt before turning to his wife. A frown tugged her lips, the subtle wrinkles forming on her face more noticeable tonight. He had just seen her a few hours before, but she appeared to have aged years within a single day.</p><p>His beautiful wife\u2014he wanted to take her anxiety away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hurt,\u201d he teased, running the back of his large hand along her warm cheek. \u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t worry about me? I must be doing something wrong.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down for a kiss, hoping her soft lips would help erase the brutal memories of the day, but she pulled away with a dramatic sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Corrado. I know you can take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Celia grew quiet, her frown only deepening. Corrado knew there was so much more she wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d he asked. \u201cI know you\u2019re not finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Carmine\u2019s a different story.\u201d</p><p>Corrado exhaled exasperatedly. He should have known. \u201cNot again, Celia. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s new to all of this,\u201d she said, ignoring his pleas. \u201cI worry about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cHe has no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but he\u2019s hurting,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen him tonight.\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your problem? You\u2019re his Capo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I make sure he does what he needs to in the business,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cHis personal life is none of my concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing,\u201d Corrado said, cutting her off. \u201cI have my own issues to deal with right now. You know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know, but he\u2019s falling apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more I can do,\u201d Corrado insisted. \u201cAnd quite frankly, your meddling is only hurting him more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my nephew, Corrado.

I don\u2019t know what it is, but it\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecoming one of us,\u201d Corrado said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s more than that.\u201d She sighed with frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. I don\u2019t like the people he\u2019s involved with. Why can\u2019t he work with you personally?\u201d</p> <p>Corrado let out an abrupt, bitter laugh. \u201cHave you forgotten what I do, Celia? Do you need me to remind you?\u201d</p><p>He could tell she tried to fight it, but a look of disgust briefly passed over her face. It twisted his stomach with guilt, having to strike her that way.</p><p>\u201cThe stealing is a lot safer than the rest,\u201d Corrado continued. \u201cAnd the kids he\u2019s working with are harmless . . . relatively speaking. You don\u2019t have to agree with me, or even like it, but I hope you\u2019d at least respect it. Respect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen drop it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing all I can.\u201d</p><p>Celia said nothing. Her lack of response told Corrado he had won that round, but he knew there would be more battles. More requests, more denials, more conflicts. His wife was just as determined as he was stubborn.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d he said, hoping to change the subject as he headed for the kitchen. He had been busy all night and hadn\u2019t had time to eat. \u201cCan you make me something?\u201d</p><p>Celia scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m going back to bed. If you want to eat, I\u2019m sure you can help yourself. You\u2019ve never relied on anyone else before, remember, so why start now?\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>We have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head as he stood by the window of his lawyer\u2019s office. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that. I came here because you said you had good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Mr. Borza said. \u201cWell, I did, but it seems petty now in comparison.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Corrado turned to him, not in the mood for guessing games. This case was proving to be harder than his others to shake. \u201cJust be out with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got your arrest record thrown out since it would bias the jury. All previous trials resulted in not guilty verdicts or dropped charges.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Borza agreed. \u201cThe prosecution\u2019s barred from mentioning any of it. Your criminal record, on the other hand, is still in, but it\u2019s squeaky clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe judge ruled the wiretaps at the club weren\u2019t covered by the warrant, so those tapes are inadmissible. I\u2019m still working on the ones from your home. The crime scene photographs were thrown out, since they would unfairly incite the jury. Being guilty under RICO is a far cry from being a cold-blooded murderer.\u201d</p><p>Not as far of a cry as the man thought. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy DiMica and Alfredo Millano are both off the witness list. Seems Tommy recanted his story and now says he doesn\u2019t even know you, and Alfredo was assaulted a few days ago in his jail cell. He\u2019s alive, but in no condition to testify.\u201d</p><p>Corrado nodded. He knew those things already. Tommy and Alfredo were both former La Cosa Nostra, and men who turned against the oath had to pay the price.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cSeems their case is falling apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is there\u2019s a new name on the list.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza picked up a piece of paper and held it out to him. Corrado took it and scanned the list, the name at the bottom jumping off the page:</p><p>Vincenzo Roman DeMarco</p><p>Corrado said nothing as he stared at it, forcing himself not to react.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible they\u2019re planning to subpoena him and he\u2019ll just plead the fifth,\u201d Mr. Borza continued.</p><p>\u201cOr he\u2019s testifying against me to save his own ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA plea bargain,\u201d Mr. Borza said. \u201cI\u2019m not certain, since I\u2019m not on his case anymore. I\u2019ll request a deposition, of course, but in the meantime I\u2019ll see what I can do about getting this to go away permanently.\u201d</p><p>Corrado looked away from the paper and handed it back to the lawyer. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me handle it,\u201d Corrado said, turning to the window once more. \u201cI\u2019d rather you not breathe a word about it to anyone.\u201d</p><p>The loud shrieking echoed through the room. Haven reached beside the bed, slapping the alarm clock to silence it. She was exhausted, her body weary, and entirely too comfortable wrapped in the comforter for her to even consider getting up. A strange buzzing noise met her ears but she did her best to block it out, not caring enough to investigate. She assumed it came from upstairs in Kelsey\u2019s apartment, and if that was the case, she probably didn\u2019t want to know what it was.</p><p>It stopped eventually and silence overtook the room. The moment she finally slipped back to sleep, a succession of bangs jolted her awake. Groaning, she hauled herself out of bed.</p><p>\u201cWake up!\u201d The thick door muffled Kelsey\u2019s voice. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t still in bed! Do you see the time? Up, up, up! Rise and shine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d she yelled, her voice scratchy. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey obnoxiously pounded a few more times even though she knew Haven was on her way. Sighing, she unlocked the door and pulled it open, immediately having a coffee cup thrust in her face.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably cold now since you took so long.\u201d</p><p>Haven rolled her eyes, knowing she had bought it right down the street. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, bringing it to her lips and taking a sip. The hot liquid made her tongue tingle as it burned, but she drank it eagerly anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Kelsey stepped past her into the apartment, watching her with a peculiar look on her face. \u201cFrom the look of you, though, you probably need about ten more of them. Did you get any sleep last night, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d she said, shrugging as she continued to drink her coffee\u2014straight black, just as she preferred. It was the opposite of the one in Kelsey\u2019s hand, which she ordered every morning like clockwork on the way to school\u2014venti soy chai latte, four pumps, no foam, extra hot. Haven had no clue what any of that meant.</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d She echoed the word, her expression telling Haven she didn\u2019t believe it. A smile crept on to her lips after a second, a sinister twinkle in her eye. \u201cDid you have company last night? A guy, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Haven said quickly, looking at her with disbelief as the blush rose onto her cheeks. \u201cI would never do . . . that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity,\u201d Kelsey joked. \u201cYou could use a good fuck to loosen you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey!\u201d</p><p>The two girls had easily become what most people would consider best friends, despite the fact that they were polar opposites in nearly everything. Kelsey grew up lavishly, never having to clean or even wear the same outfit twice. She had had the type of childhood where she asked for a pony and actually got it, whereas Haven had been doomed to sleep in the same grungy stables as one.</p><p>Kelsey loved going to crowded parties and got her news from trashy gossip magazines. Haven preferred staying home and losing herself in books. But still, something about her put Haven at ease. She reminded Haven of the life she had left behind, the one that part of her still yearned to belong to . . . the life she had nearly built with Carmine.</p><p>It still hurt her to think about, a burn in her chest constantly reminding Haven that a part of her soul had been torn away. It was a piece he had taken with him, one that would always be wherever he was.</p><p>Most days she could think of Carmine fondly, remembering things they had done together and everything he had said, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. There were still times when she questioned if she would ever smile again, worried the pain would one day swallow her whole.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced at her friend as she waved her hand in front of her face. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening to me? Jesus, girl, get yourself together. We have a long day ahead of us. You can\u2019t space out on me.\u201d Kelsey looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s your phone? I tried calling you on my way here but you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked, unable to recall hearing the phone ring. \u201cWhere were you, anyway? You aren\u2019t a morning person. Usually I have to drag you out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I just got home,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cStayed at Derrick\u2019s last night. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haven held her hand up to stop her. \u201cEnough said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous wench.\u201d Kelsey scrunched her nose as she surveyed Haven. \u201cFind your phone, and get dressed while you\u2019re at it. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going anywhere with you looking like that.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Haven headed for the bedroom. \u201cAlways so bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the many reasons you love me,\u201d she yelled.</p><p>Haven took sips of her coffee as she headed into her bedroom, spotting the black phone laying on the bed. Three missed calls lit up the screen, the first two from Kelsey, and she froze when her eyes fell upon number three. She stared at the name as her heart pounded forcefully, the blood furiously rushing through her veins.</p><p>Corrado Moretti</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any liquor?\u201d Kelsey hollered through the door. \u201cWhat are you, a nun?\u201d</p><p>Haven set her phone down, laughing, as she walked to the dresser. She dressed quickly, pulling her hair up to get it off her neck.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Kelsey yelled. \u201cI\u2019ll get some upstairs!\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head and glanced at the clock, seeing it was a few minutes before ten. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she grabbed her phone again. Her hand shook nervously as she scrolled through her contacts, stopping when she reached Corrado\u2019s number.</p><p>It rang a few times before she heard the click. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Haven breathed a sigh of relief at the soft, feminine voice. \u201cHello, Celia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven!\u201d she gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She immediately felt guilty. \u201cI\u2019ve been . . . busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to make excuses, kiddo. I just worry about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, but I promise I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cIs Corrado there? He called this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d she asked, surprised. \u201cHe stepped out earlier, said he had some things to take care of.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you tell him I called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said quietly, suddenly feeling queasy. She bit her lip, trying to hold it back as she said good-bye and hung up the phone. She had a long day ahead of her and needed to keep it together.</p><p>She grabbed her things and headed back out to find Kelsey in the living room, staring at one of the paintings on the wall. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p> <p>Jumping, Kelsey turned as she clutched her chest. \u201cI see a girl who needs to get laid,\u201d she said sarcastically as she surveyed Haven again. \u201cShe also needs some makeup for those bags under her eyes and a pedicure if she\u2019s going to wear flip-flops.\u201d</p><p>The girls departed, taking a taxi the few blocks to the Rainbow Art Center. Every semester they were required to do five hours of volunteer work, whether in a gallery or library or out in the community. Haven was excited about the opportunity to help, while Kelsey seemed to be dreading it more than anything.</p><p>Kelsey pulled the lid off her cup and gulped her drink as she started toward the entrance of the building. \u201cRemind me why we\u2019re here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they were easier to deal with than the artsy-fartsy intellectual types who spoke in haikus and took themselves way too seriously,\u201d Haven said, recalling her exact statement.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Kelsey smirked. \u201cNever trust a man in a beret with a French accent. He\u2019s either gay or a con artist. Trust me on this.\u201d</p> <p>Haven shook her head, not even wanting to know the story behind that.</p><p>Chaos reigned, screeching voices and thunderous footsteps dominating the building. The moment the door shut behind them, a form came right for Haven. She braced herself as a little girl slammed right into her legs. Snotty nosed and wide-eyed, the child stared up at her with a mixture of confusion and fascination.</p><p>She smiled at the little girl adoringly, her thick dark hair fanning in her face and partially shielding her view. \u201cUh, hey, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The little girl said nothing, just continued to stare.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re animals, I swear,\u201d Kelsey muttered. Haven glanced over and laughed when she saw she had two little boys running around her legs, hindering her ability to walk. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I like the zoo.\u201d</p><p>A lady approached them, unfazed by the madness, and smiled warmly as she wrangled the children. \u201cYou must be the volunteers,\u201d she said, pulling the little girl away. \u201cThis is Emma, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello, Emma.\u201d</p><p>The little girl smiled at the sound of her name before scampering away and joining the others. The teacher, Mrs. Clementine, showed them around before calling the class to order with a loud whistle. The noise echoed through the room, bouncing off the walls and stilling everyone immediately.</p><p>\u201cIn your seats,\u201d she declared. They started to oblige and Haven jumped into action, helping hand out the art supplies.</p><p>The Rainbow Art Center was attached to the local community center, where they taught free art classes for underprivileged children. The name struck Haven as ironic, because there was nothing bright or colorful about the place. The walls were a drab gray color and the paint was chipping, the building falling apart.</p><p>Most of the kids who came to the center had no families, every one of them deemed at-risk by the state. So young and innocent, Haven knew they were all only one step away from living the life she had once lived.</p><p>They spent two hours painting and drawing with the kids. By the time class was over, Haven was worn out. Their caregivers trickled in to pick them up, and Emma met Haven at the door, smiling brightly as she held her paintings.</p><p>\u201cI made you!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>Haven laughed and took it, gazing at the distorted stick figure with the abnormally large head and big brown hair. There was a large red mouth on the face and a big yellow sun taking up half of the sky.</p> <p>Haven smiled. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cCan I be an artist like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Haven said. \u201cYou can be anything you want to be.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>Carmine stuck a screwdriver in a delivery truck\u2019s ignition and tried to turn it, but nothing happened. It wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Groaning, he yanked it back out as another truck sped from the lot, spraying his windshield with loose gravel. He used the screwdriver to jimmy open the ignition, cracking the plastic cover as he forced it off, and pulled the red power wires from the cylinder. He stripped them quickly before tightly twisting the two of them together. The lights on the dash immediately turned on as the radio came to life, a heavy rock song rattling from the cheap speakers. Carmine grabbed the brown starter wires next and stripped them, immediately striking them hard against the red ones.</p><p>Mistake.</p><p>It sparked, a strong jolt of electricity burning his glove-clad fingers. He dropped the wires and cursed loudly as someone banged on the side of the truck.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man!\u201d Remy yelled. \u201cGet that shit started!\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, Carmine grabbed the brown wires again and held his breath as he touched them to the others. It sparked once more, but the engine roared to life before Carmine was forced to let go. He shook his hand, trying to wave off the pain as the truck idled. He had had to resort to hot-wiring a few times when the old screwdriver-in-the-ignition trick failed, but he had yet to figure out how to do it without damn near electrocuting himself.</p><p>Remy jumped up on the side of the cab and looked in. Even though his face was concealed by a black ski mask, Carmine could tell he was grinning with pride. \u201cThat\u2019s how you fucking do it, man,\u201d he said, reaching through the window to punch him on the shoulder. It was playful, but Carmine winced at the blow. \u201cDrive it to the spot, will you? I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Before he could object, Remy snatched Carmine\u2019s keys from his lap and ran off. Carmine put the truck in gear, knowing he had no other choice, and sped from the lot near the docks by Lake Michigan. His heart pounded ferociously as he pulled into the busy Chicago streets behind his Mercedes, his eyes surveying the other cars for signs of trouble. Distracted, he lost track of Remy as he hastily weaved through traffic, squeezing into tight spots where the delivery truck wouldn\u2019t fit.</p><p>It took nearly a half hour for Carmine to reach the secluded warehouse on the outskirts of town. The other delivery truck was already parked behind the building when he arrived and was being unloaded by a few associates of La Cosa Nostra. Carmine pulled in beside it and climbed out from behind the wheel, standing along the side to watch as the men wordlessly went to work.</p><p>It fascinated him how the drop-off ran fluidly like a well-oiled machine. Everyone had a job and everyone did their part, like runners in a relay race. It was habitual, a routine he had fallen into as he slowly submerged himself into life as a member of a street crew. Every week it was the same thing, the same schemes with the same guys, but in different locations around the city. And while it hadn\u2019t gotten better, and Carmine ventured to guess it never would, he had learned the art of detachment\u2014being able to step out of himself for a moment and look the other way.</p><p>He was fractured, one half of him the still slightly na\u00efve boy who drank himself unconscious to try to forget, the other half the man, numb to everything, who just went through the motions day after day. It was that man who went out at night and did the things that were expected of him\u2014the theft, the violence, the deception\u2014but it was the boy, heartbroken and disgusted, who woke up in the morning to face the aftermath.</p><p>It took about an hour for the trucks to be unloaded. Afterward, the owner of the warehouse handed Carmine an envelope of cash. He glanced inside, stealthily counting the bills, before slipping it in his pocket with a nod. He strolled away, the transaction complete, and hesitated outside the warehouse. His eyes scanned the dark property and he was about to start panicking when his Mercedes sped up, coming to a halt a few feet from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell took you so long?\u201d Carmine asked when Remy climbed out. \u201cIt\u2019s been over an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad something I needed to take care of,\u201d he replied, tossing Carmine\u2019s keys to him. \u201cThe car\u2019s nice, man. Runs smooth. You\u2019re a lucky bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, I guess,\u201d Carmine muttered, getting in the driver\u2019s seat while Remy slipped in beside him. \u201cWhat was so important you ditched the job for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ditch the job.\u201d Remy laughed. \u201cI just took a little detour, that\u2019s all. And it was nothing, really. Just had to pick something up from Vanessa. You know how it is.\u201d</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t press him to elaborate. He figured if Remy was being evasive, he probably didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>Haven let out a deep sigh as she headed into the brownstone, fumbling with her keys. She had been at a school function half the night, but slipped out as soon as she could get away with leaving. Exhaustion infiltrated every cell in her body and slowed her steps to a snail\u2019s pace. She grabbed the knob on her door, her brow furrowing when it turned right away. Her heart thumped erratically, realizing it was unlocked.</p><p>Silently, carefully, she stepped inside, horrified to see her drawers open from being rifled through. She pulled out the container of pepper spray she usually carried before tiptoeing through the dark apartment. She stepped into the quiet kitchen and reached for the light switch, but the moment her fingers touched it, a thump rang out upstairs.</p><p>Haven\u2019s heart stalled as she looked at the ceiling instinctively. The hairs on her arms stood on end as a strange feeling crept through her, the sensation that she wasn\u2019t alone nearly buckling her knees.</p><p>She stood as still as a statue, trying to convince herself she had been hearing things, when an unmistakable crash upstairs registered with her ears. She gasped, trembling, as she heard footsteps, originating in Kelsey\u2019s bedroom and heading down the hall. They were heavy, clomping against the wooden floor as if weighed down by steel. It reminded Haven of how Michael used to walk, the sound of his boots in the house as they sat in the dank cellar awaiting punishment.</p><p>She debated briefly as the footsteps started down the stairs, dizzy from the flood of memories. He was too close for her to make an escape undetected, so she slipped into a hallway closet and quietly shut the door.</p><p>The footsteps drew nearer, entering her apartment and walking right past where she hid, disrupting the natural light. She held her breath, not daring to move a fraction of an inch while they were there. The apartment was a flurry of noise as they shut drawers and moved things around, breathing heavily but never speaking.</p><p>It felt like an eternity before they left again. Haven heard them exit the building and she slipped out of the closet, even more stunned at her apartment this time. The chaos she had encountered minutes earlier was gone, everything back in its place, cleaner than she had left it that morning. Even the front door had been meticulously locked again, leaving no sign that anyone had even been there.</p><p>Carmine stepped into Luna Rossa, nodding to the bouncer before making his way to the back where his crew huddled around a large booth. He started toward them but barely made it a few feet when someone stepped directly in his path. \u201cCome with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carmine blanched as Corrado motioned toward the door. He had his coat on, a small flash of silver gleaming from his belt when he moved. Gun.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come on.\u201d</p><p>Carmine hesitated but followed his uncle out of the club, slipping into the passenger seat of his car as Corrado climbed behind the wheel. He started it up without hesitation, throwing it in gear and speeding from the lot.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Carmine asked. Had he done something wrong?</p><p>\u201cA few Irish have been hanging out on Clark Street, harassing the owner of the pawn shop on the corner.\u201d</p><p>Carmine eyed him peculiarly. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to make them go away.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s stomach dropped. Work. He hadn\u2019t been on a job with Corrado before, and he wasn\u2019t looking forward to going on one now. \u201cI\u2019m guessing they\u2019re there now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing the video poker machines,\u201d he said, his voice dripping with disgust. Corrado hated gambling, he had learned, even though a lot of his money came from underground sports betting.</p><p>They were silent the short drive to the store. Corrado pulled right up to the curb and got out without a word. Carmine followed him inside, immediately hearing the ruckus in the back. The men shouted and laughed, their thick Irish accents echoing through the shop as they banged against the machines.</p><p>Corrado walked straight to the back, taking a direct path to them. Carmine cut along the front, slipping down a side aisle out of view to sneak up behind them.</p><p>The men saw Corrado coming but barely had enough time to react before he grabbed the back of a guy\u2019s head and slammed it into the machine. He cried out with the loud crunch, blood pouring from his face as his nose shattered. He grabbed it, staggering when Corrado let go of him.</p><p>Corrado stealthily reached for the man\u2019s gun the same time the second Irish pulled out his own. They aimed at each other simultaneously as Carmine stepped out of the aisle behind the guy, flicking off the safety of his pistol.</p><p>Carmine pressed the muzzle against the back of his head. He tensed when he felt it, his hand shaking slightly. Corrado grabbed his own gun from his coat with his other hand and pointed it, too. The Irish man hesitated but slowly raised his hands in the air, taking his finger off the trigger. Carmine disarmed him and took a step back.</p> <p>Corrado put the first guy\u2019s gun in his pocket, keeping his own cocked as he stared him down. \u201cIf I ever hear of you coming back here, I\u2019ll do more than break a nose. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure to tell O\u2019Bannon I said hello,\u201d Corrado said, his cold tone causing goose bumps to spring up on Carmine\u2019s skin. \u201cNow go.\u201d</p><p>They hesitated, looking dumbfounded as they stared at Corrado, and Carmine groaned. \u201cYou heard the fucking man. He said go, so go, motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>They shot Carmine angry glares before scurrying for the exit. One of the men lingered at the door, though, turning to eye them with anger. \u201cYou want us to stay out of your territory, tell your boss to stay out of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t step foot in your territory,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>The man shook his head. \u201cYou sound like you actually believe your lies.\u201d</p><p>They were lies. Carmine himself had raided Sycamore Circle, so he knew for a fact they had crossed the imaginary lines.</p> <p>Corrado sighed when they finally left, sliding his eyes to Carmine. \u201cYou and that mouth. The elders believed we should be gentlemen in how we spoke and always presentable in how we dressed. How hard is it to put on a suit?\u201d</p><p>Carmine glanced down at his clothes. He had on jeans and a black button-up shirt, nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cSuits are for weddings and funerals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I suppose you\u2019ll be wearing one on Sunday, then?\u201d</p><p>Carmine tensed. \u201cWhat\u2019s Sunday?\u201d</p><p>Corrado started to comment but his phone rung and stopped him. He pulled it from his pocket and glanced at the screen.</p><p>\u201cMake him pay up,\u201d Corrado said, motioning toward the man working the counter. \u201cA couple thousand.\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded hesitantly as his uncle turned away, bringing his phone to his ear to answer it. \u201cHello? Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>He knew immediately from the casual greeting that it was a personal call. He watched with confusion as Corrado bolted out of the door\u2014he wasn\u2019t the kind of person to take a personal call while on business.</p><p>He shrugged it off, nothing about the day making much sense, and headed to the front. \u201cYou got money for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cHow much is some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, about five hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be fucking kidding me,\u201d Carmine said, stepping behind the counter where the man stood. Carmine spotted a baseball bat hidden near the register for protection and grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe a thousand,\u201d the man said quickly, backtracking. \u201cYeah, I have a thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s twenty-five hundred,\u201d Carmine said nonchalantly, stepping back out from behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t have that right now,\u201d he said. \u201cMy kids have summer camp, and my wife\u2019s pregnant. I can have it next week, but I just don\u2019t have it all today.\u201d</p><p>Carmine walked through the shop as the man fumbled with the safe and pulled out a stack of bills. His hand shook as he counted them out, and Carmine tried to fight back his guilt. They were just innocent people, caught in the middle and trying to make a living, but if it wasn\u2019t them extorting the cash, it would be someone else. Someone less civil, who would demand a whole lot more.</p><p>Besides, he thought, it was better than the alternative. If he weren\u2019t robbing people of money and possessions, he would be robbing them of their lives, and he would much rather take what could be replaced.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Carmine said, swinging the bat with as much force as he could. It slammed into the glass display case, shattering it and sending shards flying everywhere. He threw the bat behind the counter, nearly hitting the man with it, and grabbed the cash.</p><p>Carmine walked out, unable to even look at the shop owner, and opened the passenger door of Corrado\u2019s car. He climbed inside and saw his uncle was still on the phone, a serious expression on his face as he listened to whomever was on the line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in the morning,\u201d he said, pulling away from the curb. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ll notify you when I land.\u201d</p><p>He sighed exasperatedly as he ended the call and glanced at Carmine. \u201cHow much did you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all he had.\u201d</p><p>Corrado reached over, snatching the cash from him. He counted it out, barely paying attention to the road as he sped through the city.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s curiosity got the best of him after a bit. \u201cAre you taking a trip or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d he responded, tossing a single hundred dollar bill at Carmine and shoving the rest into the center console. \u201cYou\u2019re too soft. He would\u2019ve given you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my temper and smashed one of his displays,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured I cost him more in damages than he owed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he responded as he pulled back into the parking lot of the club. \u201cYou need to learn to control your temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d he said, eyeing his uncle suspiciously. He seemed distracted, his eyes darting toward the clock on the dashboard. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere I\u2019m needed,\u201d he said, evading. \u201cWhere doesn\u2019t matter. But I have to leave right now to be back in time for the wedding, so you need to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding,\u201d Carmine muttered, the word striking him. Sunday was his brother\u2019s wedding.</p><p>\u201cYes, wedding.\u201d Corrado reached over, opening the passenger door and waving his hand dismissively. \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>Carmine got out of the car and slammed the door. He watched as Corrado hit the gas and sped off, tires squealing. His words played through Carmine\u2019s mind, an odd feeling coursing through him. Where doesn\u2019t matter . . .</p><p>His head started to pound again, the ache in his chest intensifying, and a sinking feeling hit his stomach as Corrado\u2019s car disappeared from sight.</p><p>\u201cHaven.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t taken Carmine long to make up his mind after Corrado\u2019s car pulled away. The moment his uncle turned onto the road, he reacted on impulse. Sprinting to his car, he unlocked the driver\u2019s side door and slipped inside. Tires squealed as he hit the gas, flying out of the packed parking lot and into traffic within seconds.</p><p>The roads weren\u2019t congested at that hour, but Carmine didn\u2019t see his uncle anywhere, so he drove in the direction of their neighborhood hoping he went home first. The moment he pulled onto the street, he saw the Mercedes idling in the driveway.</p><p>Carmine parked a few houses down and turned off his headlights to wait. Corrado came outside a minute later with a black duffel bag and glanced around cautiously before getting back into his car. He pulled out of the driveway and sped down the street, and Carmine waited a few seconds before starting on the road. He slipped in behind another car, weaving through traffic in the direction of the airport.</p><p>He stayed back as far as possible, making sure there were cars between them so not to raise suspicion. He lost Corrado\u2019s car twice but each time caught back up, having a general idea of where he was going, until he unexpectedly pulled down a side street a few miles into the trip.</p><p>Carmine slowed, unsure of what he was doing, but followed his uncle. They drove along a few vacant roads before cutting down an alley, and Carmine slammed the brakes when he turned and nearly rear-ended Corrado\u2019s car.</p><p>His heart pounded forcefully when he realized it was a dead-end. Corrado\u2019s driver\u2019s side door hung open, no sign of him anywhere. Before Carmine could shift the car into reverse, his door opened and someone grabbed him. It happened fast, the movement startling him, and the car stalled from his haste. He had enough time to pull the emergency brake, not wanting it to roll, before he was yanked out into the alley and thrown against the side of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Corrado asked, pressing the muzzle of his gun underneath Carmine\u2019s chin.</p><p>He shook, stunned. \u201cI, uh . . . fuck! I don\u2019t know. I just thought . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t paid to think,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cYou\u2019re paid to follow orders and I don\u2019t recall telling you to follow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me not to, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d The sound of Corrado\u2019s finger releasing the safety of his gun sent a cold chill down Carmine\u2019s spine. \u201cI\u2019m tired of your disrespect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it! I just . . . had to know. I had to see, Uncle Corrado.\u201d</p><p>Corrado froze briefly, not moving or making a sound.</p><p>\u201cYou think I won\u2019t kill you because you\u2019re Vincent\u2019s child?\u201d he asked, his voice menacingly quiet. \u201cDo you honestly believe I\u2019m that soft?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said quickly, squeezing his eyes shut at his words. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any disrespect.\u201d</p><p>Corrado put the gun away and let go of Carmine. \u201cThere\u2019s no justification for you following me. Where I\u2019m going doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, trying to stop trembling as he stood up straight. \u201cIf you\u2019re going where I think you\u2019re going\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I just say?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cI told you in Durante to make your decision and you did. You need to be a man of your word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m right?\u201d he asked exasperatedly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to intervene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to intervene,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI just . . . Christ, I wanna know where she is, what she\u2019s doing. Why the fuck you\u2019re running off in the middle of the night. Is something wrong? Is she hurt or something?\u201d</p><p>Corrado stared at him as he rattled off questions, his expression blank, but Carmine could see the annoyance in his eyes. He knew he shouldn\u2019t have been questioning him, but he needed something, anything . . . just a bit of information to keep him going.</p><p>Glancing at his watch, Corrado sighed impatiently. He looked as if he were going to speak and hope swelled through Carmine, but it was trampled when he instead raised his gun again. Carmine recoiled as his uncle fired off two shots in his direction, the unexpected noise startling him. Carmine turned to look incredulously, seeing the driver\u2019s side tires of his car rapidly deflating.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to tail someone, at least be discreet about it.\u201d Corrado placed the gun back in his coat. \u201cCall for a tow truck and go home. I don\u2019t need you slowing me down any more than you already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fucking great,\u201d Carmine muttered as his uncle walked away.</p><p>Corrado paused. \u201cThat\u2019s an order, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>20</p><p>Haven nervously watched the clock, waiting for the black rental car to slowly pull up the street. It parked in a free spot directly in front of the brownstone, and Corrado climbed out, fixing his tie and looking around before heading inside. He tapped once on her door, patiently waiting for her to open up.</p><p>She started stammering as soon as he entered, trying to explain what had happened, but he held his hand up to stop her. She flinched from the sudden movement and he froze. \u201cI have no intention of harming you.\u201d</p> <p>Haven stood still by the door as he checked out the place. The apartment appeared undisturbed and Haven felt ridiculous, wondering if Corrado had flown out for nothing.</p><p>\u201cIs your upstairs neighbor home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, no, not yet,\u201d she said. \u201cKelsey stayed with a guy last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook around and tell me if anything has been taken,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to check her apartment and make sure neither of you have been bugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>She sorted through things, taking inventory, and found nothing missing. Even the cash she kept in a drawer was still there. Always use cash, Corrado had said, never leave a paper trail.</p><p>Corrado came back downstairs after a bit, leaving the door open a crack as he lingered near it. \u201cThe place is clean. Anything missing down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t really own anything valuable, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cValue doesn\u2019t always equal a monetary amount,\u201d he said. \u201cNo diaries?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head before it dawned on her. \u201cOh, crap!\u201d</p><p>Darting into the living room, she scanned the bookshelf and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the worn leather book amongst the others. \u201cI have Maura\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Haven turned to him and started to speak, to ask what she should do, when the front door thrust open, catching Haven off guard. She gasped as Corrado turned, reaching into his coat for his gun. He clutched it but didn\u2019t pull it out as Kelsey appeared in the doorway, her eyes darting between Haven and Corrado.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the DILF?\u201d she asked, leaving the door wide open as she motioned toward Corrado. Her eyes scanned him, a small smile coming upon her lips.</p><p>Haven\u2019s cheeks flushed. \u201cKelsey . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your missing friend?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cThe one that lives upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d Kelsey\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cAre you a cop or something?\u201d</p><p>Corrado glanced at her. \u201cDo I look like a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, you do have a gun.\u201d</p><p>Corrado immediately removed his hand from his weapon, covering it again with his coat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . .\u201d Haven started, unsure of how to explain it.</p><p>\u201cCorrado,\u201d he said, finishing her statement as he politely held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cKelsey,\u201d she said, shaking it. \u201cObviously you already know that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to make a phone call.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the kitchen, pulling out his phone. The moment he was out of earshot, Kelsey jokingly punched Haven\u2019s arm. \u201cWhere the hell did he come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019ve known him for a while,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie\u2014I was hoping you wouldn\u2019t go home alone last night. I hoped you\u2019d get some of that stiffness knocked out of you, if you know what I mean, but how did you pull that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think we . . . ?\u201d Haven was stunned. \u201cNo way! He\u2019s married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cA man like that needs more than just one woman to take care of him. I can\u2019t believe you spent all night with him and still didn\u2019t get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I spent all night with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the same clothes on from yesterday,\u201d she said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cDid you at least blow him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey, shut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a prude,\u201d she said, smirking. \u201cIf you won\u2019t, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Haven shook her head furiously. \u201cOh, God, why would you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously asking me that?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you blind? He has that whole mysterious and dangerous look about him. There\u2019s no way a man like that isn\u2019t well endowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Kelsey rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, relax. I get it. You have no interest in men, except for Cartman . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d she corrected her.</p><p>\u201cCartman, Carmine\u2014same difference. I\u2019ve known you a few months now, honey, and I\u2019ve yet to see that guy. He doesn\u2019t call, he doesn\u2019t write, he doesn\u2019t visit. He may as well be a ghost, but that fine specimen in the kitchen? He\u2019s real, he\u2019s tangible, and there comes a point where you have to give up the fantasy for the reality.\u201d She paused and glanced down the hallway as Corrado headed back in their direction. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t hurt when the reality looks a hell of a lot like my fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stepped in the room, slipping his phone in his pocket as he gazed at Haven. \u201cYou should be safe here, but I\u2019m going to have the locks replaced.\u201d</p><p>A tense silence fell over the room as Kelsey\u2019s eyes clouded with suspicion. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke in,\u201d Haven mumbled. \u201cThey were here when I got home.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDid they get anything? Did they hit my place, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe scared them away before they could make it that far,\u201d Corrado chimed in. \u201cNo harm done.\u201d</p><p>Haven nodded, confirming the lie. She looked at the clock as another bout of tension swept through the room. \u201cI need to get ready. We have somewhere to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you skip it today,\u201d Corrado said.</p><p>Haven shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a curious look. \u201cCan\u2019t, or won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as if he had expected that answer. \u201cProceed, then.\u201d</p><p>Haven left the two of them alone in the living room to get dressed. Kelsey was sitting on her couch eating when Haven returned, but Corrado was nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cHe stepped outside,\u201d Kelsey said before Haven had a chance to ask. \u201cGot a call from what I assume is his wife. Major mood killer.\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s not your type. He\u2019s a serious person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s intense. You\u2019re not in, like, WITSEC are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Haven asked.</p><p>\u201cWITSEC. You know, witness protection, where the government gives you a new identity so gangsters can\u2019t find you?\u201d</p><p>Haven cracked a smile at the irony, considering it had been the gangster to give her a new identity to hide from the government. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how come I\u2019ve never seen him here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t live around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does he live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so nosy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cHow did you meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a . . . friend of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? He looks really familiar, like I\u2019ve seen him somewhere before,\u201d she said, standing. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. He is a cop, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the questions?\u201d Haven asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure out who he is. Is it a crime to want to know about my friend\u2019s life? You don\u2019t talk much about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey rolled her eyes. \u201cWhatever, let me get dressed and we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s car was gone when they headed outside. They shared a cab in silence to the Rainbow Art Center and spent the morning cleaning the place, organizing everything and gathering up all of the kids\u2019 artwork. They carefully framed them all and spent two hours affixing the paintings to the wall and decorating for a party. Kelsey left at one point to get snacks and drinks as Haven blew up balloons. She turned around to get something, nearly colliding with someone standing there. The person grabbed her shoulders as she screamed, caught off guard.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where I was?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t keep tabs on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure, but I didn\u2019t know how closely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough that I could find you at any given moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to know. It\u2019s nice what you do here, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, flushing. Was that a compliment? \u201cThanks. I enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you do,\u201d he said. \u201cMaura did similar things. She always said if she helped just one person, it would have been worth the sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned that in her journal,\u201d Haven mumbled. \u201cI feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you understand why Carmine left you, then?\u201d</p><p>Haven cringed from the question, not expecting it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVincent fought to ensure Carmine didn\u2019t turn out like him, but at eighteen he made the exact same decision his father did anyway,\u201d Corrado explained. \u201cIt\u2019s logical they\u2019d worry what happened to Maura would happen to you, too. What they fail to realize, though, is the main thing Maura tried to teach them. Cambiano i suonatori ma la musica \u00e8 sempre quella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a moment as he wandered through the room, his attention focused on the juvenile paintings. It was weird watching him. Haven never took Corrado as someone who would be remotely interested in those sorts of things.</p><p>\u201cYou read her journal, so am I correct to assume you know I failed her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFailed her?\u201d she asked hesitantly. \u201cShe didn\u2019t see it that way. She said you were always fair to her, even when she was . . . you know . . . in your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve done more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we all?\u201d she responded. \u201cWe\u2019re only human, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot like Maura, but there are some differences. She wouldn\u2019t have stood here and held a conversation with me, that\u2019s for sure, and she would\u2019ve certainly abandoned her plans the second I demanded.\u201d He paused, smiling with amusement. \u201cRegardless, I see why they\u2019d worry, but just because a person\u2019s situation changes, doesn\u2019t mean they change. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in North Carolina or California or New York or Illinois\u2014you are who you are. That\u2019s what I meant by it.\u201d</p><p>The door swung open then, sunlight filtering in from outside.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever been in a Wal-Mart?\u201d Kelsey hollered, coming in the room and dropping bags on the floor. \u201cThat place was a madhouse. I felt like I stepped into some alternate universe where banana clips and blue eye shadow are still in style. And Jesus, what\u2019s with all the big hair? I\u2019m surprised I made it out alive! Half those women looked like they could eat me for supper! And I swear, I saw a minivan in the parking lot with one of those honor student bumper stickers, and the woman driving had on . . .\u201d She glanced over, her words faltering when she spotted Corrado. \u201c. . . Mom jeans. Hello, there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cI\u2019ll let you ladies get back to your work.\u201d</p><p>He strolled away, stepping outside as he pulled out his phone.</p><p>\u201cPersonal bodyguard?\u201d Kelsey asked, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. \u201cIs this like the Bodyguard movie, steamy affair included?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I told you, it\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d She shrugged and started digging through the bags, setting up the snack table. They ordered pizza and Haven fixed the punch when people arrived, the children excitedly running in while their caretakers lingered off to the side. Some didn\u2019t even bother to stay, instead dropping the children off at the curb.</p> <p>Corrado stuck around for the party, watching warily, so quiet and stoic most barely noticed his presence. Others, however, cast him suspicious looks as they kept their distance. Haven smiled, realizing they likely thought the same thing Kelsey had\u2014he was a police officer.</p><p>It was chaotic with so many kids running around, and Haven did her best to keep everything under control as they held a ceremony and handed out certificates. When it was over and time to go, Haven gave each kid a hug, telling them the same words that had been spoken to her at their age. Words she had lost focus of in the midst of all the heartache, but words both Maura and her mother had wholeheartedly believed.</p><p>\u201cNever lose hope,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re special and meant to do great things in the world. I believe in you.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey offered to walk one of the kids home as Haven cleaned up the mess. She could sense Corrado\u2019s eyes on her but ignored him the best she could, trying to finish what she needed to do.</p><p>Corrado cleared his voice. \u201cWere you attached?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Haven said quietly. \u201cThey reminded me of myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStrange how those things work. Doesn\u2019t matter where you go\u2014there will always be someone.\u201d Haven nodded and reached for the large black trash bag, but Corrado grabbed it. \u201cI\u2019ll get this for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cThe Dumpster is out back.\u201d</p><p>Haven finished cleaning up and grabbed her things before heading for the parking lot, finding Corrado\u2019s empty rental car parked by the door. She started around the building to see if he was still at the Dumpster. She froze when she saw him behind the parking lot with a man, the driver\u2019s side door open on a black car with New York tags. The man had his back to her, so she couldn\u2019t see his face, but his body language told her it wasn\u2019t just casual conversation.</p><p>The man climbed in the car after a second, tires squealing as he sped out of the opposite side of the parking lot.</p><p>Corrado approached. \u201cDo you need a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a few blocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d He waved her off dismissively. \u201cGet in the car.\u201d</p><p>Corrado didn\u2019t speak at all during the drive. Not long after they arrived, someone showed up to change the locks on the brownstone.</p><p>\u201cI have some things to handle, and I need to get some sleep,\u201d Corrado said, handing Haven a new set of keys. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow to make it to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Wedding? \u201cSomeone\u2019s getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDominic and Tess,\u201d Corrado said, eyeing her peculiarly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you receive your invitation?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cNo. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>His expression flickered, a frown on his lips. \u201cI must\u2019ve forgotten to send it. There\u2019s still time, though, if you\u2019d like to send a gift. I\u2019ll stop by in the morning before I leave to pick it up, if you want to go get something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, not knowing how to respond to that. \u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re welcome,\u201d he responded. \u201cHave a good evening, kid.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>Carmine sat alone in a booth in the back of the club, shot glasses scattered along the table in front of him. He could feel the alcohol flowing through his veins, diluting his blood stream and hindering the thoughts from flooding his brain. They still came, a slow trickle of memories washing through him, but he found it easier to tolerate in smaller doses like this.</p><p>It still hurt, though. It was still a constant reminder of what could have been but wasn\u2019t, and as far as he was concerned, never would be. There were reminders everywhere: in the deep brown of the wooden table that resembled the color of her eyes, in the twinkling of the club lights that made him think of catching fireflies, in the melody of the song playing that sounded vaguely like the one she used to hum.</p><p>She was everywhere, yet nowhere, and every second that passed felt like walking away from her all over again. No matter what he did, no matter what he tried, he couldn\u2019t forget. The memory of Haven haunted him.</p><p>He downed the last shot on the table, closing his eyes as he savored the burn, hoping it would finally be the one to kill the pain.</p><p>If someone years before had asked Carmine what life in Chicago would be like, he would have given them some clich\u00e9 answer about money, power, and respect, but he knew better now. La Cosa Nostra wasn\u2019t about any of that.</p><p>As Sal sat comfortably, pointing fingers and calling shots from his twelve-million-dollar mansion while drinking the best scotch money could buy, the men carrying out the jobs were barely scraping by. They were risking their lives for people who just stood by while they struggled, not caring what happened to them as long as they handed over a cut of their take.</p><p>It was all about paying tribute. If a group of guys hijacked a shipment, right off the top more than half went into the pockets of the administration. After giving the associates their cut and paying off everyone who looked the other way, each man was left with barely enough to pay their rent.</p><p>A taste, they called it. Everyone always wanted a taste. They claimed, as a family, that they all worked as one. They said it was a matter of respect. They said it was the honorable thing to do.</p><p>As far as Carmine was concerned, it was utter bullshit.</p><p>Where was the respect in being summoned out of bed at three in the morning to watch a man get his head bashed in because he borrowed money he couldn\u2019t pay back? Where was the respect in burning some man\u2019s house down, taking away everything he had worked for his entire life, because he gave the Boss a look he didn\u2019t appreciate? Where was the respect in intimidating a seventeen-year-old girl and threatening to kill everyone she loved because she witnessed something she shouldn\u2019t have seen?</p><p>Assault, extortion, hijacking, kidnapping, robbery, bribery, gambling, chop shops, prostitution, corruption, arson, coercion, fraud, bootlegging, human trafficking, and murder . . . where was the respect in any of it?</p><p>He sure didn\u2019t fucking see it.</p><p>\u201cBad night, man?\u201d</p><p>Carmine glanced over as Remy slid into the booth across from him. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>Remy motioned for the waitress and asked her for a rum and Coke, taking it upon himself to order Carmine another shot of vodka.</p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d Remy said. \u201cYou got that look about you tonight, that \u2018I\u2019ve seen shit that can\u2019t be unseen\u2019 look.\u201d</p><p>Carmine pushed the empty glass aside with the others. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t try to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but you\u2019re doing it the wrong way. Alcohol is a downer. As if this all isn\u2019t depressing enough, hitting the bottle just drags you further down. You go from being a moody bitch to a miserable cunt, and nobody likes a miserable cunt, DeMarco. Not even me, and I love everybody.\u201d</p><p>Carmine managed a small laugh at that. \u201cIt numbs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure it probably numbs you enough that you won\u2019t feel the concrete shattering your bones when your depressed ass leaps off the top of Sears Tower,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you should never jump unless you know you can fly, or at least float. Nobody wants to fall. That\u2019s how you end up hurt.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at Remy as he tried to make sense of his words. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was just too damn drunk or if the man intentionally talked in code. \u201cI can\u2019t decide if you\u2019re a genius or if you\u2019re just a fucking rambling idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be both?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged. Maybe he was.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you wanna know how you really unsee?\u201d Remy asked. \u201cHow you really forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead of dragging yourself down more, lift yourself up. You don\u2019t wanna be numb, man. You wanna be happy.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head. Happy. He remembered a time he felt that way. \u201cThat ship sailed a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong.\u201d A sly smile turned Remy\u2019s lips. He leaned across the table, closer to Carmine, and whispered conspiratorially, \u201cI think it\u2019s time I introduced you to Miss Molly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMolly?\u201d</p><p>Remy nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful. Just one night with her will change your life.\u201d</p><p>It was strange, abrupt yet slow moving. One second there was nothing and suddenly it was there, tiptoeing through his veins. There wasn\u2019t an intense rush of sensation, blinding and all consuming. Carmine didn\u2019t feel like he was sky high. No, for the first time in quite a while, he felt like he had his feet firmly planted on the ground.</p><p>He tried to find the words to describe the feeling, but none existed. It was new, yet somehow familiar, like a combination of everything good that ever lived inside of him. It was his mother being alive. It was being in love with Haven. It was playing football, and going to college, and having a future. It was forgiveness. It was understanding. It was all that was wrong suddenly becoming right. It was sunshine, and light, and spewing goddamn rainbows. It was walking on water before turning it into wine. It was Heaven. It was bliss. It was being blind for a lifetime and suddenly being able to see. It was freedom. It was happiness. The stars had aligned and wham bam . . . motherfucking world peace.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this shit?\u201d Carmine asked, rubbing his nose absently as he eyed the remnants of the white powder on the table. It glistened like flecks of glitter under the club lights, mesmerizing him. His senses were heightened, the notes of the music echoing from the speakers rippling across his flushed skin before sinking in.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure why, but he suddenly yearned to play the piano again.</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014Molly,\u201d Remy replied. \u201cPure powder MDMA.\u201d</p><p>Carmine smiled to himself, the first genuine smile to grace his lips in months, and he felt a burst of gratitude. Molly was beautiful. She was ecstasy.</p><p>Literally.</p> <p>He had heard of it, of course, mainly being taken in pill form, but he had never encountered it before. Ecstasy hadn\u2019t yet infiltrated his small North Carolina town as it had in the big cities.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you feel?\u201d Remy asked. \u201cStill numb?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head. Numb was the complete opposite of the sensation stirring within him. It settled deep in his chest, filling the gaping hole as it wiped away the pain, the ache, the heartbreak. \u201cI feel like I could take on the world and actually fucking win.\u201d</p><p>Remy laughed as he picked up his glass of rum and Coke and drank the last bit. \u201cYeah, well, you can\u2019t. The world will still destroy you, my friend, so don\u2019t do anything stupid . . . not if you wanna live to see another day.\u201d</p><p>Standing, Remy reached into his pocket and pulled out a small baggy filled with the glittery white powder. He dropped it on the table in front of Carmine. \u201cMy treat. Just use it sparingly, okay? A little goes a long way.\u201d</p><p>Carmine picked it up, concealing it in his palm. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d Remy took a step before pausing. \u201cSeriously, please don\u2019t mention it, man. I\u2019d rather people not know, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Carmine said, staring down at the packet stashed in his hand. Their bosses frowned upon drugs. The men up top may have looked the other way and arranged exchanges off the record to make a quick dollar, playing invisible middlemen in a bigger game, but they were never to get their hands dirty in the drug trade. It was too dangerous\u2014too many people involved, too much publicity, too much risk for exposure. It was one of their biggest rules, second only to keep your fucking mouth shut and never rat on your friends.</p><p>22</p><p>The tan rectangular building stood on the corner of a quiet intersection, spanning nearly half a city block. The outside was modest, with brown archways and bright green grass, a sign along the front displaying THE ROSEWOOD HALL in casual script.</p><p>Carmine expected something flashier. He always took Tess to be the kind who would demand white horses and a gold-plated dance floor at a remote location, not a simple wedding hall in the middle of Chicago.</p><p>He glanced down at his invitation once more as he leaned against the building, triple checking he had the right place before shoving it in the pocket of his black slacks. He watched in silence as the lot filled with cars, surprised at the amount of people arriving for the wedding. He didn\u2019t recognize half the guests, which unnerved him. Everyone had moved on with life, met new people, and made new friends, but he was just him . . . still the same Carmine DeMarco.</p><p>That was how it seemed, anyway. So much had changed but yet nothing felt different. He was back to being that teenage boy, all alone with no one to talk to\u2014no one to confide in. Instead, he buried everything deep inside, concealing secrets and hiding the truth from everyone\u2014sometimes, even from himself\u2014as he waded through reality, refusing to accept half of it was his life.</p><p>It was a nice day in Chicago, the temperature hovering around seventy degrees, but sweat uncomfortably gathered along his back and made his shirt stick to him. On edge, he contemplated leaving, although he knew he shouldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t. He had disappointed a lot of people in his life, made plenty of fucked-up choices at the drop of a hat, but bailing on his only brother\u2019s wedding would certainly top the list.</p> <p>Even if that brother probably didn\u2019t care if he showed up.</p><p>Sighing, Carmine reached into his pocket for his flask and took a swig. The hot liquid burned his throat, the flames eating away at his chest. He took another drink when someone called his name, the sharp voice startling him. He choked on the vodka, coughing as he put the lid back on it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he rasped as Celia approached.</p><p>\u201cWas it necessary to bring that along?\u201d she asked, motioning toward the flask.</p><p>He rolled his eyes as he slipped the flask away. \u201cIs your husband here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t heard from him today.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to make it.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s stomach sunk. \u201cIs he still with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t treat me like an idiot, Celia. You know who.\u201d</p><p>She eyed Carmine warily. \u201cWhat makes you think he\u2019s with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she replied. \u201cI know as much as you do, kiddo. He left, and I don\u2019t know why or where or when he\u2019ll be back. I do know, though, if he shows up and sees you drinking, he\u2019s not going to be very happy.\u201d</p><p>Vincent yelled from the front door of the hall, saying the ceremony was about to start, and Carmine pushed away from the building. They headed inside quietly, going straight through to the courtyard in the back. A long aisle was set up, surrounded by dozens of white chairs in rows. Celia dragged Carmine to the front, forcing him into the seat beside her.</p><p>The ceremony went by quickly. Carmine barely heard any of it as he fidgeted and tugged at his tie, looking around for any sign of his uncle. The moment it was over, they went inside for the reception, and Carmine headed straight for the open bar. He took a seat, barking for the bartender to get him some vodka, and he downed two shots back-to-back as soon as they were set in front of him.</p><p>The bartender poured him another, shot after shot flowing until Carmine\u2019s vision was a bit hazy. The celebration went on behind him, music playing as people danced and cheered, celebrating Tess and Dominic\u2019s union, while all Carmine enjoyed was the familiar numbness creeping through his limbs.</p><p>Another shot was poured\u2014number five, maybe six\u2014when the stool beside Carmine shifted. Tensing, he glanced over as Dominic sat down, loosening his bowtie. He didn\u2019t look at Carmine or even acknowledge him as he told the bartender to pour him a shot, too.</p><p>Dominic downed it in one swallow and grimaced, motioning for his shot glass to be filled again. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell you drink this straight from the bottle, Carm.\u201d</p><p>Carmine threw his back when the bartender approached. The man filled them both up, giving a small nod as he set the bottle between them on the bar.</p><p>About fucking time he gets the hint.</p><p>\u201cYour body gets used to it after a while,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI barely feel the burn anymore. It goes down like water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Dominic said, throwing his vodka back. He grimaced once more, a rumble escaping his chest as he slammed the shot glass down on the bar. Carmine chuckled and filled them both back up, but Dominic just stared at his glass. He picked it up after a moment, swirling the liquid around as if deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and say it,\u201d Carmine muttered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cYour misery takes the fun out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he insisted, grabbing the liquor. He went to pour himself a shot but stopped, instead just tipping the bottle back. There was no point in pretending\u2014they both knew he would drink the entire thing, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou know, none of us hear from Haven anymore,\u201d Dominic said, picking up a coaster from the bar and putting it on its corner, attempting to spin it.</p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Carmine asked. \u201cShe\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure if something was wrong, we\u2019d know. Corrado keeps up with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dia?\u201d he asked. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she see her, too?\u201d</p><p>He laughed humorlessly. \u201cNo. She went home for spring break and when she got back, Haven was gone. You\u2019d know that if you still talked to her, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Carmine was stunned. \u201cDia doesn\u2019t call me, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll flip out. She thinks she failed because Haven left, but I told her what happened was supposed to happen. You pushed the little birdie from the nest, and she did exactly what she was always meant to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Carmine asked.</p><p>\u201cShe flew.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged Carmine\u2019s lips at those words. She flew. \u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll drink to anything.\u201d</p><p>He raised the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll drink to that, too.\u201d</p><p>Dominic stood up and walked away, rejoining his table at the front of the room with Tess and Dia. Carmine stared at the bottle of liquor in his hand, realizing his brother had just done the one thing he had been too stubborn to do\u2014concede.</p><p>Carmine hesitated before getting up and strolling over to their table. He paused beside it, his eyes silently scanning them, before slipping into an empty seat.</p><p>Dia tentatively smiled from her seat beside him. He gave her a small smile, the warmth and acceptance in her expression comforting.</p><p>The three of them talked about weddings and families and the future, but Carmine didn\u2019t say much. There really wasn\u2019t anything he could say. His future was set in stone and it wasn\u2019t anything to gush about, or anything he could even share. It was nice, though, being around them again. There was no anger or resentment, no guilt or blame for the things that happened, or the ones that didn\u2019t. There was nothing but love and friendship at the table, and even some long-overdue sympathy.</p><p>Vincent came over for a few minutes, laughing and joking around. Carmine felt a strange sensation brewing inside as he watched them. They were his family\u2014his real family\u2014the ones who had been through it all with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But still, even then, he felt the void, the part that was missing. He felt her absence, when he wanted nothing more than her presence.</p><p>And, if he were being honest, he felt something else then, too . . . a craving for the sensation he had had the night before.</p><p>The Rosewood Room was near the Children\u2019s School of Music and just down the street from an old closed down theater, one that used to play movies for a quarter in the summer of 1972.</p><p>Vincent had been just a kid at the time, slightly rebellious yet highly impressionable. He would often leave his house on Felton Drive, two blocks past where he later settled with his own family, and slip away to that theater without his parents knowing. It was at a time when he and Celia came and went as they pleased, not long before the brutal underground wars broke out that changed everything. Before their parents tightened their grip and started monitoring their every move . . . before they came to the realization that they needed to.</p> <p>His mother had been strict and maybe already a bit delusional, refusing to let them watch television, not wanting to poison their minds, so he would lie whenever she asked and tell her he was going to the park with friends.</p><p>The Godfather came out that year. Vincent saw it one cloudy Tuesday afternoon in July, sitting in the back row of the packed theater. Those three hours altered his life, turning everything he thought he knew upside down.</p><p>Until then, he only had a vague understanding of the Mafia, based on the things he had witnessed and his mother\u2019s volatile rants. He thought it was a club, maybe part of a union, considering he had seen his dad take money from Teamsters. But reality made itself known that day, playing out on the massive flickering screen.</p><p>Vincent had been so fascinated by the film, so rocked to the core, that he hadn\u2019t noticed a dozen of his father\u2019s close friends sitting in the audience with him.</p><p>He ran home that afternoon with a million questions running through his head, absentmindedly navigating a path he knew by heart. Two blocks over, one block down, cut through the small alley the next street over, then it\u2019s only four more blocks south to his home. He could zigzag through the streets without thinking, making it there within minutes.</p> <p>And years later, as Vincent strolled away from the wedding hall after taking one last look at his family, his feet seemed to instinctively remember the way. He walked past the old theater, surveying the boarded-up windows and crumbling bricks, and he thought back to that day he watched The Godfather. He intended to question his sister when he made it home, but he never had the chance.</p><p>As soon as he opened the front door of his house and ran inside, his father\u2019s boisterous voice rocked the downstairs. \u201cVincenzo Roman!\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s feet immediately rooted to the floor as he cringed at the sound of his full name. Glancing in the direction of his father\u2019s voice, he saw him standing in the doorway to his office. His heart beat wildly. Not good, not good. \u201cYes, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Antonio disappeared inside his office. Vincent stood there for a second, intentionally delaying, before forcing his feet to move that way. He took a seat in front of his father\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do today?\u201d Antonio asked, leaning back in his chair, his hands clasped across his bulky chest.</p> <p>\u201cWent to the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe park, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how was the park, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were there all afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Antonio said. \u201cI do wonder how you did it, though, being in two places at once. You see, I got a call a few minutes ago that you were at the theater this afternoon, and I know you wouldn\u2019t lie to me, right?\u201d</p><p>The color drained from Vincent\u2019s face. Antonio stared at him intently, waiting for an answer that never came.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think I won\u2019t know these things, that I won\u2019t find out,\u201d he continued, realizing Vincent intended to remain silent. \u201cI got eyes and ears all around this city. Someone can\u2019t take a piss in my neighborhood without it getting back to me. And I don\u2019t like the fact that my kid, my only son, thought he could get one over on me. Do you think I\u2019m an idiot? You think your father\u2019s a jamook?\u201d</p><p>Vincent shook his head feverishly. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got questions, you want to know things? You come to me. You don\u2019t go out there and get information from everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Vincent paused, thinking that over. \u201cI just wanted to see a movie. I didn\u2019t realize . . .\u201d</p><p>Antonio stared at him as he trailed off, letting out a deep sigh as he leaned forward. \u201cLook, son, there\u2019s this saying\u2014fortune favors the bold. If you want things, if you want to be successful, you have to take chances, you have to accept risks. You have to, you know, do some things that maybe other people won\u2019t do. Life, it\u2019s kind of like a game of chess. You know about chess, right?\u201d</p><p>Vincent slowly nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo you know the king is the most important player. As long as he\u2019s standing, the game continues. And that\u2019s just like in life. You want to be the king, even if that makes you the biggest target. The king, he\u2019s the key to it all, make or break. You never want to be a pawn or a rook or a knight. You never want to be disposable, just another piece in the way. You want to control the game. You get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cSo since you know chess, you also know the real truth,\u201d Antonio said. \u201cThe king dictates the game, sure, but the queen? She holds the real power. Which is why we aren\u2019t going to tell your mother about what you did today. She doesn\u2019t need to know you lied and broke her rules, because the queen won\u2019t be quite so understanding. Capisce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Vincent stood to leave and made it halfway to the door when Antonio called his name. \u201cHow was it, son? The Godfather?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back. \u201cIt was the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Antonio smiled, a genuinely elated smile, before waving him away.</p><p>And as Vincent strolled through the streets of Chicago years later, he could still remember that look of pride on his father\u2019s face. It wasn\u2019t a look he received often\u2014mostly it was disappointment as he forced harsh lessons upon him growing up, lessons he carried with him his entire life. Some good, some bad, but every one of them had somehow changed him. They had turned him into the person he was\u2014a man ripped apart by the concept of loyalty.</p><p>He walked the first three blocks easily, slowing his footsteps as he approached the alley. Something in the back of his mind urged him to take the long way around, but he ignored that pesky voice, shoving it back as he continued on. He stepped into the alley, strolling down the narrow path as he looked between the old tall buildings, desperate for renovations.</p><p>About halfway down he paused, kicking around at some loose gravel on the ground. He ran his fingers along the worn siding of a business, the brick crumbling a bit in his hand. He let out a deep sigh as he felt the ridges and gashes, his chest tight with anxiety.</p><p>\u201cVincent.\u201d</p><p>Vincent looked over as Corrado strolled down the alley toward him. His suit was wrinkled, his eyes tired, and a small gift box wrapped in bright green paper was tucked under his arm. \u201cYou missed the wedding, Corrado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI just got back from New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness?\u201d Vincent asked. \u201cAmaro family? Geneva? Calabrese?\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cMore like Antonelli.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s brow creased. \u201cHaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason for concern,\u201d Corrado said, dismissing his inquisitive look as he looked around the dingy alley, shifting the present to under the other arm. His eyes settled upon the brick wall behind Vincent. \u201cIt was right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was.\u201d</p><p>It was in that spot, more than a decade earlier, when Vincent\u2019s world violently collapsed. He felt the pressure of it pressing on him, the memory weighing him down. Whenever he blinked, in that split second when blackness took over, drowning out his senses, he could still see it\u2014ashy pale skin, lifeless eyes, copper colored hair drenched in red. Terror coated her face, a horrifying mask of questions with no answers . . .</p><p>Why her? Why them? Why now?</p><p>They were things he had wondered for years, things he thought he had figured out when he murdered Frankie Antonelli. But standing there, the questions still lingered.</p><p>Why?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s peculiar, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cThe thirst for revenge? It\u2019s easy to dismiss the things we do, but it\u2019s impossible to forget the things done to us. We never think about their families, but when it\u2019s ours, we never get over it. We carry that grudge forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think about them,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI always consider their families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think about Frankie\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Vincent hesitated. \u201cNo. I was only thinking about mine back then, but I do now. Every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cThe only relative he has left is Haven, and I assure you she isn\u2019t grieving that loss.\u201d</p><p>Vincent thought that over. \u201cYou\u2019ve honestly never considered their families?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Corrado said, staring at him pointedly. \u201cMy conscience is clear, Vincent. I carry no regret, and I don\u2019t want to start now. It\u2019s why, with God as my witness, I\u2019ll never pull the trigger unless I\u2019m absolutely certain the world is a better place without them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cEvery time I think I clear my conscience, something else comes about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re letting yourself be a pawn.\u201d</p><p>A bitter laugh forced itself from Vincent\u2019s chest. \u201cI was just thinking about the day my father told me to be a king and not a pawn. But he failed to tell me there could only be one king. The rest of us, well . . . we can only do what we can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the point,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cBeing the king isn\u2019t always about having the title. Sometimes the title is a ruse. You want control? You need the upper hand, but you never let them see you have it until you\u2019re ready to make your move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if the only moves I have left break the rules?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDepends on whose rules you break.\u201d</p><p>Corrado took a step back and nodded before strolling away.</p><p>After he was gone, Vincent turned back to the building, running his hand along the crumbling brick once more. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Maura. Ti amo.\u201d</p><p>Vincent strolled out of the alley and down the block toward the pizzeria. John Tarullo stood outside the front door, sweeping the large welcome mat with a cornhusk broom. He glanced up, nodding stiffly in greeting. \u201cDr. DeMarco, I hear you have a son getting married today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear he\u2019s a good kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Vincent replied. \u201cBoth of my sons are good kids.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tarullo looked at him warily, raising his eyebrows. \u201cI hear your Carmine is friends with my Remy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad kids,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cMaybe just a little misguided. I was the same way, and you wouldn\u2019t call me bad, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said at once, but Vincent could see the truth in the man\u2019s eyes. Yes, yes, an unadulterated hell yes.</p><p>Vincent let out a laugh as he walked away.</p> <p>Carmine sipped his drink, lounging in the white wicker chair as he listened to his friends and family chatter on. He relaxed, almost enjoying himself for once, until a gruff throat cleared right behind him.</p><p>He stiffened at the sound.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you two,\u201d Corrado said as he reached across the table, holding a box wrapped in shiny green paper. Carmine turned to face his uncle, who looked exhausted but otherwise fine. \u201cI apologize I missed the ceremony, but I had unexpected business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Unk,\u201d Dominic said as he took the gift. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>Corrado walked away without even looking at Carmine. Carmine watched as he approached Celia, motioning for her to follow him. Corrado\u2019s eyes darted around nervously and Carmine\u2019s heart pounded rapidly when Dominic\u2019s voice rang out. \u201cTwinkle Toes.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine turned to him so quickly he nearly knocked over a glass of champagne, wondering why he had said that name, and saw he had pulled the card from the top of the gift.</p><p>\u201cRead it to us,\u201d Tess demanded.</p><p>Dominic sighed. \u201cDom and Tess, I wish I could give you this in person, but I\u2019m tied up with things here. I bet Tess looked beautiful in her dress. Maybe someday I\u2019ll get to see pictures of it.\u201d He paused, glancing at Tess. \u201cShe\u2019s right, babe. You\u2019re always beautiful but especially today.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Tess waved for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve talked. I\u2019m doing okay and have been busy, but I won\u2019t bore you with details. Please tell everyone hello for me the next time you talk to them, and tell them I miss them. I hope college is going well for all of you.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cTwinkle Toes says hi and said she misses you motherfuckers. She hopes you aren\u2019t fucking up in school.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine cracked a smile as his brother glanced back at the note. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re supposed to give for weddings. Someone told me people register at stores for household things, but I didn\u2019t think Tess would want a blender. So I got something both of you can enjoy. I\u2019d suggest opening it in private, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be embarrassed either way.\u201d</p><p>Tess snatched the box from Dominic, tearing the paper off and opening it. She glanced inside, shifting some tissue paper around, and laughed. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Twinkle Toes is kinky!\u201d Dominic reached for the box and pulled out some lingerie, drawing attention as he waved it around. Tess grabbed it, her cheeks tinged red as more people looked, and threw it back in the box.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a douchebag sometimes,\u201d she said, storming away. Dia smiled and excused herself, following her sister.</p><p>\u201cLooks like she was wrong,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cTess was embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t realize it was possible,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>\u201cMe, either. I\u2019d send her a thank-you note for that, but she didn\u2019t say where she was living.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t, Carmine realized. No indication at all of where she was.</p> <p>Dominic got up to go after his wife and Carmine sat there for a moment, finishing his drink alone as reality crept back in, ruining his brief moment of contentment. He left the wedding hall, not bothering to say good-bye to anyone, and took the long way home. He strolled down the street to his house, slowing as he spotted his father sitting on the bottom step. His brow furrowed as he drew near, seeing the lit cigarette between his fingers. \u201cWhen the fuck did you start smoking?\u201d</p><p>Vincent shrugged, flicking his ashes on the concrete. \u201cWhen did you?\u201d he countered, pointing at some old cigarette butts littering the yard.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not mine,\u201d he replied. \u201cMost of them, anyway. Remy smokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Vincent pulled out a pack of cigarettes and handed one to Carmine along with a lighter.</p><p>He lit it, taking a drag as he stared at his father. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda fucked up to be smoking with you, a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a doctor anymore.\u201d He let out a bitter laugh. \u201cCan\u2019t have a suspected member of La Cosa Nostra wielding scalpels.\u201d</p><p>Carmine felt guilty for bringing it up. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Vincent raised his eyebrows. \u201cDid you just apologize to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Vincent smiled. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry, too. It doesn\u2019t really matter, though\u2014not anymore. It is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get reinstated after the trial? Go back to practicing medicine?\u201d</p><p>He cut his eyes at Carmine incredulously, not bothering to entertain the question. \u201cI actually started smoking after your mother died. I drank, too. A lot. That\u2019s the biggest reason I couldn\u2019t face you kids for almost a year. I know you blamed yourself, and it was difficult to see you, but I didn\u2019t want you to see me, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d Carmine asked curiously. It was something he had always wanted to know, but a question he had been too damn self-absorbed to ask. \u201cWhat made you pull yourself together?\u201d</p><p>Vincent took a long drag. \u201cI tried to murder Haven.\u201d</p><p>That response made Carmine choke on a puff of smoke. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night I killed the Antonellis, I tried to kill her, too. My gun jammed and she slept right through it. But I realized that night your mother would have been disgusted. I wasn\u2019t doing her memory any justice. So I pulled myself together before anyone else got hurt.\u201d</p><p>Carmine tossed his cigarette on the ground and stomped it out. He wasn\u2019t sure whether it was the smoke or his father\u2019s admission, but his chest suddenly ached. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out the flask and took a drink, trying to dull the pain. Vincent watched him curiously so he held it out to him, offering his father some. He hesitated but threw his cigarette down and took it. He grimaced from the hot liquid, but it didn\u2019t stop him from taking a second swig.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve failed you a lot, withheld when I should\u2019ve been honest, and it\u2019s to the point where all I have left to give is the truth,\u201d Vincent said quietly. He looked like a broken man, utterly defeated. \u201cI remember the face of every person I\u2019ve killed. I see them everywhere I go, and I know they aren\u2019t there, but the memory of what they looked like in their final moment lingers. The fear, the anger, the heartbreak\u2014it follows me everywhere. I remember the way your mother looked, too. The way she looked when I saw her that night in the alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI remember the sound of her screams.\u201d</p><p>Vincent looked at Carmine curiously, apprehension in his eyes. He had never talked to him about that night, the memory too painful to verbalize. The only person he had told was Haven, but standing there with his father and taking in his broken expression, it felt necessary.</p><p>Sighing, Carmine closed his eyes as he sat beside him on the step, running his hand through his hair nervously as he recalled detail by detail what happened that fateful night. From the moment they stepped out of the piano recital to waking up in the hospital, every ounce of pain came out through his words.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember what they looked like, though,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to imagine the killers hundreds of times, but it\u2019s a blur. The man with the gun, I don\u2019t think he ever looked at me, and the other, his face is always fucking distorted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut her up! Do it quick! That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sat quietly and took it all in, his head bowed. \u201cYou almost bled to death. I was so angry at her that night, and the whole time she was dead and you were lying behind a Dumpster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cThe only people to blame are the motherfuckers with the guns in the alley that night.\u201d</p><p>Vincent cleared his throat. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. I sometimes wonder if I could\u2019ve stopped it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Mom would tell you that\u2019s fucking bullshit,\u201d Carmine said, earning an amused look from his father. \u201cWell, not in those words, but you know what I mean. Like you said a bit ago, it is what it is. I mean, often this past year I\u2019ve wondered if we could\u2019ve saved Haven a different way, so I could be with her wherever she is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York,\u201d Vincent said as he trailed off.</p><p>Carmine eyed him curiously. \u201cNew York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly where, but she\u2019s in New York somewhere.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged the corner of his lips. She went to New York like they had talked about. \u201cThe point is, I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s senseless to wonder. I did what I did, you did what you did, and we are where we are. We just gotta do what we gotta do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you mask it with the alcohol and profanity, but you\u2019ve grown up quite a bit this past year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t think Corrado would agree with you,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cHe threatens me at least once a week. I\u2019m just waiting for the day he catches laryngitis and can\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019ll kill you,\u2019 so he just does it instead.\u201d</p><p>Vincent laughed, shaking his head. \u201cHe\u2019s threatened to kill me before. I\u2019ve threatened to kill plenty of people, too, like Haven. It\u2019s how we\u2019re taught to control people, so it becomes second nature. Most of the men we deal with fear nothing except death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s fucked up how nonchalant you are talking about killing the girl I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still love her?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>Carmine nodded. \u201cI think I always will. Regardless of all this bullshit, she\u2019ll always be my hummingbird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHummingbird,\u201d Vincent echoed. \u201cWhy do you call her that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know. Kinda just came out one day and stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother would\u2019ve loved that nickname.\u201d Vincent smiled to himself. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any in ages, but in the summertime hummingbirds used to swarm the tree in the backyard. Maura loved them; the way they could hover and fly backward and never tire. She was convinced the souls of the pure and innocent lived inside of them, and that\u2019s why they defied nature.\u201d</p><p>Before Carmine could respond, his phone chimed. He tensed when he saw the familiar message:</p><p>The docks, Third and Wilson.</p><p>Carmine slipped the phone back away. \u201cGuess I gotta go.\u201d</p><p>Vincent nodded as he lit another cigarette, not appearing surprised, and made no move to get up.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go inside?\u201d Carmine offered. \u201cIt\u2019s still your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just going to sit here for a few minutes and then be on my way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Carmine started walking away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d Vincent called out.</p><p>Carmine looked back, seeing the serious expression on his face. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, son,\u201d he said quietly, taking a drag from his cigarette. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve told you that since you were eight, but I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Carmine replied, his father\u2019s words putting him on edge. \u201cLook, don\u2019t go do anything stupid, okay?\u201d</p><p>Vincent chuckled. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything you wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that scares me, because I do some fucked-up shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d Vincent waved Carmine off. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t be late when you\u2019re called in. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Carmine mumbled, heading for the car. \u201cBye, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood-bye, son.\u201d</p><p>23</p><p>Carmine stood stoically on the long wooden dock one Sunday afternoon, dark sunglasses covering his eyes from the blazing sunshine. He was hesitating, telling himself he may have the wrong place, but the words The Federica etched on the side of the boat in front of him were a clear giveaway that he had the right one.</p><p>Five minutes passed, maybe ten, as he stared at the yacht in silence, not wanting to go any farther. Last night\u2019s alcohol still simmered in his bloodstream, the remnants of Molly lingering in his veins. The buzz had faded away, though, as the onset of a headache made itself be known. He had been up until almost sunrise, partying with Remy and the other guys in his crew. He had just gotten home and climbed into bed when Sal called, telling him to report in at exactly one o\u2019clock.</p><p>Business? Personal? Carmine wasn\u2019t sure. What he did know, though, was he had no interest being there either way.</p><p>A car pulled up behind him, parking in the grassy lot beside Carmine\u2019s Mercedes. He turned, watching his uncle climb out and head toward him. Corrado wore a white V-neck shirt, khakis, and a pair of tan loafers. Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed as he stared at the man\u2019s shoes.</p> <p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Corrado asked, approaching him on the dock.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never really seen you so casual before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday,\u201d he replied, shrugging as if that were a good explanation. \u201cCelia is spending the afternoon with her mother so I thought I\u2019d join Sal today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Carmine looked away from him, his gaze turning back to the yacht. \u201cWhat are we doing here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Corrado didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he walked away, stepping onto the yacht and plopping down in a vinyl chair. Carmine remained still for a moment before joining him, taking a shaky step onto the polished wooden deck. He held tightly onto the railing to stabilize himself, the yacht swaying lightly. He was about to take a seat beside his uncle when Sal surfaced from inside, dressed even more casually than Corrado. Hairy legs hung out from the bottom of a pair of plaid shorts, a white undershirt clinging tightly to his oversize stomach. For once, Carmine felt like he almost fit in wearing his jeans and t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cPrincipe!\u201d Sal said excitedly, his eyes drifting from Carmine to Corrado. \u201cAh, Corrado! I\u2019m glad you could join us, too! We\u2019re just waiting for one more.\u201d</p><p>Carmine eyed him anxiously. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Sal nodded toward shore as a black sedan pulled up. Coldness rushed through Carmine as if there were ice in his veins as the man stepped out. The scar on the side of his face gleamed in the sunlight like a bright, sinister warning sign pointing to danger ahead.</p> <p>Carmine\u2019s headache kicked in full-force, the pounding blinding as he clenched his teeth together to stop from saying anything. Instead of reacting, he forced himself to sit down in the vacant chair beside his uncle.</p><p>Carlo stepped onto the yacht, walking with determination, an aura of conceit enshrouding him. It was evident in his stride, and his smile, and his stance\u2014the man believed he was invincible.</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not late,\u201d Carlo said.</p><p>Carmine glanced at his watch: 1:13 P.M. They were all late, technically speaking.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d Sal said, smiling gleefully as he slapped Carlo on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s just good to see you.\u201d</p><p>They set sail a minute later, navigating out toward an unoccupied area where nothing surrounded them but the calm, dark waters of Lake Michigan. Carmine remained tense, every muscle in his body rigid, as the men grabbed fishing rods and cast them in the water. They lounged and shared laughs, steadily sipping alcohol.</p><p>\u201cSo, we have a bit of a situation,\u201d Salvatore said eventually, his nonchalance shifting to seriousness. \u201cWe have another traitor that needs dealt with. He can\u2019t see it coming, and he\u2019s going to trust few at this point. You understand the gravity of the situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Corrado responded at once. \u201cThe rats have to go.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore turned to Carmine, his eyebrows raised inquisitively. Carmine nodded, unsure of why he was asking him, but he wasn\u2019t going to question it. His job was simply to agree. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sal said, pulling out a cigar and clipping off the end of it, \u201cbecause I need Vincent taken out as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s blood ran cold, his heart stopping for a fraction of a second. Vincent? It couldn\u2019t be so. He couldn\u2019t mean his father.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but we have sources saying he\u2019s been feeding information to the Feds,\u201d Sal continued as he lit his cigar, savoring the first puff. \u201cHis father, Antonio\u2014God rest his soul\u2014was one of the greatest Boss\u2019s in the history of the organization. Vincent turning is a notion I wouldn\u2019t suggest if I weren\u2019t one-hundred percent sure.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore paused, glancing at Corrado, and Carmine held his breath. He waited for his uncle to defend him, for him to talk Salvatore out of it, to make him see logic that Vincent DeMarco would never jeopardize his family.</p><p>But the moment Corrado opened his mouth, Carmine\u2019s hope disintegrated. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll expect you,\u201d Salvatore warned. \u201cHe knows you\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>Corrado started to respond, but another voice silenced him. \u201cWhat about the boy?\u201d Carlo asked. \u201cWhy not him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Carmine asked incredulously. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t?\u201d Sal countered, his eyes darkening. \u201cAre you refusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, sir, Vincent has a lot of experience,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cCarmine\u2019s still an amateur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but he wouldn\u2019t fire on his son, especially one who looks strikingly close to his wife. It would be like Maura dying all over again. No, Carlo\u2019s right. Carmine\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at them with shock, not knowing how to react. The fact that Salvatore would use his mother\u2019s memory to his advantage in his violent twisted game made him sick. There was no way he had just been ordered to murder his own father. It was unfathomable. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to kill my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA traitor, Carmine,\u201d Sal said sharply. \u201cYour order is to eliminate the threat. It\u2019s about time you\u2019ve proven your loyalty, anyway. You should\u2019ve been made to do it long ago, but I didn\u2019t press the issue because of who you are. In fact, I\u2019ve tolerated a lot I shouldn\u2019t have because of your last name, but I won\u2019t tolerate it any longer. Your grandfather would be rolling over in his grave right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would,\u201d Corrado chimed in. \u201cAntonio would\u2019ve never stood for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do what\u2019s expected of you,\u201d Salvatore continued. \u201cEarn some respect back for your bloodline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shot Carmine a look of murderous rage, silencing him abruptly. The atmosphere shifted once more to nonchalance as Sal puffed on his cigar with ease, turning his focus back to his fishing rod.</p><p>Two hours later the yacht docked again, and Carmine was the first one off the boat. He started down the dock in a stupor and heard Corrado follow, but he didn\u2019t turn around. Seething, he headed straight for his car when Corrado grabbed him.</p><p>\u201cGet off of me,\u201d he spat, shrugging away from his uncle.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cYou did good.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed bitterly. \u201cYou expect me to relax? Maybe you can kill your own fucking family with no remorse, but I can\u2019t! How the hell could you agree with him? I thought you knew my father better than that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI clearly know Vincent better than you do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re ignorant if you believe he didn\u2019t know this would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying he planned for this? What fucked-up world do you live in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same one you live in,\u201d Corrado said calmly, reaching into his pocket for his phone. \u201cBut it\u2019s a moot point, because you won\u2019t be killing anyone, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s news to me, considering I was just ordered to. What am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to go home.\u201d</p><p>Corrado turned away and got into his car, leaving without another word. Carmine headed home, pulling into the driveway a few minutes later. The house was warm, the air-conditioning still broken. Carmine grabbed the bottle of Grey Goose from the freezer before strolling to the living room, flopping down on the couch and kicking off his shoes.</p><p>Time passed as he sat there staring at the floor, his frantic mind trying to sort through his options while he attempted to drown it all out with liquor. It surged through his body, but it didn\u2019t extinguish the ache in his heart.</p><p>Best-case scenario, Carmine thought, his father got away and he never saw him again. Worst-case scenario, he ended up dead, possibly at Carmine\u2019s hands. Violence, mayhem, murder, bloodshed, fucking annihilation\u2014he wondered if there was any way to avoid it anymore.</p><p>Later he still sat hunched over, gripping his hair with the empty bottle of vodka at his feet. He was still lucid, hadn\u2019t even come close to drinking enough to black out. He got up when the sun set, the house cooling off a tad bit and growing darker. The cool wooden floor felt good against his feet as he strolled toward the kitchen, his head throbbing as he scoured the cabinets for more alcohol. He grew aggravated when he found none, slamming a cabinet drawer angrily as he grabbed his phone. Scrolling through his numbers, he stopped at Remy.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Remy said, answering on the first ring. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need Molly.\u201d</p><p>Remy\u2019s laugh lit up the line. \u201cI\u2019ll be right over, man.\u201d</p><p>Molly became Carmine\u2019s nightly companion.</p><p>While she finally made him feel alive again, filling that void deep inside of his chest, she proved to be both a blessing and a curse. She gave him something to focus on, something to look forward to, but at the same time she lured him deeper into a vast pit of darkness. Because when Carmine was high, he couldn\u2019t possibly be higher, but when he came down, when the drug wore off, leaving him to face life once more, he found himself much deeper than he had ever been before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Depression took over, suicidal thoughts bombarding his mind. Reckless and unstable, he couldn\u2019t think straight or function normally.</p><p>He grew desperate for the sensation, seeking her out more often to delay the unavoidable come down. It got to the point where he was constantly high, everything falling to the wayside in his quest to feel.</p><p>His downward spiral was abrupt, a twelve-story fall straight to the ground.</p><p>The Novak Gala, held twice a year in an upscale gallery just north of Chelsea, always drew the most elite art patrons. Hundreds gathered to celebrate local artists, from the professionals to the blossoming post-graduate students at the surrounding schools. Pieces were auctioned off for charity, supporting art programs in the underfunded public schools, and the media always took notice of the up-and-coming talent. It was a highly anticipated event in the community, but possibly even more so for the students at SVU.</p> <p>For at every event, some lucky undergraduate students were given the opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to show their work. Students were given a topic and had to submit a single piece of art to be judged by the administration. The competition was stiff\u2014out of the three thousand submissions, only the top twenty were chosen. The odds of being picked were less than one percent, but it didn\u2019t stop the students from giving it everything they had.</p><p>November faded fast, weeks passing, and with it came the deadline for submission to the judging panel. The theme for the winter gala was \u201ccoldness\u201d and Haven stayed busy, creating scene after scene of dramatic landscapes\u2014ice, blizzards, and freezing rain\u2014before finally settling upon a painting of a field with falling snow. Simple, but beautiful, the white mingling with the fading green. She spent Thanksgiving holed up in her small apartment, surrounded by warmth from the oversize metal radiator, perfecting her painting, as she ate dinner straight out of the carton from the local Chinese delivery place. She hardly noticed it was a holiday, too engrossed in her work, too determined not to dwell on those things.</p><p>When the school reopened the Monday after Thanksgiving, Haven turned her project in to her Painting I professor, Miss Michaels. She studied it for a moment before nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to submit it this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Haven said, smiling proudly as she took one last look at her painting. She could see no flaws, everything precise, numerous art techniques she had learned portrayed. She couldn\u2019t imagine what more they would want.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dear.\u201d</p> <p>Haven hurried home after class that morning, bundled up in a thick tan coat, to find Kelsey rushing out of the brownstone. Haven\u2019s brow furrowed. She purposely had no morning classes so she wouldn\u2019t have to be up at that hour.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to the studios,\u201d Kelsey said, answering Haven\u2019s question before she could ask it. \u201cI totally forgot submissions were due. I haven\u2019t even started mine!\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at her with shock, blinking a few times. \u201cUh, good luck.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey gave a halfhearted wave before taking off, running down the street.</p><p>Two weeks later, as class was dismissing, Miss Michaels handed out envelopes to each of the students. The room filled with the rumbling of murmurs and the sound of crumpling paper as her classmates discarded their letters in the trashcan on their way out the door.</p><p>Rejections, from what Haven could tell. It made her nerves flare.</p> <p>Haven opened her envelope carefully, smoothing out the crease in the paper as she read the letter the whole way through.</p><p>We appreciate your effort . . .</p><p>The competition was stiff . . .</p><p>So much talent . . .</p><p>We regret to inform you . . .</p><p>Better luck next time . . .</p><p>Haven slowly absorbed the typed words, disappointment setting in when her eyes scanned the last sentence.</p><p>Your submission ranked number 348.</p> <p>Nowhere near the top twenty.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, dear?\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced at her professor as she refolded the letter, sliding it carefully back into the envelope. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what was wrong with my painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, technically speaking,\u201d Miss Michaels said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t what they were looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, you took the assignment literally, and while there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it made it lack the one thing they truly wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoul,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou could look at your painting and think coldness, but you couldn\u2019t feel it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important. Your paintings should make people feel something, even if they have no idea why.\u201d</p><p>24</p><p>Time is a peculiar thing. A moment can feel like an eternity, while sometimes months can pass and seem like no time at all. It\u2019s unreliable, and fickle, but it\u2019s the most constant thing there is. Time. No matter what you do, you can\u2019t stop it. The clock will continue to tick away, minutes passing into hours, hours into days, until suddenly you are standing there and it\u2019s already a year later.</p><p>Christmas had arrived, twelve months passing since the day Carmine walked out the door in Durante. It had been a year marked with violence, with uncertainty, where doubt constantly lingered over his head like a stubborn storm cloud.</p><p>And the time showed on his face\u2014his expression harder, his skin thicker, and his eyes bleaker, unfriendly and guarded. But in Carmine\u2019s mind, he had difficulty reconciling that he had been away from his former life for so long. To him, it seemed like just yesterday he had seen Haven, just a moment ago he had heard her voice or listened to her laugh, that he had kissed her lips or made love to her. The time that passed had been a mere hazy blip for him, the blink of an eye, a single steady heartbeat, but the weariness in his bones carried the truth.</p><p>He had managed to survive a year without her . . . the first, he thought, of a lifetime to come.</p><p>Although he was a man now, seeing things a person ought not see, doing things men should never do, deep inside of him the boy still loitered. He dodged his family, sidestepping accountability in lieu of living in a delusional world of his own\u2014a world where he somehow convinced himself he could beat time, that he wasn\u2019t living his life dictated by the steady ticking of a clock, this one moving backward and not forward, counting down how many hours he had left on earth.</p><p>Because living the life he did, it was only a matter of time before death came knocking at the door, prepared to take him away.</p><p>And it only sped up with each chime of his cell phone.</p><p>Sycamore Circle.</p><p>Carmine glanced at the message as he strolled barefoot through the downstairs of his messy house, sipping straight from a half-empty bottle of vodka. Sighing, he set his drink on the counter in the kitchen before calling Remy, tapping his foot impatiently as it rang and rang. No answer.</p><p>He tried calling twice more as he threw on a coat and some shoes, wanting to know if he needed a ride to the site, but each time he only reached voicemail.</p><p>The sky was completely black, void of stars that night, with a light dusting of white on the frozen ground. It had been a peculiarly gentle winter so far, only a few days of ice and snow\u2014one of the few blessings Carmine counted in his life at the moment\u2014but he could feel a storm brewing. The tips of his fingers tingled and his nose grew numb the moment he stepped out into the frigid night air. Shuddering, he slipped on a pair of black gloves and put the hood up on his coat before climbing behind the wheel of his car, blasting the heat as he drove to Remy\u2019s.</p><p>There was no sign of him at the house, no lights on inside and no cars in the driveway. Another call went unanswered so Carmine headed to the meet-up spot, assuming he would see him there. Two other cars hid in the shadows of the abandoned lot, just down from the spot where the trucks were parked, but neither were Remy\u2019s old Impala.</p><p>One final call to his phone went unanswered.</p><p>The men staked out the location for a bit, watching and waiting, but there was no movement, just as last time. The trucks stood alone, ripe for the picking.</p><p>Or so it seemed.</p><p>They moved in, cracking locks and shoving through the gate, the group of guys approaching the trucks. It was methodical and routine, quiet and easy, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t anymore.</p><p>Carmine shoved the back of a truck open, expecting to find it packed full of weapons, but instead he saw nothing. Nothing at all. His heart dropped into his stomach, his vision blurring from dizziness. Something was wrong. Something was terribly fucking wrong.</p><p>A single loud gunshot cut through the night, confirming his worst fears. He turned quickly, blood rushing furiously through his body, and watched as one of the guys from the crew dropped to the ground. A horrifying scream ruptured from the guy\u2019s chest, so loud and poignant it vibrated through the air around them.</p><p>\u201cMan down!\u201d somebody shouted. \u201cFuck! Man down!\u201d</p><p>Before Carmine could even think to react, the shadows shifted and people appeared out of nowhere. Ten, or twenty, or maybe even thirty men descended upon them, gunshots ricocheting through the lot.</p><p>Men scattered as others dropped, bullets flying left and right around Carmine. He grabbed his gun and shot back, but he couldn\u2019t see to aim in the darkness. A bullet zipped by his head, searing pain ripping through his face as it grazed his cheek. He cursed and sprinted away, firing shots behind him into the lot. Skidding on a patch of icy snow, he lost his balance and fell, but managed to get to his feet again before another bullet struck near him.</p><p>He jumped in his car and sped away from the scene, his hands shaking and stomach churning. They hadn\u2019t caught them off guard that time. They had been ready, laying in wait in the shadows, on the offense instead of defense.</p><p>As he drove through town, weaving frantically through traffic, all he could think was that they had walked straight into a trap. Someone had tipped them off.</p><p>The wound on Carmine\u2019s face burned like fire, a trickle of blood running down his cheek. He pushed his hood off his head as he ran his trembling hand through his chaotic hair. Terror coursed through his body, overtaking the dullness he had managed to shroud himself with. He had gotten so used to feeling nothing unless it was manufactured, the craved effects of the intoxicants he repeatedly forced down his throat and up his nose, that the inherent emotion that hit him seemed to be triple fold. It was raw and real, his heart racing violently.</p><p>Had it been Sal? Did he want him dead?</p><p>Disoriented, he sped through the streets, going straight to the club to look for Corrado. He bypassed the security guard at the front door and headed straight for the back, making his way down the narrow hallway. It struck him as he reached the office door that the music was loud, hip-hop thumping from the speakers, the first sign that his uncle was gone. He pushed that aside, though, and feverishly pounded on the door anyway.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d a guard said, having followed him from the front. \u201cYou looking for Moretti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ran out for a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be much longer. You can have a drink and wait.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, Carmine stepped back into the club, grabbing a towel from the bar to hold against the wound on his face. Glancing around, he tensed when he spotted Remy sitting at a table along the side, surrounded by girls. Confusion and rage simmered deep inside Carmine\u2019s gut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere the fuck were you?\u201d Carmine spat, hastily approaching the table.</p><p>Remy looked up at him, his bloodshot eyes widening. \u201cShit, man, what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Carmine laughed bitterly, pulling the towel away.

I swear.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine grabbed the closest chair and shook it, nearly knocking the girl sitting in it to the floor. She jumped up and Carmine took her seat, shaking his head. \u201cYeah, well, it was a fucking ambush anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Remy shook his head with disbelief. \u201cThe docks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSycamore Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Carmine shook his head. Fuck was right.</p> <p>\u201cLook, man, have a drink or something,\u201d Remy said, standing up. \u201cLet me check on the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me what you\u2019ve got,\u201d Carmine said, grabbing his arm before he could walk away. \u201cI need . . . fuck, I need something.\u201d</p><p>Reaching into his pocket, Remy pulled out a small packet of powder. \u201cYou might want to take it easy on it. It\u2019s not what you\u2019re used to.\u201d</p><p>Carmine ignored him as he walked away. He dished some of the powder out onto the table and inhaled a bunch of it, breathing in line after line, carelessly, recklessly. He needed the excitement . . . needed the fear erased.</p><p>Relaxing back in the seat, he waited for it to hit. Two or three minutes passed before the euphoria washed over him, intense and blinding. He reveled in the sensation, letting out a shuddering breath of relief, and waited for it to level out, but it didn\u2019t. It grew and grew, mounting deep within him and overtaking every cell in his weary body until there was nowhere else for it to go. It seized his frantically pounding heart, slowing it so intensely that it nearly stalled the beats.</p><p>His breath left him in a whoosh as his entire body was swarmed in a sense of peace\u2014no more fear, no more anxiety, no more nothing.</p> <p>It overwhelmed him, too much, too fast, too intense. The burning in his cheek was replaced with pins and needles, his eyelids drooping so fast he nearly lost consciousness right away.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered, running his hands down his face in an attempt to stay awake, smearing the blood from his wounded cheek.</p><p>The music suddenly stopped, the atmosphere shifting as the darkness in the club grew. It took over everything, consuming him, but a familiar voice cut through it and called his name. \u201cCarmine!\u201d</p><p>Carmine looked in the direction of the sound, blinking a few times, and saw Corrado\u2019s rapid approach. It seemed in slow motion, shuddering movements like a spastic strobe light. He tried to speak, but he couldn\u2019t get any words to form.</p><p>\u201cStay awake, kid,\u201d Corrado said, his voice calm and collected. Carmine started at him briefly, trying to obey, but the drug was stronger. Despite a crack across his face that sent stinging exploding under his skin, Carmine\u2019s heavy eyelids closed.</p><p>The club erupted in chaos, but Carmine was only vaguely aware before he slipped completely into the drug-induced blackness.</p><p>Beep . . . beep . . . beep . . .</p><p>What the fuck?</p> <p>Carmine pried his eyes open, squinting from the harsh fluorescent lights. The beeping echoed through the small, secluded room, coming from a cardiac monitor to his left. The monitor spiked with each beep, coinciding with each heartbeat in his chest. It was strong, steady. He stared at it, following the wires straight to his body, surveying the IVs and tubes connected to his skin. He lay in an uncomfortable hospital bed, draped in a flimsy gown and covered with a white sheet.</p><p>Something moved on the other side of the room. Carmine turned his head, his attention suddenly shifting away from his own predicament. Corrado stood in front of the window, peering out at a large parking lot. He didn\u2019t turn or speak, his hands shoved in the pockets of his pants.</p><p>Before Carmine could make sense of any of it, the door to the room opened and a nurse walked in, followed by a doctor. The doctor, white haired and clad in a lab coat, carried a thick chart in his hands. He looked at Corrado with hesitation before turning his gaze to Carmine in the bed. \u201cMr. DeMarco, it\u2019s nice to see you awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d Carmine\u2019s throat was scratchy. He cleared it before speaking again. \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d the doctor asked, glancing down at the chart. Carmine remembered going on the faulty job and then making his way to the club to wait for Corrado, but the rest was a black haze. \u201cWell, you were brought in a few hours ago, unresponsive from an overdose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverdose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour labs indicate a few drugs in your system, but you overdosed on heroin.\u201d</p><p>Carmine blanched. Heroin?</p><p>He absorbed nothing else as the doctor talked about Narcan and counteragents, drug rehab, and long-term side effects. Dread once more bubbled up inside of him, brewing in his bloodstream. His muscles were locked up, everything strained and painful. He felt like a fucking Mack truck had hit him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll run a few tests and have you out of here by tomorrow,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cUntil then, try to get some rest.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes darted to Corrado again before he excused himself, the nurse leaving with him. The tension in the room quadrupled upon their exit. Carmine lay there, trying to find the words to address the situation, but Corrado beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cThe rules are simple,\u201d he said, still staring out the window. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many, but the ones we do, we expect to be followed. Stay away from drugs and stay out of the limelight. Which part of that didn\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . look, I didn\u2019t mean for it to go that far, I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your meaningless excuses, Carmine. How long have you been doing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few weeks,\u201d Carmine admitted. \u201cTwo months at most, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t kept a fucking calendar or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will talk to me with respect.\u201d The tone of Corrado\u2019s voice sent a chill down Carmine\u2019s spine. He wasn\u2019t speaking as family\u2014he was addressing Carmine as his superior. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And what in the world possessed you to do a job out at Sycamore Circle? Everybody knows that\u2019s Irish territory!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . I got a text.\u201d Carmine looked around for his phone, spotting his clothes laying in a heap on the floor. \u201cI thought you ordered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been Sal,\u201d Corrado muttered to himself, shaking his head. \u201cThree men were hospitalized, you know. One nearly died. And you just fled the scene . . . fled to go get high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to find you,\u201d Carmine said defensively. \u201cIt was an ambush. They were waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they were. They warned us weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Carmine said nothing. He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the history between the Italian and Irish in Chicago?\u201d Corrado asked, glancing at him and raising his eyebrows.</p><p>He nodded hesitantly, clearing his throat. \u201cThey hate each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s deeper than that,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cWe\u2019ve clashed since before Prohibition, when John Torrio was building our empire. He was diplomatic, believed just because we were criminals didn\u2019t mean we had to be savages. Bugs Moran, the underboss of the Irish Mob at the time, tried to kill Torrio. He was severely injured in an assassination attempt, which forced him to hand over control to Al Capone. Capone continued what Torrio started, but he wasn\u2019t above equal justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn eye for an eye,\u201d Carmine muttered.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cMoran tried to kill Capone a few times but failed. He wasn\u2019t a very good hit man. A peace conference was called, where Capone said he believed Chicago was big enough for all of us. Said it was like a pie, where every gang should have their fair slice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Carmine said, even though he had no clue where the conversation was going.</p><p>\u201cMakes sense to me, too,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a while, after that meeting, the bloodshed ceased, but it didn\u2019t last. You know what happened next, right?\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at him. \u201cUh, sorta. I was never good at history. I failed it in high school . . . both times.\u201d</p><p>Corrado laughed dryly. \u201cThis is the history that matters . . . our history. Moran started killing Capone\u2019s friends. Capone\u2019s patience wore thin until he finally decided enough was enough. He sent some men dressed as police into Moran\u2019s warehouse, lined six of his associates against the wall, and slaughtered them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaint Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bloodshed stopped after that. And it\u2019s only because we\u2019ve respected those boundaries, because we\u2019ve shared the pie, that we\u2019ve had peace.\u201d Corrado paused. \u201cAll of this ends now, Carmine. If I ever hear of you touching drugs again, if it doesn\u2019t kill you, I will. I won\u2019t allow you to become a heroin addict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was heroin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was supposed to be Molly, you know, MDMA.\u201d</p><p>Corrado turned from the window. \u201cThis is Molly? I thought you had a girlfriend by that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was seeing someone?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, crazy is infecting your system with illicit intoxicants for a thrill instead of indulging in something safer, like a woman.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s only one woman for me.\u201d</p><p>Corrado ignored that, turning to stare out the window once more. \u201cThis is the same room, you know. It\u2019s been remodeled, but it\u2019s where they kept you when you were shot. I felt d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu this morning, seeing you lying in that bed. The only difference is your father isn\u2019t here now. I can only imagine how he\u2019d feel, seeing you treat your life so carelessly . . . a life Maura died to protect.\u201d</p><p>The beeping from the monitor was momentarily erratic at the mention of Carmine\u2019s parents. Shame seeped under his skin as his uncle continued his lecture.</p><p>\u201cI need to be able to trust you, and so far, you\u2019ve given me every reason not to. You can\u2019t continue to disrespect me, to disrespect the organization your grandfather helped build. It\u2019s bad enough your father . . .\u201d Corrado trailed off, his posture going rigid. He stood frozen, a cold stone statue, and his voice matched it when he spoke again. \u201cDon\u2019t tarnish the DeMarco legacy any further.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s voice was hardly a whisper. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Corrado strolled over to the hospital bed. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get them, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drugs, Carmine. Where\u2019d you get them?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head. \u201cI, uh . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Corrado demanded. \u201cI want to know who\u2019s been supplying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>A shuddering breath escaped Carmine\u2019s lips, with it the lone name. \u201cRemy.\u201d</p> <p>Corrado\u2019s eyebrows rose with question. \u201cTarullo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Before he could elaborate, Corrado\u2019s strong hand shot out and wrapped around his throat. The cardiac monitor went wild, frenzied beeping filling the room as Carmine struggled to take a breath, his lungs burning, begging for oxygen.</p><p>\u201cRule number one,\u201d Corrado whispered, leaning close so he hovered over a thrashing Carmine, his mouth near his ear. \u201cYou never rat out your friends.\u201d</p><p>He let go, and Carmine inhaled sharply. Tears stung his eyes, his vision blurred as he watched his uncle head for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. I have to do some thinking on how best to handle you.\u201d</p> <p>The sun was just starting to rise outside, blinding light filtering into the window as it bounced off the windshields of the cars in the parking lot. Seven in the morning, he guessed, maybe earlier.</p><p>Carmine lay there on the lumpy, uncomfortable bed for a while, humoring the nurses as they poked and prodded, taking vials of blood and checking vitals, before he decided enough was enough. Tearing the IVs out, ignoring the blood running down his forearm, he disconnected himself from the machines. Doctors rushed in as the cardiac monitor flatlined, gaping at him as he pulled on his clothes. He ignored their pleas to get back in bed, brushing past them and walking straight out of the hospital against medical advice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make it very far. A block or so away, he strolled into a small tavern with a fluorescent OPEN sign flickering in the window. Head pounding viciously, eyes burning, and throat dry, he wanted nothing more than to drown in a drink.</p><p>\u201cJust give me whatever\u2019s on tap,\u201d he muttered, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a few crumpled-up bills.</p><p>\u201cDo you have ID?\u201d the bartender asked. Carmine glared at him, making no move to answer. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was the look in his eyes\u2014the I\u2019ll-fucking-cut-your-balls-off-for-a-drink glare\u2014or maybe the blood on his ripped shirt, but something changed the man\u2019s mind. \u201cNever mind. You look old enough to me.\u201d</p><p>He poured Carmine a beer, setting it on the bar in front of him, and wordlessly took the cash. Carmine picked up his mug and took a sip, grimacing from the bitter taste. He was about to take a second one\u2014bigger this time\u2014when someone grabbed him from behind. He flew off the bar stool and hit the floor with a painful thud, the beer spilling all over the front of him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Carmine spat as the person clutched his arm and dragged him toward the door. He saw his uncle as he finally got to his feet again. \u201cCorrado?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walk out of the hospital to go to a bar?\u201d Corrado seethed, pulling him onto the sidewalk and toward his Mercedes parked along the curb. Carmine tried to yank his arm away, but Corrado\u2019s grasp was too tight. He forced him in the passenger seat of the car before climbing in beside him and speeding away. \u201cYou nearly died last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t. How the hell did you find me? Do you have a GPS chip planted on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cAlthough maybe that\u2019s not such a bad idea. Is that what you want? Me to inject you with a chip like your father did your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx,\u201d Carmine muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for her,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cThat means she dodged a bullet . . . unlike you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine tried to keep a straight face as his uncle reached over, pinching his cheek where he had been shot. The wound stung almost as much as his harsh words.</p><p>Corrado drove the two of them past Luna Rossa, his eyes surveying the club. \u201cI\u2019ve owned Luna Rossa for decades, and until last night there wasn\u2019t a single incident here. Not one. Murderers and thieves come in and out of my doors every day, and it took a coward to blow my perfect streak.\u201d</p> <p>25</p><p>Come home with me.\u201d</p><p>Haven looked up from the book in her lap as Kelsey burst into her apartment, half a dozen bags awkwardly juggled in her arms. Frazzled, she breathed erratically, her eyes so wide she appeared unhinged.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Haven asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Kelsey dropped her luggage on the floor by her feet. \u201cBecause it\u2019s Christmas, that\u2019s why. The semester\u2019s over, you have no work to do, so there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t come home with me.\u201d</p><p>Haven closed her book, sighing. \u201cBut it\u2019s Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh, that\u2019s what I said.\u201d Kelsey rolled her eyes. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here all alone. It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family, though?\u201d Haven asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think Christmas is really the time to bring a stranger home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? You clearly don\u2019t know my family.\u201d Kelsey shook her head, laughing dryly as she muttered something quietly to herself. She turned back to Haven after a moment, her expression suddenly severe. \u201cSeriously, come home with me. Please don\u2019t make me go alone.\u201d</p><p>Haven laughed. \u201cThey can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, you don\u2019t know them,\u201d Kelsey replied. \u201cSo come meet them, eat Christmas dinner, and then we\u2019ll talk about whether or not they\u2019re bad.\u201d</p><p>Hesitating, Haven looked away from her friend. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything packed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it now. The car will be here in ten minutes. That\u2019s plenty of time for you to pack. I mean, really . . .\u201d Kelsey eyed Haven, scrunching up her nose. \u201c. . . It takes less than that for you to get ready in the mornings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Haven tossed the book onto the couch beside her before standing. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Kelsey shouted as Haven walked into the bedroom. \u201cAnd change your clothes while you\u2019re in there! You\u2019re totally not wearing sweats in public with me.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Haven slammed the bedroom door behind her.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she reemerged with a duffel bag full of clothes and necessities, wearing a pair of jeans and a long-sleeved pink blouse that matched her Nike\u2019s. She pulled her wavy hair back into a ponytail and grabbed her coat, standing in front of her friend for inspection. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d Kelsey turned to the window as a horn blared in front of the building. \u201cOh, perfect timing! Car\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>Haven locked up the apartment before following her friend out of the brownstone, her footsteps faltering the moment she stepped outside. Along the curb in front of her sat a black stretch limo, the driver hurriedly taking Kelsey\u2019s bags from her to toss in the trunk. Kelsey thanked him with a smirk before turning to Haven. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>What was she waiting for? She blinked a few times, squeezing her eyes shut tightly the last time, expecting the car to be gone when she reopened them, but it wasn\u2019t. It idled there, both Kelsey and the driver looking at her strangely.</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . nothing.\u201d Haven shook her head as she walked to the limo. She attempted to put her own bag in the trunk but the driver stopped her, prying it from her hands. \u201cUh, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he replied, opening the back door for the two of them. Haven climbed in, the smell of fresh leather strong in the vehicle. The seats and floor were immaculate, not a speck of dirt anywhere.</p><p>\u201cFirst time in a limo?\u201d Kelsey asked, casually lounging in the seat.</p><p>\u201cThat obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she replied. \u201cMy father sends them for me all the time. \u2018Nothing but the best for my baby girl,\u2019 he says.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled. \u201cHe sounds nice.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s abrupt laughter bounced through the confined space. \u201cNice? Yeah, just wait . . .\u201d</p><p>Her words made Haven\u2019s anxiety flare. \u201cYou said he\u2019s a politician, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Good ol\u2019 senator from the great state of New York. Not like he actually does anything, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your mom do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinks wine and harps on people,\u201d Kelsey replied. \u201cSo basically the same as my father: nothing.\u201d</p><p>Even though it was only a few miles away, it took them nearly forty-five minutes in traffic to reach Kelsey\u2019s parents\u2019 estate, a large three-story mansion on the Upper East Side. Haven gawked at it as they pulled onto the property, admiring the manicured lawn with elaborate fountains. \u201cYou lived here?\u201d she asked with disbelief. \u201cWhy in the world did you move to a tiny apartment?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey sighed. \u201cMy father offered to get me a place nearby, but I wanted to live in Chelsea. We waited so long it was hard to find a place near the school, but he made a few calls and managed to get the apartment above yours.\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head, too dumbfounded to understand as the limo came to a stop, the driver opening the door for them. He retrieved their bags when they climbed out, the front door to the house opening right away. Two men appeared, wordlessly taking the bags from the driver and hauling them inside.</p><p>A third man appeared then, strolling casually out of the front door. He wore a tie and coat, his dark hair perfectly sculpted, a few gray strands gleaming in the sunlight. He paused, eyeing the two of them intently. \u201cKelsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>She muttered under her breath, the words inaudible but tone petulantly scathing, before she cleared her throat and replied. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you brought a friend.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s cheeks suddenly grew warm as the attention shifted to her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, this is my neighbor, Hayden Antoinette,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI invited her for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was, uh, nice of you,\u201d he said. \u201cUncharacteristically so.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey narrowed her eyes. \u201cI know how to be nice.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her statement as he stepped forward, holding out his hand to shake hers. \u201cHayden Antoinette, is it? Any relation to Marie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie Antoinette?\u201d Haven\u2019s brow furrowed as she shook the man\u2019s firm hand. Something about his grip, his commanding presence, made her nerves flare further. \u201cWell, uh . . . she was a French queen, right? And I\u2019m just, uh . . . well, I\u2019m not royalty.\u201d</p><p>He let out a laugh as she stammered, her cheeks turning even redder. \u201cI was just joking, dear. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCain,\u201d he said, letting go of her hand. \u201cJust call me Cain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust call me Cain,\u201d Kelsey mocked her father in a fake deep voice. \u201cAre you done kissing ass now, Senator? Can we go inside?\u201d</p><p>Cain swept his hands toward the entrance. \u201cBy all means, sunshine, go on in.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey grabbed Haven\u2019s hand and pulled her past her father. Cain watched them intently like he was studying their every movement, his gaze making Haven\u2019s hair bristle a bit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She followed Kelsey, her eyes guardedly surveying the vast house as they made their way upstairs. Kelsey showed her to the guest room, where Haven\u2019s bag already sat beside the bed. \u201cMy bedroom\u2019s right down the hall,\u201d she said. \u201cThe door on the end.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey left her there, and Haven took a seat on the large canopy bed. The guest room, the size of her entire apartment across the city, was adorned in various shades of burgundy and gold, the carpet beneath her feet vibrant white\u2014so bright, in fact, she was almost afraid to move.</p><p>Haven unzipped her bag, reaching inside for the familiar leather-bound journal. Kicking off her shoes, she lay back on the bed and stared up at the see-through gold cloth draped above her, a frown tugging the corner of her lips. No matter how hard she fought it, attempting to keep a smile on her face, the sadness won out.</p><p>Christmas Eve. Tomorrow was Christmas day. And the next day, well . . . she didn\u2019t like to think about what December 26 marked.</p> <p>Opening the book, she pulled out the piece of paper she had tucked inside and unfolded it, staring at the sloppy writing, haphazardly scribbled in the middle of the night last Christmas. She had read it so many times she could recite it word for word.</p><p>She got to the end, her fingers tracing the three simple words: I love you.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>A year later, she still did.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed as Corrado drove past the street that led to home. He cleared his throat. \u201cUh, I think you missed the turn.\u201d</p> <p>Corrado\u2019s eyes remained on the road in front of him. He offered no reply as he reached for the radio, pressing the button to turn the music up. Frank Sinatra loudly vibrated the speakers, the song making Carmine\u2019s skin prickle. His heart banged against his ribcage, echoing in his ears.</p><p>Frank Sinatra tended to trigger something in Corrado.</p><p>Panicking inside, his paranoia spiked as Corrado drove onto some vacant roads, deep into a neighborhood Carmine hadn\u2019t been to in more than a decade. He had definitely fucked up and he knew there would be consequences, but he never thought it would be this. He never considered the fact that his uncle might get fed up. He never thought he might actually end him.</p><p>Carmine, until that moment, still believed he was invincible.</p><p>After driving for a few more minutes, Corrado slowed and pulled the car along the curb. Reaching over, he grasped the passenger side handle and flung open the door. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s eyes darted around for some sign of life. Corrado wouldn\u2019t kill him if there were witnesses. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said get out!\u201d</p><p>Carmine obeyed at the sound of his uncle\u2019s raised voice. He jumped out of the car and slammed the door, his frantic mind working fast. He thought about running, debating if he could evade him in the nearby alleys in the night, but he didn\u2019t have to act. Tires squealed and a cloud of smoke filtered into the air as Corrado hastily sped away, leaving him standing there alone.</p><p>Carmine stared at the red taillights as they faded into the night, partially relieved but even more baffled. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d a voice said behind him, so close the hair on the back of Carmine\u2019s neck stood on end. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to talk here.\u201d</p><p>Turning around, Carmine instinctively reached in his waistband for his weapon but unsurprisingly came up empty. He had nothing, to be precise\u2014no ID, no wallet, not even a penny in his pocket.</p><p>He stood frozen at that realization, his panic dissipating as he took in the cloaked form a few feet away. The first thing he noticed was the Roman collar, the bright white sliver of fabric shining brightly in the darkness.</p><p>Confused, Carmine glanced past the man and surveyed the massive brown building, taking in the ornamental front door and massive steps leading to it. Corrado had dropped him off in front of an old church.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOr, I mean . . . your holiness?\u201d</p> <p>The priest smiled. \u201cYou may call me Father Alberto. What seems to be your trouble tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. No trouble. I just . . .\u201d Carmine wasn\u2019t sure what to say. I just really kinda sorta fucked up my life and thought my uncle was about to kill me for it? \u201c. . . I need a phone. You wouldn\u2019t know where I could borrow one, would you? I mean, I know you wouldn\u2019t have one, but maybe you know someone who does?\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess because you\u2019re one of those old school religious guys.\u201d</p><p>The priest let out a hearty laugh. \u201cI\u2019m Catholic, son, not Amish. I have no aversion to technology. Come, you can use my phone.\u201d</p><p>Motioning for him to follow, Father Alberto headed inside. Carmine hesitated before stepping into the church, his eyes darting around cautiously. The place was dim with a golden glow that was strangely warm and inviting. Carmine\u2019s nerves instantly eased a bit. At least, he thought, his uncle wouldn\u2019t kill him there.</p><p>He followed the priest to a small office in the back with a wooden desk taking up most of the space. An old white telephone sat on the corner, the twisty cord tangled. Picking it up, Carmine dialed Celia\u2019s number as the priest took a seat behind the desk. Carmine leaned against it, waiting as the phone rang.</p><p>The answering machine picked up on the fifth ring, and her cell phone went straight to voicemail. He tried them both twice before giving up.</p><p>\u201cNo answer?\u201d the priest asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, take a seat then.\u201d Father Alberto motioned toward a chair in front of his desk. \u201cWe\u2019ll chat while you wait. You can try your calls again later.\u201d</p><p>Carmine debated for a moment before plopping down in the chair. It wasn\u2019t as if he really had another option. With no money and no friends, it was either wait or start walking, and he was too damn exhausted for the second choice.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cFor the phone and the seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It is what we old school religious guys do, after all.\u201d</p><p>His voice was lighthearted and Carmine chuckled. \u201cSorry about that. I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been into the whole church thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged. \u201cNot really my scene.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto stared at him peculiarly. \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d</p><p>A question Carmine dreaded, especially coming from a priest. He briefly considered lying to placate the man but thought better of it, considering he was sitting in the middle of a church. He had evaded death twice that week. Something told him he wouldn\u2019t be so lucky the third time if lightning struck. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure. Maybe? But I\u2019ve seen some bad shi\u2014uh, stuff, in my life that makes me doubt anyone gives a fu\u2014uh, damn, about us.\u201d Carmine\u2019s eyes widened when he realized, despite his best effort, he still cursed. \u201cShit. Sorry, Father. It\u2019s been a bad night.\u201d</p><p>Carmine was half expecting to be kicked out, but Father Alberto merely smiled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the first to utter those words within these walls, and I\u2019m certain you won\u2019t be the last. I\u2019m more concerned by your negativity than your profanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have a better chance of getting me to stop cursing than you do of changing the way I see things. It\u2019s hard to believe there\u2019s someone watching over us when so many good people get fucked over every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s an argument I hear often,\u201d Father Alberto said. \u201cHow can a God exist when it seems so many have been forsaken? But you fail to realize, son, without the bad we can\u2019t truly appreciate the good. Suffering teaches us to be better people. What we do in bad times measures how good of a person we really are.\u201d</p><p>Carmine let out a bitter laugh, slouching in the chair as he thought about how he had adapted. \u201cI must not be a very good man, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t know me. You don\u2019t know the things I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me,\u201d the priest challenged. \u201cChange my mind.\u201d</p><p>Carmine scoffed. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you ashamed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Carmine hesitated. \u201cWell, yes, but that\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the point,\u201d the priest said. \u201cThis is a safe place. Anything you say within these walls stays within these walls. The only thing keeping you from confessing your sins is your own reluctance to admit them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m screwed up. Who would want to admit that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone without morals,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich brings me back to you being a good man. The truly bad don\u2019t have a conscience, son.\u201d</p><p>Carmine pondered those words. The old man had somehow twisted things to his liking.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to discuss your past, why don\u2019t we talk about the future?\u201d the priest suggested. \u201cMaybe we can figure out why God brought you here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod didn\u2019t bring me here,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the devil dropped me off.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, the priest smiled at that. \u201cIs there a reason he did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour guess is as good as mine, but I\u2019m starting to think he might actually have a sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>Time passed as the two of them sat in the cramped office, going round in conversation about religion and life. Neither wavered, Carmine refusing to budge from his line of thinking, but he found himself feeling better the more the priest spoke. Something about the man\u2019s voice, the compassion in his words, put Carmine at ease. He started making small concessions, offering tidbits of truth as he skimmed the surface of his reality and shared the tiny shavings that came off the top.</p><p>The sun had already started to rise when Carmine tried his calls again, each one just as unsuccessful as before. He hung up the phone with a frown, realizing nobody would be coming to his aide.</p><p>\u201cNo answer again?\u201d the priest asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cI should get going. I have a long walk ahead of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk?\u201d The priest shook his head. \u201cNonsense. I\u2019ll give you a ride.\u201d</p><p>Carmine blinked a few times, surprised. \u201cYou have a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the priest said. \u201cA telephone, a car . . . I even have a microwave, if you ever need to borrow one. What\u2019s mine is yours.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at the priest with disbelief. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stood, stretching his tired body as he ran his hands down his face. \u201cWe wasted a whole night here when you could\u2019ve driven me home hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I wouldn\u2019t say we wasted the night,\u201d Father Alberto said. \u201cI rather enjoyed speaking with you. It was quite illuminating.\u201d</p><p>Carmine followed the priest out of the church and around the corner, where an old model Cadillac Deville was parked along the curb. He smiled when he saw it, eyeing the light blue paint and tan interior.</p><p>\u201cThis is yours?\u201d Carmine asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTechnically it belongs to Saint Mary\u2019s, but yes,\u201d he replied. \u201cA former parishioner donated it to the church ages ago. I want to say it\u2019s been nearly thirteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Carmine said, surprised it still ran, and smiled sheepishly when the priest gave him a peculiar look. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, you know . . . wow. My grandfather had one of these. He used to pick me up from school sometimes when I was a kid and drive me around. Pretty much the only memory I have of the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He died when I was a kid, probably about . . .\u201d Carmine paused as he did the math in his head. \u201c. . . Thirteen years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The priest smiled at him before climbing into the car and starting it. It hesitated, the engine roaring and car trembling as it sprung to life. Sighing, Carmine climbed into the passenger seat and rattled off his address, staring out the side window as they silently drove through town.</p><p>Father Alberto pulled the car into the driveway when they arrived. Carmine turned to the man, about to thank him, and noticed the look of awe on his face. Before Carmine could say anything, the priest burst into a loud, boisterous laughing fit. He laughed so hard tears sprung to his eyes, and he wiped them with the back of his hand as Carmine stared at him with confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe door is blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so?\u201d</p><p>The priest shook his head. \u201cI thought Vincenzo was joking.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine\u2019s expression fell at the sound of his father\u2019s name. He could only gape at the man in shock.</p><p>\u201cHe truly did a terrible job painting it,\u201d Father Alberto continued, \u201cbut I commend him for doing it, nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d the priest said. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence you ended up on my front steps tonight, son.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head. What was this, a goddamn intervention?</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d The priest smiled, waving good-bye. \u201cAnd for the record, I\u2019ve always suspected Corrado had a sense of humor, too.\u201d</p> <p>26</p><p>Christmas on the Upper East Side turned out to be a more formal affair than Haven anticipated. No gifts were exchanged in the morning, no stories shared in the afternoon. At precisely three o\u2019clock they all gathered in the large dining room, the four of them sitting at a table fit for a dozen. The staff served the meal, quietly and swiftly fixing each of them a plate before disappearing from the room.</p><p>Haven stared down at her food as the others started eating, her stomach in tight knots. Those people, the servants\u2014didn\u2019t they have families? Why were they working there on Christmas?</p><p>Thoughts of the worst kind infiltrated her mind. They couldn\u2019t be, could they? A senator, a man of the law, wouldn\u2019t keep slaves in his home.</p><p>Would he?</p><p>The possible answer to that terrified Haven.</p><p>\u201cSo, Hayden . . .\u201d</p><p>Haven looked up from her plate, turning to Kelsey\u2019s mother, Anita, down the table from her. Anita wore her dark hair in a tight bun on top of her head, a long string of pearls draped around her neck. She sipped from a glass of white wine that she had already refilled twice since they sat down.</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your family.\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at her. \u201cMy family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, your family. I\u2019d like to know why you\u2019re not with them on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother . . .\u201d Kelsey hissed through clenched teeth at the same time her father muttered, \u201cAnita, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, I\u2019m merely curious,\u201d she said, waving them both off as she eyed Haven. \u201cSo, your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, uh . . . I don\u2019t really have one,\u201d she replied. \u201cMy parents are both gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn orphan?\u201d Anita gasped loudly, leaning closer to the table. \u201cHow tragic! How did they die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar accident,\u201d she answered right away, swallowing back the harsh truth that the only parent she really ever had took her own life to free herself from restraints . . . restraints put on her by the man who was supposed to be her father.</p><p>\u201cSo sad,\u201d Anita said. \u201cWhat about your other family members? Brothers? Cousins? Uncles? Aunts? Do you have anybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Anita,\u201d Cain said, his voice firm. \u201cDrop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, get off it,\u201d Anita said as she took a sip of her drink. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not curious why a young girl has no place to go on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has someplace to go,\u201d Cain countered. \u201cShe\u2019s here, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Anita scoffed. \u201cPlease, Cain. Nobody actually wants to be here. Not even our own daughter wants to be in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you always give everyone the third degree,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to come here half the time because of your interrogations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t give me that! That\u2019s not why you don\u2019t come home! Maybe you can lie to everyone else and have them believe the bullshit that comes out of your mouth, but not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit?\u201d Cain slammed his hand down on the table. \u201cYou want to talk about bullshit, let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Back and forth they went, bickering, slamming each other with harsh words. Kelsey continued to eat, completely unfazed, while Haven flinched and cringed at their exchange of hostility. It went on forever until suddenly they both seemed to run out of things to say.</p><p>Silence strangled the room. Haven took a few bites of her food, forcing it down, grateful that was over.</p><p>Until Anita spoke again. \u201cSo Kelsey, sweetheart, how bad did you fail school this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fail,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI made mostly As and Bs with one D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the D in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the world?\u201d Anita shook her head in disapproval. \u201cEven a monkey could pass that class. Any idiot can slap paint on a canvas.\u201d</p><p>The words were like a crack to Haven\u2019s chest. She let out an involuntary gasp, stung by the insult. Cain\u2019s eyes darted from her over to his wife. \u201cDammit, Anita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a painter?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m sure your work is lovely, dear. Just lovely. My daughter, on the other hand . . .\u201d</p><p>The bickering started all over again.</p><p>Haven breathed a deep sigh of relief when dinner ended. Kelsey excused herself to use the restroom while Anita grabbed the bottle of wine and darted from the room, leaving Haven alone with Kelsey\u2019s father.</p><p>The staff came in to clear the table. Haven watched them curiously, forgetting Cain was there until he spoke. \u201cThey\u2019ve been employed by my family for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced at him curiously. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe staff. They\u2019ve worked for me for years, since Kelsey was a baby. Christmas is completely voluntary, but since they get paid double on holidays they usually all choose to work part of their shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Suspicion washed through Haven. \u201cHow did you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I know you wondered?\u201d he asked, nailing her question right away. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up wealthy. My mother moonlighted as a dancer. My father was a conman. Needless to say, I know that look on your face well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat look is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe look of not understanding how life can deal someone such a crummy hand.\u201d Cain stood, tipping his head. \u201cIt was nice meeting you. You\u2019re welcome here any time.\u201d</p><p>He walked out, leaving Haven alone in the giant dining room. Kelsey returned after a moment, pausing in the doorway. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Haven said, standing up, \u201cmaybe you weren\u2019t totally exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey laughed. \u201cTold you. Terrible.\u201d</p><p>Terrible? Maybe not, but they certainly reminded Haven of people she had tried to avoid since she was a kid.</p><p>Saint Mary\u2019s Catholic Church was a ghost town on a Saturday night, the rows of pews leading up to the pulpit vacant. The Bibles were all closed, tucked into their wooden nests, awaiting tomorrow\u2019s service when the words printed on their pages would once again become front and center in dozens of lives.</p><p>Lives that, when the moon shone in the night sky, casually and callously disregarded the commandments they swore to abide by in the Sunday morning sunlight.</p><p>Vincent slipped into the church under the cloak of darkness, shrouded in an oversize black hooded sweatshirt covered in thick snowflakes. He removed his hood once safely inside, exposing his dark unkempt hair. He hadn\u2019t had a cut in weeks, nor had he taken the time to shave\u2014his scruffy hair coated his jaw while baggy jeans hung loosely from his waist. He appeared to be quite the opposite of the clean-cut doctor he once was.</p><p>He strolled up the aisle toward the front of the church, stopping near the massive organ to the left of the pulpit. It didn\u2019t take long, only a moment or two, before Vincent heard footsteps behind him in the church. They were subtle, undetectable to ears that weren\u2019t trained to listen to the dangers carried on the wind.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Father Alberto in quite some time\u2014not since he had spilled his soul, letting loose all of his deepest, darkest demons\u2014but he needed the man now. He needed his guidance. He needed to know that sometimes it was okay to do something immoral in order to spare others from suffering. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, he knew that, but he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if maybe, just maybe, one inconceivable wrong could be forgiven if it set it all straight again.</p><p>Vincent bowed his head as he closed his tired eyes, sullenly making the sign of the cross. \u201cForgive me, Father, for I have sinned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else is new?\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s eyes snapped open at the sound of the voice, low yet striking, entirely detached and frighteningly familiar. Guarded, Vincent\u2019s heart pounded as hard as a bass drum when he turned around, coming face-to-face with the last person he expected to encounter: Corrado.</p><p>\u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize you,\u201d Corrado said, standing beside the front pew a few feet away. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been stealing your son\u2019s clothes, have you? It\u2019s really not a good look.\u201d</p><p>Vincent eyed his brother-in-law suspiciously. Corrado seemed relaxed, his hands in the pants pockets of his black fitted suit as he stared at him, awaiting a response.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I\u2019d be here?\u201d Vincent asked.</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cLucky guess. You\u2019re quite predictable, to be honest. Just as predictable as your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same thing, Vincent,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cChurch sanctuary ended centuries ago. They can\u2019t offer you protection anymore. Well, maybe protection from God, but not from man. Nothing can protect you from man\u2019s wrath. Not the police and certainly not a priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come for asylum,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI came to get advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, maybe I can help you, then. Please, continue. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It\u2019s been . . .\u201d Corrado raised his eyebrows expectantly as he trailed off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vincent glanced around. Corrado was blocking the main exit of the church. There was nowhere for him to go, no way to leave unless Corrado allowed him to pass. \u201cIt\u2019s been six months since my last confession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months,\u201d Corrado repeated. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have a bit of repenting to do then.\u201d</p><p>Vincent scoffed. \u201cProbably not as much as you.\u201d</p><p>Corrado let out a laugh as he pulled his hands from his pockets. Vincent\u2019s hair bristled when he saw the black leather gloves. It was a sight he knew well, the sight of the man at work. He was like a reaper, a malicious spirit ripping the life from men before vanishing undetected, leaving no trace of himself behind.</p> <p>Corrado\u2019s victims rarely knew what hit them. Most never even saw him as he snuck up on them in the night, firing a single shot through the base of their skull, severing their spinal cord and killing them instantly. It was neat and tidy, painless and quick. He was in and out and on to the next thing within a matter of minutes. Corrado wasn\u2019t in the business of torture . . . unless you made him mad.</p><p>When Corrado got angry, when he took things personally, a different side of him emerged. The ugly, green monster burst forth, ripping through his calm skin, and nobody was safe from his rage when that happened. He never made a mistake, never got sloppy, but the otherwise unruffled man was no longer merciful. He would tear a man to pieces, slowly, methodically, until everything left behind was no longer recognizable.</p><p>\u201cDid Sal send you?\u201d Vincent asked, trying to keep his voice even.</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cI came on my own.\u201d</p><p>Not business. Personal.</p> <p>Corrado took a step forward then, tugging his gloves to make sure they were on tight, and Vincent instantly took a step away. He did it again, and again, and again, like the two of them were doing a deadly tango.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to believe it,\u201d Corrado said, \u201cbut seeing you here\u2014seeing you like this\u2014I can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not how it seems,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cIt never really is, is it? But that\u2019s irrelevant, and you know it. You crossed a line, and it doesn\u2019t matter why you did it or what you planned to do on that other side, the fact that you went over there is inexcusable. Lupo non mangia lupo. How many times did we hear your father say that when he was alive? How many times? Wolves don\u2019t eat wolves. We don\u2019t turn on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust your own kind, who can you trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one, according to your son,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cNon fidarsi di nessuno. Did you even stop to think about how this is going to affect him? How this is already affecting him?\u201d</p> <p>Thoughts of Carmine made Vincent\u2019s chest ache. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s not okay. He\u2019ll never again be okay! It\u2019s his job to kill you!\u201d</p><p>Flinching from the hostility, Vincent took a few quick steps back. \u201cYou can\u2019t let him do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to.\u201d Corrado stealthily moved with him, not missing a beat.</p><p>A loud voice echoed through the cathedral then, stalling them both. Father Alberto stepped out of his office, scowling. Corrado backed up, putting some space between him and Vincent, as the priest swiftly approached. \u201cGentlemen, I\u2019m not a man to judge, and I\u2019ve never condemned you for your life choices, but there comes a point where enough is enough! You don\u2019t bring that into the house of the Lord. This is a place of worship, of love, of acceptance. We\u2019re always open, but only to those who check their sinning at the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Corrado shoved his hands back into his pockets. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or the place for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, exactly, are you two squabbling over?\u201d the priest asked. \u201cYou\u2019re family!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a misunderstanding,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight, a misunderstanding,\u201d Corrado agreed, clearing his throat. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I should be going. I have business to handle later tonight.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto raised his eyebrows at him. \u201cI hope not too late. I expect to see you planted in one of these pews tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss your service for anything, Father,\u201d Corrado said, looking from the priest to Vincent. \u201cIt\u2019ll all be finished before the sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>He turned, casually strolling toward the exit as if he had not a care in the world. Vincent and Father Alberto both watched, remaining silent until Corrado disappeared outside into the night. Vincent sighed, running his hands down his face in exasperation. Not good. Not good at all.</p><p>\u201cOh, Vincenzo, what have you gotten yourself into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA situation with no way out,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Father Alberto said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive?\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto was quiet, staring at the door Corrado had disappeared out of as he pondered Vincent\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Vincent muttered when the priest supplied no response. \u201cI guess there are worse things to be than dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest,\u201d Father Alberto said, quoting Matthew 11:28. \u201cAs true as that may be, I don\u2019t like you sounding so defeated. You should never give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up, Father. I\u2019m giving in. I\u2019ve fought against the current for a long time, but in the end I got swept downstream anyway. And I can\u2019t keep swimming. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m too damn tired to do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you just let yourself drown?\u201d Father Alberto asked with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI wait for someone to throw me a lifeline, and then I drift away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if no one does? Certain things are unforgiveable. Don\u2019t do anything you\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have faith I won\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto shook his head. \u201cYou look terrible, Vincenzo. Come, I have an extra cot in the back for you to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen at least eat something and freshen up.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to refuse, but the thought of food and a shower was too tempting to resist. Following Father Alberto to the back, he scarfed down two sandwiches and a bag of chips as the man sat across from him, studying him with his concerned eyes. \u201cIs there a reason you came here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvice,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father used to have this saying: chi tace acconsente. I just wondered what you thought about it.\u201d</p><p>Chi tace acconsente. Silence gives consent. Antonio DeMarco believed if you wanted something, if you believed in something, it was your responsibility to fight for it. If you remained silent, if you just stood back and did nothing, then you had no one to blame but yourself when nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cI believe your father was a wise man,\u201d Father Alberto said. \u201cI may not have agreed with his choices, but I always admired his beliefs when it came to family and responsibility. And it\u2019s true\u2014if you stand for nothing, you\u2019ll fall for anything.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cIs that scripture?\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto smiled. \u201cNo, I believe it was Alexander Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Father.\u201d Vincent stood. \u201cI\u2019ll take that shower now, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto showed him to the small bathroom. Vincent stripped out of his clothes, sighing as he pulled the simple gold necklace from around his neck, setting it on a shelf beside the towels. He squeezed into the shower, the stall so tiny he barely fit inside, and scrubbed with a bar of unscented soap. After washing his hair, he got out and dried off, putting his dirty clothes right back on again.</p><p>Vincent walked away, avoiding Father Alberto and any sort of good-bye as he made the inevitable journey to the exit. He covered his head with his hood again when he stepped outside, his hair still damp. A nice breeze hit his face as he stopped on the top of the church steps and peered out at the empty street.</p><p>A chill ran through his body, but it had nothing to do with the cool night air.</p><p>\u201cCorrado.\u201d He greeted him quietly, not bothering to look at the figure lurking in the shadows beside the steps. He knew he would be out here, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cWell, Vincent, we could call you a lot of things, but a coward certainly isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on! We\u2019re running behind!\u201d</p><p>Corrado stood in the upstairs bathroom, early morning sunlight streaming in the window as he stared at his reflection in the small mirror. He was already showered and dressed, but he had done little else to prepare for the day. Exhaustion infiltrated every cell in his body, clearly visible in the lines on his face. He studied them, surveying every mark and blemish, every gray hair on his head and every blood vessel in his tired eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear me, Corrado? We\u2019re going to be late!\u201d</p><p>Celia stepped into the bathroom, frowning. Without saying another word, she walked up behind him and fixed the collar of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven years,\u201d he said, meeting her eyes in the mirror. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married for almost three decades and you still have to fix my tie most days.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, glancing from her reflection back to his. \u201cI\u2019m showing my age.\u201d</p><p>Celia laughed as he turned around to face her. \u201cYou\u2019re still as handsome as the day we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re even more beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her softly, enjoying the feel of her lips on his own. She broke the kiss within a matter of seconds, though, and wrinkled her nose when she pulled away. \u201cYou\u2019re quite a bit scruffier now, though,\u201d she said, rubbing the prickly hair on his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like shaving,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t have the energy today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do look tired,\u201d she commented, her hand moving from his face to his hair. \u201cDid you get any sleep at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got in really late last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her, seeing the questions in her warm brown eyes. Where were you? Where did you go? What did you do? Who were you with? Who did you hurt? They were questions that nagged her, always on the tip of her tongue, but she would never ask and he was grateful for it. He didn\u2019t want to lie to her, and there was no way he could tell her he had stalked her only brother a mere few hours ago like he was prey, cornering him like a wounded animal in the same church they were headed to.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on,\u201d she said, looking away from him. \u201cWe still have to pick up Mom, and you know she hates being late. If we don\u2019t hurry, she\u2019s going to complain the entire time.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stepped out of the bathroom, shutting off the light, and followed his wife out to the car. Neither said much on the drive to Sunny Oaks Manor where Gia DeMarco had resided for the past few years. Corrado was never fond of the woman and her harsh tongue, but he had the utmost respect for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they arrived, Celia went upstairs to get her as Corrado waited by the entrance. He opened the car door when he saw them coming and Gia slid into the back seat of the Mercedes without acknowledging him. She scowled, her arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>Corrado shut the door, sighing, as Celia shot him a pointed look that said whatever they were about to endure was entirely his fault.</p><p>He would take the blame. It was the least he could do.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice, Gia,\u201d he said politely as he pulled out into traffic. \u201cIs that a new dress?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a new dress?\u201d she muttered, mocking him. She stubbornly stared out the side window of the car, refusing to look in his direction. \u201cI\u2019m not a child, you know, and I don\u2019t appreciate being treated like one\u2014especially by you. Antonio would have your head if he were still alive, God rest that bastard\u2019s soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would,\u201d Corrado agreed quietly. \u201cAntonio would be severely disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is a nice dress, Mom,\u201d Celia chimed in, glancing into the backseat with a hopeful smile plastered on her face. \u201cThat color blue looks fantastic on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd other colors don\u2019t?\u201d Gia asked, finally shifting position to look at her daughter. Her gaze scanned her, picking her apart piece by piece with her sharp eyes. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t wear so much black, Celia. The darkness washes you out, and you look like you\u2019re in mourning. People are going to think you\u2019re unhappy. They\u2019re going to start wondering about your marriage. Is that what you want? For them to think you can\u2019t please your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Celia said, turning back around. \u201cEveryone knows I wear black because it\u2019s slimming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t appear to be working,\u201d Gia said. \u201cMaybe you should try exercise.\u201d</p><p>Celia forced a laugh, but Corrado could tell from her expression that the insult stung. He reached over to grab his wife\u2019s hand, wordlessly comforting her.</p><p>They pulled up to a stoplight, traffic heavy despite it being early on a Sunday. Gia dramatically exhaled and Corrado glanced in the rearview mirror in just enough time to see her turn her stubborn eyes back out the side window. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re late. We\u2019re going to have to sit in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always sit in the back, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we want to, not because we have to,\u201d Gia said. \u201cI hate when I don\u2019t have a choice. I should have a choice, you know. When your father was alive, everyone waited for us to sit first. It was a matter of respect. No one cares anymore.\u201d</p><p>Corrado sighed in relief when the light turned green.</p> <p>The church was packed when they finally arrived, and Corrado had to park around the corner. He offered Gia his arm, but she refused and walked a few feet ahead of him, huffing the entire way. Celia tried to keep up with her mother but Corrado didn\u2019t bother, instead strolling slowly toward the church doors.</p><p>He slid into the back pew beside his wife a few minutes later, smoothing out his jacket. Mass had already started, Father Alberto standing up front preaching about love and forgiveness. Corrado remained quiet through the service, merely going through the motions, and he stayed in his seat when it was time for communion. When it was over and they were dismissed, Corrado was out the door before anyone else.</p><p>Celia and Gia joined him, lingering with the others and greeting friends. Corrado stood along the side, patiently waiting for them, when Father Alberto sought him out in the crowd. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you at first, Corrado. I thought perhaps you were missing church today, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Father,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe were just running a bit late.\u201d</p><p>The priest eyed him closely. \u201cWill I be seeing you later this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d he said. \u201cMy door is always open, but as you know, I regularly take confession on Wednesday nights.\u201d</p><p>He was fishing, Corrado realized. He wanted information that Corrado wasn\u2019t going to give.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe week\u2019s still young. There\u2019s no telling what may happen between now and then.\u201d</p><p>27</p><p>The run-down building was set back off the main highway.</p><p>Massive holes littered the large gravel lot surrounding it, cars haphazardly parked every which way to avoid getting stuck in them. A fluorescent sign hung above the entrance, the word SINSATIONS flickering in hot pink letters.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d Carmine asked as he climbed out of the passenger seat of the black Mercedes. Corrado had dragged him out of bed at three in the morning, but he hadn\u2019t explained where they were going on the drive. Of all the places he considered, a trashy strip club hadn\u2019t been one of them.</p><p>\u201cBusiness,\u201d Corrado replied, motioning for Carmine to follow him.</p><p>Carmine strolled through the parking lot behind his uncle. \u201cDo you own this place, too?\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s footsteps faltered as he flashed Carmine an irritated look. \u201cYou clearly don\u2019t know me very well if you think I\u2019d run a place like this. The owner pays a fee every month and we let them keep their filthy dump in our territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackmail and extortion,\u201d Carmine muttered. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>Corrado laughed dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair trade. No one messes with them because they pay their dues, and in exchange we utilize their facilities when necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you ever want with this shithole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Bass-thumping loud music instantly assaulted them when Corrado opened the door. Carmine\u2019s ears started ringing as he stepped inside, grimacing from the stench. It smelled like stale sweat and liquor, with cigarette smoke lingering in a thick cloud. He coughed as he inhaled it, peering through the haze at the stage. Women danced around poles in platform shoes, their skin blindly glittering under the lights. Parts of them sagged as they bent over, letting men stuff dollar bills into G-strings.</p><p>No respectable human being would step foot in the place, and he realized that was likely the point.</p><p>\u201cStop looking,\u201d Corrado said, leaning closer to Carmine and still having to shout to be heard. \u201cWe\u2019re not here for pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Carmine muttered, following him through the club. \u201cIf you think I\u2019d ever have anything to do with bitches like that, then you clearly don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>They headed into a back office and shut the door behind them to block out some of the noise. Corrado opened a cellar door in the floor and started down the stairs, but Carmine hesitated at the top when he heard a female\u2019s piercing scream. His heart nearly stilled at the sound as Corrado groaned. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t she gagged?\u201d</p><p>She screamed again, the sound silenced right away.</p><p>Carmine slowly started down the steps, not wanting to aggravate Corrado by lingering behind. The thick cellar walls muffled the music from the club, a wordless vibration of bass coming from above. He looked around cautiously as the room came into view, shocked at the sight before him. Two people sat in chairs in the center of the room, handcuffed to metal chairs with burlap sacks over their heads. One was clearly a girl, wearing a gold-colored dress, while the other was clad in jeans and a t-shirt. Besides Corrado, there were two other Mafiosi in the room, watching from the sidelines just as he was now.</p><p>Carmine studied the captives, assessing the situation, when his eyes fell upon the guy\u2019s old, gold watch. Coldness swept through him as his heart dropped into his shoes. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered to himself, horrified. He had seen that watch before. \u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>Corrado peered back at him, hearing his quiet declaration. Their eyes locked for a moment before Corrado motioned toward one of the guys in the back, who ripped the bag off of the girl\u2019s head. She glanced around in a frenzy, fear flashing across her face when she spotted them. Red hair fell into her face as her eyes locked on Carmine. He had to look away.</p><p>\u201cDo you know her, Carmine?\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s Remy\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Corrado laughed, the bitter sound sending a chill down Carmine\u2019s spine. \u201cHer name\u2019s Vanessa O\u2019Bannon. She\u2019s Seamus\u2019s daughter, and apparently also the one who supplied Remy with his drugs, filtering Irish product through right under my nose.\u201d</p><p>Corrado motioned toward one of the men, who took the bag off the other person\u2019s head. Remy\u2019s terrified eyes immediately sought out Carmine, tears streaming from them as he silently begged for help.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the rules, Carmine? Recite them to me.\u201d</p><p>Carmine looked away from his friend and blinked a few times when that question registered. \u201cStay away from drugs and stay out of the public eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, our women are off limits. And children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rat on your friends,\u201d Carmine said, regret bubbling up inside of him. \u201cKeep your mouth shut and stay away from the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t steal from each other. Give back to the organization. Always be available when called on, no matter what.\u201d Carmine paused. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cYou missed one\u2014an important one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever fraternize with the enemy.\u201d</p><p>Corrado reached into his coat and pulled out his gun. Without warning, a lone gunshot exploded in the cellar, the loud noise bouncing off the thick walls. Carmine jumped back as the bullet ripped through the back of Remy\u2019s skull, blood splattering the floor and walls around them.</p><p>The air left Carmine\u2019s lungs, his knees weak as a high-pitched, blood-curdling scream echoed through the room. Carmine couldn\u2019t move. His eyes were fixed on the polka dots of bright red now littering his white Nike\u2019s. His friend\u2019s blood . . .</p><p>Suddenly, unexpectedly, flashes of Nicholas assaulted his mind. For the second time, the overwhelming guilt of getting a friend killed consumed him.</p><p>Shell-shocked, Carmine watched as Corrado pointed the gun at Vanessa\u2019s forehead. Sobbing, tears coated her flushed cheeks as she violently shook. She squeezed her eyes shut tightly as Corrado pulled the trigger at close range, a subtle click ricocheting through the room.</p><p>Carmine felt the bile rising up and swallowed it back, not wanting to get sick. Vanessa continued to sob, her head down in defeat.</p><p>Grasping her chin, Corrado pulled her face up, forcing her to look at him. \u201cI know where you live. I know where your father hangs out. I know where your little cousin Jessie goes to school. Your best friend Marie? I know where she works, and I\u2019ve been to the church your grandmother plays Bingo at on Tuesday nights. You cross me again, you step foot near my club, and I\u2019ll kill every single one of them before I slit your throat in your sleep. Capisce?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa nodded furiously, hiccupping, unable to speak through her cries.</p><p>Corrado removed her restraints and took a step back. \u201cWalk out of here calmly and hitch a ride home. Don\u2019t speak a word of this.\u201d</p><p>Vanessa jumped up, stumbling as she scurried up the stairs. Carmine watched in shock, his eyes darting between the door and his uncle. \u201cYou let her go? What if she calls the police?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t,\u201d he replied, putting his gun away before motioning for the other two men to dispose of Remy\u2019s body. They quickly wrapped it up in a blanket and carried the bundle up the stairs. Corrado supervised it, turning back to Carmine once the body was gone. \u201cClean up this mess.\u201d</p><p>Carmine ran his hand through his hair in a panic. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and make it fast,\u201d Corrado said, starting up the stairs. \u201cYou know, in case I\u2019m wrong and she opens her mouth.\u201d</p><p>28</p> <p>The long mahogany table filled the conference room, leaving hardly enough space for people to push out their chairs. It was cramped, the atmosphere stifling as Corrado breathed the same stale air as half a dozen other men.</p><p>He sat at the far end of the table with Mr. Borza to his right, the lone court reporter seated beside the lawyer. The federal prosecutor by the name of Markson sat on the left side with his two assistants, while a U.S. Marshal slumped half-asleep in a chair by the exit. Corrado wasn\u2019t surprised they had enlisted security, given the nature of the case, but he was a bit offended they thought one pesky man would be enough to keep everyone safe.</p><p>The clock on the wall read 8:23 in the morning, nearly half an hour past the time the proceedings were scheduled to start. Tension choked the silent room as everyone stared at the closed door, waiting for it to open, for something to finally happen. No one seemed to know what to say, neither side wanting to be the first to verbalize what was becoming evident:</p><p>Vincent DeMarco was a no-show for his deposition.</p><p>The clock steadily ticked away, another ten minutes passing before Mr. Borza cleared his throat. \u201cI think we can all agree this isn\u2019t happening today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust give it a little longer,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already given him thirty minutes,\u201d Mr. Borza argued. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly decided not to testify, after all.\u201d</p><p>The prosecutor scoffed. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t show, it\u2019s because something\u2019s keeping him from being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Mr. Borza asked. \u201cTraffic? A flat tire? Those are hardly good excuses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean something like your client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, give me a break,\u201d Mr. Borza said, waving him off. \u201cMr. Moretti has been here with us all morning. You know that. He was here before even you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe so, but what about last night or the day before? What about last week?\u201d The prosecutor turned his attention to Corrado, his eyes ablaze with anger and suspicion. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw Vincent DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>Corrado didn\u2019t have a chance to consider responding. Mr. Borza shoved his chair back, slamming it against the wall as he stood. \u201cYou know very well my client is under no obligation to be here for this nonsense, much less entertain your absurd, paranoia-fueled questions! Contact me if your witness surfaces and we\u2019ll reschedule this sideshow. Otherwise, we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>The lawyer stormed out of the room, all spitfire and rage, while Corrado stood, as calm as could be. \u201cGentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has your name written all over it, Moretti,\u201d the prosecutor muttered, slamming a notebook closed as he gathered his things. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with this. Mark my words. I\u2019ll have you off the streets by the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>Corrado wasn\u2019t home for more than two hours before his phone started incessantly ringing. He ignored it, not in the mood to humor anyone with conversation, but realized they weren\u2019t going to give up after the third consecutive call.</p><p>He answered with a sigh, hitting the speakerphone button. \u201cMoretti speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Corrado closed his eyes at the sound of his lawyer\u2019s voice. He was tired of hearing Mr. Borza say those words. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe prosecution filed for an emergency hearing on a motion to revoke bond based on evidence that you\u2019re a flight risk and a danger to society.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in his office chair, Corrado ran his hands down his face with frustration. \u201cWhat evidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re citing the fact that Vincent\u2019s missing. They\u2019ve issued a warrant for failing to appear, but so far there\u2019s no sign of him here or at his home.\u201d</p><p>There wouldn\u2019t be, Corrado thought. They weren\u2019t going to find Vincent.</p><p>\u201cIt seems he found a way to remove his monitoring device,\u201d Mr. Borza continued. \u201cThey tracked it to a location here in Chicago, but it turned out to be a Dumpster. They searched it, just in case, but there\u2019s no sign of a, uh . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA body,\u201d Corrado said, finishing the man\u2019s thought.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Nervousness seeped through the phone, clinging desperately to every word. It made Corrado tense. Even his lawyer doubted things.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly what I\u2019d call evidence of wrongdoing on my part,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cThey\u2019re just looking for an excuse. Punishing me for my brother-in-law\u2019s sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile that may be true, it doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Borza said. \u201cYou\u2019re on trial for a statute they invented to be able to nail you for crimes you\u2019re only somewhat linked to. The government isn\u2019t above stretching things to suit them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying they\u2019ll be successful.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza hesitated. Corrado knew the answer before the man even said, \u201cMore than likely, yes.\u201d</p><p>While he wasn\u2019t surprised, given Mr. Markson\u2019s words from that morning, Corrado\u2019s stomach churned from the turn in events. \u201cHow long does that give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hearing is scheduled for tomorrow morning. They wanted to do it tonight, but I stalled a bit. It\u2019s better if you aren\u2019t present, I think, or they may detain you on site. Otherwise, they\u2019ll give you about forty-eight hours to surrender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the weekend,\u201d Corrado said.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Corrado was silent for a moment, mulling over the situation. Forty-eight hours wasn\u2019t enough time for him to do everything he needed to do. If they detained him, he could be gone months, or even years. Too much relied on his ability to remain out on the streets.</p><p>\u201cJust do what you can,\u201d Corrado said finally. \u201cI trust your abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it my all, but I can\u2019t work miracles.\u201d</p><p>Corrado let out a sharp laugh. \u201cAre you insinuating only God can help me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m just saying we may have to give them this battle and keep our eyes focused on winning the war.\u201d</p><p>Corrado pressed the button again, ending the call without giving a response. He sat there for a moment, rubbing the tips of his fingers together deep in thought, before standing up and grabbing his cell phone. He slipped it in his pocket and headed out of his office, passing his wife on the way to the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He kissed her cheek. \u201cI have things to take care of. Don\u2019t wait up for me.\u201d</p><p>I think some people are born with tragedy in their blood. Mixed with the cells, the plasma, and the platelets are deeply hidden secrets they just can\u2019t escape. It\u2019s a part of them, passed down between generations, but it doesn\u2019t define them. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re doomed. Like a smart man once told me, the nastiest fertilizer makes the most beautiful flowers grow.</p><p>Haven ran her fingers along the yellowing paper, tracing the handwritten words as she read the paragraph for the second time. She sat in the middle of her couch, legs crossed, with the leather-bound journal on her lap. Kelsey lounged in a chair across the room, her legs kicked over the side, as she flipped through channels, seemingly uninterested in anything on television.</p><p>After a moment, the familiar voice of Alex Trebek resounded through the room. \u201cThe author of the twentieth-century work The Secret Garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrances Hodgson Burnett,\u201d Haven muttered, looking up from the journal at Jeopardy on the screen.</p><p>Kelsey glanced at her when she answered, shaking her head as she changed the channel. \u201cYou\u2019re such a nerd.\u201d</p><p>Haven shrugged. If she meant that as an insult, she didn\u2019t take it as one.</p><p>Kelsey flipped through a few more before giving up, turning off the television and tossing the remote down. She grabbed a blue registration folder from the coffee table, eyeing Haven peculiarly as she sat back in the chair. \u201cWhat are you reading, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Haven closed Maura\u2019s journal. \u201cIt\u2019s just a book.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey stared at her for a moment, her eyebrow arched. \u201cI gathered that much, Sherlock.\u201d</p><p>Haven stood and returned the journal to the bookshelf before grabbing the second registration folder from the table. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Kelsey opened her folder and started sorting through the papers. Haven followed her lead, taking out her schedule for the spring semester. School started back up in the morning, giving Haven another fresh start. She hadn\u2019t done too horribly in the fall, failing none of her classes, but some she had just passed by the skin of her teeth.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll drop Drawing II and pick up Writing and Literature with you,\u201d Kelsey said, reading over her schedule.</p><p>Haven glanced through hers. \u201cI have that at eight in the morning on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey grimaced. \u201cUgh, forget about it. How about Survey of World Art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine-thirty, same days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill too early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>Haven laughed. \u201cWell, all I have left is Painting II.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday, Wednesday, and Friday at noon.\u201d</p><p>A smile curved Kelsey\u2019s lips. \u201cBingo!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey scribbled it down on a piece of paper as Haven put her schedule away, placing the registration folder back on the table. She settled back into the couch, crossing her legs once more, when a loud ringing ricocheted through the apartment.</p><p>\u201cPhone\u2019s ringing,\u201d Kelsey said, picking a pillow up off the chair and tossing it at Haven. She caught it, tensing as her blood ran cold. Her eyes darted over to the bookcase where the small black cell phone lay, glowing and vibrating as it rang.</p><p>Besides Kelsey, there was only one person who had that number.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer it?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d Haven walked over to the phone, glancing at the caller ID even though it was senseless. Corrado\u2019s name shone brightly on the screen. Her hand shook as she picked it up, but before she could answer it, the ringing stopped.</p><p>Thirty seconds, then forty-five, then a minute passed until her phone chimed again, this time with a text message. Haven opened it, reading the simple message:</p><p>Call me.</p><p>The club on Ninth Street was packed, the sound of an old Frank Sinatra song booming from the massive speakers situated in the corners. Cigar smoke permeated the air, making Carmine\u2019s eyes water the moment he stepped inside.</p><p>Corrado had called him and told him to come down right away. He wouldn\u2019t elaborate as to why on the phone and that put Carmine on edge. Was it his father? Haven? Had something happened to her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The last time he had been there, things hadn\u2019t gone over very well.</p><p>Slowly, he walked over to the bar. \u201cVodka, please.\u201d</p><p>The bartender raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you have ID?\u201d</p><p>Carmine hesitated. What the fuck? \u201cYou know me, man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d the bartender said, not sounding impressed in the least. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so are you gonna give me a shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the man said. \u201cJust as soon as you show me some ID.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at him, stunned. \u201cAre you fucking with me?\u201d</p><p>The bartender sighed. \u201cLook, I feel for you, but you know your uncle . . . I ain\u2019t losing my life just so you can drink. He said you were cut off permanently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is fucked up,\u201d Carmine muttered, wishing he had something to soothe his frazzled nerves before he had to face Corrado. \u201cWhere is my uncle, anyway? He told me to meet him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his office,\u201d the bartender said, motioning toward the hallway. \u201cYou know which one it is.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, Carmine pushed away from the bar and slowly made his way to the back. He knocked on the door and waited. The last thing he wanted was another fight with Corrado.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s open,\u201d Corrado yelled.</p><p>Carmine stepped inside. Corrado sat in his leather chair, nonchalantly flipping through paperwork. Not wanting to interrupt, Carmine wordlessly plopped down in a chair in front of his desk.</p><p>Corrado glanced up at him and stilled his movements. \u201cDid I tell you to sit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think a man of reasonable intelligence can conclude you should still be standing. You\u2019re by no means a genius, but even a two year old can follow simple commands.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s mouth drew into a thin line as he tightly pressed his lips together, fighting hard not to respond to the insult. He should be used to it by now, but his temper still often got the best of him.</p><p>He stood back up.</p><p>\u201cNow you can sit.\u201d</p><p>Motherfucker.</p><p>Carmine plopped back down, fidgeting as he drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair. A sheen of sweat formed on his brow, the lights in the room feeling too bright and uncomfortable. His heart hammered in his chest as he waited for Corrado to tell him why he had been called there, but the silence lingered on. Corrado returned to his paperwork, ignoring his presence.</p><p>Nearly twenty minutes passed\u2014excruciatingly uncomfortable minutes\u2014before his uncle looked up at him again. \u201cAre you on something, Carmine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his eyes narrowing defensively. \u201cI haven\u2019t. Not since . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you better not,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable. Disrespectful. I\u2019ve put a bullet in men for less than what you did, and . . .\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Carmine slouched in the chair as his uncle went on and on, the same shit he had heard more than a dozen times the past few weeks. He knew it all\u2014in fact, he knew it before the incident even happened\u2014and he was getting tired of constantly being berated for his mistake.</p><p>He had paid enough, he thought, the aftermath something he would never forget.</p><p>His mind wandered then, drifting, until the sound of a phone ringing shattered his train of thought. Corrado immediately stopped talking as he glanced at it, his eyes darting straight to him, his expression severe. \u201cIf you say a single word, I\u2019ll make you suffer. Understand?\u201d</p><p>He blanched, nodding, suddenly too terrified to reply.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d Corrado warned. \u201cDon\u2019t even breathe too loud.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for his phone, Corrado answered it as he brought it to his ear. \u201cHello, Haven.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, the air flew from Carmine\u2019s lungs. Corrado narrowed his eyes at him as he let out a shuddering breath, but he couldn\u2019t help it. The room felt smaller, stifling, suffocating.</p><p>He wanted to puke. He wanted to cry. He wanted to sucker punch his uncle and snatch the fucking phone from him just to hear her voice one more time.</p><p>But he did nothing. He merely sat there, staring across the desk, straining his ears in hopes to hear something, anything . . . just a part of her again.</p><p>\u201cI just called to tell you I\u2019d be away for a while,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be concerned about, but I may be out of touch for a few months.\u201d</p><p>Corrado was silent as he listened to her response. He pulled his phone from his ear after a moment, laying it on his desk as he pressed a button on the screen. Carmine\u2019s stomach sunk, figuring he had hung up, until he heard her sigh through the line. It was subtle, barely inaudible, but it was there. Speakerphone.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d Corrado asked, sounding disinterested, his eyes glued to Carmine as he asked the question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, uh, good,\u201d Haven replied. \u201cThe new semester starts tomorrow. I\u2019m all signed up for my classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Corrado tapped his fingers against the desk. \u201cI hope you\u2019re enjoying yourself and making friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re well. Take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, sir.\u201d</p><p>Carmine closed his eyes as his uncle pushed another button, this time ending the call. They sat in silence for a moment before Corrado addressed him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be around to keep an eye on you, Carmine, so you better stay straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJail.\u201d</p><p>Carmine blinked a few times. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re revoking my bail as we speak,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey think I had something to do with your father going missing.\u201d</p><p>After a strangled bout of silence, Carmine forced the million-dollar question from his lips. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Corrado waved his hand, turning back to his stack of paperwork. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>29</p><p>The moment Corrado stepped in his house later that night, the succulent aroma of marinara assaulted his senses. He took a deep breath, inhaling it as he strolled toward the kitchen. Celia stood in front of the stove, the sleeves of her blouse rolled up to her elbows and her usually pristine hair pulled back in a sloppy bun. A blue apron was tied around her, protecting her clothes from splatter as she stirred the homemade sauce.</p><p>Corrado silently watched her, a ghost of a smile tugging his lips. She hadn\u2019t heard him come in and continued to concentrate on her cooking, oblivious to her husband\u2019s presence. Corrado loved these moments, when Celia was in her element and the world around her faded away. She glowed radiantly, beaming like the sun as she floated along. It was what had drawn him to her in the first place\u2014her ability to bring light into such a devastatingly dark world.</p><p>He would miss it. There was no doubt about it. His world would soon be a much colder place.</p><p>He let out a deep sigh, not wanting to think about what would come tomorrow, and Celia jumped at the noise. Dropping her spoon, she spun around and clutched her chest. \u201cYou scared me! I didn\u2019t know you were home.\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s smile grew, but he said nothing as he took a few steps toward her. Carefully, he untied the apron from around her waist, and Celia eyed him skeptically as he tossed it aside. He reached up and tugged on the band securing her hair, making it fall loose. It was messy, an unruly wave cascading past her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Celia asked as he took her hand.</p><p>\u201cTaking you upstairs,\u201d he said, \u201cand getting you out of those clothes.\u201d</p><p>She tried to dig in her heels to make him stop, but he was much stronger than her. \u201cCorrado, hold on! I\u2019m cooking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my sauce might burn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can make more later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the stove is on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d she asked incredulously as he pulled her toward the stairs. \u201cWhat if it catches on fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll buy you a new stove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could burn down the whole house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll build you a new house.\u201d</p><p>She laughed with disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019ll burn down with us in it, Corrado.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, cocking an eyebrow. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019d let that happen?\u201d</p><p>Her comeback was snappy. \u201cDo you really think you could stop it?\u201d</p><p>Corrado was momentarily silent, still clutching her wrist as they stood near the bottom of the stairs. He pondered her question. Did he think he could stop it?</p><p>\u201cBellissima, I\u2019d stop time for you. I\u2019d give you the moon and the stars; I\u2019d learn to defy gravity. There\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do, nobody I wouldn\u2019t kill, if you asked me to. If you needed me to. Saving you from a fire would be nothing, purely instinct.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for three beats, not budging, before her body relaxed and she gave in. It wasn\u2019t as if it was a hard decision for her\u2014as much as Corrado would do for her, they both knew she would never deny him anything. Whatever he needed, come hell or high water, Celia would be there every step of the way.</p><p>Their hands linked together, Corrado took her upstairs to the bedroom. He shut the door behind them, locking out the cruel world that would tomorrow tear them apart, but today\u2014tonight\u2014it would just be her and him.</p><p>Hours later, Corrado descended the stairs and made his way to the dark kitchen. He turned off the stove and dumped the scorched sauce down the garbage disposal before rinsing out the pot. He scrubbed it for a minute but when it refused to come clean, he tossed the entire thing in the trashcan.</p><p>He headed back upstairs and showered, standing under the spray of hot water until it started to grow cold. He shaved then, using a thin razor blade under the bright lights of the quiet bathroom to remove the stubble along his sharp jaw. Afterward, he slicked back his thick hair before dressing in his most expensive black Brioni suit. With his Rolex affixed to his wrist and his Italian leather shoes on his feet, he wandered into the bedroom and gazed at his wife under the moonlight.</p><p>Celia snored lightly, snuggled up to his pillow. Corrado leaned down and kissed her forehead. \u201cSleep well, bellissima.\u201d</p><p>He made his way back downstairs, using his cell phone to call for a car service to pick him up. It only took the town car a few minutes to arrive, and another few minutes for them to make it through the city. He tipped the driver handily when they arrived and he climbed out, waiting for it to leave before he started to move.</p><p>He strolled into Metropolitan Correctional Center shortly before three o\u2019clock in the morning, his head held high and a swagger in his step. He may have been there to surrender himself to a bright orange jumpsuit and confinement in a rat hole, but he saw no reason why he couldn\u2019t at least do it in style.</p><p>30</p><p>Grip firmly, everybody, and use deep strokes. Up, down, up, down.\u201d</p><p>Strangled laughter echoed through the small art room. It sounded like someone was choking on air.</p><p>\u201cExperiment with light and hard touches. Play around with it. Find out what feels good to you.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey leaned over, elbowing Haven as she whispered, \u201cDo you think she does that on purpose?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Haven\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cDoes what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Keep it up, guys. This is exactly what I like to see\u2014your creativity exploding onto the canvas as I help you reach your peak.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey coughed loudly, trying to hide another laugh, but others in the class were less successful at containing themselves. The professor didn\u2019t notice, though, or if she did, she didn\u2019t react.</p><p>\u201cArt\u2019s personal. It\u2019s just you and your tools, making something out of nothing. It\u2019s a sensual process. You\u2019re creating love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, definitely on purpose,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cMiss Michaels is freaky-deaky.\u201d</p><p>Haven felt the blood rush to her cheeks when she realized what the fuss was about. She dropped her paintbrush and stared at the random shapes and patterns on her canvas, everything suddenly looking sexualized.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful work, Hayden. Absolutely stunning.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled softly, her blush deepening as the professor stopped beside her station. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s truly my pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>The rest of the class passed in a similar fashion, more immature snickering accompanying possible sexual innuendos. By the time they were dismissed twenty minutes later, Haven was flustered and about to jump out of her own skin.</p><p>She grabbed her things before bolting toward the exit, hoping to delay the inevitable awkward conversation with her friend, and made her way to the lobby from the seventh floor. Rushing out of the massive brick building, she collided with a form right outside the front doors. Haven bounced back from the force of it.</p><p>Monday was turning out not to be her day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said at once, pulling away from the guy in front of her. He seemed startled, his feet locked in place and eyes wide. They were a strange blue color, bordering on steel gray. His skin was dark tan.</p><p>\u201cNo big deal,\u201d he replied, letting go of her. His voice was high-pitched, a thick Brooklyn accent she heard often around New York. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d she said, taking a step back. \u201cI\u2019m fine. This happens all the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou running into strangers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He let out a laugh, his face lighting up to expose a set of clear, deep dimples. \u201cGives new meaning to hitting on people, huh?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at his joke, grateful that he didn\u2019t seem angry. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>He started to speak again, but she didn\u2019t give him time. Hearing Kelsey\u2019s laughter in the building behind her, Haven blurted out another quick apology before dodging past the man and into the crowd on the street.</p><p>Painting II, also known as Art from the Heart, had become Haven\u2019s favorite class from the first day of the semester. It was the one hour where she threw caution to the wind and allowed herself to truly feel everything inside of her. There was no pretending. Not when painting.</p><p>Soul, the professor had said. And Haven gave it every ounce she had.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Miss Michaels gets off on da Vinci?\u201d Kelsey asked on Wednesday as they strolled out of class together. \u201cMaybe The Last Supper is porn to her. She kept gushing about it today.\u201d She paused, crinkling her nose. \u201cGushing. Gross, now I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p> <p>Haven rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a religious painting. I doubt she finds it erotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then, Mona Lisa,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cThat\u2019s da Vinci, isn\u2019t it? Or wait, maybe it\u2019s Van Gogh. Picasso?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s da Vinci,\u201d Haven said. \u201cHow are you an art student?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally other side of the industry,\u201d Kelsey replied. \u201cI design things on a computer, unlike you folks who make love to a canvas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe create love on a canvas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d she asked dismissively. \u201cBoth sound kinky to me.\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head, looking away from her friend as they stepped out of the building. Her eyes immediately locked with a pair of blue ones, the same guy from two days ago. He smiled at her, giving a slight wave, and Haven blushed from the recognition.</p><p>\u201cSee, I\u2019m right,\u201d Kelsey said, noticing her suddenly flushed cheeks. \u201cAll of you artsy fuckers are turned on by it.\u201d</p><p>Friday, when leaving class, the guy was there again, just as he was the following Monday and Wednesday. The cycle continued with curious looks, polite smiles, and subtle waves every other weekday at precisely one o\u2019clock. He was always lingering just outside the building like he was waiting for someone or maybe something.</p><p>On Friday two weeks later, Haven was asked to stay after class. The halls were vacant by the time she left, the street clear of students. She walked out of the building as she situated her backpack, her footsteps faltering after a few feet. On the corner, leaning against the building, was the guy once again.</p><p>He glanced up as she approached. \u201cHey there.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled politely. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>He pushed away from the wall and stopped in her path. \u201cRemember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her heart raced at the blunt acknowledgment. She already preferred it when he didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I? I\u2019m honestly really sorry for it. I was in a rush and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he said, cutting her off with a laugh. \u201cYou just ran off that day before I had a chance to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She eyed him warily. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAbout anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, okay.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other for a moment, the air thick with awkwardness. Haven took a step to the side to go around him, but he spoke again before she made it that far. \u201cSo, can I walk you to your next class?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m done for the day.\u201d</p><p>He started to reply, but she was gone before he could say anything.</p><p>He tried again on Monday. \u201cCan I get you some lunch?\u201d</p><p>Another refusal. \u201cI\u2019m not really hungry, but thanks.\u201d</p><p>And again on Wednesday. \u201cHow about some drinks?\u201d</p><p>She mumbled as she ducked past him, \u201cI\u2019m not thirsty.\u201d</p><p>Friday, just like clockwork, he was standing there. \u201cCan I walk you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going home right now.\u201d</p><p>Monday, Haven was prepared. She stepped out of the building after class with Kelsey at her side, chatting away, but the guy was one step ahead of her. He pushed away from the wall when he saw them and paused in their path, focusing his attention on Kelsey. \u201cExcuse me, miss. Can I cut in?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s brow furrowed. She was momentarily stunned into silence. \u201cCut in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, I\u2019ve been trying to talk to your friend for weeks, so, well, I\u2019m a little jealous right now.\u201d</p><p>A smile slowly lit up Kelsey\u2019s face. \u201cOh! Absolutely!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey turned to her and winked dramatically, barely containing her squeal as she skipped away into the crowd. Haven just stood there in disbelief as the guy smirked. \u201cSo, since your friend approves, can I walk beside you wherever you\u2019re going today?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Unbelievable. \u201cWhy would you even want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re a gorgeous girl.\u201d</p><p>Those words sunk in and she gaped at him. He was flirting, she realized. He was flirting with her.</p><p>She shrugged hesitantly. \u201cUh, I guess. I mean, you can do anything you want. I can\u2019t really stop you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The word was drawn out in his accent. \u201cAre you giving me the it\u2019s a free country spiel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, yes . . .\u201d She scrunched up her forehead. \u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it? Or at least that\u2019s what they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t want to impose. I know I\u2019ve been persistent, but I just wanted a chance to actually meet you. You can tell me no, and I\u2019ll never ask again.\u201d</p><p>There was a tinge of hurt in his voice that surprised her. She didn\u2019t want to be rude to the boy, but his presence alarmed her, the attention unnerving.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really imposing,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re just walking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said again, looking away from her and shaking his head. A smile tugged his lips as he motioned for her to proceed. \u201cWalking. After you.\u201d</p><p>Haven strolled down the street and he stayed in step beside her, his hands in his pockets and his gaze on the ground.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we heading?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe library,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cThe library isn\u2019t on campus?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is an art school, isn\u2019t it? Just art? Or do they have normal shit, too?\u201d</p><p>She peeked at him curiously. What kind of question is that? \u201cJust art, but I like to think it\u2019s pretty normal.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you don\u2019t go to school here,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019d know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a student.\u201d He laughed to himself. \u201cI walk by here all the time for work, though. I\u2019m working down at the construction site on Sixth Avenue.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him curiously. His clothes were crisp and clean, an expensive watch on his wrist. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a construction worker.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNo, I\u2019m more of the supervising type. I don\u2019t like getting my hands dirty if I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Haven loosened up as they walked. He offered to carry her things and waited as she dropped off the books at the library before asking again if he could walk her home.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, standing in the middle of the sidewalk in front of the New York Public Library. People walked around them, casting glares for being in the way, but she wasn\u2019t budging. Not until he answered.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you already ask me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d She paused. \u201cYou\u2019re being nice. People just aren\u2019t nice like that unless they want something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said. \u201cI do want something, though.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not you?\u201d</p><p>He was being evasive, answering a question with a question. Haven stiffened. \u201cYou\u2019re not the police, are you? You have to tell me if you are.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her with surprise. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Or, well, they don\u2019t. Who told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re wrong. The police can legally lie to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re one?\u201d</p><p>He burst into laughter, so loud it seemed to bounce off the surrounding buildings, startling people walking past. \u201cMost girls would be worried a guy is a serial killer or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the police, either. I told you\u2014I\u2019m in construction.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Haven opened her mouth, considering conceding, when a phone rang in his pocket. He pulled it out, his smile falling as he silenced it.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re in luck,\u201d he said. \u201cDuty calls. It was nice to meet you . . .\u201d</p><p>He paused, raising his eyebrows curiously. She realized she hadn\u2019t yet told him her name. \u201cHayden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden,\u201d he echoed, smiling. \u201cYou can call me Gavin.\u201d</p> <p>Ping, whack, ping, whack, ping, whack</p><p>Corrado lay in his bottom bunk with his arm draped over his eyes, listening to the sound of paddles striking Ping-Pong balls on the tier outside his small cell. Chatter accompanied their playing, the noise loud enough to make his head viciously pound. He squeezed his eyes shut tighter, trying to block out the commotion, but it only seemed to grow louder as time went on.</p><p>For the first time since arriving, he regretted requesting general population.</p><p>There was little to do at MCC, nothing to look at, and no one to talk to. Table tennis and card games seemed to be how most men passed the time, but neither activity interested Corrado. He occasionally went to the rec yard for fresh air, but he spent most of his days staring at the drab walls, blocking out the others as he counted the days. Three weeks down, God knows how many more to go.</p><p>Ping, whack, ping, whack, ping, whack</p> <p>Corrado tried to take it in stride. After everything he had done over the years, a few months should be an easy punishment. The way he calculated it, it was less than a day for everyone he had hurt. A measly few hours of incarceration for everyone he killed. He would take his few months and then go right back to his life.</p><p>Today, however, he found being there insufferable. The pinging of the balls, the babble of the inmates, and the squeals of the pigs as they marched along the tiers, barking orders and throwing their weight around\u2014it was all too much to take.</p><p>Sighing, he hauled himself out of the bed. His cellmate looked up from his book on the top bunk and eyed Corrado cautiously as he stood. They hadn\u2019t shared more than a handful of short conversations in three weeks.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, man?\u201d he asked, his voice and eyes guarded.</p><p>\u201cI will be in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Corrado walked out of the cell, no hesitation in his step as he made his way into the common area. A few of the inmates were off on their own, but the bulk of them were gathered around the Ping-Pong game. Corrado cut through the crowd, people stepping out of his way instinctively as he headed straight for the man at the end of the table. He was the loudest of the group, a large guy from the south side of Chicago doing a few years for drug trafficking. He clutched the paddle, laughing as he smacked the ball, oblivious to Corrado\u2019s approach.</p> <p>Ping, whack, ping, whack, ping, whack</p><p>CRACK</p><p>The sickening crunch of Corrado\u2019s fist connecting with the guy\u2019s face echoed through the concrete room, bouncing off the metal doors. The guy hit the floor with a thud, stunned, as blood poured from his nose. The crowd was immediately silenced and took a step back, retreating, as whistles and lights went off on the tier.</p><p>Corrado stood in place and raised his hands in the air as a horde of correctional officers descended upon them. They ignored his peaceful surrender and grabbed him, violently shoving him against the nearest wall. His hands were forced behind his back, his wrists secured with handcuffs before shackles were attached to his ankles. In a matter of seconds he was led away, taken straight to solitary confinement.</p><p>\u201cDumb move, Moretti,\u201d an officer said as they placed him in the single windowless cell, brightly lit by a flickering fluorescent bulb. \u201cYou\u2019ll be lucky if you don\u2019t get an assault charge.\u201d</p><p>Corrado laughed dryly. The D.A. wouldn\u2019t waste his time. He had beat four trumped-up murder charges, seven assault charges, three counts of extortion, and a dozen weapons violations, give or take a few. A punch was nothing, no more than a speeding ticket.</p><p>The officer shook his head as he released Corrado from his restraints, annoyed by his refusal to react. \u201cYou\u2019re not as infallible as you think you are. If you were, you wouldn\u2019t be in prison right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only temporary,\u201d Corrado said, rubbing his hand. His knuckles were already swelling from the force of the punch.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true,\u201d the officer muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Corrado quipped. \u201cComprehension doesn\u2019t seem to be your strong suit.\u201d</p><p>The officer ignored the jab as he locked the cell and walked away. Finally alone, Corrado lay on the hard, thin mattress and once again draped his arm over his eyes. Silence surrounded him, blanketing him in peace as sleep took him away.</p><p>When he resurfaced, the pounding in his head had dulled. He sat up and glanced toward the door at the same time the slot in it opened, an officer\u2019s voice carrying through. \u201cMail call.\u201d</p><p>He slid in two envelopes that fell to the floor, both already opened. He wasn\u2019t surprised. His mail was routinely checked, confiscated for days and read countless times in an attempt to find some hidden message they would never find.</p><p>Not because there wasn\u2019t one . . . because they weren\u2019t smart enough to decipher their code.</p><p>\u201cHeard it\u2019s your birthday,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThat true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The officer laughed. \u201cSolitary confinement\u2014hell of a birthday present.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stood and grabbed the mail when the slot closed. The first was a simple birthday card from his wife, plain blue with no sappy message inside. He eyed the second envelope curiously before pulling out the sheet of paper. It was short, the message scribbled in messy pen.</p><p>Roses are red,</p><p>Violets are blue,</p><p>I went to work,</p><p>How \u2018bout you?</p><p>P.S.\u2014I thought violets were purple, not blue. Color me surprised. Thinking I need some tutoring\u2014the hands-on type.</p><p>He read it twice, surprised the message made it through security. The note wasn\u2019t signed, the return address sketchy, but he knew exactly who it had come from.</p><p>Corrado had no pen and paper, so he couldn\u2019t reply yet, but he knew exactly what he\u2019d say:</p><p>Flowers come in every color, but some aren\u2019t meant to be picked. Enjoy the view, but don\u2019t try to plant any of your seeds in my garden. I\u2019d hate to see you piled high with fertilizer.</p><p>31</p><p>On the first day of spring, March 20, trucks and vans packed the streets surrounding the Dirksen Federal Building in downtown Chicago. The sun shone brightly, the afternoon warm as trees grew lush and flowers bloomed. The way it felt on the twelfth floor of the building, though, you wouldn\u2019t know things flourished outside.</p><p>Under the dim lighting of the courtroom, Corrado sat behind the long defendant\u2019s table, hands clasped in front of him, tie hanging sloppily around his neck. His wife hadn\u2019t been there that morning to fix it as he dressed in a room not far from where he sat. The air was frigid in temperature and feeling. Despite having lived in Chicago for decades, he still wasn\u2019t used to the cold.</p><p>He didn\u2019t shiver, though. He refused to appear weak.</p><p>UNITED STATES V. CORRADO MORETTI</p><p>DAY ONE</p><p>The courtroom was packed, not an empty seat anywhere to be found. Corrado had surveyed the spectators when he was ushered in, spotting Celia in the back with her nephew, Dominic. Besides them, he saw little in the way of friendly faces. No family, no friends, no La Cosa Nostra . . . victims and their relatives crammed the frozen room, sucking up all of the oxygen.</p><p>Corrado could feel their hostility ghosting across his skin.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care what they thought, though. The only opinions that mattered to him belonged to the twelve people stuffed into the secluded box along the side. Eight men and four women, housed in a dingy hotel for the duration of the trial, guarded twenty-four hours a day.</p><p>It was the first time Corrado had been given a sequestered jury. The judge was afraid he would bribe his way out of trouble or ultimately hurt someone to get his way. If it didn\u2019t annoy him so much, having to rely on a genuine outcome, he might have been flattered by their fear.</p><p>Sitting back in his chair, Corrado leaned toward his lawyer. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the fact that they\u2019re locking the jury away with armed guards prejudice them against me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any more prejudiced than they already were,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey came into this believing you\u2019re a monster. Our job is to humanize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch and see.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza stood, straightening his tie as he approached the jury. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, during the next few weeks you\u2019re going to hear some terrible stories, some so horrific they\u2019ll turn your stomach. That\u2019s a guarantee. As the prosecution lays out its case, they\u2019re going to tell you about a violent man, a man without morals, a man without a conscience, who wreaks havoc on this great city day in and day out. But I\u2019m here to tell you right now, if that man exists, I haven\u2019t met him, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t represent him.\u201d</p><p>The jury was attentive, hanging on to the lawyer\u2019s every word. Mr. Borza strolled along the carpet in front of them, looking each and every one in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you about the real man on trial here,\u201d he said, motioning toward the defendant\u2019s table. \u201cCorrado Moretti never went to college. He didn\u2019t even graduate high school, but that didn\u2019t stop him from following his dreams. He\u2019s a God-fearing man, a man who loves his family . . . especially his wife, Celia. They\u2019ve been happily married for twenty-seven years.\u201d</p><p>It took everything in Corrado not to seek out his wife right then. He remained still, watching the jury, looking for signs of compassion.</p><p>He found none.</p><p>\u201cThe prosecution\u2019s case is based on half-truths from known liars who will get on that stand and tell you whatever the prosecution wants you to hear. They\u2019ll tell you these things, these fabrications, because the government cut them deals. You pat me on the back, I\u2019ll pat you. Why are they doing that? Because they have a personal vendetta against my client.</p><p>\u201cMr. Moretti built his business from the ground up, brick-by-brick, investing every penny he had into Luna Rossa. He\u2019s a small business owner, employing more than a dozen people and providing them with full benefits. He pays his taxes dutifully. He\u2019s living the American dream. Despite his lack of education, he made something out of himself. Does that sound like a man without morals? Does that sound like he lacks a conscience? In my opinion, it sounds like he\u2019s just like you and me.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza went on and on, twisting the facts, so by the time he finished he made Corrado seem like a bona fide boy scout. Corrado scanned the faces of the jurors as his lawyer took his seat, relaxing a smidgen when he finally saw it. There, in the eyes of a lone female\u2014juror number six\u2014a gleam of hope for humanity stared back at him. Na\u00efve and foolish, maybe, but that woman wanted to believe the best in him.</p><p>It was all he needed: a foot in the proverbial door, the first step toward walking free.</p><p>DAY NINE</p><p>Wiretaps.</p><p>The sound of Corrado\u2019s voice resonated through the courtroom from a set of speakers in the front. Stacks of transcripts were piled high on the tables, completely untouched. His voice was clear and concise. They didn\u2019t need to read his words when they could plainly hear them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he barked on the tape. \u201cWhen I wake up tomorrow, I better not hear about him still breathing, or you might not be by the time I go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>Corrado ran his hands down his face in frustration. How would his lawyer explain that one away?</p><p>Tape after tape, threat after threat. Little in the way of proof but a whole lot of damning insinuation.</p><p>They were all restless when the prosecution put on the last recording of the day. Corrado sat back in his chair, tensing when a familiar voice spoke through the speakers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cHappened tonight. Finally.\u201d</p><p>Corrado pinpointed the conversation immediately. He had been sitting at home when his brother-in-law called from Blackburn to say he had gotten Haven.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cHow much did you pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA quarter mil, cash,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ve given more than that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cYou\u2019ve paid a lot for that girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Vincent sighed loudly on the line. \u201cWe all have.\u201d</p><p>When those words hit him, Corrado shook his head. Trafficking in persons for servitude. Those words on his indictment made sense. Intentions hadn\u2019t mattered, and often never do.</p><p>DAY SEVENTEEN</p><p>Expert witnesses.</p><p>Corrado\u2019s attention wavered as the prosecutor questioned an accountant on the stand. They were going through his financial records one transaction at a time, trying to find a large sum of money they could prove was acquired illegally. Corrado was quite bored, knowing they would find nothing substantial. As far as he was concerned, a few dollars here and there didn\u2019t count.</p><p>\u201cObjection!\u201d his lawyer interrupted the line of questioning. \u201cI fail to see why it\u2019s important to note how much Mr. Moretti spent for bathroom supplies in July.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOverruled.\u201d The judge motioned for the prosecutor to continue.</p><p>More questions. More prying. More desperation. Corrado glanced at the jury, who appeared just as bored. Juror number six turned to him at that moment. He caught her eye, expecting her to look back away, but she didn\u2019t. She stared, studying him, a look of curiosity in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cObjection,\u201d his lawyer said again. \u201cI fail to see the relevance in any of this.\u201d</p><p>The judge sighed. \u201cOverruled.\u201d</p><p>It went on for two excruciating hours before the prosecution finished. Mr. Borza stood then. \u201cBased on your calculations, what\u2019s the total amount of money that went unreported at Luna Rossa last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, $15,776.49.\u201d</p><p>Corrado cringed. More than a few dollars.</p><p>\u201cSeems like a lot,\u201d Mr. Borza said, verbalizing his thoughts. \u201cBut we\u2019re talking about a club that made more than three million dollars last year, correct?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis unaccounted for money equals what, half of one percent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFractionally more than that, but yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo more than ninety-nine percent of Luna Rossa\u2019s revenue is right there in black and white. That half of one percent is the equivalent of blaming a man for losing a few pennies when he broke a dollar at the store. That\u2019s hardly what I\u2019d call an elaborate money laundering scheme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObjection!\u201d the prosecution declared. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to distort the math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSustained. Move on, Mr. Borza.\u201d</p><p>The ruling didn\u2019t put off the lawyer. He had gotten his point across. \u201cCould this half of one percent merely be a mathematical error?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there may not be any missing money at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObjection!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverruled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d the accountant said. \u201cIt\u2019s usually why taxes are audited during a series of years for consistency and accuracy, since mistakes happen.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza smiled as he sat back down. \u201cMistakes happen. I couldn\u2019t have said it better myself.\u201d</p><p>DAY TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Testimony.</p><p>Witness after witness took the stand, answering questions being fired at them. Former associates, a few La Cosa Nostra, testified to tales of mayhem, while shop owners and unlucky bystanders swore to what they knew. Not a single one of them would finger Corrado directly, but there was enough to loosely link him to the crimes.</p><p>\u201cMr. Gallo,\u201d Corrado\u2019s lawyer started, addressing a former street soldier on the stand, \u201cyou testified that you, along with three others, were involved in a string of robberies in March of ninety-eight. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what role do you assert Corrado Moretti played in all of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ordered us to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough text message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there would be record of these messages, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was on a prepaid phone, a disposable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the messages came from my client\u2019s number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it came from a private number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still have that disposable phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was destroyed. You know, uh, disposed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight . . . you robbed these places because you received anonymous text messages telling you to, which you have no evidence of, and you expect us to just take your word that it came from Corrado Moretti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you the three others you named in these robberies claim to not even know who Corrado Moretti is? They say it was a scheme the four of you cooked up on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say they were lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible all three are lying,\u201d Mr. Borza said. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it more likely it\u2019s just you?\u201d</p><p>A pin drop could be heard through the strained silence of the courtroom. The prosecutor stood beside his table, shifting through paperwork while everyone waited for him to speak. Nerves frazzled, the spectators were on the edge of their seats, eyes darting toward the big set of double doors every time there was a noise.</p><p>A month into the trial, the prosecution was down to the last name on their witness list.</p><p>Carmine held his breath, as did what seemed like half of Chicago crowded into the stifling room. He had avoided most of the proceedings\u2014out of respect or selfishness, he wasn\u2019t sure\u2014but today was one day he couldn\u2019t miss. He had to be there, had to see with his own eyes, face reality and learn the truth.</p><p>He needed to know if his father was still alive.</p><p>Had Vincent been located and taken into witness protection, nobody would know until he walked in, escorted by armed U.S. Marshals. But if he didn\u2019t show, well . . . Carmine didn\u2019t like to think about what that meant.</p><p>He glanced around, his eyes drifting to his uncle. Corrado seemed relaxed, borderline bored as he leaned back in his chair, his eyes focused on the restless jury. Had he been like that the whole trial, confident and calm, or did he know something the rest of them didn\u2019t?</p><p>Carmine shifted his attention to the other side of the room where his aunt sat with Dominic. Neither had seen him come in, and he appreciated that. The last thing he wanted was forced family time.</p><p>Mr. Markson cleared his throat. \u201cYour honor, the prosecution . . .\u201d</p><p>Carmine closed his eyes . . . Calls Vincenzo DeMarco to the stand . . .</p><p>\u201c. . . Rests its case. We have no more witnesses.\u201d</p><p>Carmine reopened his eyes as the silence was abruptly shattered by a wave of murmurs. The judge banged his gavel for silence as Carmine stood, slipping out of the courtroom before they could continue.</p><p>32</p><p>Gavin became a regular fixture outside the art building on the west side of Manhattan. It was rare that he wasn\u2019t standing there when Haven got out of her painting class, casually leaning against the wall as if there were nowhere else he needed to be.</p><p>Haven spoke to him on the days she saw him, and he would occasionally walk with her to the library on his way to the construction site a few blocks away, but he didn\u2019t push his luck by asking for anything more.</p><p>It was comfortable and easy, and she grew used to their strange arrangement after a while, enjoying their short conversations before they went their separate ways. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was something. It was a connection, a blossoming friendship she found herself looking forward to those three days a week he infiltrated her life.</p><p>Haven smiled to herself one Friday afternoon when they were strolling down the sidewalk, the crowd moving briskly around them, but they were in no hurry to get anywhere. Gavin filled the time by telling a joke he had heard at work, a vulgar one Haven didn\u2019t quite understand, but she laughed at what she figured were all the right places. \u201cYou know, you kind of remind me of someone I used to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, raising his eyebrows. \u201cA boyfriend, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. He was just a friend. He liked to tell jokes.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s expression fell. \u201cAm I being friend-zoned already?\u201d</p><p>Haven looked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>He waved her off. \u201cThis friend of yours . . . was he anywhere near as handsome as me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNot quite, but few are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, is that a compliment?\u201d He stopped walking, dramatically blinking his eyes. \u201cAre you flirting with me?\u201d</p><p>Haven rolled her eyes and refused to respond, continuing to walk. He had no choice but to move again to catch up with her.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, was that a compliment?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can\u2019t tell when you\u2019re being sarcastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never sarcastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He paused. \u201cWait, was that sarcasm?\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head. \u201cIt was a compliment. I meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019m shocked,\u201d he replied, grinning widely. \u201cI honestly thought you were still entertaining the idea of a restraining order. Good to know I\u2019ve worn you down enough that you like me a little bit.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI never said I liked you. I just said you were handsome. That says nothing about your personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know that was sarcasm,\u201d he declared.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>He clutched his chest. \u201cI\u2019m hurt.\u201d</p><p>Haven nudged him playfully with her elbow. \u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>A sheet of notebook paper was taped to the glass of the locked art studio door that Friday, class cancelled scribbled on it with pencil. No explanation\u2014just no class.</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Kelsey dramatically fist pumped in celebration. \u201cNo class!\u201d</p><p>Haven frowned. She always looked forward to painting. \u201cWonder why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cI have extra time to hit the computer lab and work on my design project now. Maybe I won\u2019t be stuck in the house all weekend after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means I have time to . . .\u201d Haven trailed off, unable to think of something to do. \u201cgo to the library.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey laughed. \u201cYou spend more time there than at home.\u201d</p><p>Haven shrugged. It was probably true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After saying their good-byes, Kelsey headed to the lab the next floor up while Haven left the building. She strolled down the street, in no rush to get anywhere, and made the walk toward the library. Her mind wandered as she fell in with the bustling crowd, and before she realized it, she had already passed her destination. She looked around in confusion, catching sight of the closest street sign: Sixth Avenue.</p><p>A substantial construction site stood near the corner across the street, spanning about an acre and surrounded by tall buildings. The frame of a structure was built, metal beams stuck together like an elaborate maze. Dirty and chaotic, it looked a lot like she imagined a construction site would look.</p><p>Curious, Haven\u2019s feet carried her across the street for a closer look. Most of the workers were busy, operating equipment or scaling the structure, but a few guys in yellow hard hats stood around, chatting. One or two looked her way, someone even letting out a low whistle, but she ignored it as she walked through the lot. A trailer sat along the side, the low hum of an air conditioner buzzing from it. Something told her if Gavin was at the site, that was where he would be.</p><p>Haven felt out of place, her eyes locking on the ground as she headed straight for the trailer. She had come that far and figured it would be silly to leave without at least saying hello.</p> <p>A thick man in scruffy jeans and a black tank top leaned against the corner of the trailer, tossing rocks at something in a nearby patch of dirt. Haven chanced a peek at him, her footsteps faltering when she heard a small squeal. Her eyes darted to the source of the sound, seeing a small white kitten. It could hardly walk, its fur matted with a bit of blood.</p><p>It squealed again as the man threw a rock at it, smacking it in the side.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d Haven said, the words flying from her mouth in horror. \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d</p><p>The man looked at her with dark bloodshot eyes, no flicker of acknowledgment on his face. He turned away and grabbed another rock, striking the kitten again. It stumbled from the blow.</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes burned with tears. \u201cDon\u2019t do that anymore!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMind your own business, sweetheart,\u201d the man grumbled. \u201cGo on back to wherever you came from. You don\u2019t belong here.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed another rock, but Haven wasn\u2019t having it. She lunged for the cat, grabbing it as he threw the rock, smacking her with it instead. It stung as it struck her ankle, but she barely winced as she shielded the cat in her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d the man spat, pushing away from the trailer. He took two steps toward her, his big stride closing the distance between them. Haven instinctively took a step away from the man.</p><p>Before she could say anything\u2014or rather, run\u2014the door of the trailer opened and laughter cut through the air. Two guys stepped out, one an old bald man in a black suit with a walking cane. He tipped his head in greeting to the other before heading to a waiting town car. The second man Haven recognized immediately, wearing freshly pressed khakis and a blue button-down shirt: Gavin.</p><p>He turned to them after the older man was gone, the smirk on his lips disappearing when he spotted Haven. His brow creased, his eyes darting between her and the worker. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering the same thing!\u201d the man exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m over here taking my afternoon break, you know, just hanging out, and this broad walks up and starts telling me what to do! Can you believe it?\u201d</p> <p>Gavin\u2019s expression darkened, his blue eyes clouding to a furious gray. Haven\u2019s heartbeat quickened, the cat meowing as she instinctively gripped it tighter.</p><p>The Gavin she knew was friendly, playful. She had never seen him angry before.</p><p>\u201cGet back to work,\u201d he barked at the man.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. Go. Now.\u201d</p><p>The man hesitated for a fraction of a second before storming away. Gavin took a few brusque steps toward Haven, eliciting a small retreat from her, but he wasn\u2019t deterred in his approach. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . the kitten was hurt, and he was throwing rocks at it, and I told him not to but he wouldn\u2019t stop, and the kitten yelped, so I couldn\u2019t just stand there. I had to help! He got mad, then you came out, and he told you what happened, and uh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here we are?\u201d he guessed.</p> <p>Haven nodded, avoiding his eyes. He reached toward her and she flinched, but he seemed not to notice as he grabbed the cat, taking it from her.</p><p>\u201cIt looks pretty messed up,\u201d he said, checking it out. \u201cThere\u2019s a shelter a few blocks over. I can drop it off there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ll fix her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her brow furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean they\u2019ll either fix it up or put it to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Haven recoiled as if he had struck her. \u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe city\u2019s overrun with stray animals, so I\u2019m sure the shelter gets more than it can keep. Might not be worth saving.\u201d</p><p>Horrified, Haven ripped the kitten from his hands, taking it back. \u201cThey can\u2019t just kill it! That\u2019s not fair! It did nothing wrong!\u201d</p><p>Gavin let out a sudden laugh of surprise as he held up his hands defensively. \u201cGeez, all right, relax. There are other options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you can let it go and hope it can fend for itself.\u201d</p><p>Out of the question. \u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you can take it to the vet.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the cat before looking back at him. \u201cDo you know a good vet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might know of a place,\u201d he replied, eyeing her curiously. \u201cWhy are you here, anyway? I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014it\u2019s a pleasant surprise, but still a surprise. I was actually about to head your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy class got cancelled,\u201d she replied. \u201cI was going to the library and kind of just ended up here instead.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stared at her with disbelief. \u201cYou just ended up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And since I was here I thought I would say hey, so . . . hey.\u201d</p><p>A smug smile formed on his lips. \u201cYou must\u2019ve missed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t see me yesterday and you wouldn\u2019t see me today if you didn\u2019t have class. It\u2019s the weekend, so that means you\u2019d have to wait until Monday to see me again. That\u2019s a long time.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at his cocky tone. \u201cIt was nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou missed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe just a little,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut just as a friend,\u201d she clarified. \u201cNot more.\u201d</p><p>Gavin shook his head as he took a step away. \u201cStay here and I\u2019ll get the address for the vet.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared back into the trailer as Haven strolled farther away, petting the kitten. It stared up at her, bright blue eyes alive with excitement, mismatched from its dull and lifeless exterior.</p><p>\u201cSnowy,\u201d she whispered, the word popping in her mind. \u201cI\u2019ll call you Snowy.\u201d</p><p>Gavin came back out, pausing on the steps of the trailer as he hollered for someone. The firmness was back in his voice, the hard edge once again etched in his expression. The man from earlier jogged over, and Haven watched as Gavin said something to him. He spoke too quietly for her to hear but the man\u2019s head dropped low, his shoulders slumping in defeat. He gave a slight nod before turning, and Haven tensed as he approached her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d he muttered, refusing to meet her eyes. \u201cI hope you can accept my apology. I ain\u2019t mean to hurt the cat or anything. I was just messing around. Send me the vet bills. Mr. Amaro can take it out of my pay.\u201d</p><p>Haven stammered with surprise, only able to get out an \u201cokay.\u201d</p><p>Gavin walked over when the man scurried back to work. He handed her a scrap of paper with an address and phone number scribbled on it.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhat did you say to make him apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told him who you were.\u201d</p><p>She tensed at those words. \u201cWho am I?\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s eyes met hers. He stared for a moment before answering, his eyebrows raised as if that question surprised him. \u201cA friend of mine, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you want me to go with you?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not far, just about a block back the way you came. We can walk.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the address on the paper. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to leave work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI was about to leave anyway.\u201d</p><p>A few hours later, the two of them sat in flimsy blue plastic chairs in the busy waiting room of a walk-in emergency animal clinic. Haven fidgeted anxiously, her backside starting to hurt from the hard seat.</p><p>A nurse eventually called Haven\u2019s name and she jumped up, not bothering to wait for Gavin as she made her way to the back.</p><p>\u201cThe kitten\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d the lady said. \u201cWe\u2019ve cleaned him up and dressed the wound\u2014just a small gash that should heal right up. He had a horrible case of fleas that we\u2019ve taken care of, but there was nothing majorly wrong. You can take him home now.\u201d</p><p>Smiling with relief, Haven signed the heap of paperwork before taking the cat and rejoining Gavin. They left the clinic, the animal fast asleep in Haven\u2019s arms as they headed back out into the street. The sun had started to set, most of the day having faded away.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do with the cat?\u201d Gavin asked. \u201cKeep it?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed to have pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can try to find it a home,\u201d Gavin suggested. \u201cPut out an ad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if someone bad responds, like that guy you work with?\u201d</p><p>Gavin sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m out of ideas short of me taking it home.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s expression lit up. \u201cWould you really?\u201d</p><p>He blanched. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you keep him?\u201d she asked. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be nice to him.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stammered, opening and closing his mouth a few times, before shrugging and letting out a deep sigh. \u201cFuck it, why not?\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled, holding the kitten up and waving its paw at Gavin. \u201cSnowy thanks you.\u201d</p><p>The clinic was near her art building, the students all gone for the weekend when they strolled past. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of a long walk from the construction site to my school,\u201d Haven mused. \u201cWhat in the world do you do up here all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that long of a walk,\u201d he said. \u201cTen, fifteen minutes at the most. I came up here that first day to hit up a deli nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about every other day?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI come for the company.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite herself, Haven blushed at that.</p><p>They chatted casually as they walked\u2014about the cat, about school, even about the weather. It took nearly a half hour for them to reach Haven\u2019s neighborhood, although she usually made the walk in half that time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that took so long,\u201d Haven said, stopping in front of her brownstone when they arrived.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind,\u201d he replied, shrugging. \u201cDidn\u2019t have much else to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about work? Didn\u2019t they expect you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make my own hours, so it isn\u2019t a big deal. I come and go as I please.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him curiously. He genuinely sounded like he didn\u2019t mind. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re really nice. Not many people would\u2019ve done what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it make you like me just a little more?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d he said, smirking. \u201cYou actually let me walk you home.\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at him with surprise. It hadn\u2019t struck her until that moment. As many times as she had refused, she finally let him walk her home without him even having to ask.</p><p>Before Haven could respond, the front door of the brownstone flung open and Kelsey appeared, talking loudly into her cell phone. She looked at the two of them, her expression lighting up with surprise, before her attention went back to her call. Her gaze darted past them, scanning the street, before she started frantically waving. \u201cYou see me? Yeah, there. Find a parking spot.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and squealed. \u201cHey, guys! What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>Haven held the cat up. \u201cI found this, so Gavin went with me to the vet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I walked her home.\u201d Arrogance oozed from his voice. Haven rolled her eyes at him as Kelsey cooed and petted the tiny animal. \u201cI was just leaving, though.\u201d</p> <p>Kelsey\u2019s attention switched from the cat to Gavin instantly. \u201cLeaving? No way! I have some friends over . . . we were going to have a few drinks and hang out. You should totally join us. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head, but Gavin\u2019s smug smile grew infinitely. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s friends appeared then, a few Haven vaguely recognized, but none she really knew. They were sociable, while Haven preferred to keep to herself. They disappeared inside, gathering in the second floor apartment.</p><p>Raising his eyebrows, Gavin stared at her questioningly, awaiting a reaction. \u201cAre you going to invite me inside?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged slowly. \u201cKelsey already invited you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t come here for Kelsey, so I\u2019m not going in unless you invite me.\u201d</p><p>Haven considered that, unsure of how to respond. It had been a long day and she really wanted to take a bath and maybe read a book, but when the music started upstairs, so loud it rattled the windows, Haven knew she wouldn\u2019t be getting any peace anyway.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d Go with the flow, she told herself. Live a little. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of invitation is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only kind you\u2019re getting.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed, holding open the front door politely and pressing his hand gently against her back. Bypassing her apartment, she headed up the stairs, acutely aware of Gavin\u2019s eyes on her as he walked behind her. It made her skin prickle as her stomach churned from nerves.</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s apartment, identical to the one below it when stripped down to its core, looked like an entirely different world. Everything was brand-new and bright, expensive furniture filling every room while elaborate artwork hung on the walls. Haven gingerly took a seat in the first spot she came across, a tan leather chair with wide, plush arms. She kicked her shoes off and tucked her feet under her, protectively holding the sleeping kitten in her lap, while Gavin casually positioned himself on the arm of her chair.</p><p>It took only seconds before Kelsey thrust drinks at the two of them. Haven took the spiked lemonade with a polite smile while Gavin eyed the bottle of bright yellow alcohol with aversion. \u201cYeah, I can\u2019t drink this shit,\u201d he mumbled to himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she has other stuff,\u201d Haven said, pointing across the room. \u201cThe kitchen\u2019s over there. You can help yourself. Kelsey won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, looking down at her. \u201cAre you going to drink it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she said. \u201cI might as well.\u201d</p><p>Gavin strolled away, stealthily handing the bottle back to Kelsey as he made his way to her kitchen. Haven watched him curiously, taking a moment to admire the way he seamlessly infused himself into a group. Poised and confident, he spoke to strangers as if they were friends.</p><p>Envy pecked at her, sudden and unexpected. Was it jealousy that he was sharing himself with others, or jealousy at the way he seemed to effortlessly fit in? She thought it was the latter, but the sheer possibility that she might yearn to keep him to herself filled her with uneasiness.</p><p>Gavin returned with a red plastic cup and retook his spot on the arm of her chair. He took a sip of his drink and smiled. \u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked curiously, peeking into his cup. \u201cBeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMountain Dew.\u201d</p><p>Haven took a sip of hers, puckering her lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled playfully. \u201cI drink water, milk, and pop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not alcohol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make a habit of it,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink, either,\u201d she said, elaborating when his brow furrowed. \u201cWell, not usually. I\u2019m not old enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am old enough, but I prefer to keep my wits about me.\u201d</p><p>Haven surveyed him as he sipped from his cup. His smooth skin showed no sign of age, his eyes bright and encouraging, his smile genuine. He had had a good life\u2014that much was clear\u2014but small scars on his hands told her he had fought for it.</p><p>Gavin looked at her as if he could sense her gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld?\u201d he guessed.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, I was going to say that\u2019s kind of young to be a manager.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cManager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the construction site. You work in that little office. You said you supervised things, right?\u201d</p><p>His face lit up with understanding. \u201cAh, yeah. Well, what I do is less about your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and more about your references . . . if that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Haven nodded. \u201cIt does.\u201d It was precisely how she had gotten where she was, how she had been admitted into school and settled into New York. Corrado had pulled strings, bypassing policies to manipulate the system to his benefit.</p><p>Haven nursed her drink as she mused over that. Despite the fact that she sipped slowly, she could feel the alcohol taking affect after only a few minutes, relaxing her back into the seat as her eyelids drooped a bit. Buzzing, her head swam as her body tingled, warming slightly under Gavin\u2019s intense gaze. He remained perched on the arm of the chair, his attention unwavering.</p><p>She excused herself when her drink was empty and grabbed another from the refrigerator, taking a moment to clear her head before returning back to the others. They were playing a game, their laughter bouncing through the apartment and mixing with the music. She sat down again and had just opened her bottle when Kelsey\u2019s voice rang out above the others. \u201cPlay with us!\u201d</p><p>Haven looked up, her eyes connecting with her friend\u2019s. \u201cPlay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s easy. We take turns saying things we haven\u2019t done, and everyone who has done it has to take a drink.\u201d</p><p>The blood rushed to Haven\u2019s cheeks as everyone looked at her. She peeked at Gavin, hoping to divert the attention away from herself. He shrugged. \u201cSure, why not.\u201d</p><p>Everyone migrated to the small living room, a dozen of them gathering around, and the music was turned down so they could hear the declarations called out one by one. Never have I ever had sex in the house with a parent home. Never have I ever been high. Never have I ever had a fake ID. Never have I ever gotten drunk at a school dance. Never have I ever driven a car without a license. The others laughed, trading playful jabs and reminiscing about shared experiences, while Haven quietly took sip after sip.</p><p>She found herself drinking more than she had expected to, given how sheltered a life she had lived. She realized, as the alcohol gradually seeped into her bloodstream, intoxication taking over her mind and loosening her hold on her emotions, exactly how many experiences Carmine had unknowingly exposed her to. Their lives had been anything but normal, their love anything but average, but he had managed to show her the same world everyone else knew, the world she had always yearned to be a part of, the one she thought she had only just stepped into.</p><p>The game grew more intense as it went on, the statements cruder. Haven didn\u2019t drink so much then, but she was already past the point of no return. Gavin played along, steadily sipping his soda to things that made Haven even blush to imagine. He chuckled at her reactions, smiling guiltily at the questions in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever been in handcuffs,\u201d someone called out.</p><p>Bottle halfway to her lips, Haven hesitated as she thought of Dr. DeMarco and the day he had bound her to her bed as punishment. She took a quick drink and Gavin cocked an eyebrow at her as he took his own sip. \u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d she muttered, shaking her head. He didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>A few more were thrown out, raunchy ones that gave her a quick reprieve from the alcohol, before someone shouted, \u201cNever have I ever seen a dead body!\u201d</p><p>The room erupted in laughter, others rolling their eyes at the absurdity, but Haven blanched as visions flashed through her mind of the death, and chaos, and destruction she\u2019d seen. She saw Number 33, the lifeless blue eyes that still haunted her, the blood pooling around the young girl\u2019s blonde hair.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she took a long pull from her bottle, downing the rest of her drink as she tried to clear the memory away. And maybe she had imagined it, or maybe it was purely coincidence, but when she reopened her eyes, Haven noticed that Gavin, too, had taken a sip from his cup.</p><p>The game came to a stopping point, people dispersing for more alcohol as the music was turned up again. Gavin let out a long sigh, glancing at his watch as he stood. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced around for a clock, but her vision was too blurry to make out the numbers. She climbed to her feet, still holding the sleeping cat, and swayed a bit. Gavin grasped her elbow to steady her, taking both the empty bottle and the kitten.</p><p>\u201cWe should get you home,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>Despite Kelsey\u2019s objections, Gavin led Haven from the apartment. He helped her down the stairs, pausing in the foyer outside of her apartment door as she fumbled with her keys. \u201cThanks again for tonight. I\u2019ll see you Monday.\u201d</p><p>She turned away, but he reached out to stop her. \u201cSee me sooner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo out with me.\u201d</p><p>The color drained from her face as those words washed through her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. Go out with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI have plans.\u201d</p><p>At the library, she thought, but she refrained from saying it out loud.</p><p>\u201cThen the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cGo out with me on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>33</p><p>Haven fidgeted, peeking through the thick white curtains that hung in her living room. It was early afternoon on Sunday, and the Manhattan neighborhood was as hectic as ever. Tourists wandered the streets, mingling with the locals and the busy street vendors. Usually watching the flurry of activity put Haven at ease, but today every movement just made her more edgy.</p> <p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Kelsey said, plopping down on Haven\u2019s couch with the remote control. \u201cYou\u2019re stressing for no reason.\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? It\u2019s a Sunday. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a real date.\u201d</p><p>Not a real date. Haven tried to tell herself that, but it had yet to work. It certainly felt real to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just two people getting together to do whatever it is you people do,\u201d she said. \u201cPersonally, unless it involves sex or bacon, I see no reason to do anything on Sundays.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, we won\u2019t be doing that,\u201d Haven muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo bacon? He isn\u2019t vegan, is he? I don\u2019t trust a guy that won\u2019t chow down on a steak.\u201d</p><p>Haven felt the blood rush to her cheeks. \u201cI meant the sex.\u201d</p><p>She could hardly get the word past her lips.</p><p>Kelsey laughed. \u201cWhat a shame. I had hope for you.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Haven peered back out the window. She saw him right away, halfway down the block, walking through the crowd. He was dressed impeccably, wearing black slacks and a white shirt. His dress shoes shone under the afternoon sunlight, a dark pinstriped tie hanging loosely around his neck. He walked with confidence, comfortable in his skin.</p><p>Watching him made her dizzy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get why you\u2019re freaking out over this,\u201d Kelsey continued. \u201cYou see this boy all the time.\u201d</p> <p>It was different, but Haven knew her friend wouldn\u2019t understand. Kelsey dated all the time, meeting new guys every week, but that wasn\u2019t Haven. She had no interest in dating at all. The afternoon walks after her painting class and the friendly banter she shared with Gavin were innocent. But this . . . this was planned. This was contrived. And to her, that was the difference between being friends and something more.</p><p>That thought alone\u2014the thought of someone wanting something more with her\u2014made her stomach clench with severe angst.</p><p>She dropped the curtain back into place, smoothing her clothes when Gavin knocked. She felt underdressed in her jeans and pink blouse. What did people wear on a possibly-but-maybe-not real date?</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Kelsey said, a mischievous glint in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Haven mumbled. \u201cI won\u2019t do half of what you would.\u201d</p><p>Haven opened the door, smiling sheepishly when she came face-to-face with Gavin. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes.\u201d She took a tentative step outside. \u201cI look okay, though, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>His eyes quickly raked down her body at that question. Her skin prickled at the attention. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI just saw you were dressed up and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I guess I\u2019m a little overdressed,\u201d he said, looking down at himself as he rocked on his heels. \u201cYou look fine for what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Haven shut the door, taking another step toward him. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hands in his pockets as he stepped off the porch, motioning for her to follow him. \u201cI thought we\u2019d take a walk or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s what we do every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt works for us, right? We can just see where we end up. I mean, unless you\u2019d rather\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d She cut him off, her anxiety lessening. \u201cWalking is great.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t a date.</p><p>The two of them set off through the streets. Gavin struck up conversation, their usual friendly banter returning as he led her down to the subway on Twenty-third Street.</p><p>Haven froze on the platform after he grabbed their passes, her eyes scanning the others waiting. A white tile wall loomed behind her, while trash littered the grimy concrete ground. Bells and whistles sounded, a crackling loudspeaker drowning out the chatter of the crowd. People pushed, others yelled, as the whoosh of trains rushing past stirred up the musty odor of dirt and rank urine. Electricity buzzed and lights flashed as doors clattered, noisily opening and closing before the trains sped away.</p><p>It was contradictory\u2014loud and chaotic, yet orderly at the same time, like an assembly line in an overworked factory. It felt robotic, almost inhuman, as people packed the vessels, methodically moving on and off like clockwork. It was an entirely different world underground, one Haven never realized existed beneath her feet.</p><p>Haven\u2019s wide eyes scanned the scene, taking it all in with stunned silence. Gavin noticed her expression, scrunching his nose. \u201cI know, it\u2019s disgusting down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s, uh . . . I\u2019ve just never taken the subway before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you live in New York and not take the subway?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow do you get to the other side of the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison Square Garden?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cTimes Square?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroadway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>A train pulled up to the platform, the silver doors creaking open. People moved toward it and Gavin pressed his hand to Haven\u2019s back, guiding her into a graffiti-ridden car. He muscled his way through the crowd, acting as a shield between her and the others. She slid into the last empty spot on a hard plastic bench, her small frame squeezed between a teenage boy humming and an overweight bald man with body odor, slumped over and snoring.</p><p>Gavin stood in front of Haven, leaning against a metal pole as the doors closed. They jolted as they took off, shoving her into the sleeping man, but he hardly stirred. The floor beneath her feet vibrated as they sped along the old tracks, metal grinding as the lights inside the cramped car flickered.</p><p>Haven\u2019s heart thumped wildly in her chest, a mixture of exhilaration and alarm, and blush stained her cheeks when she noticed Gavin\u2019s eyes fixed squarely on her, watching with curiosity. She looked away from him, her gaze timidly dipping to the floor. He stood so close their knees almost bumped, the tips of their shoes touching\u2014his: shiny, new, and black; hers: old, scuffed, and dirty.</p><p>She slid her foot back impulsively, away from his, before chancing a peek at him again. He, too, stared at their shoes, his eyes darting back to hers as if he could sense her gaze. His curious expression held questions, but he asked none of them.</p><p>After a few minutes, the air brakes whistled loudly like fireworks about to explode. Haven clung to the seat, careful not to bump anyone as the train came to a screeching halt. The doors opened and Gavin led her onto another platform, COLUMBUS CIRCLE written in mosaic tile along a wall.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Haven asked as he led her through the crowd. The fact that she was in a part of the city she had never been to before both unnerved her and excited her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see in a minute,\u201d he said.</p><p>She followed him out of the subway station and onto the street above. The moment she stepped out, something inside her twisted. She saw it then, just as he had said she would. Trees spanned as far as her eyes could see, a forest tucked into the heart of the bustling city.</p><p>\u201cCentral Park,\u201d Gavin said. \u201cEver been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on, then.\u201d Gavin motioned with his head, a smirk highlighting his face. \u201cNothing stopping you now.\u201d</p><p>Nothing stopping you now.</p><p>Haven followed Gavin across the street, passing the massive statue and into the park. The two of them strolled side by side in peaceful silence as Haven admired the trees towering over them like oversize green umbrellas. Sunlight spilled through the branches in spots, patches of light scattered along the path of cool shade, warmth forcing its way into the shadows. Haven reveled in it, stepping into the glow when they came upon it and glancing up into the sky with a smile on her lips.</p><p>Heaven, she thought. It felt like Heaven streaming down on her.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d Gavin asked.</p><p>Haven\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cAren\u2019t we doing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we can just walk around if you want, but there\u2019s more to do here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought it was just, you know . . .\u201d She motioned all around them. \u201c. . . trees.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNot at all. Come on, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Statues, bridges, trails, wildlife . . . hours passed as Haven took it all in. They watched a puppet show and she swung on the playground swings before exploring the zoo and feeding the ducks on the lake. Gavin taught her how to play checkers and blatantly let her win, even buying her ice cream when they passed a vendor. There was music and games, laughter and excitement. She hummed along to the musical tower clock as they watched people toss a Frisbee and plant new trees.</p><p>Everywhere she looked there was something else, something new, something more, and little by little a part of her guard crumbled. The hurt she carried with her took a hit, hope and happiness resonating inside her again. The strong-willed girl, restrained and suspicious, didn\u2019t even notice as her vulnerability showed, bits of the real Haven Antonelli shining through for once.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some food,\u201d Gavin suggested. It was growing late, already close to dusk. \u201cWe haven\u2019t eaten all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had ice cream, remember?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t count. I know a nice place. We can grab some dinner and get you home, since you have school in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have work,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have to get up super early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I get up when I get up,\u201d he said. \u201cI make my own hours. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Is your dad in construction, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d he said, frowning as he looked at his watch. \u201cMy father\u2019s got his hands in a bit of everything.\u201d</p><p>They headed out of Central Park, catching the subway back to Twenty-third Street. Gavin sat beside her on the bench this time because there were far fewer riders at that hour than in the afternoon. They got off at their destination, walking about a block to a small restaurant. Long windows overtook the front of the brick building, and Haven could see quite a few tables inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were seated along the side of the dining room at a table with two wooden chairs. Gavin ordered vegetable curry with spicy noodles without looking at the menu, while Haven picked a cheeseburger with fries. They were both quiet as they waited, sipping their drinks and resting their feet from walking so much.</p><p>It took ten minutes, maybe fifteen, before their food arrived. Within a matter of seconds, Gavin cleared his throat. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, popping a fry into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your deal?\u201d</p> <p>She stopped chewing. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that, you know, you\u2019re not like the usual people I deal with. There\u2019s something different about you.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Haven\u2019s guard crept right back up, the wall of disconnect rebuilding. Different wasn\u2019t blending in. Different wasn\u2019t staying out of the limelight. Different wasn\u2019t a part of the plan. \u201cHow am I different?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou live in New York but you haven\u2019t seen much. You\u2019ve gone nowhere and done nothing.\u201d</p><p>Haven had no idea how to respond. She swallowed harshly, her appetite gone. \u201cI was born in a really small town and never got to go anywhere. There wasn\u2019t really anywhere to go, anyway, even if I could. I only had my mama growing up, and she couldn\u2019t take me places. My father . . . I never really had one of those, and then I lost my mama, and well . . . here I am, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>She stumbled over her words, cringing at her explanation. While true, technically, it was a lie by omission. A half-truth. It was all, she realized, she could ever give him.</p><p>\u201cYou have other family, right? Aunts? Uncles? Cousins?\u201d</p><p>The question spurred an image in Haven\u2019s mind of her last Christmas in Durante. Dominic. Tess. Dia. Celia and Corrado. Dr. DeMarco. Carmine. While technically not her relatives, they were the only other family she had ever known. \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t talk to them much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d That time, it was one hundred percent truth. \u201cThey all live far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here then?\u201d</p> <p>Haven started to reply, looking up from her plate, but her words trailed off when her gaze drifted past Gavin. Her eyes were drawn to the back of the restaurant, out of the glass wall and onto the patio, where a row of potted palm trees aligned the railing. \u201cPalm trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPalm trees?\u201d he asked, Haven\u2019s attention returned to him when he spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s why you came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, well, uh . . .\u201d She let out a sudden laugh, tears prickling her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think there were any in New York.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cAh, yeah, they imported them. You know, for ambiance. A bit tacky, but whatever.\u201d</p><p>Gavin pried no more after that, but the damage had been done. Haven was distracted, her thoughts lodged in the distant past as her eyes continually drifted back to the patio, her food remaining untouched. She missed them all, more than she had wanted to admit, but she missed him most of all.</p><p>She tried not to dwell on Carmine, but sometimes it was unavoidable. Sometimes something small rubbed against the wound, reopening it, reminding her of what she tried to forget\u2014not him, never him, but the ending. The devastation. The good-bye.</p><p>Or lack of one, really. The lack of closure. Without it, the wound could never properly heal. It would linger forever, fueled by the ideology of what could have been.</p><p>What could have been? It could have been Carmine there with her, exploring Central Park, traveling around New York. It could have been Carmine sitting across from her, not asking questions because he already knew the truth. He knew her past. He knew where she came from. He understood what she had gone through.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t him, and as she sat there, she allowed herself to feel that void again.</p><p>Gavin paid when they finished. They left the restaurant, neither speaking on the walk to her apartment. He reached over and took her hand halfway there, his fingers loosely linking with hers. She didn\u2019t pull away, didn\u2019t fight it. Her emotions were all over the place, up and down, a roller coaster of twisted thoughts and confusion.</p><p>\u201cThanks for today,\u201d Gavin said, pausing in front of the brownstone.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. It was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d He repeated the word, eyeing her peculiarly. \u201cNothing more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I had a wonderful time, and I do like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you did. It\u2019s just me, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He let out a sudden, abrupt laugh that startled her. \u201cAre you giving me the \u2018it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2019 line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, yes. It\u2019s true, though. You\u2019re really nice, and you have a great personality, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they say about ugly people,\u201d he deadpanned.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s true. And you\u2019re not ugly. You\u2019re handsome.\u201d She felt the blush rise to her cheeks at the admission. \u201cVery handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what is it?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at their still connected hands. \u201cThere\u2019s no spark. No electricity. No lightning.\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in his eyes then, his face softening as he let go of her hand. \u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cNo harm done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>He smiled genuinely. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did have fun, though,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he said, taking a step back as he shoved his hands in his pocket. \u201cI should be going. Have a good one.\u201d</p><p>He walked away without another word, jogging across the street and disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>Monday came. Haven stepped out of her art building at precisely one o\u2019clock and looked up to see Gavin leaning against the wall. They shared warm smiles and he strolled beside her to the library like usual, conversation flowing easy.</p><p>Wednesday he was there again, as he was on Friday. But the following week, when she walked out of her painting class, the sidewalk was vacant. For the first time in weeks . . . months . . . Gavin wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>She waited for a few minutes, lingering along the side of the building, before making the journey alone.</p><p>Days passed, then weeks, with no sign of Gavin. What started as confusion quickly grew into frustration before finally morphing into concern. Had something happened to him? Was he okay?</p><p>One Friday afternoon, instead of heading to the library, she made the trek to the construction site. She stopped near the corner when she reached it, remaining on the old cracked sidewalk, her eyes scanning the property. They had made little progress from what she could tell, a few more levels of metal beams erected, but it was still no more than a fractured shell. Workers swarmed the grounds, a sea of yellow hard hats in the distance, bobbing and moving like rubber ducks in the water.</p><p>Her attention shifted to the trailer as the door flew open and Gavin appeared in the doorway. A group of guys greeted him when he stepped outside. He joined them, sipping on a bottle of water as he sat on the trailer steps, laughing.</p><p>Relief washed through her instantly before a tinge of hurt bubbled up. He appeared to be more than okay. Happy, even.</p><p>Haven stood there for a minute before turning away. She knew it then, could feel it in her gut, the concern and frustration fading right back to utter confusion. Their friendship was no more, tossed away haphazardly like it no longer meant anything . . . if it ever even did.</p><p>34</p><p>Intuition.</p><p>It was something Haven relied on since she was a child, living on the isolated ranch in the long-forgotten town of Blackburn. It had kept her out of trouble, warning her when something was not quite right. It was a sensation along her skin, a twisting in her gut that set her on edge. Whether it was coyotes prowling in the night or monsters lurking in the shadows, she had always sensed when something\u2014or someone\u2014was there who shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>She could remember only a handful of times when her intuition failed her. The afternoon in Dr. DeMarco\u2019s bedroom had been once, when he had cornered her after she touched his gun. The warning signs had gone up too late. He had caught her red-handed, vulnerable and alone.</p><p>It had happened another time, too, years earlier when she had been a small girl. Trudging along after her mama in the greenhouse along the side of the property, boredom nagged at her as Miranda was busy at work. She was at that age where she still didn\u2019t understand the reality of her existence, the dreamer inside of her still alive, na\u00efve and innocent.</p><p>\u201cCan I go see Chloe?\u201d she had asked, tugging on the back of her mama\u2019s shirt to get her attention. The cool air from an air conditioner blew on them from behind, stirring her filthy white summer dress.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d her mama said, not taking her eyes off the rows of plants. \u201cYou should stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it in here,\u201d she said, scrunching up her nose. \u201cIt smells funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does. It\u2019s cold, too. See!\u201d She held out her arm to show her the chill bumps covering her tanned skin, even though her mama wasn\u2019t looking. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too bright. My eyes hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just full of complaints today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all true!\u201d Haven said. \u201cCan I go? I promise I\u2019ll be good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll be good. I just . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease? Chloe\u2019s my best friend!\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Haven ran from the greenhouse, hearing her mama call after her to be careful, but she was too excited to respond. She hadn\u2019t seen Chloe in more than five sunsets and missed her, but her mama said it was too dangerous for them to visit a lot.</p><p>Haven looked around when she got outside, making sure no one was there, before running across the yard as fast as her legs would go. She slowed when she got to the building on the other side of the house, right beside the stables that she and her mama stayed in. The building was gray, like a big metal house, and she quietly tiptoed to the back, where a bunch of cages were lined up against it.</p><p>\u201cChloe!\u201d she called, seeing her right away in the first cage. She jumped up as soon as Haven said her name, looking as excited as she felt inside. \u201cI missed you!\u201d</p><p>She started crying out and Haven ran over to her, shushing her. \u201cYou have to be quiet before they hear!\u201d</p><p>Haven got down on her knees, reaching her hand through the links in the cage. \u201cMama\u2019s working in the greenhouse again,\u201d she told her. \u201cMaster\u2019s crop is sick and he told Mama she better fix it, but I don\u2019t think she knows how. She asked me if it looked like she had a green thumb, but when I tried to look at her thumb she told me I was being silly. So I don\u2019t know if she does.\u201d</p><p>Chloe just stared at her. Haven guessed she didn\u2019t know, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh and someone came here yesterday! I don\u2019t know who, because Mama made me stay away. She said it was for my own good, but what if it was my friend?\u201d</p><p>Chloe yelped. \u201cMy other friend,\u201d Haven said quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re still my bestest friend, but I have another friend that lives out in the world. Mama says the world is big. Did you know that? She says there are bunches and bunches of people out there, and there are so many houses! Like, bajillions of them!\u201d</p><p>She held her arms out wide to show her how many. Chloe got excited, jumping up and down and making noise. She quickly dropped her arms, putting her finger against her lips. \u201cShhhh, quiet! If someone hears you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d</p> <p>It felt like all the blood in Haven\u2019s body froze. She jumped up and turned around, wanting to hide, but Frankie was there. He had her cornered.</p><p>She stood like a statue, stubbornly, childishly hoping she would disappear and he wouldn\u2019t see her anymore. He would go away and forget she existed again. She tried to count in her head, like her mama taught her to do when she was scared, but she got stuck after six, and he was looking at her too hard.</p><p>Haven took a big step to the side, thinking she could escape, but it didn\u2019t work. His eyes widened as he shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t run, girl.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t run. She stood like a statue again.</p><p>He walked over and bent down, reaching his hand in the cage, snapping his finger. Chloe came right to him, whining for attention as he rubbed her head.</p> <p>\u201cDo you like my beagle?\u201d he asked, looking at Haven.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what a beagle was but she nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl, makes a good hunting dog.\u201d He patted Chloe on top of the head once more before standing back up. \u201cDo you have a name for her?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me it?\u201d</p><p>Another nod. She didn\u2019t know what else to do.</p> <p>He laughed at her muteness, and Haven squeezed her eyes shut tight when his hand came toward her. She braced herself for the hit, for the fingers digging in her flesh, the scratches and bruises, but none of it came. Instead, he patted her on the head like he had done Chloe. His hand was heavy, but it didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to be more careful, kid,\u201d he said, still laughing to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s never good when the likes of me can sneak up on somebody like you.\u201d</p><p>It was then, as Frankie sauntered away, that Haven felt the telltale signs of her intuition striking, warning her when it was already too late.</p><p>And years later, as she sat in a booth in the back of a small diner, sipping a cup of black coffee as Kelsey stabbed at a plate of scrambled eggs, she felt it stirring yet again. It started with a prickle, a tickle across her taut skin, before the tiny hairs at the nape of her neck stood on end. She ignored it at first, trying to pay attention to Kelsey, but the sensation just grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>\u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d Kelsey asked, pointing her fork at Haven.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Haven said, absently rubbing her neck. \u201cWhat did you say again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a road trip.\u201d</p><p>Brow furrowed, Haven stared at her friend. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a road trip,\u201d Kelsey repeated for what was likely the third time. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything else to do this summer, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, well . . .\u201d Haven hesitated. Road trip? \u201cI kind of thought I\u2019d just stay around here this summer and take a few extra classes. You know, get ahead.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey dramatically rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, come on. School will be here when we get back. It\u2019s been a long year, and we deserve a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, think about it.\u201d Kelsey threw her fork down and stood up, tossing some cash down on the table. \u201cWe can leave after the Novak Gala.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Haven said, drinking the rest of her coffee before setting the cup aside. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>She had no intention of thinking about it, no intention of leaving New York.</p><p>The two of them left the diner, Kelsey once again babbling as they walked side by side toward the school. Haven was tense, her eyes darting around as they passed through crowds, surveying faces, analyzing looks. She kept peering over her shoulder, but she wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>What she was sure of, though, was the twisting in her gut, her intuition telling her that someone\u2014or something\u2014was there that shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cExplain it to me again.\u201d</p><p>Haven ignored Kelsey, acting as if her friend hadn\u2019t spoken as she studied the canvas in front of her. The fresh paint glistened under the fluorescent lights of the art studio, the vast array of colors weaving together like a tangled rainbow.</p><p>Abstract art\u2014Haven was still trying to get the hang of it.</p><p>\u201cDoes this look okay?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cIt looks fine,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cNow explain it to me again.\u201d</p><p>Haven sighed. \u201cWe went out, it was nice, but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Haven confirmed, still staring at the canvas. \u201cAre you sure this is okay? Does it make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s abstract. It\u2019s not supposed to make sense.\u201d Kelsey snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t get why you and Gavin can\u2019t be friends. So there\u2019s no spark, but you were totally friends before, right? What changed?\u201d</p><p>Haven sighed. She didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. They had been talking about it for weeks. \u201cI guess it was all or nothing with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Kelsey argued. \u201cHe\u2019s not that kind of man.\u201d</p><p>Haven rolled her eyes. \u201cYou hardly knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>Silence permeated the studio. Did she know him? He worked at the construction site. Family business, he had said, but Haven knew nothing about his family. In fact, she knew little more than his name: Gavin something-or-other. She had heard his last name before, but she couldn\u2019t recall it.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Haven said finally. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to happen. People come into our lives for a reason, so I have to believe there was a point to it somewhere, but it wasn\u2019t for us to be friends, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Setting down her paintbrush, Haven stepped back from the canvas. The spring Novak Gala was fast approaching, their submissions due by the end of the week, and Haven was struggling to create something she felt worthy of turning in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss seeing his face around,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cTalk about good looking!\u201d</p><p>Haven laughed. \u201cIf you like him so much, go ask him out.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, Kelsey fervently shook her head. \u201cNo way. I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you, duh,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s breaking the friendship code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. He\u2019s a really great guy. Funny. Nice. You could definitely do worse. Actually, you have done worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really liked him.\u201d A statement, not a question.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why? Really?\u201d</p><p>Haven half shrugged, half shook her head. \u201cThere was nothing there.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s expression softened. \u201cYour ex.\u201d</p><p>Carmine. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you felt no spark with Gavin. You had it with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Haven thought that over, remembering the chemistry she had felt with Carmine. There had been electricity, so much he made her glow. The thought of never having that again, having to live her life with nothing but the memory of the way she had felt, troubled her. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible to feel it more than once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI feel it every time a guy so much as looks at me these days.\u201d</p><p>Haven laughed.</p><p>\u201cOr . . .\u201d Kelsey took a few steps toward her, scanning the colorful painting. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ve never really felt it at all, and you\u2019re just one of the lucky ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrado Moretti is notorious. They call him the Kevlar Killer on the streets, insinuating he\u2019s bulletproof, untouchable, and maybe out there he is, but not in here. Here we seek the truth. Here we get justice. And justice, today, would be a guilty verdict. The defendant is a murderer, a liar, and a thief. Nobody is safe with him roaming free. We have proven he belongs to an organization that prides itself on killing, an organization that advances people for hurting others. What kind of organization does that? An immoral one. An illegal one. A dangerous one.\u201d</p><p>The prosecutor babbled on and on as Corrado sat still in the hard chair, waiting. The eight-week trial was finally coming to an end with closing statements. It would soon be over and time to move on.</p><p>Or so he hoped.</p><p>When it was their turn, Mr. Borza stood and let out a bitter laugh. \u201cThe Kevlar Killer. It should be noted the media invented that nickname to sell papers. Sensationalized, to make money off an innocent man. The only reputation my client really has is for being a savvy businessman, a family man. His criminal record is clean. The government spent millions of dollars and thousands of man hours digging into every aspect of his life for years, trying to find something big, something scandalous, and the most they got was a bunch of heresy from convicted criminals looking for a way out of jail and a potentially unpaid tax bill, for which\u2014if it makes them feel better\u2014Mr. Moretti will write a check today. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Corrado tuned his lawyer out as he glanced around the courtroom, still banking on juror number six to come through for him. Mr. Borza kept it short and sweet, and the judge instructed the jury, sending them to the back to deliberate.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you expect it to take?\u201d Corrado asked after court was in recess.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to tell,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf they come back today, I\u2019d say it\u2019s good news. But honestly, Mr. Moretti? If they\u2019re out more than forty-eight hours, I\u2019d start praying for a hung jury.\u201d</p><p>Forty-eight hours came and went with nothing. Three days passed, then four. Corrado remained locked away at MCC, outfitted once again in an oversize orange jumpsuit. Warm weather had somehow crept up on them, the prison sweltering as the faulty air conditioner kept breaking down. The stench of stale sweat hung in the sticky air, clinging to everything its vileness could touch.</p><p>Corrado\u2019s patience dwindled. Every time footsteps approached his tiny cell, he stood at attention, waiting for them to deliver some news.</p><p>None came.</p><p>After a week, the jury sent a note claiming they were deadlocked and couldn\u2019t agree, but the judge sent them back to deliberations, ordering them to give it a few more days. While a hung jury was certainly better than a guilty verdict, he wasn\u2019t as excited at the prospect as his lawyer. A mistrial meant another trial. Another jury. More time away from his life . . . his wife.</p><p>Twenty-four hours later, Corrado was lying on the bunk in his cell when heavy footsteps slowly approached the door. He got up and eyed the door, hoping against hope it was finally over.</p><p>\u201cMail call,\u201d the guy hollered, opening the slot in the door and dropping in an envelope. Corrado snatched it off the floor. Another false alarm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sighing, he eyed the ripped open envelope with the sketchy address, surprised yet again that it passed security. He pulled out the greeting card, eyeing the photo on the front. Corrado knew little to nothing about art, but even he could recognize the painting The Scream.</p><p>Hope your day is a scream the card read, sloppy handwriting under the typed message: I scream, you scream, we all scream . . . until somebody hears.</p><p>Corrado stared at the message, reading it again and again. He was so busy deciphering the short message that someone managed to sneak up on him.</p><p>\u201cMoretti.\u201d</p> <p>Corrado looked over, eyeing the correctional officer. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow time.\u201d He smirked. \u201cThe jury came back with a verdict.\u201d</p><p>Haven darted across the busy New York street, long wavy hair flowing behind her as her feet zealously carried her down the block. Despite her best effort, she repeatedly knocked into others, elbows jabbing and shoulders bumping as she flew past.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered, breathing heavily as she ran along the sidewalk, heading straight for her brownstone apartment. The white envelope crumpled in her hand as she fisted it, making sure not to lose her grip.</p><p>Once she made it home, she bolted inside, no hesitation in her steps as she bypassed her door. She frantically took the stairs two at a time, heading straight for Kelsey\u2019s apartment on the second floor.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t bother to knock in her haste. Grabbing the knob, she shoved open Kelsey\u2019s front door. \u201cKelsey, you won\u2019t belie\u2014Oh, God!\u201d</p><p>Startled yelps echoed through the living room. Haven shielded her eyes and quickly swung around as Kelsey and a male friend fumbled for their clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Haven\u2019s cheeks turned scarlet and warm from embarrassment. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize, well, you know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cWe\u2019re dressed now.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Haven turned back around, tentatively peeking through her hands at them. \u201cI should\u2019ve knocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Kelsey stood as she motioned toward the guy. \u201cYou remember Fred, right? The architect?\u201d</p> <p>Haven eyed the tall man peculiarly, taking in his short blond hair and blue eyes. She didn\u2019t remember him at all, but Haven politely smiled and nodded anyway. \u201cSure. It\u2019s nice to see you again, Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I should be going.\u201d</p><p>He kissed Kelsey\u2019s cheek before strolling past and disappearing downstairs. Haven stood there for a moment, watching her friend as she stared at the now empty doorway. \u201cHe\u2019s hot, right?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cI think he might actually be the one.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDid you feel it? The spark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I felt it all right.\u201d Kelsey laughed, turning her attention to Haven. \u201cAnyway, what\u2019s up? Why the speedy entrance?\u201d</p><p>All thoughts of the awkward incident evaporated as Haven\u2019s face lit up with excitement. She held up the crinkled white envelope, waving it frantically at her friend. \u201cI did it! I got in!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cGot in where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Novak Gala,\u201d Haven declared. \u201cMiss Michaels pulled me aside in the hallway. I came in thirteenth! They\u2019re going to display my painting!\u201d</p> <p>Kelsey let out a sudden shriek. \u201cNo way! That\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>The two of them jumped around and squealed, hugging as they celebrated the news. Tears sprung to Haven\u2019s eyes, overwhelming elation running through her veins. She had done it. Out of three thousand entries, she had made the cut.</p><p>\u201cThis is so crazy,\u201d Kelsey said, pulling away. \u201cWe have so much to do now! We need to get you a dress and shoes. You\u2019ll need hair and makeup.\u201d</p><p>She blanched. A dress? High heels? A makeover?</p><p>\u201cOh, oh oh! And a date! We have to get you a date!\u201d</p><p>Haven blinked rapidly. \u201cA date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! You get to bring guests, right? You can\u2019t go alone!\u201d</p><p>Reaching into the envelope, Haven pulled out the letter and unfolded it, eyeing the three wrinkly tickets tucked inside. She put hers back into the envelope and held the other two out to her friend. \u201cI want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake them,\u201d Haven insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so great to me. You took me home on Christmas and introduced me to your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be making that up to you, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Haven laughed. \u201cCome with me. And if Fred\u2019s the one, bring him, too.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey hesitated before taking the two tickets. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d Smiling, Haven took a step back toward the door. \u201cInvite whoever you want. My thanks to you for being such a great friend.\u201d</p><p>Haven started out of the apartment, hearing Kelsey yell after her as she descended the stairs. \u201cFine, but you\u2019re still getting a dress! Don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting out of that one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs to count one, participating in the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, we the jury find the defendant, Corrado Alphonse Moretti . . .\u201d There was a pause, one that seemed to stretch for eternity, before the fateful words were read. \u201c. . . Not guilty.\u201d</p><p>The packed courtroom erupted in noise, a few elated cheers mixing with the horrified shouts of disbelief from onlookers. Cameras flashed from the media, recording the moment, as the judge feverishly banged his gavel for silence.</p><p>Count after count was read, all of them with the same result: not guilty, not guilty, not guilty. Corrado remained still as he stood at the defendant\u2019s table, the only one in the room not reacting emotionally. He felt it, though, churning in the pit of his heavy stomach, evident in the cold sweat formed along his back. It was the only time he had ever been unsure of a verdict before it was read. For the first time in his life, he had had a moment where he actually wondered if it could be the end for him.</p><p>And that moment to Corrado, as he contemplated his uncertain future, was worse than facing death. Death he could accept . . . being a caged animal he couldn\u2019t. He would never let it show, though. He exuded nothing but total confidence, bordering on callous conceit.</p><p>When the jury finished, the judge ruled for Corrado\u2019s immediate release. Corrado stood after the final bang of the gavel, ignoring the incessant shouting and name-calling from the gallery as he shook Mr. Borza\u2019s hand. He turned then, seeking out his wife in the crowd, and found her in the back, standing all alone and smiling.</p><p>Corrado\u2019s chest swelled. It felt like forever since he had seen her look happy.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Mr. Markson said, his voice laced with bitterness. \u201cI\u2019m curious how you did it this time. Intimidation? Extortion? Plain ole bribery?\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cI did none of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder, then?\u201d The prosecutor raised his eyebrow in challenge. \u201cDid you kill your own family, Mr. Moretti? Is that what happened to Vincent DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>Corrado stared at the man, keeping his expression blank. If he only knew the depth of that question . . .</p><p>\u201cThe jury just saw through you,\u201d he responded coolly. \u201cYou had no case. You should work on that, you know. You don\u2019t seem to be very good at your job.\u201d</p><p>The prosecutor\u2019s posture stiffened. \u201cI am good at my job. The problem is people like you have absolutely no respect for it. You have no respect for the law. But you\u2019ll get what\u2019s coming to you someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>The prosecutor stormed away as Corrado addressed his lawyer. \u201cJuror number six . . . I want you to find out who she is.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza blanched. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I owe my freedom to her.\u201d</p><p>Corrado turned to the crowd of spectators, watching his wife make her way toward him. He opened his arms, pulling her to him in a tight embrace. Her body shook with happy cries as he kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cSix months away from you was far too long, bellissima,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI promise it\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d</p><p>35</p><p>The gallery was packed, hardly a foot of space between the people inside. Haven stood outside the building, gazing through the sheet of thick glass that separated her from the Novak Gala. Every time the door opened, she could hear the soft melody of classical music filter out into the street, fading away into the darkness as soon as the door closed again. She could see the patrons smiling and laughing, socializing as they admired the artwork, comfortable in their surroundings, while Haven was anything but.</p><p>Nervous, she tugged at her dress, feeling ridiculously out of place and awkward in a pair of high heels. Her heart hammered in her chest, pounding so hard she could feel it clogging her throat, the only thing, she feared, keeping her from throwing up. She regretted telling Kelsey she would meet her there, afraid with every step she took that she would fall flat on her face.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to steady herself, she opened the gallery door, stepping inside and holding out her ticket to the man working. He took it with a smile, nothing but warmth in his eyes as he gazed at her, no sign he felt she didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said politely, motioning toward a guest book to the right. \u201cPlease sign in and enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, stepping to the side and grabbing the pen before she scribbled on the first blank line: Hayden Antoinette. She gazed at it for a moment, her smile fading a bit, but pushed the sadness away. She knew who she truly was, even if nobody else did.</p><p>The lighting was warm and the atmosphere welcoming. Haven strolled through the crowd, mostly keeping her head down, her eyes flickering periodically to the paintings on the wall. It wasn\u2019t until she came to the back of the gallery that she spotted hers, the familiarity stalling her footsteps immediately. She stared at it with wide eyes, her initials scribbled in the corner of the canvas.</p><p>It was surreal. In that moment, Haven had to pinch herself.</p><p>I had a dream, Carmine had said on their last night together. You made a painting\u2014some abstract shit, I don\u2019t know\u2014but it was so good they hung it in a museum and raved about how talented you were. It was like you were the next fucking Picasso, tesoro.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a spectacular piece of work, isn\u2019t it?\u201d a man asked, pausing beside her as he gazed up at it. He squinted his eyes, studying it, analyzing the dark background tinged with white and tan, musical notes distorted by splatters of red. \u201cIt looks like a concert to me. Maybe the artist is also a musician.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled. He couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He walked away and Haven stood there, listening as a few others offered their unsolicited analysis, every one of them missing the mark. She was about to walk away, to stroll through the gallery and check out the other works, when a throat cleared behind her. \u201cI take it this is yours.\u201d</p><p>She spun around so fast at the sound of the familiar voice that she nearly lost her footing, staggering. Her eyes met a pair of blue ones. \u201cGavin? What are you doing here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged, stepping forward. \u201cKelsey invited me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It took a second for those words to sink in. \u201cOh! So you and her . . . I mean, you guys . . . ?\u201d She paused, brow furrowed. \u201cWhat happened to Fred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d Guys were always interested in Kelsey.</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess my interests are elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. He cocked an eyebrow at her playfully, and a warm blush rose to her cheeks. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed, turning from her to the painting. \u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, relaxing a bit as she gazed at it too. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet, studying it, before a smirk lifted the corner of his lips. \u201cSpark.\u201d</p><p>Nailed it right away.</p><p>The Gala carried on as Haven was showered with praise. She basked in it, sipping seltzer water and hanging out with Gavin, laughing and chatting the night away. Kelsey appeared at some point, briefly stopping her to say hello, but Haven barely noticed amidst the chaos. It was more than she had expected, receiving so much acclaim over something she had poured her soul into, and by the time the evening started winding down she felt as if she were floating on air.</p><p>It was toward the end of the evening when Gavin\u2019s phone rang, interrupting the tranquility. He pulled it out, silencing it. \u201cI have to get going. Work stuff.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he said genuinely. \u201cIt was nice seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he reached over and caressed her flushed cheek. \u201cSee you around, Haven.\u201d</p><p>Before she could come up with any words, he walked away. It wasn\u2019t until after he passed through the door that what he had said struck her. It sounded so natural coming from his lips, so casual, that she was lucky to have caught it at all.</p><p>Haven.</p><p>Coldness washed through her so fast she visibly trembled. Her eyes remained glued to the exit he had disappeared through as her mind frantically worked. Could she be mistaken? Had she misheard? Maybe he misspoke and didn\u2019t really know at all. She had never told him\u2014she was certain of that\u2014so she couldn\u2019t imagine where he would have heard her real name.</p><p>Trying to squelch her panic, she walked over to the guest book and flipped back through it, reading the countless names until she came to his: Gavin Amaro.</p><p>Her stomach dropped.</p> <p>She bolted straight for the door. Bursting out to the sidewalk, she took a deep breath of the fresh night air, her heart beating like wildfire in her chest.</p><p>She felt it then, the current running across her skin, jolting her spine and warning her. Intuition. Terror coated her like ice as she let out a shaky exhale, swinging around abruptly to face whoever was there.</p><p>And in an instant, she nearly lost her balance in her high heels as she stared at a startlingly familiar face, so close she could reach out and touch it. She didn\u2019t, though. She couldn\u2019t move. She just stood there, completely still, as she whispered his name. \u201cDr. DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello there.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s greeting hung in the warm air around them, lost somewhere between his lips and her ears. She gaped at him, her face a sheet of white like she had seen a ghost, as she stood in the middle of the sidewalk, wobbling in a pair of high heels. \u201cDr. DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>He let out an awkward chuckle when she said his name for the second time. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in disbelief, cautiously surveying their surroundings as she took a step toward him. \u201cIs something wrong? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, anxiously rubbing the back of his stiff neck as someone stepped out of the gallery behind her. He averted his gaze, turning slightly so he was angled away until they disappeared down the street.</p><p>Paranoid, maybe, but he had good reason to be.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, taking yet another step toward him. \u201cYou seem . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSketchy?\u201d he guessed when she trailed off.</p><p>\u201cMore like nervous,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Nervous. That was putting it mildly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he assured her, giving her a smile, hoping it would ease her concerns. \u201cDo you think we can go somewhere to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sure.\u201d Haven glanced briefly behind her at the art gallery before starting toward him. She only made it a few steps before kicking off her shoes and carrying them. She nodded at him, smiling sheepishly, as they started down the street. They walked in silence, her eyes darting to him periodically as if still in disbelief, while he kept his head down, monitoring their surroundings.</p><p>It only took a few minutes for them to reach their destination. Haven pulled out a set of keys and unlocked the front door of an apartment. Vincent ducked around her, not waiting for an invitation, and exhaled with relief once he was safely away from the public street.</p><p>\u201cThis is your place?\u201d he asked, glancing around the one-bedroom apartment he\u2019d stepped into. This is the place Corrado set her up in? \u201cIt\u2019s kind of small, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I mean, it\u2019s bigger than the horse stall I grew up in.\u201d</p><p>Touch\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cSo was there something you wanted to talk about?\u201d she asked, nervously sitting in a chair in the living room. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Vincent strolled over, taking a seat in the center of her couch. \u201cI was actually hoping you would tell me about your kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>As if by some miracle, Haven managed to turn even paler. \u201cMy kidnapping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, of course, but I just wondered if you could tell me who you remembered seeing there.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, her forehead scrunching up in concentration. \u201cYou already know. I mean, they were there when . . . well, when you came for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but I\u2019d like to hear it from you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to know what you remember.\u201d</p><p>She let out a deep sigh as her gaze drifted to her hands in her lap. He could tell she didn\u2019t want to talk about it and nearly felt ashamed for bringing it up to her, but it was important he heard it from her. Very important. \u201cNunzio was there. That guy Ivan was in charge. There were some other men, but I don\u2019t know their names. Mostly Russians. And the girls . . . the nurse showed up, and then there was the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other one?\u201d</p><p>Haven hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t remember her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d Vincent rested his elbows on his thighs, leaning forward to look at her pointedly. \u201cWho else was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust people who don\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf they ever did.\u201d</p><p>Vincent quietly processed that, the meaning sinking in as he thought back to the images he had seen in Haven\u2019s notebook. The memory stung. \u201cMaura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Haven whispered. \u201cAnd my mama. And Number 33.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers, curiosity brewing inside of him. \u201cNumber 33?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl I saw at one of those places . . . she was for sale. She was number 33.\u201d</p><p>Vincent frowned when it struck him what she meant. \u201cAn auction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Frankie took me as a kid.\u201d</p><p>Sickness stirred Vincent\u2019s stomach. He never knew. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it was to teach me a lesson,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe girl tried to escape, so well . . . Frankie killed her. He said it was what happened when people like me forget their place. It\u2019s why, when you said you were going to remind me of my place that day, I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>Vincent closed his eyes when she trailed off. He could still remember the look on her face when she came around that afternoon, waking up handcuffed to the post of her bed. \u201cPlease,\u201d she had whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><p>Before Vincent could come up with words, Haven spoke again. \u201cI know they weren\u2019t really there, but I saw them in the warehouse. They talked to me. They gave me the strength to hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there anyone else?\u201d Vincent asked. \u201cMaybe someone less desirable, like a . . . monster?\u201d</p><p>Haven remained still, staring at him, before softly whispering, \u201cCarlo.\u201d</p><p>Vincent was stunned. \u201cYou know his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard Frankie say it the day of the auction,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe wanted my master to sell me to him. Terrified me. I thought he\u2019d do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he still taunted me over the years. I\u2019d see him when he came to Blackburn. He\u2019d stand there and stare at me. Just stare. He always hurt my mama. He always . . .\u201d She paused, angry tears glistening from her eyes. \u201cHe did things to her, but never me. He just watched me all the time, like he was waiting for when the time was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you saw him when you were in the warehouse?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, wiping her eyes as a tear fell down her cheek. \u201cI imagined him, I guess. Standing over me, just staring as usual, like the time still wasn\u2019t right. He looked older, but it was definitely him. I\u2019d never forget that face.\u201d</p><p>Haven let out a bitter laugh while Vincent remained stoic. He hadn\u2019t wanted to believe it, but something about her words made him wonder if she hadn\u2019t imagined it at all.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI just needed to hear you confirm it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Haven eyed him peculiarly. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay, Dr. DeMarco? Won\u2019t the people who monitor you track me here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have my ankle monitor on anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cIs your trial over?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, realizing at that moment how cut off she was from everything. He had been following her for weeks, gathering the courage to approach her, unsure how she would react to a wanted man showing up at her doorstep . . . a man most people suspected to be dead. But she didn\u2019t even know. She knew nothing.</p><p>Standing, Vincent stretched his aching back. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet, but it will be soon. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I should be going. I\u2019ve taken up enough of your time.\u201d</p><p>Haven walked him to the door, the two of them silently hesitating in the foyer. There was so much Vincent still felt he needed to say, the words stuck on the tip of his tongue. He nearly managed to force them out, overpowering his lingering pride and overabundance of shame, when the front door to the brownstone thrust open behind them. A female\u2019s laughter carried through the downstairs.</p><p>Vincent immediately dropped his head, his eyes darting to the girl. She looked at him with surprise, and familiarity struck Vincent as he vaguely recognized her.</p><p>Senator Brolin\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d she said, a grin lighting up her face. \u201cAnother one?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vincent didn\u2019t stick around to find out what she meant by that.</p><p>36</p><p>The first weekend in June, Carmine received a call from Salvatore about a celebration for Corrado\u2019s exoneration. He begrudgingly got dressed that Saturday night and drove to Salvatore\u2019s house at dusk, parking his car toward the back before hesitantly making his way to the front door. He pressed the doorbell and Abby appeared, seemingly relieved when she saw Carmine there.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said when she ushered him inside. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled softly, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cFine. You, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with these motherfuckers, so I\u2019m obviously not doing that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she said shyly, offering to take his coat. \u201cYou talk to me like I\u2019m a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a person, Abby. They\u2019re just too nasty to see it.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, surprised by his candid response, before slinking away to do her work. Carmine headed for the den when someone called his name, and he turned, his blood running cold the second his eyes came into contact with Carlo\u2019s. The man smirked as he strolled toward Carmine. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky your godfather didn\u2019t overhear that exchange. Something tells me he wouldn\u2019t be amused.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine stared back as he fought to control his temper at the man\u2019s smug expression. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with saying hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said much more than hello, boy.\u201d</p><p>Carlo looked as though he was going to say something else when Corrado walked over and interrupted. \u201cCarlo, Carmine. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just reminding young DeMarco that he should be mindful of what he says and who he talks to,\u201d Carlo said. \u201cIf he isn\u2019t careful, someone might get the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was about to say he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong when Corrado cut him off. \u201cCarmine\u2019s sarcastic mouth is notorious. I think at this point people would get the wrong impression if he didn\u2019t have a snide remark here or there.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine looked at Corrado with shock, not expecting his defense.</p><p>Carlo laughed bitterly. \u201cJust because it\u2019s expected doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s acceptable. He needs to learn respect. He was talking to that slave and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespect?\u201d Corrado snapped. \u201cAnd I suppose you think you could teach it to him after speaking like that in his presence? You\u2019re well aware of his mother\u2019s background, and you want to speak about respect? Maybe you need to learn some yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve earned my place here\u2014I\u2019ve put my time in,\u201d Carlo said, anger clouding his face. \u201cI\u2019ve proven myself and he hasn\u2019t. He needs to mind his superiors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d Corrado said pointedly. \u201cOr have you forgotten I\u2019m your superior? You know protocol, or have you forgotten that as well? Carmine\u2019s my soldier\u2014if you have an issue with him, you air your grievance with me.\u201d</p><p>Carlo narrowed his eyes. Corrado had struck a nerve. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is maybe he shouldn\u2019t mouth off so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you the first time, but I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d want to create a scene over it,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious. So he\u2019s mouthy? It\u2019s not like he murdered your family, Carlo.\u201d</p><p>Carmine froze when those bitter words came from his uncle\u2019s lips. Carlo looked like a deer caught in headlights as Corrado stared at him with an eyebrow cocked, waiting a response that never came.</p> <p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Salvatore said, pausing between them, his expression stone cold serious. \u201cPerhaps we should have a sit-down later to clear the air, but for now we celebrate. Go enjoy yourselves, have a drink, get to know one of the beautiful ladies here.\u201d</p><p>Corrado nodded obediently. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Carlo echoed his words and walked off when Salvatore excused himself, the situation diffused for the time being.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you said, but he was right,\u201d Corrado said once they were alone. \u201cYou do need to learn to watch your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve worn a suit, too,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look like a slob.\u201d</p><p>Carmine glanced down at himself. He had on a long-sleeved button-up shirt and slacks\u2014he had just nixed the tie. It wasn\u2019t as if he had strolled in wearing faded jeans and a hoodie.</p><p>He wished he had, though. That way if he was forced to be miserable, at least he would be comfortable.</p><p>He spent the next two hours making small talk with other made men and associates, getting to know the families of the ones brazen enough to bring them around such a heartless crowd. Carmine pretended to care, smiling and entertaining curious questions about his father\u2019s whereabouts (No, I haven\u2019t heard from him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just lying low.); playing the part of Principe, grandson of Antonio (Yes, my grandfather was a God among men, I hope to be just like him someday.). But in his mind he was counting down the time until he could leave (Two more fucking hours. You\u2019re already halfway there.).</p><p>For a group that prided themselves on silence and honor, they gossiped more than a group of catty high school bitches. It wasn\u2019t Carmine\u2019s first mandatory gathering, but it was certainly the most uncomfortable one. His father was on the lam and everyone was well aware that the expiration date on Vincent DeMarco\u2019s life had already passed.</p><p>Carmine drank heavily as the time slipped away, painfully aware as Corrado watched him from across the room. He had warned him before never to drink at these things, but he couldn\u2019t help it. The alcohol seeping into his bloodstream was the only thing keeping him from jumping out of his own skin.</p><p>The crowd thinned eventually, associates and soldiers clearing out while the ones at the top of the chain of command gathered in the den. Carmine took the shift in atmosphere as his cue that the night was finally over. At a little after nine, he strolled over to Corrado, his body relaxing naturally as relief set in. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cGo home. Sober up.\u201d</p><p>Carmine turned and mock saluted his uncle behind his back as Corrado went into the den. Carmine started for the door, but Salvatore\u2019s shrill voice stopped him halfway there. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going, Principe?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at him apprehensively. \u201cHome, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Salvatore motioned in the direction of the den. \u201cJoin us.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sighed, not wanting to be there any longer. \u201cI\u2019d really rather just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a request,\u201d Sal said, cutting him off as he walked away.</p><p>Carmine cursed under his breath, catching a look of alarm on Corrado\u2019s face the moment he stepped in the den. \u201cI thought you were leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, he was, but I requested he stick around,\u201d Salvatore chimed in, taking his usual seat. He motioned toward an empty chair beside him and Carmine slid into it, running his hand nervously through his hair. There were a dozen men in the room besides him, but he was the only low-ranked soldier present. These gatherings were always invitation only, and Carmine had appreciated the fact that he had never been invited to stay for one until that moment.</p><p>The men talked for a while about things that didn\u2019t matter, like baseball teams and brands of liquor, while Carmine sat quietly, drinking more to calm the flare of his nerves. He wasn\u2019t sure how long they had been sitting there when they finally delved into business\u2014who owed money, who wasn\u2019t producing enough, who had potential, and who they frankly were sick of dealing with. The ones in the last category were immediately written off, no questions asked, no objections. There was no regard for their families or their obligations. Intentions didn\u2019t matter\u2014they had been judged without having a chance to defend themselves.</p><p>It made Carmine sick to know that someday it could be him, sentenced to die callously, his murder plotted casually like they were deciding something as petty as preferable brands of alcohol.</p><p>\u201cDismember him,\u201d someone said. \u201cTake him apart piece by piece, and then incinerate the leftovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo messy,\u201d someone else chimed in. \u201cSlip something in his food. Make it look like a heart attack. Clean and easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cowardly! You\u2019re better off putting a bomb in their car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bullshit! And a bomb isn\u2019t cowardly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019ll send everyone a message when the whole street blows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019ll send them a message, all right . . . it\u2019ll probably send some of his neighbors to the hospital, too. They didn\u2019t do shit to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Like bystanders haven\u2019t been hurt before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they got kids. We don\u2019t fucking hurt kids, not if we can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust make him go missing,\u201d someone suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s not cowardly\u2014it\u2019s smart. The fact is he\u2019s nobody. No reason for a scene. Just poof, be gone.\u201d</p><p>Somebody scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s all cowardly unless you make it personal. Ain\u2019t that right, Carlo? That\u2019s what you always say.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s eyes shot across the room to where the scarred man sat in the corner, quietly sipping from a glass of scotch. Carlo tipped his head at the man in confirmation. \u201cAlways look them in the eye so they know it\u2019s you, so you can see their fear. You want them to associate your face with death . . . that\u2019s how you know you\u2019re doing it right. Then when they understand, you do it quick\u2014blow their head off, shut them up with a gun in the mouth when they try to scream for help. There\u2019s nothing better. Always been my signature move.\u201d</p><p>Those words hit Carmine hard and sharp, striking at his insides ferociously when flashes of the night in the alley ran through his mind. The sound of his mother\u2019s terrified screams, the fear in her eyes as she somehow knew she was going to die. \u201cShut her up!\u201d a man yelled. \u201cDo it quick!\u201d Then there was nothing but the loud bang of the gunshot as the man shoved the pistol in her mouth and pulled the trigger, forever silencing her.</p><p>Carmine was on his feet before he even knew what he was doing, the liquor splashing from the glass he clutched and splattering on the floor. His sudden movement startled the others, conversation instantly ceasing as men jumped to their feet, trained to sense danger. Guns were drawn and a chorus of clicks echoed through the room as safeties were released, the weapons pointed at Carmine\u2019s head.</p><p>Tunnel vision fixed Carmine\u2019s gaze on Carlo. He remained in his chair, slouching casually as he swirled the scotch around in his glass, staring right back. His face was a mask of indifference, but his eyes told a much different story. There was a challenge in them. He dared Carmine to say something to him.</p><p>Seconds passed\u2014long, infinite seconds of tension and inner turmoil\u2014before Salvatore broke up the sudden standoff. \u201cGentlemen, this is unnecessary. We\u2019re all family here.\u201d</p><p>The men lowered their weapons at once, concealing them again as they retook their seats. Low grumbling vibrated the room, their words indiscernible, but hostility infused the air, smothering Carmine. They would have shot him easily, the simple flick of a finger stealing his life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He felt like he was going to throw up as that sunk in.</p><p>\u201cCarlo, Carmine,\u201d Sal said, looking between the two of them. \u201cOutside now.\u201d</p><p>Sal walked out but Carmine remained rooted to his spot for a moment, his eyes following Carlo as he sauntered from the room behind the boss. Carmine hesitantly followed them, knowing he had no choice, and the three took seats on some tan chairs on the outside patio beside the inground pool. Sal called for Abby to bring them drinks before dismissing her with a wave of the hand, ordering her to remain in her room for the rest of the evening.</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape Carmine\u2019s notice that Carlo\u2019s eyes followed the girl as she scampered away, his gaze that of a predator stalking its prey.</p> <p>Fucking sick.</p><p>When she was gone, Salvatore raised his eyebrows curiously. \u201cHow are things, Principe?\u201d</p><p>The question rubbed Carmine the wrong way. Just fucking peachy, thanks for asking. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Salvatore echoed, glancing between the men briefly before settling back on Carmine. \u201cAnd what\u2019s going on between the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing? I can feel the tension rolling off of you. You\u2019re hiding something. What happened earlier to cause the argument in my parlor?\u201d</p><p>Carmine said nothing. Regardless if he remained silent or told his side of it, he knew he would be on the losing end.</p><p>Salvatore realized he wasn\u2019t going to get an answer from him and turned to Carlo. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be more forthcoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just put off by young DeMarco\u2019s attitude,\u201d Carlo said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard someone speak so vulgar and disrespectfully.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore turned back to Carmine curiously, but before he could speak, unexpected laughter rang out beside them. The sound of it nearly made Carmine\u2019s heart stop. He quickly looked in the direction it had come from, in utter disbelief as his eyes fell upon his father. Vincent DeMarco stood about twenty feet away at the corner of the house, dressed from head to toe in all black. He wore a new Italian suit, which was covered by a long trench coat, sweeping at his ankles and exposing a pair of black dress shoes that shone under the moonlight. His dark hair was slicked back, his face freshly shaved.</p><p>\u201cNow Carlo, you know that\u2019s not true,\u201d Vincent said, taking a few steps toward them. \u201cYou act like this organization is filled with saints. My son\u2019s hardly the first to have a smart mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, Vincent,\u201d Salvatore said, confusion evident in his voice. His shoulders were tense, his expression hard as if chiseled in stone. It didn\u2019t happen often, but the Boss had been caught off guard. \u201cI was wondering if I\u2019d ever see you again.\u201d</p><p>None of them knew how to react. Carmine just stared at his father as Carlo placed his hand on his gun under the table.</p><p>\u201cYou had to have known we\u2019d see each other again, Sal. It would be rude of me to take permanent leave and not say good-bye to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Salvatore eyed him cautiously, desperate for the upper hand. \u201cCome, have a seat. We\u2019ll chat.\u201d</p><p>Vincent lingered, slowly shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine where I am.\u201d</p><p>Sal subtly shifted in his seat to get a better view. \u201cYou know, you\u2019ve been gone for a while now. I was worried something happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, honestly,\u201d Sal said. \u201cEspecially when you skipped out on the trial. I was deeply concerned what that meant for your future.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, yes, that. I figured there was no use going through the charade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised, Vincent. Disappointed, yes, but not surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you always did know me well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity I never really knew you, though. I thought I did, but I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Sal laughed, a tinge of nervousness to his forced chuckle. \u201cWhat you see is what you get with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish that were true,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI always thought you were a man of your word, a man who saw the world as black and white. I never realized how much you skirted in the gray area to suit your needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think such a ridiculous thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven Antonelli.\u201d</p><p>A gasp involuntarily flew from Carmine\u2019s lips at the sound of her name. Salvatore\u2019s gaze flickered to him, anger in his eyes, before his attention shifted right back to Vincent. \u201cWhat does that girl have to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore stared at Vincent with disbelief, but whether he was truly dumbfounded or just shocked at being called out wasn\u2019t clear. Carmine\u2019s heart beat rapidly as his eyes darted between the silent men. All of them were on edge, shoulders squared, poised for a fight.</p><p>\u201cGo inside, son,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak to your godfather alone.\u201d</p><p>Pushing his chair back, Carmine started to stand when Salvatore slammed his fists down on the table in front of them. \u201cStay where you are!\u201d</p><p>Carmine knew he couldn\u2019t disregard a direct order from the Boss. Glancing at his father, he shot him an apologetic look as he forced himself back into the chair.</p><p>Panic flared in Vincent\u2019s expression, and Carmine knew it then. Whatever was about to happen was not going to be good.</p><p>\u201cI still fail to see what the Antonelli child has to do with anything,\u201d Salvatore said, turning his attention back to Vincent. \u201cEnlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you aware she\u2019s an artist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less what she is,\u201d Sal said. \u201cShe\u2019s nothing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you know she\u2019s an artist,\u201d Vincent continued, ignoring his hostility. \u201cIn fact, you know a lot about her, more than you\u2019d ever admit, including the fact that she\u2019s not nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Sal said. \u201cShe\u2019ll never be anything more than a slave in my eyes, a worthless piece of flesh you idiots waste your life on. She\u2019s irrelevant in my world. She shouldn\u2019t even exist!\u201d</p><p>Carmine flinched as irritation flashed across his father\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it didn\u2019t make sense at the time,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI never understood why Frankie refused to give her up, why he wouldn\u2019t let her go when he wanted nothing to do with the girl. She was a burden, another mouth to feed, so why not take the cash to be rid of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was his granddaughter,\u201d Salvatore said pointedly. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t matter to him,\u201d Vincent retorted. \u201cHis son getting a slave pregnant would\u2019ve been a disgrace in his eyes, tainting his bloodline\u2014he would\u2019ve wanted to be rid of the child. So why did he not only keep her but kill over her, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want anyone to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what you told me.\u201d Vincent shook his head. \u201cI believed it for years because I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d lie to me and you told me you were sure. I slaughtered him and his wife, and then I put my gun to that girl\u2019s head as she slept and pulled the trigger, because you swore she was the reason my wife died. And that\u2019s exactly what you wanted, wasn\u2019t it? You used my grief to solve your problem, and it almost worked. If my gun hadn\u2019t jammed, I would\u2019ve killed everything there that breathed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to kill any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to! You knew exactly what I would do with the information you fed me, and you gave me just enough time to do it before calling me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve never ordered a hit on a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t! The men wouldn\u2019t have trusted you anymore if they even suspected you had anything to do with it. There would\u2019ve been a mutiny! But you knew how to push my buttons, how to get me to react. You wanted them all dead and you used me so you could keep your hands clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cWhy would I want them dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidence,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cNever leave anything behind if it can be linked to you. It\u2019s simple, something all of us know. The moment you realized your mistake, you wanted it disposed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat evidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl\u2019s bloodline.\u201d</p><p>Panic swept across Salvatore\u2019s face. Carmine stared at him in shock, realizing he wasn\u2019t surprised . . . he did know. Confusion rocked Carmine\u2019s brain, the knowledge nearly crippling him. The entire time, through it all, Salvatore knew they were related.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but I\u2019m still right,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cAll it took was a simple prick of a finger and a lifetime of secrets came spilling out in the blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once believed that. I thought you were as much a victim as her, but that changed when she was kidnapped. You wouldn\u2019t get involved because you knew why they took her and you wanted nothing to do with it! You were afraid they\u2019d expose you and you thought . . . you hoped . . . they\u2019d get rid of her. But they didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou were power hungry and had your own family murdered. You used to talk about how much family meant, and I actually pitied you because you didn\u2019t have anyone left! And the whole time it was your own fault!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you accuse me of that!\u201d Salvatore spat. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you for this!\u201d</p><p>The moment he spoke those words, Vincent reached into his coat and pulled out a gun, aiming it at Salvatore. Carmine jumped up, as did Carlo, knocking chairs over in haste, one flying into the shallow end of the pool. Salvatore sat still, unmoving, barely blinking. Carmine was frozen with fear as Carlo pulled his gun, aiming at Vincent.</p><p>\u201cYou had no idea thirty years later DNA testing would exist,\u201d he continued, keeping his eyes and gun trained on Salvatore. \u201cThat\u2019s the real reason he wouldn\u2019t sell me the girl . . . he was trying to protect you, and maybe even protect her in the process. When it got back to you that Maura was asking questions, you panicked, and that\u2019s when you set the plan in motion. You put the hit out on my wife to cover your tracks, and I never wanted to believe it. Never did I want to believe you\u2019d do that to me, that you\u2019d do that to my children.</p><p>\u201cHaven drew pictures after her kidnapping\u2014like I said, she\u2019s an artist\u2014and she drew one of Carlo. I denied it to myself, I denied it to my son, but there came a point where I couldn\u2019t deny it anymore. Your man\u2014your best friend\u2014had been there for it all!\u201d</p><p>Tears slid down Vincent\u2019s cheeks. Carlo yelled, denying it all, while Salvatore glanced around with fear. Carmine stared at his godfather with disgust.</p><p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d Sal said firmly, and he knew instantly what he wanted. He expected Carmine to follow his orders, to do what he had told him to do.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to my son!\u201d Vincent snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve hurt him enough! Tell me, when you had my wife killed, did you want him dead, too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course not!

God, how sick does a man have to be to make his own family slaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was supposed to have a good life!\u201d Salvatore spat, losing control of his temper as he reached for his gun. Carmine cursed and backed up a few steps, nearly tripping over a chair. \u201cFrankie begged me to let him have her, the fool! He begged me to let the child live! He\u2019s the one who failed! He treated her like crap! He let his son have his way with her! She would\u2019ve been better off dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you never went to Blackburn, why you always sent us?\u201d Vincent asked, no hesitation in his voice. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t look at her, knowing what you\u2019d done?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is that why you were so insistent on seeing Haven when you visited? Why you were elated Carmine fell in love with her, why you wanted him to vouch for her? You\u2019d finally be family again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought it was redemption! They were possessions to you! And you had the nerve to ask me if she\u2019d been worth it, if she was worth all the pain I went through, if she was worth everything I lost, and you\u2019d been the one to do it to me! Did you enjoy that? Did you get off having so much power over everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re delusional!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re disturbed! You\u2019re a traitor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you accuse me of that! You, who has been feeding information to the Feds? Tell me, Vincent, how does it feel to be a rat? How does it feel to break the oath you swore? How does it feel knowing you\u2019re going to die for it?\u201d</p><p>Vincent stood frozen for a second before a sinister smirk turned the corner of his lips. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>The bang of a gunshot ripped through the night air and Carmine recoiled, realizing his father had pulled the trigger. He covered himself defensively as Salvatore stumbled backward, the bullet ripping through his shoulder, and dropped his gun as his arm went limp. Flipping the patio table over, Salvatore ducked behind it as Carlo returned fire. Vincent shot again, hitting Carlo\u2019s thigh with a bullet, making his leg buckle, but he managed to stay upright and shoot back.</p><p>A bullet from Vincent\u2019s gun hit the table Salvatore hid behind, ricocheting off of it and flying in Carmine\u2019s direction. He ducked as soon as he heard it hit and it whizzed past his head, barely missing grazing his temple. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine!\u201d Salvatore yelled, barely audible above the sudden rampant gunfire. \u201cKill him!\u201d</p> <p>Carmine didn\u2019t know what to do. He slowly pulled his gun out, his thoughts frantic as he fought off dizziness. Kill or be killed. He knew how it went. If he didn\u2019t kill his father, Sal would kill him next.</p><p>Before he could consider aiming at anything, another gunshot ripped past him. Carlo stumbled backward, blood pouring through his button-down shirt. He tripped and fell, his body trembling as he clutched his stomach. Awful cries escaped his throat as Vincent closed the distance between them, firing off more shots in anger. Two rounds went through Carlo\u2019s arms, disabling him, and another bullet ripped through his kneecap as he tried to drag himself away.</p><p>Salvatore jumped up and grabbed his gun again before ducking out of the way. Vincent was clearly on a mission, his expression grave as he crouched down and grabbed Carlo by the collar. He shoved the muzzle of his gun in Carlo\u2019s gaping mouth and pulled the trigger without hesitation. Blood splattered, the back of Carlo\u2019s head exploding, and Carmine couldn\u2019t stop the scream that reverberated from his chest as violent flashes of his mother overwhelmed him.</p><p>Vincent looked at Carmine with concern, his eyes scanning him quickly, assessing for wounds. \u201cGet out of here, son,\u201d he demanded before turning to Salvatore, who had taken shelter by the back door. He stood but didn\u2019t have enough time to aim before Salvatore shot at him, a bullet hitting Vincent straight in the chest. He grunted and staggered but stayed on his feet to fire back.</p><p>\u201cCarmine, it\u2019s an order!\u201d Salvatore yelled, continuing to shoot, but his aim was off. \u201cDo it now, or I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t threaten my son!\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s words gave Vincent his strength back. There was a commotion as he steadied himself, the back door of the house bursting open and guys running outside. Corrado followed behind them but froze, taking in the scene as Carmine released the safety from his gun.</p><p>Corrado noticed the movement. Raising his gun, he aimed at Carmine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fu\u2014\u201d he started, unable to get the entire thing out before his uncle pulled the trigger. The bullet grazed the back of his right hand and he cried out, dropping the weapon and grabbing the searing wound. It felt like it was on fire, throbbing painfully as blood dripped onto the patio.</p><p>Corrado sprinted toward Carmine and tackled him, shoving him onto his stomach on the ground, his low voice demanding. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Standing, Corrado haphazardly fired across the yard, the bullets deliberately flying past the target. Vincent turned and fired a wayward shot toward Corrado, his aim just as bad, before ducking for cover around the back of the house.</p><p>Salvatore and the others shielded themselves near the back door, as Corrado and Carmine hunkered down to the side with a clear line of sight. The gunshots slowed to a trickle as they reloaded, the rest of the men filtering out to come to Salvatore\u2019s aid.</p><p>Carmine watched his father drop his pistol, clutching his heaving chest as he staggered a few steps. Vincent shrugged off his coat then, revealing a small Uzi hanging by a strap around his shoulder. The blood rushing through Carmine made him light-headed, his vision blurring as tears flowed down his cheeks.</p><p>Vincent bowed his head and made the sign of the cross, his mouth moving furiously as he spoke to himself. Praying, he realized. His father was praying.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Carmine screamed the word as realization dawned\u2014it was a fucking kamikaze mission.</p><p>Vincent turned, his eyes falling on him briefly before he stepped into the wide-open yard. Corrado dropped to the ground instantly, roughly grabbing Carmine as he tried to get to his feet. He pinned him down with his body as the loud spray of bullets ripped through the night. It was deafening. Carmine\u2019s head thumped ferociously with every loud bang as the frantic explosion of gunfire lit up the yard.</p><p>Carmine screamed, begging his father not to go through with it, but it was too late. There was no turning back. He had made his bed and he was prepared to lie in it . . . he was ready to lie in it.</p><p>But Carmine wasn\u2019t fucking ready. He never would be.</p><p>He tried to push Corrado away but his uncle wouldn\u2019t budge, shielding him as the spray of bullets flew all around them. Two guys dropped nearby, their bodies convulsing, and others ducked for cover to fire back. In the midst of the chaos, Carmine lost track of who was where, bodies dropping and people running, painful screams mixing with the gunfire.</p><p>A shot ripped through Vincent\u2019s stomach and he stumbled, his finger leaving the trigger briefly as he lost his grip, giving the others enough time to recover. They fired in succession, a bullet tearing through Vincent\u2019s shoulder as another one struck his calf. He dropped to his knees, swaying as he tried to stabilize himself. Vincent pulled the trigger again, more people hit with the wild spray of bullets.</p><p>The gunfire stopped abruptly as the cartridge was spent. Vincent shrugged the weapon off his shoulder, letting it drop to the ground. He sat back, his head dropping and body shaking as he stared at the trampled grass. Someone stood up near the house and Carmine panicked because his father was unarmed, but Corrado reacted instinctively. He fired off a shot, the bullet hitting the man straight in the temple.</p><p>Carmine yelled for his father but Corrado shoved him farther into the ground, busting his face on the concrete to silence him. He cursed, blood seeping from his nose, as sirens blared in the distance. Someone yelled, \u201cPolice!\u201d as others fled, scrambling to disappear into the night.</p><p>Corrado finally let go of him when the crowd dispersed. Carmine pushed away from the ground and glanced across the yard as his father crawled toward the side of the house. Corrado started toward him as Vincent stopped at the corner, sitting back on his knees as he grabbed his discarded pistol.</p><p>\u201cVincent!\u201d Corrado yelled, panic in his voice.</p><p>Vincent glanced in their direction, the breath leaving Carmine when he saw his father\u2019s face. The color had drained away, his skin the ashy pale hue of death, his eyes dull and lifeless.</p><p>Vincent said something quietly, not loud enough for Carmine to hear, but whatever it was made Corrado\u2019s footsteps falter. The sirens grew louder and Corrado shook his head, stiffly, angrily, but Vincent nodded with determination.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, Carmine!\u201d Corrado yelled.</p><p>Carmine started across the yard toward them, ignoring his uncle, but nearly buckled from fright when his father raised his gun and pointed it below his chin. \u201cNo! Dad, no!\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s eyes drifted closed, his finger shaking violently on the trigger.</p><p>Corrado bowed his head with a long sigh, his voice quiet. \u201cPerdonami.\u201d</p><p>Forgive me.</p><p>Without hesitation, Corrado raised his gun and squeezed the trigger. A hoarse scream vibrated Carmine\u2019s chest, painfully clawing its way from his throat, as the final bullet tore through his father\u2019s skull. Vincent dropped backward, his body limp on the grass. Carmine collapsed at the same moment, unable to move any farther as sobs rocked his body.</p><p>Corrado walked past him and approached the pool. He grabbed Carmine\u2019s gun and took his own, wiping them off with his shirt before dropping them into the deep chlorinated water. His eyes scanned the property then, surveying the carnage. Bodies were scattered everywhere, puddles of blood all around.</p><p>The sirens wailed louder, lights flashing as police raided the property. Corrado raised his hands in the air and dropped to the ground before they had to tell him, and Carmine rolled onto his stomach to assume the same position.</p><p>Carmine was in a complete daze as they were handcuffed. Corrado lay beside him in the grass, muttered to himself in Italian. It took a minute for Carmine to register that he was praying, and Carmine lost control of himself at the sound. A loud sob escaped as they placed a sheet over his father\u2019s lifeless body, blood soaking through and turning the crisp white to a vibrant red.</p><p>Carmine tried to silence his cries when they pulled Corrado from the ground to lead him away, but it was senseless. He was distraught.</p><p>\u201cSeven deceased, including Dr. DeMarco,\u201d an officer said. \u201cStill waiting on confirmation of the other six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a move on it,\u201d a second man responded, his voice vaguely familiar. \u201cAnyone inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the trafficking victim DeMarco said would be here,\u201d the man said. \u201cThe girl wouldn\u2019t speak to anyone, though, so we don\u2019t know who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her some time. She\u2019ll come around once she realizes she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps approached, the familiar voice calling Carmine\u2019s name. He glanced up, coming face-to-face with Special Agent Cerone. He crouched down and unlocked Carmine\u2019s handcuffs, sighing as he grabbed his hand and eyed the wound. \u201cGet the medic to come look at his injury, please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He stared at Carmine for a moment as he sat up. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to take you in for questioning, but you\u2019ll be out by morning as long as you cooperate. Do you want to make a statement now?\u201d</p><p>He wiped his face, trying to get rid of the tears, and groaned when it did nothing but smear blood on his cheek. \u201cAbby,\u201d he said quietly. His throat burned from screaming, the word barely audible.</p><p>\u201cAbby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe girl inside,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cHer name is Abby.\u201d</p><p>37</p><p>The interrogation room at the Cook County police station smelled like someone had attempted to clean up week-old piss. Corrado grimaced as he took a deep breath, the harsh stench of ammonia and bleach burning his lungs. Gazing across the metal table in front of him, he eyed the federal agent with distaste.</p><p>Agent Cerone started to speak, but Corrado cut him off before he could get started. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I was home, I was alone, I was asleep, and nobody saw me.\u201d</p><p>The agent gaped at him. \u201cI saw you tonight, Mr. Moretti.\u201d</p> <p>Corrado raised his eyebrows. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were even arrested at the scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with your memory?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cI suppose I don\u2019t recall a thing from tonight, then.\u201d</p><p>Corrado forced a look of indifference on his face as Agent Cerone stared at him with disbelief. The agent pulled himself together quickly, gritting his teeth as he flipped through pages of notes. He had hundreds of documents, but nothing to prepare him for facing Corrado. \u201cYou know, Vincent DeMarco was a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cDid something happen to him?\u201d</p><p>The agent shook his head exasperatedly. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to play ignorant, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Corrado merely shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying, he was a good man. I judged him wrong. He wasn\u2019t callous or selfish. He cared about his family, would do anything for them. And I got to thinking . . . maybe you\u2019re the same way. Maybe I was wrong about you, too.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Corrado\u2019s lips turned slightly with amusement. \u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>The agent stared at him for a moment before genuinely laughing. Corrado was much too street smart for the psychological tactics to work on him. He had been through it all before and knew their tricks. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right. Out of curiosity, would you be willing to take a lie detector test?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes against my religion.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly God can judge me. I certainly don\u2019t trust a machine to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only have to worry if you\u2019re untruthful. Do you plan to lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I prefer to sit, thank you.\u201d</p><p>The agent sighed. \u201cWhen did you get to be so sarcastic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see I\u2019m wasting my time,\u201d Agent Cerone said. \u201cAnything you want to say before we end this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that I\u2019d like to speak to my lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Agent Cerone gathered his things, not the least bit surprised. \u201cOf course. Hang tight. It\u2019ll take a while to get you released, but we should have you out in plenty of time for the funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>The agent shook his head. \u201cAt least you\u2019re consistent. But yes, he is. They should be alerting the next of kin any moment.\u201d</p><p>As Agent Cerone stood to leave, Corrado\u2019s expression fell. He was much too weary to keep up the charade. He sat still in the seat and stared at the far wall as his stomach twisted again . . . this time with something much closer to anxiety. He hardly noticed the stench anymore, his grief strong enough to overpower it.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, stalling the agent\u2019s footsteps.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Moretti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to make a call.\u201d</p><p>The agent sighed. \u201cYour lawyer\u2019s already next door with Carmine DeMarco. I\u2019ll send him over as soon as we\u2019re done there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to call my lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to call my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife can\u2019t help you right now.\u201d</p><p>Corrado glared at the man. \u201cShe\u2019s going to think it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they\u2019re going to be making the notification soon. As soon as they show up at my door, she\u2019s going to think it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>A debate played out on the man\u2019s face momentarily, his lips twitching into a frown. \u201cHer brother, her husband . . . it\u2019ll hurt either way. They\u2019ll explain it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made her a promise that I\u2019d never leave her again,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to think I broke it, even if it\u2019s only for a minute.\u201d</p><p>The agent\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cHow could you promise her that? Living the life you live, you\u2019re bound to break it someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t do to keep my vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it means killing?\u201d</p><p>Corrado just stared at the man, and he stared right back. The agent broke first, though, a deep sigh reverberating his chest as he looked away. Frowning, he released Corrado from the interrogation room and led him to a small cubicle, where he picked up a black phone and handed it to him. \u201cYou have five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Corrado dialed his house number, listening as it rang and rang. He was on the verge of giving up when he heard Celia\u2019s voice on the line. Although she spoke hesitantly, he could detect no distress. Worried, but not heartbroken. She hadn\u2019t been told yet. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were going to answer.\u201d</p><p>Celia let out a deep sigh. \u201cCorrado, why does the caller ID say the Cook County Police Station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it end with you getting arrested again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He glanced down at himself, eyeing the handcuffs secured to his wrists. \u201cNot technically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to get you out?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can come up with bail money until morning, although we might have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelia, stop. I\u2019m not calling about me. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine!\u201d she gasped. \u201cOh God, what did he do? Is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . .\u201d Corrado shook his head. \u201cCarmine will be fine. This isn\u2019t about him. It\u2019s about his father.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing but silence on the line for a moment. Had he not detected her steady breathing, he might have suspected she hung up.</p><p>\u201cCelia, Vincent is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She cut him off. \u201cDon\u2019t say what I think you\u2019re going to say. Don\u2019t . . . just don\u2019t say it, Corrado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bellissima.\u201d</p><p>Before she could react, before he could say another word, the federal agent reached over and pressed the button on the phone, effectively ending the call.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of nerve,\u201d Corrado seethed, his voice a low hiss escaping from between his angrily clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to tell her and you did,\u201d the agent said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to give you that much.\u201d</p><p>Disoriented, Carmine\u2019s surroundings twisted and distorted as the interrogation room spun, the dark gray walls slowly closing in around him. Even though frigid air blew out of the vent above him, chilling his taut skin, his body felt like it was engulfed in fire. Teeth chattering, his flushed skin poured sweat, making his torn and bloody shirt stick to him uncomfortably.</p><p>Carmine tried to sort through everything that had happened, but he couldn\u2019t think straight. It was all just too much. Agent Cerone and another man, whose name Carmine couldn\u2019t remember hearing, sat across from him, while Mr. Borza sat to his right. The lawyer urged Carmine to cooperate, but the flickering fluorescent lights made it impossible for him to concentrate.</p><p>\u201cWho fired the first shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. It happened too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many people were shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. A few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you fire a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Corrado Moretti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I can\u2019t say. I told you, it all happened too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what did you do when the shooting started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGunshots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot. I didn\u2019t count them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was involved in the shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it could\u2019ve been Corrado?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fucking could\u2019ve been Jimmy Hoffa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you keep the sarcasm to a minimum. This is a serious situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being sarcastic. I told you I didn\u2019t see. I don\u2019t know who shot first, who shot who, who\u2019s dead, and who\u2019s still alive. All I know is what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I didn\u2019t do a goddamn thing.\u201d</p><p>Round in circles they went, the same vague answers being given for the same questions. He saw nothing, he did nothing, and he couldn\u2019t recall a thing.</p><p>It was the truth . . . partially.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what they expected from him. All he could recall were his father\u2019s last moments, the brutal image haunting Carmine like someone had taken a blowtorch and burned it in his brain.</p><p>Gone . . . his father was gone.</p><p>As Carmine\u2019s chest constricted, a memory came to his mind. It happened a few weeks before his mother had been murdered when his parents had taken them to Six Flags. He and Dominic had climbed into one of those spinning cups and spun it so furiously that by the time the ride was over, he couldn\u2019t make sense of which way was up. His legs buckled as he climbed off the ride, his stomach churning ruthlessly. Collapsing, he threw up right there in the middle of the busy amusement park.</p><p>Today, in that room, he felt a lot like he did back then\u2014dazed and disoriented, betrayed and confused.</p><p>Vincent had pulled him to his feet that day, kneeling in front of him. Carmine\u2019s face turned bright red as tears of embarrassment welled in his eyes. He kept his gaze fixed on the cement, not wanting anyone to see him cry\u2014especially not his father.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Vincent had asked. Carmine hesitated but slowly lifted his eyes, nodding as he took in his serious expression. \u201cEveryone falls sometimes, son, even me, but the trick is to get right back up. They\u2019ll always target the ones who appear vulnerable, so you need to be strong. Fake it until you make it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carmine hadn\u2019t known it at the time, but his father was giving him his first piece of advice on how to survive the lifestyle, and it was a lesson that sunk in as he sat in that cold, tense interrogation room. Unshed tears burned his eyes as he fought to hold them in, not wanting to buckle under the weight of his grief. He needed to be strong; he needed to keep his composure.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let those motherfuckers see him break.</p><p>The sound of Carmine\u2019s name being called pulled him back to reality. Agent Cerone and the other man stared at him, throwing out the same questions. His ears still rung from the incessant gunfire, the buzzing noise in the air driving Carmine to the brink. He clenched his hands into fists, wanting it all to stop, and cringed as searing pain shot up his right arm. He looked at his hand, seeing the blood seeping through the white bandage. His vision went white and flashes of random memory struck him. He tugged at his collar, the air so thick he felt like he was suffocating.</p><p>Blood . . . there was so much fucking blood.</p> <p>Squeezing his eyes shut, he forced himself to think about something else, conjuring up an image of Haven. She was free, he reminded himself. She was following her dreams. As long as she was out there, as long as she had her life, all of it was worth it. The ache in his chest was worth it, the throbbing in his hand was worth it, and being in that room was worth it. All of the blood, sweat, and tears he had shed were worth it, because she was worth it.</p><p>He missed her.</p><p>God, how I fucking miss my hummingbird.</p><p>Carmine was so wrapped up in the moment that he forgot where he was until someone shook him. He jumped, clutching his chest with his injured hand and wincing as he opened his eyes. Agent Cerone stood beside him and grasped his shoulder, raising his eyebrows questioningly. \u201cCan I get something for you? A glass of water, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get me out of here,\u201d he snapped. \u201dHow long do you plan on keeping me? I didn\u2019t fucking do anything!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe just need to ask you a few more questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can tell you,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your hummingbird?\u201d he asked as he sat down again.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a moment ago you said you missed your hummingbird.\u201d</p><p>He stared at him in shock, realizing he had said that out loud, and wondered what else he might have unknowingly said.</p> <p>\u201cI fail to see what this has to do with the incident tonight,\u201d Mr. Borza chimed in. \u201cI would appreciate it if we could stay on topic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Agent Cerone\u2019s eyes lingered on Carmine for a moment longer. \u201cHow well do you know Salvatore Capozzi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my godfather,\u201d he muttered, the agent\u2019s expression instantly lighting up at the word. Carmine shook his head as he clarified. \u201cI was baptized as an infant and my parents named him my godfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so he\u2019s like a parent to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d Cerone asked curiously. \u201cAre you saying he isn\u2019t anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fucking dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d he spat.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, no.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine stared at him, hoping he had heard him wrong. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated, the confirmation sending Carmine\u2019s heart racing. If Salvatore wasn\u2019t dead, he was in danger\u2014a lot of fucking danger. Not only had he witnessed everything and knew his darkest secrets, the things he would kill anyone to keep from being exposed, but he had also disobeyed an order. There was no way Sal would just forgive and forget. He had too much to lose to give Carmine a pass. \u201cAs far as we can tell he fled the scene. We have reason to believe he\u2019s injured, but there\u2019s no evidence he didn\u2019t survive the attack.\u201d</p><p>Carmine absorbed that information, trying to keep his expression blank although he was panicking inside.</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did you initiate?\u201d the other officer asked casually, changing the subject.</p><p>Carmine glanced at him, surprised at his nonchalance. \u201cInitiate what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Cosa Nostra.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m joking?\u201d he asked, raising his voice. \u201cWe know you\u2019re involved, so there\u2019s no sense denying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve watched Scarface one too many times,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThat shit\u2019s not real. It doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>He sighed exasperatedly, giving Carmine an annoyed look. \u201dWe know it exists. We\u2019re not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I,\u201d Carmine snapped. \u201cTake your bullshit questions about the Mafia elsewhere, because I have nothing to say about it. Period. End of motherfucking story.\u201d</p><p>A tense silence fell over the room before Agent Cerone cleared his throat. \u201cI saw her, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Carmine asked, the shift in topic catching him off guard.</p><p>\u201cHaven,\u201d he clarified, his lips twitching as he fought back a smile.</p><p>\u201cHow . . . ?\u201d His confusion deepened. How the fuck? \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about looking her up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her the fuck alone,\u201d Carmine spat, standing and shoving his chair back in haste. \u201cI swear to God if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish, Mr. Borza grabbed his arm and pulled him back into his seat. \u201cThreatening my client\u2019s loved ones isn\u2019t going to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t threatening anyone. I was simply saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all well aware of what you were saying,\u201d Mr. Borza said, \u201cand it was nothing but a thinly veiled threat. You claim to want his cooperation, but yet you bring up Miss Antonelli in an attempt to upset him further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did no such thing,\u201d Agent Cerone said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, he doesn\u2019t care about her. In fact, last we spoke, he denied even knowing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why bring her up at all?\u201d Mr. Borza countered. \u201cI requested once that you stay on topic and it\u2019s clear you have no intention of doing so. Mr. DeMarco agreed to answer your questions, but he\u2019s under no obligation. Given the fact that mere hours ago he witnessed his father\u2019s murder, I\u2019d say he\u2019s been quite forthcoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s given us nothing,\u201d the other officer said, still glaring at Carmine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he has nothing to give,\u201d Mr. Borza retorted. \u201cYou can\u2019t get from him what he doesn\u2019t know. Because of that, I\u2019m going to have to say this conversation is over. Either charge him with something or let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do either,\u201d the officer said smugly, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cWe have every right to detain him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but you won\u2019t. Not only is my client injured, but he\u2019s also traumatized. The media would have a field day if you detained him . . . as if you don\u2019t already have enough damage control to do. You don\u2019t need to add harassing an innocent man to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarassing? Innocent? He\u2019s one of them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d Mr. Borza asked, glancing at Carmine. \u201cYou honestly believe the public is going to look at this boy and think \u2018criminal\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Agent Cerone sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>The officer looked at him with disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re going to let him walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave my word,\u201d Agent Cerone said quietly, pushing his chair back and glancing at his watch. \u201cSit tight while I secure your release. I told you I\u2019d have you out by morning and it looks like I was right, considering the sun will be up soon.\u201d</p><p>38</p><p>Kelsey and Haven sat at the diner near their brownstone in a booth by the door. It was Sunday morning on their first weekend of summer vacation. There were a few other patrons in the diner, an elderly couple a few seats away and a family in the back, as well as two men drinking coffee at the bar.</p><p>A lady in a white top and khakis with a black apron tied around her waist plopped two plastic menus down on the table. \u201cWhat can I get you ladies to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cTwo creams, a dash of skim milk, and three packets of Splenda. Oh, and two ice cubes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take coffee, too,\u201d Haven said. \u201cJust black, please. You know, normal.\u201d</p><p>She returned with their drinks as Haven opened the menu and scanned it. Kelsey rattled off a list, emphasizing her need for extra bacon, whereas Haven asked for a stack of pancakes. As hungry as she was, nothing sounded appetizing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it to you in a jiffy,\u201d she responded, taking the menus and walking off. Haven sighed and picked up her coffee, taking a sip of the hot bitter liquid as she gazed out of the window. She heard one of the men ask the waitress to turn on the television and a few seconds later the diner was filled with the sound of the news.</p><p>The reports were mainly politics, with local scandals dominating the headlines. She had spent some time learning about political parties in New York. Kelsey\u2019s dad was running for office again and Haven often asked her about it, but she always blew off the questions and claimed none of it mattered. She said she wouldn\u2019t bother voting if her father\u2019s job didn\u2019t rely on it, insisting nothing would ever change no matter who got into office.</p><p>Haven never contradicted her, but she didn\u2019t agree at all. Abraham Lincoln and the Thirty-eighth Congress passed the Thirteenth amendment that abolished slavery. Woodrow Wilson and the Sixty-sixth Congress passed the Nineteenth amendment to give women the right to vote. To Haven, it mattered.</p><p>The men started debating issues, the two opposite on everything. She sipped her coffee as their bickering grew louder, a debate about gun control, and Haven froze, spilling her coffee when she caught a glimpse of the television. Her stomach lurched at the sight of the familiar man, her eyes quickly scanning the caption on the bottom of the screen: D.O.J. Special Agent Donald Cerone.</p><p>The coffee scorched her skin and she gritted her teeth from the searing pain as her coffee cup clattered to the table, slipping from her hand. The diner grew quiet as people turned to the commotion at her booth, but Haven ignored them, her attention focused squarely on the television. She had a hard time catching the words, the throbbing in her hand distracting, as she felt like she was sinking under water.</p><p>\u201c. . .

Dr. DeMarco was dead?</p><p>\u201cHayden?\u201d Kelsey\u2019s voice rang out. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Haven tried to respond, but as soon as she uncovered her mouth another sob echoed through the diner. She jumped up from the booth and nearly fell, her legs barely able to withstand her weight. She pushed past her friend as she ran for the door and bolted down the street to her apartment. Kelsey yelled after Haven but she didn\u2019t turn around, fumbling for the keys and rushing inside. Leaning back against the door, she closed her eyes and tried to get a grip on herself. The words of the news report continually ran through her mind, although she couldn\u2019t make sense of it. How could he be dead? What happened?</p><p>After her breathing was under control, she opened her eyes again and wiped the tears from her cheeks. Grabbing the small black cell phone, she dialed the Chicago number and listened as it rang. \u201cCorrado Moretti. Leave a message.\u201d</p> <p>Haven pushed back the nerves that always accompanied the call. The words escaped her lips, the burn in her chest dulling as another sensation settled in. Through the shock, through the horror and fear, she felt the resolve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Haven left her apartment under the cloak of darkness, taking only a small bag of clothes. She locked up before making her way down the block to the nearest parking garage, taking the elevator up to the third tier. She spotted the black Mazda parked precisely where she had left it almost a year before. The thick layer of dirt and dust covering the paint concealed the scratches still adorning the top.</p><p>It took nearly every penny she had in her pocket to pay the parking fees and fill up the gas tank for her trip.</p><p>Her heart ached as she drove out of the city, thoughts of Dr. DeMarco infiltrating her mind. Unlike so many times before, when the incident where he had punished her would spring to mind, all she could think about were the good moments: the time he had given her the picture of her mother, the holidays, the sound of his laughter, and the look of pride on his face when Dominic graduated. She thought about the food he had given her and how he had handed over his keys so she could learn to drive. He hadn\u2019t even been angry when it was returned with a scratch.</p><p>It seemed as if more than a year\u2019s worth of memories flooded Haven, and with them came the tears. Dominic\u2019s words ran through her mind, ones he had spoken down by the river in Durante.</p> <p>\u201cI already lost my mom to this life,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose him, too.\u201d</p><p>Dominic had made Haven see that it was okay to want more in life. He had helped her face her worst fear. It was only fair she would be there to help him face his.</p><p>39</p><p>Haven sat in the car along the curb, her stomach churning as she stared at the blue door of the old house. She had only seen it once before, sitting on the bottom step with Carmine by her side. More than a year had somehow passed since that day . . . more than a year since she had laid eyes on him. She wondered if he would be happy to see her, or if he would be angry she came.</p><p>So many scenarios flooded her mind as she got out of the car and made her way across the street. She tried to push back her anxiety as she stepped on the porch, but before she could even knock her name was called from down the street. Her vision blurred, her heart rate skyrocketing as she turned around, watching Corrado\u2019s leisurely approach. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re well.\u201d He eyed her intently, a serious expression hardening his face. Haven immediately grew paranoid, wondering if it was wrong for her to be there.</p><p>Panic crept through her at the prospect that she could be in danger. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I should come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice of you to show up,\u201d he said as he stepped closer. \u201cI apologize for not calling. By the time I had a chance, you\u2019d informed me of your intention to come, so I assumed someone else told you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw it on the news,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThey said there was a massacre.\u201d</p><p>Corrado scoffed at the word. \u201cIt was hardly a massacre. If it was, no one would\u2019ve survived, but Carmine and I walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d she gasped, horrified. \u201cHe was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cAnd as you can probably guess, he isn\u2019t taking it very well. After Maura\u2019s murder, he didn\u2019t speak to anybody for a long time. It seems he\u2019s dealing with his father\u2019s death the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d The burn flared in her chest as her eyes filled with tears. \u201cHe saw them both die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he, uh . . . ?\u201d She motioned toward the door behind her. \u201cIs he home?\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s already gone to the service with my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join me,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cI\u2019m waiting on the car service to pick me up. Plenty of time to meet them at the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>Haven looked down at herself, eyeing her wrinkled shirt and dirty jeans. She had had them on since yesterday morning, having not taken the time to change before leaving. \u201cI don\u2019t really have anything with me to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod doesn\u2019t care what you wear, Haven,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter to Vincent, either. But if it would make you feel better, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in my wife\u2019s closet that would suffice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Haven furiously shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t impose like that.\u201d</p><p>Corrado let out a sharp bark of laughter. \u201cAs much as I\u2019ve already done, a change of clothes is hardly an imposition.\u201d</p><p>That silenced her immediately.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he insisted. \u201cNo excuses.\u201d</p><p>Haven quietly followed him to his house and upstairs to the bedroom he shared with Celia. She glanced through the closet, pulling out a plain black dress she found in the back. It was slightly too big but fit better than she expected.</p><p>She borrowed a pair of shoes, too, some simple black heels that pinched her toes, a size too small but good enough for the moment. She did little else to prepare, in and out in less than twenty minutes.</p><p>Corrado waited downstairs for her, peering out the front door at the black town car parked along the curb. They climbed into it, and Haven shifted anxiously around on the leather seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried,\u201d Corrado said quietly a few minutes into the drive. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything within my power for Carmine, but it seems to be beyond my reach. He\u2019s too stubborn and reckless. The way he\u2019s going, he\u2019s doomed.\u201d</p><p>Doomed. That word rippled through her, a cold chill striking her bones. \u201cYou\u2019ve given up on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter . . . not when he\u2019s already given up on himself.\u201d</p><p>Before Haven could respond, Corrado\u2019s cell phone rang. He pulled it out, letting out a long exhaustive sigh as he answered the call. \u201cMoretti speaking . . . Yeah, it\u2019s all settled. I\u2019m certain it\u2019ll go according to plan.\u201d</p><p>He hung up quickly, slipping his phone back away as his attention once more turned to her. \u201cIs this visit temporary, or do you need to retrieve your things from New York?\u201d</p><p>She blanched. \u201cWell, I . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, his eyes focusing straight ahead. \u201cLet me know when you figure it out.\u201d</p><p>The long, gold-toned casket stood out strikingly on the grassy knoll, a makeshift memorial of colorful flowers surrounding it on all sides. A crowd of mourners gathered, dozens of people dressed in their most expensive black clothing, their heads bowed and gazes cast away, as if avoiding having to face reality. Sorrow and misery wafted around them, the atmosphere stifling with pain lingering in the air.</p><p>Haven paused a few yards away from the service, her knees weak. Dr. DeMarco\u2019s cold body lay in that box, his heart no longer beating and the life expelled from him. He was gone, never again to open his eyes and see another day.</p><p>The air seemed to be forced from Haven\u2019s lungs at the thought, dizziness blurring her vision. She took a few steps to the side to lean against a tall maple tree in order to catch her breath as Corrado continued on, infiltrating the crowd. She scanned them as she composed herself, catching brief glimpses of Celia and Dominic, but the others were shielded from view.</p><p>She wanted to go closer, desperate to see Carmine, but her feet wouldn\u2019t move no matter how hard she tried to make them.</p><p>\u201cVincenzo was a loyal man,\u201d the priest declared, clutching a Bible to his chest as he stood behind the casket. \u201cHe was a husband and a father; a son and a brother. He wasn\u2019t a perfect man, he made mistakes, but no man is perfect. We all sin; we all fall victim to temptation. Vincenzo was no different.</p><p>\u201cGreed, lust, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy, pride\u2014the seven cardinal sins. He struggled with them, trying to balance the good and evil in his life, and many times he failed. But just because he succumbed to evil doesn\u2019t mean he was evil. Vincenzo visited me often before his life came to an end. He expressed remorse for all of the hurt he had caused, and because of that I am certain of one thing\u2014despite his flaws, Vincenzo Roman DeMarco was a true Man of Honor.\u201d</p><p>Sobs rang out from the crowd, but Haven couldn\u2019t decipher who they came from. When the priest finished a few minutes later, mourners took turns placing long-stemmed red roses on top of the casket, one by one saying their final good-byes to the man inside. Haven caught a glimpse of Tess and Dia, but the family stood in the front and remained mostly blocked.</p><p>Haven picked at her nails nervously as the crowd dispersed, chipping away at the pale pink polish when Carmine finally came into view. He wore a black suit, his hair slicked back and head bowed as he stared into the massive hole in the ground. People spoke to him as they passed, but he didn\u2019t acknowledge them. He just stood still, a cold marble statue, unmoving and unwavering, looming in the pathway as everyone moved around him.</p><p>She watched Celia rub Carmine\u2019s back before she and Corrado walked away. Corrado steered her in Haven\u2019s direction, her footsteps faltering as a look of surprise passed over her face. She smiled warmly as she approached, pulling her into a hug. \u201cYou look great, kiddo. It\u2019s been way too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Haven said quietly as she let go, seeing Celia\u2019s face was flushed, her makeup was smudged from crying. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, Celia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, sweetie,\u201d she whispered, glancing back over at Carmine, frowning, before looking at Haven again. \u201cGo on,\u201d she said, motioning toward him. \u201cMake sure he gets home safely, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrado put his arm over Celia\u2019s shoulder, nodding at Haven in approval before leading her away. Haven remained in place for a moment as she stared at Carmine, wondering if she even knew the person in front of her anymore. He seemed so different, from his stance to the way he was dressed, all of it foreign. His slumped shoulders screamed with defeat, as he stood seemingly oblivious to anything in the world around him.</p><p>Haven took a few steps in his direction but stopped again when he broke his stance, grabbing a rose from the closest display and slowly approaching an adjacent grave. He crouched down in front of the headstone and laid the rose on the ground before running his fingers along the words engraved on the worn white marble.</p><p>Haven started his way again, her curiosity fueling her, but stopped after a few steps when realization struck. He had once told her his mother was in Hillside.</p><p>Her heart pounded rapidly as she suddenly felt like she was invading his privacy. The memory of him sitting in front of his piano, slumped down and crying on the anniversary of her death came to mind. Pain ripped through her chest.</p> <p>She immediately took a step back.</p><p>Carmine must have sensed her movement, because his body stiffened at that moment, his shoulders squared and head held high as if on alert. Something in the atmosphere shifted\u2014the afternoon sun disappeared behind a thick cloud, encasing the cemetery in gloomy shade. A cool breeze blew through, ruffling Haven\u2019s dress and causing a shiver to run the length of her spine.</p><p>It felt like it happened in slow motion as Carmine turned in her direction, their eyes locking across the way. She finally saw his face, taking in the deep frown on his lips and dark bags under his bloodshot eyes. His blank expression changed as he stared at her, distinctive emotions flashing across his face that matched the ones surging inside of her. Shock, disbelief, confusion, desperation, fear, longing, hope, sorrow, grief . . . all of it hit Haven at once as she stared at the broken boy she had once given her heart to\u2014a heart she had never quite got back.</p><p>She loved him, just as much as she ever had, and when she saw that same feeling reflected back at her, it all came together. Because despite everything that was different, despite everything that felt unfamiliar, despite the pain and heartbreak, the love was still there.</p><p>Finally, something felt right again.</p> <p>He hesitantly took a step toward her, his movement causing Haven to break into a run. She kicked her shoes off in the grass as she sprinted in his direction, shaking and crying as she rammed right into him. He braced himself in an attempt to keep his footing and wrapped his arms around her, staggering a few steps from the force of the collision. His body violently shook as a strangled sob tore from his chest.</p><p>Neither spoke, the lump in Haven\u2019s throat making it impossible for anything to escape but cries. She closed her eyes as he held her, reveling in his familiar scent and body warmth. Despite how vulnerable she knew he was, how shaky the ground was beneath his feet, she felt secure in his arms, like all of her wandering had come down to that moment, in that place, where she finally felt like she was home again.</p><p>He was her home. He always had been.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long they stood between his parents\u2019 graves, clinging to each other, all of their hurt, and pain, and heartache expelled through each shuddering breath, each salty tear staining their cheeks. It could have been minutes or hours, but it felt as if time had stopped for them once again.</p><p>\u201cLa mia bella ragazza,\u201d he whispered, his voice cracking.</p><p>The words sent a pang of longing through her body, and she closed her eyes as the electricity of his touch coursed through her veins. \u201cOh, Carmine.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled back to look at Haven, his face wet with tears and hair a disheveled mess. She reached up to run her hand through it, cringing as her fingers got tangled in a stiff nest of hair product. \u201cYour hair.\u201d</p><p>A sad smile lifted the corner of his mouth, and although he didn\u2019t respond, she knew he understood. He reached out and wiped the tears from her cheeks, her eyes fluttering closed from his touch. He ran his fingertips down her jaw, his hand gently exploring her face, before he tucked a wayward strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>Wiping his tears, Haven explored his face much like he had hers, eyeing the small mark on his cheek peculiarly as she ran her pointer finger across it. She had never seen it before. \u201cYou have a scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d He cracked a smile as the blush rose into her cheeks. \u201cYou still blush, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still make me,\u201d she whispered, surveying him. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a suit.\u201d</p><p>Glancing down at himself, he grimaced. \u201cI still hate them, but it\u2019s a funeral.\u201d His voice cracked on the word and he turned away, taking a deep, calculated breath. He gazed past her at something. \u201cYou wore high heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still hate them, but it\u2019s a funeral,\u201d she said, repeating his words. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing Nike\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThese fucking shoes hurt my feet.\u201d</p> <p>She stifled a laugh. \u201cYou still say that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat word?\u201d He raised his eyebrows when she didn\u2019t respond. \u201cI guess you still don\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><p>Haven shrugged.</p><p>They stood there for a while longer trading observations. It might have been trivial, given the weight of the circumstances, but it was their way of reconnecting. They memorized each other again, becoming acquainted with the things that had changed in their absence as the comfort and familiarity settled back in. Countless times she wondered what she would say if she ever saw Carmine again, musing about what he might possibly say in response, but she never considered that it would be so seamless for them.</p><p>They had both changed, and it was obvious, as she stared into his deep green eyes, that there was a darkness lurking inside of him, but it hadn\u2019t consumed him. Carmine\u2019s spirit might have been broken, but his soul remained intact. It was like meeting him for the first time all over again, but knowing in her heart exactly who he was from the beginning.</p><p>He was Carmine Marcello DeMarco . . . and even broken, he was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here,\u201d he said, pulling Haven into his arms again. He buried his face in her hair and inhaled deeply. \u201cThis has to be a fucking dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a dream,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. Carmine\u2019s phone rang then, tension sweeping over them as he motioned for her to stay where she was. She eyed him warily as he stepped away, bringing his phone to his ear and speaking quietly to ensure she couldn\u2019t overhear.</p><p>A sinking feeling settled into the pit of her stomach. She knew the easy couldn\u2019t last, that the seamless would have snags. He was a part of that life, and there were things about him she couldn\u2019t be involved in\u2014things she could never know. Carmine harbored secrets that would never be spilled.</p><p>Not wanting to appear to be eavesdropping, Haven took a step away and quietly gazed at the headstone that marked his mother\u2019s grave.</p><p>Maura DeMarco</p><p>April 1965\u2013October 1996</p><p>\u201cAma, ridi, sogna\u2014e vai dormire\u201d</p><p>She had only been thirty-one, too young to be ripped from the world. Dr. DeMarco had lived more than a decade without his wife. Haven couldn\u2019t begin to imagine how he had felt waking every morning to face the realization that he would never have it back, he would never feel the spark again.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Carmine said, interrupting her thoughts. \u201dIt was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to know,\u201d Haven cut him off, but she heard him mutter Corrado\u2019s name regardless.</p><p>An awkward silence lingered before Carmine sighed. \u201cAma, ridi, sogna\u2014e vai dormire,\u201d he said, reading the line chiseled into the stone. \u201dIt means \u2018Love, laugh, dream, and go to sleep\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled softly. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he mumbled, a sad smile tugging his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was an amazing woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was. Too bad I couldn\u2019t take after her more. Instead, I\u2019m like him.\u201d Tears brimmed his eyes, sudden anger flowing out with those words. \u201cVincent DeMarco\u2019s son, so that makes me the fucking enemy. As much as I hate it, it\u2019s true. I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. You don\u2019t even fucking know.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to look at me if you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only did what you had to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve stood by and watched without saying a goddamn word. I\u2019ve watched people die and kept my mouth shut like they didn\u2019t matter, like they didn\u2019t fucking count. What kinda person does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Haven said quietly. \u201cDid you forget about Frankie killing that girl? Number 33\u2014that\u2019s all I know about her, a number written on a piece of paper someone stuck to her. She\u2019s dead and I don\u2019t even know her name. I never did anything to help her.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve fucking killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying they won\u2019t kill you if you don\u2019t go along with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still not the same,\u201d he said, the aggravation clear in his voice. \u201cYou were born into it, but I chose this life. I chose to be this fucking person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf nothing else, that makes you good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he sneered. \u201cThey talked today about how good my father was, about all the people he helped, but what about the bad? He helps a few people and suddenly all the ones he hurt are forgotten? What about what he did to you? What about what he did to me? He opened fire on a house and I had to see that shit! Then he . . . then he fucking tried to . . .\u201d</p><p>He shook as he fought for control, on the verge of hyperventilating. Haven rubbed his back, her tears steadily falling. He hurt, and she had no idea how to make it any better.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Carmine said after a moment. \u201cHe went out in a blaze of glory, and I can\u2019t help but hate him for it because now he\u2019s gone, too! And the worst part is that I wasn\u2019t surprised, because he did exactly what I would\u2019ve done. I would\u2019ve killed every single one of those motherfuckers. I\u2019m just like my goddamn father.\u201d</p><p>Haven grabbed his arm to calm him down, his moods shifting so quickly she had a hard time keeping up. He shrugged away from her, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a silver metal flask.</p><p>Bringing it to his lips, he closed his eyes and shuddered as he took a drink. \u201cI owe you a lot of apologies, but sorry doesn\u2019t seem good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour intentions were always good,\u201d Haven said, not liking his self-loathing. Based on his demeanor, he had been beating himself up for a while.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that saying go\u2014the road to hell is paved with good intentions? Makes sense, I guess, since I\u2019m heading that way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She winced. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, you\u2019re right,\u201d he said quickly, taking another drink from his flask. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be saying this shit to you.

You look good, tesoro.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart started acting erratically, a fluttering in her stomach as the word tesoro escaped his lips. He tried to run his hand through his hair but cringed, a white bandage covering it. \u201cWhat happened to your hand?\u201d</p><p>He shoved it back in his pocket as if to hide the injury. \u201cCorrado shot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shot you? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him.\u201d He grew quiet again and Haven knew he was holding back. \u201cThat\u2019s where the scar on my face came from, too. Someone shot at me. Wasn\u2019t Corrado that time, though . . . some Irish fucker.\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at him as that sank in. \u201cThat\u2019s scary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s life,\u201d he said, shrugging as if it weren\u2019t a big deal. \u201cThat\u2019s my life now, anyway. Thank God it\u2019s not yours.\u201d</p><p>Silence lingered between them as he took sips from his flask, his eyes looking everywhere but at her. She could see the sadness, the yearning for something he felt he couldn\u2019t have. It made her chest ache.</p><p>\u201cA guy named Gavin asked me out a few months ago,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Carmine froze with the flask to his lips, cringing at her words. Tension rolled from him in waves. \u201cDid you go out with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, but it could never work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause he could never know me,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI had friends, but they didn\u2019t know me, either. No one did. They don\u2019t know where I came from or what I went through. They only know the cover story, the girl I pretend to be . . . the girl everyone wants me to be . . . the girl I still sometimes wish I could be. They think the world I came from only exists in movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be whoever you want to be.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it, Carmine? I am that girl. I always will be, and believe it or not, I like her. I like being her. I like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you, too,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you deserve more than this life, Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so do you.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI chose this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why couldn\u2019t I?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy did you choose for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d be goddamned if I was going to let you throw everything away for someone like me. You\u2019re better than my kind.\u201d</p> <p>Haven shook her head with disbelief. \u201cYour kind? How can you say that? You, the boy who told me over and over again that I\u2019d overcome my label . . . how can you label yourself? You wanted me to go out there and explore my options. I did that, Carmine, and I loved it, but I was lonely. Do you know what it\u2019s like to stand in a crowded room and still feel like you\u2019re the only one there? Do you? Because that was how it felt to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be something you settled for, Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think being with you would be settling? I\u2019ll always be a part of your world. I\u2019ll always have someone keeping tabs on me, making sure I don\u2019t break my silence. My house got broken into and I couldn\u2019t even call the police, I had to call your uncle! How do I explain that to people? It\u2019s not normal\u2014I\u2019m not normal! Being out there in the world alone, spending my life pretending to be someone I\u2019m not . . . that\u2019s settling, Carmine. Does it even matter what I want?\u201d</p><p>Carmine sighed exasperatedly, taking another drink. \u201cOf course it matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, his eyes boring into hers intensely. \u201cWhat do you do when the thing you want most suddenly feels like it\u2019s just beyond your fingertips?\u201d</p><p>The question caught Haven off guard. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrote that in your journal,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hold you back.\u201d</p><p>A bitter laugh of disbelief erupted from her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s why you did it? Are you kidding me? The answer to that question isn\u2019t to give up, Carmine. You don\u2019t just quit. You keep trying. You keep reaching. All I ever wanted was someone to see me, to love me, to understand me. I didn\u2019t have to hide from you; I didn\u2019t have to pretend to be someone I wasn\u2019t. You know me, the person no one else will ever know. I wanted to be with you, I thought we\u2019d be together, and then you left! You walked out on me as I slept!\u201d</p><p>Haven shook as all of the hurt came pouring out in her words, everything she had kept bottled in for the past eighteen months erupting in a cloud of anger.</p><p>\u201cI wanted what was best for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted you to have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chance?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou asked me for a chance once. Do you remember that? I gave it to you, and I don\u2019t regret that for a second. I\u2019ll never regret it. If you didn\u2019t love me, that\u2019s one thing, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I loved you!\u201d His eyes filled with tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get you killed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not your father, Carmine, and I\u2019m not your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he spat.</p><p>\u201cDo you? You\u2019re so busy trying to stop history from repeating itself that you\u2019re completely ignoring what\u2019s right in front of you!\u201d</p><p>He wiped his eyes. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFate,\u201d she said. \u201cYou came into my life because you were meant to be in my life. It wasn\u2019t an accident! So don\u2019t push me away, because I fucking love you, Carmine DeMarco, and you\u2019re just hurting yourself doing it!\u201d</p><p>Frantic, Haven wrapped her arms around her chest, trying to hold herself together. Carmine stared at her in a daze, but the moment a sob escaped from her throat he snapped back to reality. He wrapped his arms around her tightly. \u201cOh, tesoro,\u201d he whispered into her hair. \u201cI fucking love you, too.\u201d</p><p>They clung to each other again until Carmine\u2019s phone shattered yet another moment. He groaned as he reached for it and glanced at the screen.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d His voice was even as he answered, his eyes refusing to leave Haven\u2019s face. \u201cYes, sir. Thirty minutes. I got it.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, giving Haven a curious look.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go?\u201d she guessed.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou, too. We\u2019re expected at the gathering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that Corrado?\u201d she asked, surprised when he nodded. \u201cIt sounded serious, like, you know . . . work.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly. \u201cCorrado is work to me. He\u2019s my boss first and family second. I can\u2019t tell him to fuck off anymore. I\u2019d hate for him to shoot me again.\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced at his hand instinctively. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe he did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I can. He\u2019s threatened to kill me more times than I can count, so it was only a matter of time.\u201d Haven looked at him with horror and he chuckled nervously. \u201cI deserved it. I\u2019ve fucked up a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? I mean, if you can . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019d be here all night if I tried to explain, and we\u2019re down to twenty-eight minutes now.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around briefly, his eyes darting between his parents\u2019 graves as he pressed his hand against Haven\u2019s back to lead her away. \u201cI guess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably most of it, really, but I was referring to you not saying fuck,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you cursed at me.\u201d</p><p>Neither spoke during the drive. So much time had passed that Haven knew it would be impossible for them to just pick up where they had left off, unrealistic to expect to have back exactly what they had once shared. It was still there, though, buried beneath the surface. It would take time to unearth it and nurse it back to health.</p><p>If he was willing to try, that was.</p><p>They made their way into the Morettis\u2019 house when they arrived. Carmine was on edge, his hands shoved into his pockets and body tense. He kept his head down, retreating further into himself with each step. He walked inside without knocking, stopping in the foyer. She stepped in behind him and saw Corrado standing by the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>He glanced at his watch. \u201cThirty-nine minutes.\u201d</p><p>Late.</p><p>An animated voice carried through the hallway as they headed toward the living room. Haven smiled at the familiarity, recognizing Dominic. Carmine paused in the doorway and she stopped behind him, glancing past him nervously. The large room was packed with people and she spotted Dia right away, sitting on the couch. Tess was beside her but mostly blocked from view by Dominic, who stood directly in front of her. Celia sat in a chair near the door beside an older woman.</p><p>There were at least two dozen others, people Haven didn\u2019t recognize, but each of them listened intently as Dominic spoke. He told a story about a fishing trip they went on when they were children, about how Carmine had dumped out all of the worms they had caught the night before.</p><p>Gazing at Carmine, Haven saw no flicker of emotion in his face, no recognition as Dominic recounted the story. He stood tensely right inside the doorway, his hands still shoved in his pockets with his head down. Haven realized then, looking at him, that he knew exactly how she had felt on her own. He knew what it felt like to stand in a crowded room, surrounded by people, yet feel utterly alone.</p><p>Haven slid her arms under his from behind, shoving her hands in his pockets with his. She laced their fingers together as she laid her head against his back. Carmine didn\u2019t move or speak, but his body relaxed from the contact.</p><p>Stories were shared, one after another, until the room grew quiet, a somber feeling taking over as no one seemed to know what else to say. Haven pulled away from Carmine and felt him tense again as she cleared her throat. \u201cI think I have something to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwinkle Toes!\u201d Dominic bounded across the room the second he noticed her and pulled her into a hug. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut her down, Dominic,\u201d Tess said sternly.</p><p>Dominic put Haven back on her feet, smiling sheepishly. Dia and Tess both said hello to her before Celia chimed in. \u201cGo on, Haven. I\u2019d love to hear what you have to say about Vincent.\u201d</p><p>Not everyone seemed as confident as Celia about hearing Haven speak. Corrado watched her apprehensively and she noticed a few others were, too, all of them likely aware of what Dr. DeMarco had done to her.</p><p>\u201cAbout a year and a half ago, when I was living in Charlotte, I wasn\u2019t doing so well. I guess you could say I was, uh . . . homesick.\u201d She glanced at Dia, who smiled knowingly. \u201cI wanted nothing more than to run back to what was familiar to me, and Dr. De\u2014err, Vincent knew that. I hit bottom one night and did something stupid out of desperation, and he came to talk to me. He said he knew I was scared but that I needed to give life a chance. He told me to show those who had doubted me that they were wrong, that I was strong enough to make it, and after I did, if I was still homesick, he\u2019d help me find my way home. He promised when I was ready he\u2019d help me, even if it was the last thing he did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took a deep breath and glanced at Carmine, their eyes connecting. \u201cHe probably thought he\u2019d have to break his promise, but he didn\u2019t, because he did exactly what he said he would. Now that I\u2019m ready, he helped me find my way home. I just wish it hadn\u2019t really been the last thing he did.\u201d</p><p>A tear slid down her cheek as she stared into swirling deep green eyes that seemed to beckon to her. He opened his mouth like he was going to speak, but no sound escaped as he moved his lips. It didn\u2019t matter, though, because she knew what he was trying to say.</p><p>Welcome home.</p><p>The woman sitting beside Celia spoke up then, her voice laced with cynicism. \u201cWho is this girl? How\u2019d she know Vincenzo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is Carmine\u2019s, uh . . .\u201d Celia trailed off. \u201cWell, Mom, this is Haven Antonelli. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAntonelli? You mean that little slave girl?\u201d</p><p>People cringed and gasped, shaking their heads and muttering under their breath from secondhand embarrassment, but Haven just nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d The woman surveyed her. \u201cI guess we can\u2019t really call you that, though, can we? No, Federica\u2019s grandbaby isn\u2019t a slave. She\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>Dozens of eyes shot straight to the woman at those words, a deathly silence falling over the room.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you say, Gia?\u201d Corrado asked, blinking with shock.</p><p>\u201cI said she\u2019s Federica\u2019s grandbaby,\u201d Gia replied. \u201cWhat, you didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I knew, but how did you?\u201d</p><p>Gia waved him off. \u201cAntonio told me ages ago. He was planning to kill that Salamander when he found out, but he never got the chance. God got to my husband first, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Corrado gaped at her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never asked,\u201d Gia said, shrugging. \u201cBesides, you all think I\u2019m crazy, anyway. Would you have believed me?\u201d</p> <p>A minute of tense silence passed before Corrado shook his head. \u201cNo, I probably wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>40</p><p>I fucking love you.\u201d</p><p>The words still echoed in Carmine\u2019s head an hour later. Could it be that easy? He wanted to believe it, wanted to give in, but he was still conflicted. He couldn\u2019t be positive he could keep her safe or be the man she deserved. He struggled to function on his own, and the last thing he wanted to do was drag her down with him. He would never forgive himself if he got her hurt.</p><p>Carmine glanced away from Haven, sighing as he considered that, and noticed Corrado watching him with a peculiar look on his face. His penetrating stare burned through him, painful and raw, a bit of pity lingering behind the obvious judgment. Carmine stared back, their eyes connecting for only a few seconds, but it felt as if an eternity passed under the scrutiny of his gaze.</p><p>A phone rang then and Carmine breathed a sigh of relief when his uncle looked away. Corrado pulled out the phone, silencing the ringing before casually slipping it back into his pocket. He sat unmoving for a moment, his expression vacant and shoulders relaxed, but Carmine could tell from the way he flexed his fingers at his side that he was stressed.</p><p>And Corrado on edge was never good for anybody.</p><p>He draped his arm over Celia\u2019s shoulder and pulled her closer, whispering something in her ear. She tensed as she listened, glancing past him to where Carmine stood by the door. When he saw her worry, every ounce of relief he had felt a moment before washed away. Something was going on, and based on Celia\u2019s expression, whatever Corrado had planned most likely concerned him.</p> <p>Carmine wasn\u2019t surprised. As long as Salvatore was still out there, somewhere, his life was at risk. Glancing at Haven again, his paranoia flared. They had fought to keep her out of the line of fire, and she had unknowingly walked right onto the battlefield.</p><p>He stood there for another minute, his unease growing until it all got to be too much. He slipped out of the room quietly, desperate for a drink, hoping it would help him clear the convoluted thoughts from his head. He ducked outside, surveying the streets quickly for any sign of trouble, but someone called his name before he could get more than a few steps away. Carmine froze at the sound of the voice and glanced behind him, seeing Corrado following.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving without saying anything? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Carmine sighed as his uncle paused beside him on the sidewalk. \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Corrado shook his head. \u201cAs many times as I speak to you about your behavior, you\u2019d think it would sink in by now! You have absolutely no respect for your family. You treat them as if they\u2019re disposable to you. Do you even care what they\u2019re going through right now? Your father\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><p>Carmine scoffed defensively, words flying from his mouth as he lost his temper. \u201cYeah, because of you.\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s eyes darkened. He grabbed Carmine before he could utter another word and slammed him back against the brick house. Clutching his throat tightly, Corrado pinned him there, cutting off the flow of air. Carmine desperately grasped at his large hands, trying to pry them off as he struggled to breathe, but Corrado\u2019s grip was too strong.</p><p>\u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you won\u2019t ever speak to me like that again,\u201d Corrado said, his voice low and laced with venom. \u201cYour family is in enough pain right now. Don\u2019t make me give them another reason to grieve.\u201d</p><p>He let go and took a few steps back as Carmine bent over, gasping for air. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he spat, his eyes burning with tears. Corrado stepped forward again and Carmine flew upright immediately, holding his hands up defensively. \u201cChrist, I didn\u2019t mean it! I, uh . . . I\u2019m sorry, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cThis entire time I\u2019ve been cutting you slack because you can\u2019t get over whatever you shared with Haven, and now that she\u2019s here, this is how you act? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong is she shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he gasped, still trying to catch his breath. \u201cShe\u2019s going to get hurt. They\u2019re all going to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re avoiding them to keep them safe?\u201d Corrado laughed bitterly. \u201cWell, that\u2019s . . . honorable, I suppose, but it\u2019s also insulting. Do you honestly believe I won\u2019t protect them? That I can\u2019t? They\u2019re my responsibility. Keeping them safe is my job. If I didn\u2019t know Haven would be perfectly fine in your presence, she wouldn\u2019t be here right now. If I thought you posed some danger to my wife, I wouldn\u2019t let you within a hundred feet of her.\u201d</p><p>Corrado paused as his phone rang again, to silence it once more. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m telling you?\u201d he asked, continuing as if it never interrupted. \u201cThe odds of Haven dying in an accident are far greater than the odds of her being killed because of someone as trivial as you. Because that\u2019s exactly what you are\u2014insignificant. Do you get that? You\u2019re nothing.\u201d</p><p>He paused once more as his phone rang again, anger clouding his face at the sound, but this time he didn\u2019t even bother to look at who was calling. \u201cI have things to take care of. Go be with people who actually care about you. Don\u2019t waste the chance. You never know when you might only have a few hours left to enjoy them.\u201d</p><p>A chill ran the length of Carmine\u2019s spine at his words. He stood there for a moment after Corrado left, trying to calm down, and bummed a cigarette from the first person that happened to stroll by. The smoke burned his lungs as he inhaled, the nicotine instantly soothing his frazzled nerves. He took a few quick puffs of the cheap generic menthol before tossing it onto the sidewalk and stamping it out.</p><p>The house was still noisy when he reentered, but the crowd from the living room had disbursed. He wandered through the downstairs and found Celia in the kitchen, surprise flickering across her face when she spotted him. \u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he mumbled, grabbing a bottle of water from the fridge. He desperately wanted a real drink, something hard and straight from a glass bottle, but he knew better than to pull out the alcohol there. \u201cIs, uh . . . I mean, where . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out back,\u201d Celia said, knowing what he wanted without Carmine even getting it out.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He headed for the back door, spotting them lounging on the old wicker lawn furniture as soon as he stepped outside. He strolled in their direction, suddenly nervous again, but it all faded away when Haven looked at him. A radiant smile lit up her face as her eyes sparkled. His heart nearly stilled at the sight.</p><p>It took everything Carmine had in him not to fall to his knees right then and there and beg her to always look at him that way. He wanted to plead with her to never stop loving him, for her to forgive him for everything he ever did wrong, even the shit she didn\u2019t know about and never would. He wanted her to grant him absolution, to be his saving grace, to swear he was worthy of being saved. He never wanted her to be ashamed, and he sure as hell never wanted to see disappointment in her eyes. He wanted her to be proud, and at that moment, he wanted to swear he would do anything she ever asked of him to make it so.</p><p>But instead, he choked back the flood of emotion and kept his mouth shut as he grabbed a chair from the patio and joined them out on the lawn. He sat beside Dominic and directly across from Haven, his eyes fixated solely on her.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro,\u201d Dominic said, slapping Carmine on the back. \u201cBack already?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201dI never left. I just went out for some air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure you went out for air,\u201d Tess said sarcastically. \u201cYou smell like smoke. Go sit downwind from me. It reeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wind isn\u2019t even blowing, Tess,\u201d he said. \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s soft voice captured his attention, an inquisitive look on her face. \u201cYou smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery now and then I\u2019ll have one, but I don\u2019t make a habit of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of habits . . .\u201d Dominic motioned toward the bottle in Carmine\u2019s hand. \u201cIs that really water, bro? It\u2019s not usually your beverage of choice.\u201d</p><p>Carmine narrowed his eyes. \u201cYes, it\u2019s water. Is it that hard to believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. The only clear liquid you\u2019ve had to drink in a year is vodka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You can\u2019t say that when you haven\u2019t even seen me much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ve been drunk the entire time,\u201d Tess chimed in, laughing humorlessly. \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t even remember seeing us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink that much,\u201d he retorted, knowing it was a lie the moment the words came out. He\u2019d drunk himself unconscious more times than he could count. There were definite blank spots in his memory, entire days he couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cDid you drink at all today?\u201d Dia asked from her seat beside Haven.</p><p>\u201cYeah, where\u2019s your flask?\u201d Dominic asked. \u201cDo you have it with you?\u201d</p><p>Carmine dropped his gaze. The subject made him want a drink even worse than he already had. He started rubbing his neck absentmindedly, his anxiety growing. \u201cWhat is this, an intervention?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Dominic replied.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re wasting your breath, because I don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe disagree,\u201d Dia said. \u201cYou always drank, but it\u2019s worse now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it the fuck alone, Dia.\u201d</p> <p>She started to argue but Tess cut her off. \u201cLet\u2019s just drop it. So, yeah, he drinks. Whatever. At least he\u2019s not messing around with Molly anymore.\u201d</p><p>A tense silence instantly strangled them. Carmine slowly raised his eyes to glare at Tess, anger surging through him. She saw his hostile expression and blanched, starting to stammer about not meaning it how it sounded, but he stopped her. \u201cJust . . . shut the fuck up, Tess. Talk about something else, whatever you all were talking about before I interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were reminiscing,\u201d Dominic said, casting Carmine a worried look as he quickly changed the subject. \u201cSharing some of our favorite memories of Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, continue,\u201d he responded, opening his bottle of water to take a drink. It was cold and went down smooth, none of the burn or warmth he craved.</p><p>The atmosphere grew a bit lighter as they shared stories and traded playful jabs. Haven seemed at ease as she smiled and laughed, but she didn\u2019t contribute much to the conversation. He yearned to hear her voice and listen to her stories, to know what she had done off on her own. He wanted to know everything, a twinge of jealousy brewing deep within him when he thought about how much he must have missed. She had an entire life he knew nothing about.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t like that shit one bit.</p><p>Celia joined them when the other guests started leaving, sharing a few more stories of her own. Every now and then Haven would peek at Carmine and her cheeks would turn pink, hints of the timid girl he remembered shining through. The sight of it gave Carmine hope, something he hadn\u2019t felt since walking out that door in Durante.</p><p>Maybe they had a chance. Maybe she could forgive him someday.</p><p>\u201cTess, babe, we need to get going,\u201d Dominic said eventually, the two of them standing. Dominic glanced around at everyone, his eyes locking with Carmine\u2019s momentarily. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice hanging out again. We need to get together more often, not just when, you know . . . something happens.\u201d</p><p>Everyone murmured in agreement.</p><p>They said their good-byes, making Haven promise to stay in touch, before heading out. Dia departed right afterward, scurrying away to leave Haven and Carmine alone. They sat quietly, gazing at each other, the air between them growing thick with unspoken questions.</p> <p>\u201cDo you, uh . . .\u201d he started, unsure of what to say. \u201cFuck, I don\u2019t know. Do you wanna get coffee or something? Is that what people do?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know about other people, but it sounds nice to me.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s nerves flared again, queasiness stirring in the pit of his stomach. He was afraid he would say something wrong and ruin any chance he had at fixing things.</p><p>He held his hand out to her but she simply gazed at it, the apprehensive look on her face making him second-guess himself. He dropped his hand, shoving it in his pocket when she didn\u2019t take it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I just thought, well . . . Christ, why is this so fucking awkward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said as she stood. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just us, right? And it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to hold your hand, but you\u2019re injured and I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He pulled his hand back out to look at it. \u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna hurt me.\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip nervously as she offered her hand to Carmine this time. He took it with a smile, lacing their fingers together and squeezing gently. Pain shot through his wrist and he winced, his hand clearly not fine despite what he had said.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Haven asked. \u201cHonestly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he muttered, letting go of her and unwrapping the white bandage. \u201cThe medic said it wasn\u2019t serious, but I didn\u2019t go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Haven surveyed his hand. The back of it was red and she pressed her fingers to the skin, sighing when he grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s infected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d She raised her eyebrows at Carmine like it was a stupid question. \u201cWe got hurt a lot in Blackburn and weren\u2019t allowed to see doctors, so we learned to watch for the signs. I\u2019ve seen people die from wounds less severe than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, looking at his hand. \u201cCan\u2019t I just soak it in peroxide? Get some Neosporin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo stubborn,\u201d she muttered, lacing their fingers together once more. \u201cIt\u2019s better to get antibiotics, so go to the doctor. Please?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, resigned and partly annoyed that she knew how to get to him. All it took was a fucking please. \u201cI\u2019ll make an appointment tomorrow, but right now I have a, uh . . . whatever this is. A date, I guess.\u201d</p><p>A small smile curved Haven\u2019s lips at those words.</p><p>They headed around the side of the house to avoid seeing anyone as they left, because Carmine wasn\u2019t in the mood for their pity disguised as sympathy. He was on edge as they walked down the street, keeping his head down but acutely aware of everything going on around them. It didn\u2019t matter what Corrado had said\u2014he couldn\u2019t stop his paranoia. Salvatore was still out there, somewhere, and until he was sure that was dealt with, there was no way he would be able to relax.</p><p>Carmine let go of her when they reached his house and unlocked the front door. She stepped inside, her eyes darting around curiously. It didn\u2019t escape Carmine\u2019s notice that she cringed at the utter mess.</p><p>\u201cUh, kitchen, dining room, living room, bathroom and laundry room or whatever,\u201d he said, pointing out the areas on the first floor. \u201cThe room down the hall across from the living room used to be my father\u2019s office when I was a kid but right now it\u2019s just full of boxes. I never bothered to unpack everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here over a year and you still haven\u2019t unpacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you cleaned at all in that time?\u201d</p><p>He blinked a few times, gazing at her, but didn\u2019t bother answering that question. \u201cMake yourself at home. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Carmine left her alone in the hallway as he headed upstairs and kicked off his shoes, tossing them into the closet before stripping out of his clothes. He put on a pair of jeans and a green long-sleeved t-shirt, slipping his Nike\u2019s on before going into the bathroom. He wet his hair and attempted to run his fingers through it, the act making his hand viciously throb. He rooted through the cabinets and found a bottle of peroxide, the wound scorching as he poured it on his hand.</p><p>He headed back downstairs and found Haven in the living room, staring at the covered piano. She glanced back at him questioningly. \u201cCarmine, who\u2019s Molly?\u201d</p><p>He froze, caught off guard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if she was, uh, you know . . . it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d She grimaced, her reaction at odds with her words. \u201cI just wondered if you and her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolly\u2019s not a person,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cMolly\u2019s a drug. I wanted to feel better and got hooked on it. It probably would\u2019ve killed me . . . well, fuck, it almost did kill me, but I\u2019d definitely be dead by now if Corrado hadn\u2019t intervened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got you off of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that.\u201d</p><p>She stared at Carmine as she took in his words. \u201dDid it work?\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201dI told you I stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean Molly,\u201d she clarified. \u201dDid it make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>He sighed as he considered the question. \u201cIt did for a while, but it wasn\u2019t real. No matter how high I got, I never found what I was looking for. And it ended up taking from me more than it gave.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into a hug and she gazed up at him, her eyes sparkling. The air around them grew thick with emotion as she wrapped her arms around his waist. His heart raced, blood rushing furiously through his veins as his body tingled from her embrace. He moved forward a bit, hesitantly, gauging her reaction, and her eyes seemed to instinctively dart to his mouth. He took that as a sign and hoped like hell it wasn\u2019t a mistake when he leaned down, aiming for her mouth.</p><p>At the last second, panic overtook Haven\u2019s face. She pulled back, turning her head so his lips brushed against her flushed cheek. He silently cursed himself as he let go of her. Too soon.</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . .\u201d She picked at her fingernails, moving away from him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d He glanced at his watch with a sigh. It was already a little after seven in the evening. \u201cHow about that coffee?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, reaching into her pocket and pulling out her keys. She tossed them at Carmine with no warning, and he barely got a grasp on them before they hit the floor. He eyed them peculiarly, spotting the familiar key. \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s parked out front,\u201d she said. \u201cThought maybe you\u2019d like to drive.\u201d</p><p>Carmine cruised through the streets of east Chicago, lounged back in the driver\u2019s seat of the black Mazda. The dark interior smelled just as fresh as it had the last time he had driven it, the plush leather seat somehow still formed to his shape. North Carolina radio stations were programmed for the buttons of the stereo, the dial turned to his favorite\u201497.1 FM. A black tree-shaped air freshener hung from the rearview mirror, and he suspected it was the same one he had put there back in Durante.</p><p>\u201cDid you even drive this thing?\u201d he asked, looking at the mileage . . . a few hundred miles more than he remembered it being.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cI drove it here last night.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head, turning his focus back to the street. He pulled into the parking lot of the first coffee shop they saw, politely opening Haven\u2019s door for her. She smiled sweetly and took his hand as they headed inside. Customers packed the small building, standing in groups and huddling around the tables.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d Haven asked as they got in line.</p><p>Carmine laughed dryly. \u201cI can\u2019t say I like anything. I don\u2019t drink coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you ask me out for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured I had a better chance of you saying yes to something as simple as a drink than a whole meal,\u201d he said, gazing at the menu board. \u201cChrist, who pays five dollars for a drink that doesn\u2019t have alcohol in it? For that price it better come with a complimentary blow job or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d she gasped, his rant drawing the attention of people around them. He muttered an apology to her and noticed a man a few feet away glaring at them. He narrowed his eyes at him as he mouthed \u201cProblem?\u201d and the man looked away quickly. Carmine smirked, looking back at the menu as Haven spoke again. \u201cDo you see anything you think you might like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what any of this is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Italian I can read, but that doesn\u2019t tell me a damn thing about how it tastes. What do you drink?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBlack coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? All of this fancy caramel chai frappe cappu-fucking-ccino venti latte bullshit and you get plain coffee?\u201d She nodded and he chuckled, pulling her hand up and pressing a kiss on the back of it. \u201cThat\u2019s the Haven I remember, the one who likes the simple shit.\u201d</p><p>The barista asked Carmine for their order and he muttered, \u201cTwo regular black coffees,\u201d his expression daring her to try to correct his lingo. She simply nodded as she rang it up, and he groaned when he saw the price.</p><p>\u201cI have some cash on me,\u201d Haven said, reaching into her pocket. \u201cI think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t even dare,\u201d he said, shooting her an incredulous look. \u201cI\u2019d rob the place before I let you pay.\u201d</p><p>She removed her hand as he grabbed his wallet, pulling out a twenty-dollar bill. The woman gave Carmine his change, eyeing him warily, and he slipped a ten into the tip jar on the counter.</p><p>\u201cThat was generous,\u201d Haven commented.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I kinda just threatened to rob the place, so I figured I probably shouldn\u2019t stiff them on top of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t actually rob the place, though,\u201d she said confidently.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cAs long as I wasn\u2019t ordered to, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grabbed their drinks, leading her to a table in the corner away from everyone else. They sat and Carmine took a sip from his steaming cup, gagging from the taste. \u201cThis shit is bitter.\u201d</p><p>She took a drink of hers. \u201cTastes fine to me.\u201d</p><p>He dumped in as much sugar as he could fit, adding some creamer to make it a bit more tolerable, but he still had no desire to drink it. They chatted as Haven sipped her coffee, and he listened intently as she told him about her life in New York. She talked about going to school and creating art, about the people she had met and the friends she had made, before she explained about hearing the details of his father\u2019s death on the news.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the first time I wanted to come. When I was in Charlotte, I ran out in the middle of the night and took a cab to the bus station.\u201d She laughed humorlessly at the memory. \u201cI was out of my mind, hadn\u2019t slept in a while. Your father stopped me. That\u2019s what I was talking about at Celia\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Carmine gaped at her. \u201cYou could\u2019ve been arrested for suspicious behavior. The cops don\u2019t fuck around, you know. Everyone\u2019s worried about terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed it off. \u201cI don\u2019t look like a terrorist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither do I, but looks don\u2019t mean shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t a terrorist,\u201d she refuted. \u201cSo that proves my point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t prove shit. I terrorize people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same,\u201d she said, narrowing her eyes as annoyance flashed across her face. \u201cYou\u2019re being too hard on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re just being too easy on me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me,\u201d she said seriously.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me anything?\u201d she asked, cocking an eyebrow in challenge. \u201cOr is it just that you don\u2019t want to tell me because you don\u2019t want me to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to know. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to run out that door because of something you tell me, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t tell me, I understand, but don\u2019t hide things from me just because you believe it\u2019s better if I don\u2019t know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo good can come from you knowing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll look at me and you won\u2019t see me anymore. You\u2019ll see them. You\u2019ll see the people I\u2019ve hurt and the things I\u2019ve done, so excuse me if I sorta fucking like you seeing just me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond but hesitated briefly, leaning her elbows on the table and moving closer to Carmine. \u201cHave you had to, uh . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill?\u201d he asked, finishing her question. She glanced around anxiously to make sure no one was listening before nodding. He could see the curiosity in her eyes, but he could also see the apprehension. That was something he never wanted from her. \u201cWould it make a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you did, I know it\u2019s because you had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Carmine cautiously. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s the answer, Haven. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She was quiet for a moment, appearing deep in thought. \u201cIs that what you see when you look in the mirror? The people you\u2019ve hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the good when there\u2019s so much damn bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see the good.\u201d She smiled softly as she gazed at Carmine. \u201cIt might help you to talk to someone, though. You shouldn\u2019t keep it all bottled in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not going to tell you that shit,\u201d he replied, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI meant, like, a professional.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cAre you suggesting I go to a shrink?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhy not? I know there are some things you can\u2019t tell them, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t help at all. I saw a movie where a mobster guy went to a psychiatrist, and so did that other one in that TV show. He was the boss, too.\u201d</p><p>Carmine smirked when it struck him what she had said. He tried to contain his amusement, but his laughter escaped when a blush overtook Haven\u2019s face. \u201cAw, don\u2019t be embarrassed,\u201d he said, reaching across the table and cupping her cheek. It was warm against his palm and she leaned into his touch, smiling sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet of you to worry, but this isn\u2019t like TV, tesoro. We can\u2019t do that shit in real life.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her cheek softly as she whispered, \u201cI wish you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>The sun had set by the time they left the coffee shop, darkness surrounding everything. He held her hand as they strolled through the parking lot toward the car, the atmosphere between them light once again. It felt like a weight had been lifted from his chest, his world just a tad brighter since she had walked back into it.</p><p>The carefree feeling didn\u2019t last, though\u2014not that he had actually expected it to. They made it back to his house and he asked if she wanted to watch a movie, but they barely made it through the opening credits before his phone rang.</p><p>He pulled it out hesitantly, tensing. Corrado. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe in front of my house in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he grumbled, but responding was pointless because Corrado had already hung up. He slipped the phone back in his pocket and looked at Haven, running his hand through his hair anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go,\u201d she said quietly, a tinge of sadness in her voice, but she forced a smile. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>She started to stand but he grabbed her arm to stop her. \u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Carmine with confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just . . . fuck. Just stay, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s late. I should find a hotel.\u201d</p><p>He groaned loudly, the noise sounding like a growl. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not telling you what to do. If you want to go, tesoro, by all means go, but I\u2019d rather you stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . .\u201d she started, but she trailed off when his phone rang again.</p><p>Five minutes had already passed.</p><p>Carmine cursed, answering it quickly. \u201cI\u2019m coming, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Corrado barked before hanging up.</p><p>Carmine stood, eyeing Haven carefully. \u201dJust . . . wait for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word but she also made no move to leave, so he wasn\u2019t sure what she was thinking. He didn\u2019t have time to stick around and figure it out, though, so he gave her one last look before grabbing his gun and bolting for the door. He stepped outside as a memory hit him, the last time he had said those words to her running through his mind.</p><p>She had refused to wait for him that day.</p><p>He glanced behind him at the house as he headed down the street, hoping like hell she would wait this time.</p><p>41</p><p>Carmine\u2019s phone was ringing again by the time he reached Corrado\u2019s, but he didn\u2019t bother answering it since he was so close. Corrado\u2019s car was parked along the curb, the headlights blacked out but engine running. Carmine climbed in the passenger side and gave his uncle a cautious glance, seeing the look of impatience on his face, and tensed in anticipation of him snapping. Corrado closed his phone and Carmine\u2019s instantly stopped ringing, but he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Corrado pulled away and sped down the street, waiting until he was a block away before flipping on his headlights. Carmine surveyed his uncle, noticing he wore his black leather gloves, and instantly knew something serious was happening.</p><p>\u201cI hope you had a nice time with Haven tonight,\u201d Corrado said, shattering the tense silence.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I did,\u201d Carmine replied. \u201cThank you for everything you did for her. She told me about it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason to thank me,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cI was only doing the job that was given to me, Carmine. That\u2019s what we do. Personal feelings are irrelevant. We follow orders and one thing you should know about me by now\u2014one thing I hope you respect me for\u2014is the fact that I don\u2019t fail when I take on a task. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And I didn\u2019t want to interrupt your evening, but it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Carmine eyed him warily, wondering what time it was, but Corrado didn\u2019t elaborate and Carmine knew better than to question him.</p><p>A bad feeling seeped into Carmine\u2019s bones as Corrado drove without saying another word toward a rough area in the south side of Chicago. It was fairly deserted except for the occasional scraggly passersby, the street aligned on both sides with condemned buildings covered in graffiti. It was gang territory, the part of town where they battled for control of corners no one really wanted in the first place. They killed one another for the fuck of it, for the right to rule the forsaken streets.</p><p>The fact that they were there, moving deeper into the midst of gangland territory, didn\u2019t sit well with Carmine. He reached under his shirt and felt his gun secured in his waistband, his thumb flicking the safety off just in case.</p><p>\u201cDo the thugs in this neighborhood scare you?\u201d Corrado asked, noticing his movement.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cI just know anyone who comes to this side of town is up to no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Corrado responded, pausing before adding, \u201cIt\u2019ll be over quick.\u201d</p><p>His cryptic words sent Carmine\u2019s heart pounding furiously. They neared the end of the main street and took a left onto another narrow road, stopping halfway down. Corrado cut the engine and opened his door, hesitating as he glanced at Carmine. \u201cLeave your gun in the car. You seem to have an itchy trigger finger tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Something was off, Carmine could sense it, and being unprotected was as good as asking to be killed.</p><p>\u201cYou heard what I said,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cDon\u2019t question me.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grabbed the gun and shoved it in the glove box. He had to do it. Corrado would have taken it.</p><p>Carmine followed Corrado across the street to a run-down house. It looked like it hadn\u2019t been inhabited in decades, the shutters barely hanging by their hinges and old wooden boards nailed up along the windowpanes, the glass long gone. They stepped on the porch and Corrado knocked twice on the large door. Before he could knock a third time, it opened. Corrado walked in and Carmine followed him cautiously, his eyes falling upon an Italian man right inside. He was about Corrado\u2019s age and familiar, definitely a friend in the organization. He held a gun defensively, but he seemed to relax a bit when Corrado nodded at him.</p> <p>Their silent exchange made Carmine feel queasy, the bad feeling nearly overpowering him.</p><p>He tried to sort through his thoughts to make sense of what was happening, briefly considering bolting back out the door while he still had the chance. He wondered how far he could get while unarmed, but such a train of thought was senseless. He would be caught before he even made it off the porch. He needed to stay calm, to play cool, and not let them see his fear, even if that was exactly what he felt.</p><p>He was fucking terrified.</p><p>Corrado grabbed his arm as he shut the front door, shoving Carmine toward the staircase that the man started up. No one said a word, no instructions given as Carmine begrudgingly climbed the creaky steps with Corrado on his trail. He felt like cattle being herded to the slaughterhouse as he followed the man down a long hallway.</p><p>They approached a room, and Carmine froze in horror as soon as he stepped in the doorway. Vision blurring, his knees went weak as fear slammed into him. He nearly collapsed but Corrado grabbed him, keeping him on his feet as he pushed him farther into the room.</p> <p>The pieces of the puzzle clicked together in an instant. He should have sensed it earlier, should have known what was happening. The signs were all there. The look on Celia\u2019s face . . . Corrado\u2019s cryptic words . . . \u201cYou never know when you might only have a few hours left.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t want to interrupt your evening, but it\u2019s time . . .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll be over quick.\u201d</p><p>The moment he told Carmine to leave the gun in the car, he should have known what he would find in the house: his demise.</p><p>As his green eyes met the pair of dark, cold muddy ones across the room, it made sense. Corrado told him not to worry about retaliation because the entire time he had planned to take him straight to Salvatore.</p><p>The Boss stood in the corner of the empty room, near a shattered window with a single board nailed over it. Moonlight filtered inside, giving Carmine barely enough light to see. Salvatore appeared disheveled, his right arm bandaged sloppily in a blue sling. He took a few steps in their direction, his movements rigid like he could no longer bend his left knee.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d his raspy voice called, his eyes trained on Carmine as the other man strolled to the window to gaze out.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for being late, but you know how he can be,\u201d Corrado said behind Carmine, blocking the only exit.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know exactly how he can be.\u201d Salvatore\u2019s voice seethed with anger. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t listen. You tell him to do something and he ignores it. He seems to think he knows better than everyone else, like he\u2019s above us all and doesn\u2019t have to fall in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he certainly is his father\u2019s son,\u201d Corrado said.</p><p>Carmine sensed something in his uncle\u2019s voice, amusement with a hint of sarcasm. He started to turn around to look at him, to get a read on his mood, but Corrado grabbed the back of his neck roughly, keeping him in position.</p><p>Rage flashed in Salvatore\u2019s expression at the mention of Vincent. He angrily spit on the floor with disgust, like just the thought of him made him sick.</p><p>Carmine shook, his eyes darting around the room. The sins of the father were about to be paid for by the son. His brain worked a million miles a minute as he tried to think of some way out. He was unarmed and outnumbered, everyone in the room more experienced than him.</p><p>\u201cLooking for a way to escape?\u201d Salvatore asked, slowly approaching. \u201cPity for you, there isn\u2019t one.\u201d</p><p>Corrado violently shoved him toward the ground, forcing him on his knees in the middle of the room. He let go of the back of his neck and withdrew his gun.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this!\u201d Carmine pleaded, the words tumbling from his mouth. \u201cI swear, just . . . fuck! This isn\u2019t necessary!\u201d</p> <p>Before he could say any more, Corrado shoved the muzzle of his gun against the back of Carmine\u2019s skull. He closed his eyes, tears burning their way to the surface as he bowed his head in desperation.</p><p>If there\u2019s a fucking God, He won\u2019t let me die today.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you tell me what\u2019s necessary!\u201d Salvatore yelled. \u201cThis is what I was talking about! You think you know better than everyone! I gave you a simple order, and you had every opportunity to do it, but you disobeyed me! Vincent never would\u2019ve hurt you, and now, because you betrayed me, my men are dead! Your father got what he deserved, and frankly so did your mother! Your entire family is a disgrace!\u201d</p><p>Carmine fought back a sob, his body shaking violently at those words. His world was imploding and there was a gun pointed at the back of his head.</p><p>Corrado was a perfect shot. He never missed his target.</p><p>His uncle, his own fucking family . . .</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Carmine whispered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t fucking do this.\u201d</p><p>As soon as those words passed his lips, something slammed hard into the back of Carmine\u2019s head. He fell forward onto his hands and knees, splinters of wood from the floorboards digging into his palms.</p><p>He knew he couldn\u2019t give up. He couldn\u2019t go down without a fight. He wouldn\u2019t win, but he wasn\u2019t a coward. He wouldn\u2019t just stand there and let them steal his life. Maybe a month ago he would have, or even yesterday, but not now. Not today.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>The lone word slipping from Corrado\u2019s lips set Carmine in motion. He dropped flat against the floor and rolled as a deafening bang sounded, the gunshot echoing in the room. He braced himself for a scorching bullet to tear into his flesh, but he felt nothing. No blood. No pain.</p><p>Adrenaline or sheer fucking luck?</p><p>Carmine forced himself to his feet and turned for the door when something across the room captured his attention. The man at the window dropped with a thump to the floor, blood pouring from a wound dead center in his forehead. Salvatore turned in horror as Corrado knocked Carmine to the floor again on his hands and knees. As he scurried away, Carmine watched in shock as Corrado used the distraction to swiftly reach into Salvatore\u2019s waistband with his left hand and pull a pistol from it.</p><p>Salvatore turned back around, his eyes wide when he saw both guns now pointed at his head. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollowing orders,\u201d Corrado said calmly. \u201cWhen I initiated, I took an oath. I swore to Antonio DeMarco that I would be a man of honor, a man who always put the organization first. They may just be words to some, but they have meaning to me. La Cosa Nostra or death. That\u2019s what I swore. I choose La Cosa Nostra and always have. It\u2019s a real pity you chose death, sir.\u201d</p><p>Corrado lowered his gun and fired two shots, bullets ripping through both of Salvatore\u2019s knees. He let out a blood-curdling scream as he collapsed. Corrado stood stoically as Salvatore desperately tried to pull himself away, his legs gushing blood and soaking his gray pants.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what happens to rats, Carmine?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cWhat we do to vermin, the disloyal and dishonorable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he responded weakly, his voice shaking. It was an urban legend within the organization, a story everyone whispered about but had no proof it ever happened. \u201cRats for the rats.\u201d</p><p>Corrado took the few steps toward Salvatore, thrusting his foot out and kicking him square in the nose. Carmine flinched as Salvatore cried out, trying to shield himself as Corrado kicked him a few times in quick succession. The brutality in his uncle\u2019s movements terrified him, anger and passion erupting from him. He did it again and again until Salvatore\u2019s face poured blood like a leaky faucet.</p><p>\u201cThis place is infested,\u201d Corrado said, his words strained as he fought to catch his breath. The rage had taken a toll on his composure. \u201cIf you listen carefully, you can hear them in the walls, scratching and scurrying around. It won\u2019t take the rats long to catch a whiff of the blood. As soon as they realize there\u2019s fresh meat, they\u2019ll swarm. It\u2019s a brutal way to go, being eaten alive.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s stomach churned ruthlessly and he resisted the urge to gag. What kind of monster would think to do such a thing?</p><p>Corrado turned to him as if he had heard Carmine\u2019s silent question, the vacant expressionless mask enshrouding his face the only answer he needed. He seemed inhuman, the monster from the legends, the one he had heard about. The Kevlar Killer. No remorse, no emotion, and absolutely no conscience. \u201cSal knows this already. It\u2019s why he chose this place. He just didn\u2019t anticipate being the one to face the horror.\u201d</p><p>Corrado slipped his gun back in his coat, ignoring Salvatore\u2019s incessant yelling. He focused his attention on the pistol he had taken from the Boss, removing bullets from it one by one. He spun the chamber as he started toward the door, pausing in the doorway to lay the pistol on the floor. \u201cI left a single bullet in your gun, Salamander. It\u2019ll take you a while to drag yourself over here to it, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll manage if you want the suffering to end. The choice is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou traitor!\u201d Salvatore spat. \u201cYou\u2019ll burn in Hell for this!\u201d</p><p>Corrado laughed bitterly. \u201cI\u2019ll probably burn in Hell for most of what I\u2019ve done in my life, but this is one of the few things I feel is actually worth it.\u201d</p><p>He walked out without another word.</p><p>The moment Carmine heard his uncle\u2019s footsteps on the stairs, he jumped to his feet and ran after him, tripping on a loose board and nearly falling in his haste. He could still hear Salvatore screaming as they exited the house but it didn\u2019t seem to faze Corrado as he headed for the car.</p><p>Carmine opened the door to climb in the passenger seat when it all hit him. Hunching over, he dry heaved on the road.</p><p>Corrado waited patiently for Carmine to get himself together before starting the car to drive away.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t people hear him screaming?\u201d Carmine asked as he wiped his watery eyes.</p><p>\u201cPossibly, but it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he replied. \u201cLike you said, anyone who comes to this neighborhood is up to no good.\u201d</p><p>They drove in silence, the atmosphere suffocating. Carmine had reached the end of his rope, on the verge of a breakdown as he tentatively clung to the last shred of his sanity. It pressed upon Carmine, the memory of everything he had been through tearing through his system at once\u2014the chaos, the destruction, the pain, the murder.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d he choked out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrado glanced at him. \u201cWould you rather it had been you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Sal.\u201d He shook his head as the tears continued to stream from his eyes. \u201cMy father.\u201d</p><p>Corrado let out an exasperated sigh and swung a sudden right, pulling the car along the curb and cutting the engine.</p><p>\u201cYour father died a long time ago,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cJust because he was walking around and breathing doesn\u2019t mean he was alive, Carmine. We die the day we lose the will to go on. We die the day we stop caring about life. The Vincent I knew, the man who made you, whose blood flows through your veins, ceased to exist when you were eight years old. He died in that hospital room as he held vigil beside your bed, mourning the loss of his wife. I watched every painful second of it as it happened and did nothing to stop his death.\u201d</p> <p>Corrado avoided looking at Carmine, instead staring out at the vibrant full moon in the sky. \u201cHe had work to do, so he kept going until it was done. He\u2019d finally finished, so it was time for him to go. To him, it was better than the alternative. He had no intention of going to prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would he?\u201d Carmine asked, shaking his head. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be this way. I mean, the Feds . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cYour father didn\u2019t make a deal for himself. He didn\u2019t turn state\u2019s evidence against me. He accepted his fate long ago. Your father cooperated for you. He cooperated for Haven and everyone else you love. He gave them what they wanted so they\u2019d leave his family alone, and in the process he did Maura\u2019s memory justice by saving a young girl.\u201d</p><p>Corrado paused briefly to collect his thoughts before he continued. \u201cHe\u2019d made his decision, but I couldn\u2019t let him do it himself. He wouldn\u2019t find the peace he sought if he did. He wanted to be with your mother. He wanted to live again, with her. I made it so he could.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at him as he processed his words. \u201cWhy\u2019d you ask him for forgiveness then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you pulled the trigger, you said \u2018Forgive me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking him.\u201d</p><p>Starting the car up again, Corrado pulled away from the curb. \u201cWe have one more thing to take care of tonight, so pull yourself together.\u201d</p><p>They drove across town to the run-down strip club, the one he had been to before when Corrado killed Remy. The crummy lot was packed, the back row filled entirely with familiar sedans. Corrado parked along the side of the building, climbing out and glancing around cautiously. \u201cAre you registered to vote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d Carmine said as he got out of the car.</p> <p>Corrado nodded, as if that answer didn\u2019t surprise him, and motioned for Carmine to follow him inside. The club was packed, the air thick with smoke. They slipped by the bouncer without saying a word, Carmine keeping his attention on his uncle as they headed to the back room.</p><p>\u201cVoting\u2019s important,\u201d Corrado said, pausing at the cellar door. \u201cPeople like to feel like they actually have a say in what happens, even if it\u2019s just an illusion.\u201d</p><p>Corrado opened the cellar door and voices filtered out instantly, but they quieted once they descended the stairs. Carmine hesitated on the bottom step, looking around the small grimy space with shock. There were at least twenty-five men present, mostly Capos from what he could tell\u2014the highest-ranking men left within the collapsing organization. They all looked at Corrado as he entered and he nodded toward another man, who cleared his throat to gain everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cWe all know why we\u2019re here. Nominations?\u201d</p><p>A few people said Corrado\u2019s name, while others just murmured in agreement.</p><p>\u201cAny others?\u201d</p><p>The basement remained completely silent.</p><p>\u201cAny objections?\u201d the man asked. \u201cSpeak now or take it to the grave.\u201d</p><p>Carmine looked around. The men appeared nervous, their shifty eyes everywhere except for on Corrado. The room once again remained silent, no one speaking up.</p> <p>The entire scene was strange to Carmine.</p><p>\u201cMoretti it is, then,\u201d the man said. \u201cThis meeting never happened.\u201d</p><p>Corrado turned back around, motioning for Carmine to go right back up the stairs without having spoken a single word. They headed out to the parking lot, pausing beside the car not more than five minutes after arriving. \u201cLike I said, people like to believe they have a choice, even if they really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Corrado got in the driver\u2019s side and Carmine slipped into the passenger seat, eyeing him warily. \u201cYou\u2019re the Don now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would\u2019ve happened if someone objected? Would they have been allowed to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would\u2019ve certainly left the room,\u201d he replied. \u201cJust in a dozen pieces.\u201d</p><p>Carmine listened for sounds as he opened the front door, noting the house was completely silent, but the glow from the television illuminated the living room. Haven lay on the couch fast asleep, her shoes kicked off and sitting on the floor in front of her.</p><p>Carmine walked over and crouched down, stealthily slipping his gun under the couch before pushing some stray hair from her face. She stirred a bit but still slept, and he remained there for a moment, just watching her breathe.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been sure before, it was at that moment he knew it. It was then, watching her sleep, that he felt it. He didn\u2019t know what would happen in the future, but somehow they would make it if they gave it a try.</p><p>He fought back tears again, still unable to get himself under control. Life overwhelmed him, tugging him in opposite directions while he stood stagnant, trying to remain whole. He was surrounded by violence and death, the ugliness eating away at him, but then, on the other side, there was her. She was peace, and hope, and pure fucking beauty. She was the good that he hoped would overpower the bad.</p><p>\u201cHaven,\u201d he whispered, running the back of his hand along her cheek. \u201cLa mia bella ragazza.\u201d</p><p>She stirred again and opened her eyes, blinking rapidly with confusion. It seemed to strike her where she was, a sleepy smile curving her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. I told you I wouldn\u2019t run from you, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t either,\u201d he said, smiling softly. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou swear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking know I do.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, eyeing Carmine curiously as she sat up. She placed her right hand on his cheek, gently stroking his skin and brushing her thumb along his mouth. \u201cHave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he replied, leaning forward to softly press his lips to hers. She didn\u2019t pull away that time, didn\u2019t turn her head. Instead, she moved her mouth in rhythm with his. It was sweet, and innocent, but it was enough.</p><p>He ducked his head and nuzzled into her neck, inhaling deeply as he kissed the exposed skin. Her presence was overwhelming, the touch and scent and taste of her driving him wild.</p><p>\u201cDo you still feel that?\u201d he asked, nipping at the skin near her collarbone. \u201cThe electricity between us? Please tell me you feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Haven,\u201d he said, his voice cracking as the words caught in his throat.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>A strangled sob escaped his throat, the sound causing her to grip him tighter, and she whispered quietly as he cried in her arms. He couldn\u2019t seem to stop himself\u2014she destroyed his walls all over again, broke Carmine down so it all came flooding out.</p><p>42</p><p>Life was a whirlwind, each day rapidly morphing into the next. Haven stayed with Carmine, things between them relaxed as she made herself at home. It was platonic, except for the occasional kiss and gentle touch.</p><p>Exhausted, Carmine grew wearier every day. Nightmares plagued his sleep and he tried his best to stay sober, but the liquor seemed to call to him. Haven never said a word about it, but he could see the concern in her eyes whenever she saw him take a drink. The looks got to Carmine, guilt chipping away at him every time he swallowed the harsh liquid.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough to make him stop.</p><p>Despite that, things were going well\u2014almost too well, in fact. Carmine was waiting for everything to cave in around them. It felt too good to be true, like he had missed the fine print listing an expiration date.</p><p>People left them alone, though, much to his surprise. He thought for sure his brother would be knocking the door down to see Haven, or Corrado would be calling to deal with business, but there was nothing.</p><p>No visits, no phone calls, not a goddamn thing.</p><p>It was almost a week later when there was finally a knock on the door. Carmine begrudgingly opened it, surprised to see a mailman standing on the porch. He glanced down at an envelope in his hand, squinting as he read the name. \u201cCarmine DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertified mail,\u201d he replied, handing a small card to Carmine to sign. He scribbled down his name before giving it back, and he handed Carmine the letter. He thanked him before shutting the door, strolling to the living room and plopping down on the couch beside Haven. He saw it was from the lawyer and tore the envelope open, pulling out a piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Haven asked.</p><p>His eyes scanned the letter. \u201cThey\u2019re reading my father\u2019s will on Monday. Apparently he left me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you sound surprised?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019re his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, shrugging as he set the paper down. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t feel real. I mean, I know it is\u2014I know he\u2019s gone. I fucking saw it. But it\u2019s still hard to believe it really happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d she replied. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I even want to think about right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, leaning over and pushing Carmine backward on the couch. She wrapped her arms around him and settled her head onto his chest as he grabbed the remote, turning on the TV and flipping through channels. They stayed that way the rest of the evening, forgetting about everything except what was happening within the walls of the house.</p><p>Once again, it didn\u2019t last. The next day, at the same exact time, there was another knock on the door. Carmine grumbled as he walked over to it, pulling the door open. The same mailman was standing on the porch, holding a familiar-looking envelope in his hand. \u201cFucking d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Weren\u2019t you just here for this shit?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and looked down at the envelope in his hand. \u201cHaven Antonelli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he responded, opening the door farther and yelling for Haven. She appeared, looking between Carmine and the mailman in confusion. He motioned toward the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s for you, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she asked with surprise, taking the card from the man. She signed her name to the bottom of it, her handwriting precise and perfect cursive. He smiled watching her, knowing how hard she fought to learn to do that. She handed the card back and he gave her the envelope, telling her to have a good day before departing. She didn\u2019t respond, just stood at the door staring at it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you surprised?\u201d he asked, playfully repeating her words from the day before. \u201cYou\u2019re his son\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at Carmine and raised her eyebrows. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I your girlfriend?\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated at her question. \u201cI don\u2019t know, are you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI asked you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s too soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her as he tried to make sense of their conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t know. This is fucking ridiculous, Haven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she said, turning her attention back to the envelope in her hand. \u201cI wonder what he left for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be anything,\u201d he replied as she opened it and read the paper giving her the time and date to appear. \u201cMoney, property . . . who knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d she asked. \u201cNone of that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out on Monday.\u201d</p><p>They spent the weekend together, catching movies and having dinner as he showed her around Chicago. Monday approached quickly and he dressed around noon, putting on some black slacks and a white button-down shirt, trying to look halfway decent since Corrado would be there. He slipped on a pair of black and white Nike\u2019s and headed downstairs while Haven was in the shower, opening the freezer and pulling out the bottle of Grey Goose. He took the top off the bottle and brought it to his lips, taking a big swig. It burned his throat but soothed his nerves, his anxiety lessening almost immediately.</p><p>They made it to the lawyer\u2019s office at exactly a quarter after one, right when the will reading was set to start. Haven sat in a large black office chair around the long wooden table, and Carmine pulled out the chair beside her to sit down. She smiled and reached under the table, taking his hand. The family surrounded them\u2014Celia and Corrado, Dominic and Tess. Even Carmine\u2019s grandmother was present, although she looked less than happy to be there with them.</p> <p>Mr. Borza cleared his throat to get started. \u201cEveryone here knew Vincent well, so I think we can all agree that he wouldn\u2019t mind if we kept it informal. He left a letter with his wishes, so I\u2019m just going to read it.\u201d</p><p>Haven fidgeted in her chair, looking at Carmine anxiously. He squeezed her hand, hoping she would relax as Mr. Borza started reading.</p><p>It\u2019s with a heavy heart that I write this. I\u2019m sorry for any pain I\u2019ve caused you all. Everything I\u2019ve done has been with you in mind, and I know I\u2019ve made mistakes, but I\u2019ve always tried to do what I felt was best. I don\u2019t expect you all to understand, but I hope with time you\u2019ll find peace with my decision. I assure you I have.</p><p>During the next twenty minutes, property was divided and personal items were bequeathed. The house in Durante went to Dominic, while the place in Chicago was officially turned over to Carmine. Tess was given a vast savings bond\u2014as was Dia, who couldn\u2019t be there\u2014while he left his mother enough money to sustain her.</p><p>Celia was left a bunch of mementos, while Corrado was given the key to a storage unit. The rest of his assets, his stocks and bank accounts, were to be split equally between Carmine and Dominic.</p><p>The reading was winding down when Haven\u2019s name was finally read. The eyes of everyone in the room darted to her. She fidgeted from the attention, the apprehension clear on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving you an envelope,\u201d Mr. Borza read. \u201cIt seems petty in comparison to what the others have been given, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll mind. What\u2019s inside is selfishly as much for me as it is for you, and I wish I would have delivered it in person like I originally planned, but this will have to do.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza held a white envelope out to Haven and she took it carefully. Curiosity burned inside of Carmine but he knew it was none of his business, so he turned his focus back to the lawyer.</p> <p>\u201cI have one last request,\u201d Mr. Borza read, \u201ca favor to ask of my son, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rolled his eyes. \u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed as Mr. Borza continued. \u201cI ask that he go to Saint Mary\u2019s Catholic Church and meet with Father Alberto. I left something there, something I think he\u2019ll someday need.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza set the letter down on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Carmine glanced at Haven, fighting back the emotion flooding him, and tensed when he saw tears streaming from her eyes. She had torn the envelope open and it sat on the table in front of her, her hand clutching a piece of paper she had pulled from it.</p><p>\u201cTesoro, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked quietly, reaching over and wiping the tears from her cheeks. She looked at him and shook her head before hesitantly holding the paper out to him. He took it carefully, smiling as he read the words scribbled in the middle.</p><p>You were worth it.</p><p>\u201cWe should celebrate,\u201d Celia said. \u201cHave a family dinner in honor of Vincent. We can go out somewhere, or I can cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Haven chimed in, shoving the paper back in the envelope.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t really cooked a meal in so long, since I was on my own. It\u2019ll be nice to do it again.\u201d</p><p>Celia smiled. \u201cWould you like to borrow my kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can do it at home.\u201d Almost instantly her eyes widened and she started stammering. \u201cI mean, you know, at Carmine\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged the corner of Carmine\u2019s lips. Home.</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean, sweetheart.\u201d Celia winked. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure I speak for everyone when I say we\u2019d love to have your cooking again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d Dominic declared. \u201cI\u2019ve missed it.\u201d</p><p>A few hours later, Carmine stood near the doorway of his kitchen, watching as Haven fluttered around, humming to herself. Groceries covered every inch of his counter, more food than had been brought into his house in over a year.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you need me to do?\u201d He knew enough to make a sandwich, but starting from scratch was something he had never had to do. \u201cI should do something.\u201d</p><p>He hoped Haven didn\u2019t have high expectations, because he was probably going to fuck things up . . . as usual.</p><p>\u201cUh, can you start the chicken?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He eyed the whole chicken wrapped in packaging on the counter. \u201cStart it, like, put it in the oven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need you to clean it.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018clean it\u2019? I\u2019m not plucking a fucking chicken.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have feathers, but you have to wash it out.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cDo I just wash it in the sink or what?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and grabbed a cutting board, setting it on the counter beside the sink. \u201cPull the insides out and run cold water over it.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the chicken and set it down on the cutting board, grabbing a knife and slicing open the packaging. Grabbing one of its legs, Carmine turned it around so the opening faced him. He stared at it for a moment with disgust before glancing at Haven. She was busy cracking raw eggs into a bowl of torn bread to make stuffing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to stick my hand up there?\u201d he asked, cocking an eyebrow at her when she nodded. He took a deep breath and thrust his hand inside, cringing at the feel of the cold poultry against his skin. He came upon a package of some sort and grabbed it. \u201cWhat is this, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the giblets,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cNeck, liver, gizzard, heart.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s eyes widened as he yanked his hand out, taking a step back in disgust. \u201cWhat the fuck? Why is that in there, Haven? Who wants a chicken heart?\u201d</p><p>Haven grabbed the package and tossed it in the trash. \u201cPeople make gravy and stuff with them or just eat them whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople eat the chicken\u2019s heart?\u201d he asked, repulsed. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve never fed me that shit.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, laughing. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone else did and you never knew it, though.\u201d She grabbed the chicken and set it in the sink. \u201cCan you wash it out, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>He turned on the water and attempted to hold the chicken under the faucet, giving up after a moment and instead grabbing the spray hose. He pressed the trigger, water firing out of it like a gun, and hosed the chicken down. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>Haven wasn\u2019t paying attention to him, wrist deep in a bowl of stuffing, the gooey bread sticking to her fingers.</p><p>\u201cHaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He pointed the hose at her when she looked his way, on a whim pressing the trigger at close range. She gasped as a blast of water shot her neck, instinctively flicking her hands as she tried to shield herself. Raw stuffing flew in his direction, a clump of it smacking him in the face.</p><p>\u201cYou bi\u2014\u201d He cut himself off abruptly as her eyes widened, choosing to shoot her again instead of finishing.</p><p>Chaos erupted as she dodged toward him, trying to pry the hose from his hands. They wrestled for it, shoving and grabbing, as water from the spray soaked both of them. Haven managed to wiggle past him and got her hand on the faucet, turning the water off as laughter erupted from her chest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you. I\u2019m soaked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started it.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her from behind. \u201cYou ignored me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference.\u201d</p><p>Wiggling out of his grasp, she grabbed the bowl of stuffing and pushed it toward him. \u201cCan you handle the rest?\u201d</p><p>He considered her question. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t involve any fucking voodoo shit with chicken hearts.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cForget about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me what to do. Just gimme a job that doesn\u2019t deal with organs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr water,\u201d she mumbled, looking around. \u201cCan you, uh, chop vegetables?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can do that.\u201d He smirked. He could work a knife, at least.</p><p>Haven pulled out some carrots, celery, potatoes, and onions, and she gave Carmine instructions, but all he heard was that he needed to cut them up.</p><p>They were vegetables\u2014how hard could it be?</p><p>Haven shoved her mixture in the chicken, instructing Carmine to throw the vegetables in the pan with it. He chopped the celery and carrots with no problem but the potatoes were trickier because she didn\u2019t tell him to peel them first.</p><p>Or did she? He hadn\u2019t been listening.</p><p>Carmine got to the onion and eyed it suspiciously. Haven looked at him as he removed the skin, but she stopped him before he could cut into it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to do that?\u201d she asked. He shook his head and she reached past him, grabbing some vinegar and rubbing it on the cutting board. \u201cVinegar messes with the chemical process so it doesn\u2019t burn as much.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows curiously. \u201cJeopardy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a trick I picked up along the way. Open flames help, too. I can get you a candle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a candle, Haven. I can handle an onion.\u201d</p><p>She smiled but didn\u2019t respond. Carmine took his knife, cutting the ends off of the onion before slicing it down the center. The moment it came apart, the gases hit Carmine and he blinked rapidly as his eyes started to burn.</p><p>Every cut seemed to intensify the sting. He squinted, his eyes welling with tears. It got so bad after a few minutes that his vision blurred, and he blinked to clear it, only succeeding in pushing the tears over the edge. He groaned and cut faster, turning his head to the side to brush the tears away with his arm. He lost focus, cutting blindly, and cursed as pain shot through his finger.</p><p>He dropped the knife and pulled his hand away in shock, seeing the spot of blood form. It was a small cut, barely anything at all, but the juices from the onion made it burn. He stuck his finger in his mouth as a natural reaction and cringed at the rusty onion taste.</p> <p>Haven pulled his hands away from his face, frowning. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and she pulled him to the sink, placing his hands under a stream of cold water, washing his cut.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, fixing me up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen did we change places?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you decided to try to cook.\u201d</p><p>Carmine splashed some water on his face before turning off the faucet and grabbed a towel as he leaned back against the counter. He watched Haven as she finished cutting the onion, feeling inadequate when it didn\u2019t seem to affect her. She preheated the oven and worked quickly, throwing together their food with ease.</p> <p>Once she had it all in the pan, she turned to Carmine with a smile. \u201cWhen the oven\u2019s ready, can you put the chicken in? I need to go change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He stood there for a minute after she left until a string of beeps sounded through the kitchen. Carmine grabbed the pan and stepped toward the stove, oblivious to the puddle of water on the floor. His foot skidded in it as he slipped, absentmindedly letting go of the pan as he caught himself. He managed to stay on his feet but the pan hit the floor, the chicken and vegetables scattering around the kitchen.</p><p>He scrambled, grabbing the ingredients and shoving them back in the pan, as footsteps quickly descended the stairs. Cursing under his breath, he grabbed the chicken just as Haven walked back in.</p><p>She gasped, freezing in the doorway as she surveyed the mess.</p><p>\u201cFive-second rule?\u201d he suggested, holding the chicken up by its leg.</p> <p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time the floor was washed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this count?\u201d he asked, motioning toward the puddles.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, uh . . .\u201d He paused, calculating. \u201c. . . Eleven years ago when my mother lived here.\u201d</p><p>She just stared at him, blinking. He dropped the chicken, letting it hit the floor with a splat, and reached into his pocket for his phone. He dialed Celia\u2019s number and waited as it rang. \u201cYeah, uh, can we reschedule dinner for tomorrow night? Great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He hung up with a sigh and looked over at Haven. \u201cHow do you feel about Chinese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChinese is great,\u201d she said, sliding her eyes to the chicken on the floor. \u201cSalmonella? Not so much.\u201d</p><p>The church pew felt like steel beneath Carmine, his entire bottom half numb and tingling. Restless, he tapped his foot, trying to pay attention to the service, but it all sounded like blah, blah, blah to him.</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019s he fidgeting?\u201d Gia asked, her voice a mock whisper that seemed to echo through the church. Worshipers in the surrounding rows turned to look, scowling. \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s possessed! There\u2019s a demon in that boy!\u201d</p><p>Celia quietly scolded her mother while Corrado let out a low, bitter laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s called addiction. He hasn\u2019t had a drink today.\u201d</p><p>Gia sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t let him take communion then. He\u2019ll steal all the wine.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rolled his eyes, relaxing back into the seat, but his leg steadily bounced as Haven grabbed his hand. What made him decide to tag along for Sunday Mass, he wasn\u2019t sure, but he certainly regretted it now. Sweat formed along his brow as anxiety crept through his veins, bubbling up under the surface of his flushed skin.</p><p>The rest of the service dragged by slowly. He sat in the pew during communion, ignoring the snide comments that slipped from his grandmother\u2019s lips as she moved past to join the procession to the altar. Haven remained right beside him, silently absorbing everything, her eyes wide with innocent fascination.</p><p>She had never been inside a church before.</p><p>After Mass ended, Carmine pulled Haven into the main aisle. He made it only a few steps before stopping, hesitating as he glanced at her. \u201cCan you ride home with Celia and Corrado?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed with confusion, but she nodded, not questioning him. He gave her a quick kiss, making sure they would get her home safely, before he headed toward the front of the church. Father Alberto stood at the altar, talking to a few parishioners. He noticed Carmine\u2019s presence and excused himself, making his way over to him. \u201cAh, Mr. DeMarco, do you need to use my telephone again?\u201d</p><p>Carmine chuckled, pulling out his cell phone. \u201cNo, I\u2019m covered today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ride?\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his keys. \u201cAll set there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping we could talk.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto smiled. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>The priest led Carmine into the back office, the same one the two of them had sat in before, and motioned for him to take a seat. Carmine nervously ran his hand through his hair as he sat down, remaining quiet as the priest settled into his chair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you,\u201d Father Alberto said. \u201cI wanted to catch you at the cemetery after Vincenzo\u2019s funeral, but you were preoccupied with the young woman. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s Haven. She, uh . . . she\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who she is,\u201d Father Alberto said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard quite a bit about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that I cannot say.\u201d The priest smirked, a twinkle in his eye. Definitely his father. \u201cConfessions are confidential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven after the person\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Your relationship with God doesn\u2019t end with death, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Carmine muttered, gazing across the desk at the priest. \u201cThat\u2019s sorta why I wanted to talk to you. When they read my father\u2019s will, he asked me to do him a favor. He wanted me to come here . . . said he left something.\u201d</p><p>The priest nodded, not an ounce of surprise registering in his expression. He had been expecting him. \u201cThat he did. But before I give it to you, tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Carmine shook his head. \u201cHow does it look like I feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be holding it together pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, looks are deceiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Maybe you\u2019re the one who can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>Carmine paused, hesitating for a fraction of a second, but the weight of his grief became too heavy to hold back. The dam broke, the words gushing out in a furious unyielding wave of emotion. It flooded the office, nearly drowning Carmine as he choked on the confession of his sins.</p><p>Father Alberto gazed at him, silently taking in his rant, and didn\u2019t speak until Carmine finished. There was nothing formal about it, no asking for forgiveness from God or man. It was just Carmine and his truth, and the one person who could hear it without looking at him differently.</p><p>The one person who could hear it and never tell a living soul.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d the priest asked when the office grew silent again.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I need a drink,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>The priest laughed lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you can do instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need Catholic penitence,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI\u2019m not fasting or repeating Hail Mary a dozen times. That\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I wasn\u2019t going to tell you to,\u201d he said. \u201cI was merely going to suggest you make a list. Write down the names of everyone you feel you\u2019ve wronged and find a way to make it right again someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would take the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto shrugged. \u201cYou have something better to do? I once knew a man who tried to drink his pain away. He drank to forget his family, he drank to dull the loss of a life, and when he finally sobered up, he had to make up for it somehow. He was righting his wrongs until the day he died.\u201d</p><p>Carmine gaped at him. His father?</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, this was left here.\u201d Father Alberto reached into his desk, pulling out a long gold chain and holding it up. A simple gold band swung from it, Carmine\u2019s chest aching at the sight. He recognized it, had seen it thousands of times, on the finger of the first woman he ever loved and later around the neck of the first man he revered.</p><p>His mother\u2019s wedding band.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know what to do with it,\u201d the priest said, handing it to him.</p><p>Carmine carefully put the chain around his neck and concealed it in his shirt. The metal felt cold against his bare chest. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I also noticed you didn\u2019t take communion. Would you like to do it now?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head as he stood. \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d the priest mused as Carmine headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll take that. It means you might be back some day.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-four hours later, the six of them met at the Moretti home\u2014Haven and Carmine, Celia and Corrado, Tess and Dominic\u2014for a family dinner to honor Vincent\u2019s life. It had been moved from Carmine\u2019s house, since he didn\u2019t even have a dining room table, and Haven and Celia went in together on cooking the meal.</p><p>They gathered around, plates piled high with food, and shared laughs as they ate to their hearts content. Dia was the only one missing, having returned to her life in Charlotte. That weighed heavily on Haven\u2019s mind during dinner as she thought about the life waiting for her back in New York. Kelsey had called her dozens of times, but Haven had been too conflicted to return any of those calls.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice, having us all here,\u201d Celia said. \u201cI tried to get Mom to join us, but she wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeno male,\u201d Corrado muttered.</p><p>\u201cHey, she\u2019s not that horrible.\u201d Celia paused as everyone cast her skeptical looks. \u201cOkay, so she\u2019s a handful. But she\u2019s relied on Vincent a lot the past few years, so the rest of us are going to have to step up now that he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly know her,\u201d Dominic said.</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Carmine replied. \u201cAnd what little I do know says she doesn\u2019t want shit to do with any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d Celia interjected. \u201cShe\u2019s just stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Corrado scoffed. \u201cI mean no disrespect, bellissima, but your mother\u2019s issues reach far beyond sheer tenacity. We both know she has a deliberate cruel streak.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe so, but she\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, which is why I\u2019ll do what\u2019s expected of me,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll like it, though. I have no idea how Antonio dealt with her all those years. The man was a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father?\u201d Celia asked. \u201cDid we even know the same man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery man sins, Celia. Even the saints.\u201d</p> <p>Dinner wore on, as did the conversation. It was well past nightfall when they separated, Tess and Dominic heading back to Indiana, while Carmine and Haven made their way down the block. All was silent between them, their fingers loosely entwined as they strolled along. Carmine seemed content, his shoulders relaxed, but something brewed in his expression. He stopped abruptly a few feet from the blue door, his hand slipping from Haven\u2019s as she continued on.</p><p>She turned to him at the loss of connection, seeing the furrow of his brow and the hard line of his lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about New York.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I already told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me what was wrong about it, what you were missing, but I wanna hear the good. You know, the dream. Your dream.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say it, but she saw it in his eyes: He wanted to know if leaving her had really been a mistake.</p><p>\u201cWell, New York was busy, just like you said the city would be,\u201d she started. \u201cThere was always something going on. People everywhere.\u201d</p><p>It all spilled out of her, every detail of her life there, as the two of them stood along the street in the darkness. She held nothing back, wanting him to know she had had a good life. It may not have been perfect, but things rarely were.</p><p>Carmine listened intently, drinking in every word, and didn\u2019t speak until she was done. \u201cYou love it there,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI really love it.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other again as that truth hung in the air between them. Haven watched his expression slowly shift, another question forming in his eyes. She didn\u2019t address it, not acknowledging its existence, instead waiting for him to be the one. She waited for him to ask, for him to gather up the courage to say the words.</p><p>Love me more, his eyes said.</p><p>\u201cDo you, uh . . . ?\u201d He ran his hands down his face as he let out a deep sigh. \u201cWould you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched as he restrained a smile. \u201cWill you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me.\u201d He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cYou know, stay with me?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but the words didn\u2019t have time to escape her lips. Something in Carmine snapped, his anxiety getting the best of him.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I can\u2019t believe I just asked you that. What the fuck is wrong with me? It\u2019s not right! I can\u2019t ask you to choose me!\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his arm, stopping him as he started pacing. \u201cYou\u2019re not asking me to choose you. There\u2019s no choice about it. It\u2019s always been you. Your father once told me that we always have a choice, but I think he was wrong. I think sometimes things choose us. It\u2019s like with breathing. It\u2019s natural. It\u2019s a part of us. It just happens. We can hold our breath and try not to breathe anymore, and it\u2019ll work for a few minutes, but we\u2019ll eventually pass out and nature takes over. We can\u2019t just not breathe, just like I can\u2019t just not love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut New York,\u201d he said. \u201cYour life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best parts of life have nothing to do with a place. Love, friendship, happiness . . . I don\u2019t need to be in New York to have those things. I have it all here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut school? Painting? What about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do those things anywhere, Carmine. But you . . . you\u2019re in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>The hopeful smile twisted his lips, held back no more. \u201cClean slate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs clean as our slate can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is still pretty fucking dirty.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, watching him for a moment before extending her hand. A nervous blush warmed her cheeks. Clean slate. \u201cI\u2019m Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cYou have an interesting name, Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means a safe place,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied, entwining their fingers again. \u201cAnd something tells me it fits you perfectly.\u201d</p><p>43</p><p>The heads of the five families gathered around a long table in the back room of a swanky Italian restaurant just outside of New York City. Their unrestrained chatter overshadowed the music from the violinist in the main dining room, their laughter and exuberance palpable from the parking lot.</p><p>The hostess pointed Corrado in their direction the moment he stepped inside, no words necessary. They had been expecting him. He approached the men, personally greeting each one before slipping into the only empty chair.</p><p>\u201cMoretti,\u201d the Don of the Calabrese family said. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you could join us.\u201d</p><p>Corrado tipped his head. \u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine.\u201d</p><p>Drinks flowed as the men discussed everything from politics to music, side skirting business issues for most of the night. The conversation was fluid, almost friendly, but Corrado wasn\u2019t fooled\u2014he was being tested. They watched his every move and weighed his every word, gauging whether or not they wanted to do business with him. He had met them all before while on the job, but this was different.</p><p>This was the interview of his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to New York?\u201d Sergio Geneva, head of the Geneva faction, asked. \u201cHow long are you here for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for the night,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cBrought my nephew and his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo personal reasons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly.\u201d</p><p>The Calabrese Don looked at Corrado across the table. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. There\u2019s something I wanted to talk to you about. This friend of mine, Sammy Graves . . . he opened up this new casino. You know which one I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy, on the straight and narrow. Got a family and kids. I tried to help him out, get his place off the ground upstate, give him a line of credit, but he declined. Wanted to do it himself, every bit of it legal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s honorable,\u201d Corrado said.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m sure you can see how this deal he made with Chicago is a bit of a thorn in his side. He never wanted that, you know, never wanted to make deals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cYou tell him he has nothing to worry about with Chicago. A friend of yours is a friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>The Don raised his glass. \u201cI\u2019ll pass the message along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the truce in Chicago?\u201d another of New York\u2019s dons asked.</p><p>He considered the question. \u201cDelicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Bannon still pushing his luck?\u201d</p><p>More like Sal pushed him over the edge first. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time, I figure, before he tests us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let us know when that happens,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything you need, you just ask. We\u2019re all friends here.\u201d</p><p>Corrado nodded, picking up his glass to take a sip as the conversation once more switched to things of no consequence. Although his expression remained stoic, his eyes hard and dark as he portrayed the cold man they knew him as, satisfaction glowed inside of him.</p><p>He glanced down the table, his eyes connecting with Johnny Amaro, boss of the Amaro family and one of the few men Corrado had considered a true personal ally over the years. His family had run that faction since the beginning, passed down from father to son for decades. Johnny raised his glass in silent celebration.</p><p>Nailed it.</p><p>Cardboard boxes packed the living room of the downstairs apartment in the brownstone on Eighth Avenue, stacked one on top of another and filled to the brim. They were sectioned off into two piles: some to take along, others to leave behind. Haven\u2019s life was once more being categorized and evaluated, things disposed of as she moved on with life.</p><p>A bittersweet sensation collected in her chest, happiness and sadness colliding as she finished packing her things to move to Chicago. It was getting to follow your dreams, only to have to turn your back on others. It was breaking one promise in order to keep another, a feeling she suspected Carmine could relate to.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he said, standing in the middle of the room, his hands in the pockets of his jeans. \u201cWe can work something out.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe could commute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you stay here, I stay there. We visit when we get the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Haven laughed to herself, placing the last of her books in a box. She picked up the journal belonging to Maura and opened it, haphazardly flipping through the pages as she considered his words. She came to a page about halfway through, reading an inscription in red marker at the top of the page.</p><p>Sometimes I lose perspective, but it helps to stop and look around. I may not have it all, but I have more than enough. And enough, it seems, is more than most have.</p><p>Haven set the book in the box before closing it. \u201cWe have something a lot of people don\u2019t have, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Haven shoved the box of books to the side along with the other belongings she planned to keep. \u201cA chance. We aren\u2019t promised tomorrow, so we shouldn\u2019t take today for granted.\u201d</p><p>Carmine helped her pack the rest of her things before excusing himself to make a call. He slipped to the bedroom as Haven stood in the living room, surveying the boxes. A commotion rang out in the foyer of the building, and Haven swung around just as the front door to her apartment thrust open, slamming into the wall.</p><p>Kelsey appeared, her wide eyes frantic like a mad woman. Haven was about to greet her friend when she bolted forward, yelling hysterically. \u201cWhat the hell? Where have you been? What happened? What are you doing?\u201d Kelsey spun in a circle, pointing at the boxes. \u201cAre you moving? Really? Are you in some kind of trouble? Why haven\u2019t you called?\u201d</p><p>The bedroom door yanked open then as Carmine burst in. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the fucking shrieking?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey blinked rapidly as her attention darted to him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Carmine narrowed his eyes. \u201cMe? Who the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Haven let out a deep sigh as she waved between the two of them. \u201cCarmine, this is my friend Kelsey. Kelsey, this is my, uh . . . Carmine.\u201d</p><p>The two stared at each other, neither one acting as if they had heard her. Kelsey\u2019s expression softened eventually, though, her eyes turning from panicked to suspicious. \u201cI might\u2019ve heard about you once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes at their standoff, Haven scanned the apartment, making sure everything was boxed. The white walls were barren, the place suddenly feeling much smaller than before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you are?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cYou\u2019re moving?\u201d</p><p>Haven turned to her friend, guilt flaring inside of her. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Kelsey\u2019s eyes darted from Haven to Carmine. \u201cLet me guess . . . because of him.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stood there, arms folded across his chest, mouth twitching like he was fighting the urge to interject.</p> <p>\u201cNo, not because of him,\u201d Haven said. \u201cFor him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA smart man once told me there was.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey sighed. \u201cLook, Hayden, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden?\u201d Carmine interrupted, brow furrowed. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p> <p>Haven frowned as she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s my name here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrado\u2019s idea,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHe picked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Kelsey shook her head in confusion. \u201cYour name here? Jesus, is that not your real name? Who are you?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. \u201cI can explain.\u201d Haven paused. \u201cWell, actually, no I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>She slowly shook her head. Kelsey\u2019s attention moved to Carmine, who shrugged just as his phone rang. \u201cI can\u2019t explain either,\u201d he replied, glancing at the screen before holding his phone up. \u201cBut maybe he can.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, after awkward bouts of strained conversation between the three of them, Corrado showed up at the apartment. He stood in the middle of the living room as Kelsey sat on the couch, watching him warily.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cAn officer of some kind?\u201d she asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what we decided?\u201d</p><p>Corrado smirked. \u201cI\u2019m Corrado Moretti. My father, Vito, died in prison while doing a life sentence for a murder commissioned by Antonio DeMarco.\u201d He pointed to Carmine. \u201cAntonio was his grandfather. His name\u2019s Carmine DeMarco, and his father, Vincent, died in a shootout at Salvatore Capozzi\u2019s house.\u201d He pointed to Haven. \u201cSalvatore was her great-uncle. Her name\u2019s Haven Antonelli, and her father, Michael . . . well . . . let\u2019s just say it all comes full circle.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey gaped at him, her mouth hanging open.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a family,\u201d he continued. \u201cSometimes we fight, and sometimes we go our separate ways, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re still a family. Do you understand what I\u2019m telling you?\u201d</p><p>After a few seconds of hesitation, Kelsey nodded. \u201cI grew up in New York. I know all about the, uh . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe family,\u201d Corrado said, finishing her sentence for her.</p><p>\u201cThe family,\u201d she repeated. \u201cMy dad, he . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a senator who was ushered into Congress based on his last name. His father\u2014your grandfather\u2014was the senior senator from New York who headed a special committee to investigate organized crime. It was because of his committee that my father was eventually convicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d Kelsey stammered. Something flashed in her eyes. Fear? \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in punishing the son for the sins of the father,\u201d Corrado continued, cutting her off. \u201cYour father doesn\u2019t believe in it, either. He and I have a mutual understanding of sorts about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you see, there\u2019s no such thing as coincidence. There are no accidents in life. Everything that happens is the result of a calculated move that leads us to where we are. And where we are, Kelsey, is right here in this apartment, having this conversation that never happened. Capisce?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Corrado started for the door. \u201cHaven, Carmine, we\u2019ll leave in the morning. I have one more loose end to tie up tonight.\u201d</p><p>The construction site stood still at near midnight, the equipment switched off hours earlier. There was no drilling, no shouting, no sawing\u2014not even the hum of the generator echoed through the lot. It appeared abandoned, but a sliver of light shining from a window of the small trailer indicated otherwise.</p><p>Corrado quietly slid through the lot under the cloak of darkness, avoiding going near the motion-sensor security lights that aligned the place so not to draw any unnecessary attention. He headed to the trailer, walking swiftly yet silently, and gripped the door with his glove-clad hand. It was unlocked and gave no resistance when he pulled on it, opening right away.</p><p>Gavin sat hunched over at a small desk along the side, facing away from the door. His spine straightened when Corrado stepped inside, his shoulders tense and body rigid, but he didn\u2019t turn around to look. His focus remained on the notebooks scattered in front of him, illuminated by a dim lamp on the corner of the desk. Lines and columns of names and numbers filled the notebook pages, various statistics written down as probabilities were worked out in the margins like elaborate algebra problems. To a na\u00efve person it might have looked like he was a student studying diligently for an arithmetic exam, but Corrado wasn\u2019t na\u00efve . . . nor was he ignorant.</p><p>\u201cYou should never sit with your back to a door,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cDidn\u2019t your father teach you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father taught me a lot,\u201d Gavin replied coolly. \u201cOne of the biggest things he taught me is that if Corrado Moretti shows up at your door, you\u2019re about to have a really bad day.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Corrado\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s shoulders relaxed a slight bit as he slowly turned around to look at him, his expression guarded. Corrado couldn\u2019t blame the boy for being on edge.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something?\u201d Gavin asked tentatively. \u201cI\u2019m just going through the neighborhood books, but if you need me to do something . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, quite the opposite, actually,\u201d Corrado replied. \u201cI stopped by to tell you your services were no longer needed.\u201d</p><p>Corrado reached into his coat swiftly and Gavin tensed once more, pushing his chair back against the desk as far as it would go. Fear shone from his eyes as he braced himself for something that never came. Corrado merely pulled out a thick envelope and held it up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Did you think I was here to kill you?\u201d</p><p>Gavin answered at once. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Knowing it was a lie, Corrado let out a sharp laugh as he tossed the envelope down on the desk, on top of one of the notebooks. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything that warrants death . . . that I know of. But I appreciate your help and wanted to give you a little something to express my gratitude.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, Gavin reached for the envelope and glanced inside. In it, wrapped together, was ten thousand dollars in crisp, new one hundred dollar bills. Gavin blinked rapidly as he skimmed through the cash but said nothing. Corrado had commissioned him months ago to keep an eye on Haven. Gavin had kept her safe during his absence, even periodically sending coded messages to the jail to update him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I came for,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to your books.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the door to leave when Gavin jumped up from his seat, clutching the envelope. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Corrado turned back around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Gavin shook his head as he stepped forward. \u201cI can\u2019t take this. I know it was supposed to be a job, that I was supposed to keep an eye on her for you, but it doesn\u2019t feel that way. It feels wrong to take your money. It feels . . . dishonest.\u201d</p><p>Corrado raised his eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s an awful lot of feeling, Amaro. Your father also should\u2019ve taught you there\u2019s no place for emotions in this life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she\u2019s not really a part of this life. I know you said she\u2019s important to your family, but she\u2019s just a girl . . . a regular girl. Being with her wasn\u2019t work. It was kind of nice. And my father . . . well . . . one thing he did teach me was you don\u2019t rob a friend. And taking this feels a hell of a lot like stealing.\u201d</p><p>Corrado took the envelope and slipped it back into his coat with a shake of his head. \u201cHow did she get to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious how she won you over,\u201d he replied. \u201cHow she got under your skin and made it worth risking offending me by refusing my money.\u201d</p><p>Gavin sighed, his eyes drifting across the room to where a small white kitten lay, fast asleep in the corner. \u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stared at him for a moment before turning to leave. \u201cThey never do.\u201d</p><p>44</p><p>Carmine stood quietly near the doorway of the art studio, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed over his chest. The large room looked almost like a warehouse, everything painted off-white except for the dark concrete floor. Bright fluorescent lights hung from the ceiling, illuminating the dozens of colorful paintings on display around the room. The artwork shone prominently, begging for attention, but nothing stood out more than the scene in the middle of the room.</p><p>Haven sat on a small brown stool, a canvas set up in front of her. Crumpled paper littered the floor around her feet, sketches she had discarded tinged with splatters of paint she had spilled throughout the day. The messy chaos that surrounded her fascinated Carmine, considering she was the most naturally organized person he had ever met. She couldn\u2019t let laundry pile up, floors needed to be swept every day, and dishes had to be washed as soon as they were dirtied. She believed everything had a place where it belonged, but at times like these, all of that went out the window.</p><p>When Haven painted, it was just her and the canvas. A tornado could hit and take the roof off the building and she probably wouldn\u2019t flinch. The apocalypse could come and Jesus could be standing right behind her, trying to take her to Heaven, and she would keep him waiting until she finished. No one interrupted her, not even Carmine, which was why he just stood there, waiting by the door.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mind, though. He enjoyed watching her. Seeing her there, listening to her humming as she worked a mere few feet in front of him, set his soul at ease. Not long ago he had been so close to giving up, exhausted by life\u2019s sudden twists and turns, but she showed up right when he needed her the most.</p><p>It had been a few months since she had moved to Chicago. A new school year started, and she had enrolled at a small art school downtown, while Carmine continued on with his life . . . the same life he had been involved in since leaving Durante. It was the same, the shift in power not altering his circumstances at all, but yet something was different. He approached it another way. He wasn\u2019t as reckless . . . not now that he had a reason to come home at night.</p><p>He still fucking hated it, though. Hated every second of life in La Cosa Nostra with every fiber of his being.</p><p>Haven sighed loudly, the sound exaggerated in the empty room. She stood and pushed her stool back to pace back and forth in front of the canvas. The painting of the tree looked fine to Carmine, but he could tell she felt something was wrong with it. She added a bit more color to the trunk before blending some yellow in with a few of the leaves, setting her paintbrush down as she took a step back. She eyed the canvas intently, tilting her head to the side as if looking at it from a different angle would somehow change the image. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carmine chuckled under his breath and strolled over to her. She stiffened when she sensed him, taking a deep breath before relaxing again. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little while,\u201d he responded, placing his hands on her hips. He pulled her body back against his and leaned down, nuzzling into her neck. \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smelled you,\u201d she replied casually.</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cAre you saying I stink?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed and nudged Carmine playfully as she turned around. \u201cOf course not. You smell good, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d He smirked. \u201cLike motherfucking sunshine, right?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t get cocky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, why not?\u201d He pulled her closer, pressing himself against her. \u201cI always liked being cocky with you.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and turned back to her painting.</p> <p>\u201cSo a tree, huh?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said, tilting her head to the side again as she studied it. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, it looks like a tree to me. What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s missing something. It doesn\u2019t feel like the same tree, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat tree?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe white tree of Gondor? The fucking whomping willow? The one Eve stole the apple from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tree in Durante,\u201d Haven said impatiently. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even recognize it, so obviously it\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tree, tesoro. It has wood and leaves and acorns and shit. I\u2019d say it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have acorns,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sycamore tree. Does it really look like an oak tree? They\u2019re nothing alike.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. How was he supposed to know? \u201cHaven, baby, you could tell me it was the Joshua tree and I\u2019d agree because I can\u2019t tell the difference.\u201d</p><p>She let out an exaggerated huff as she looked at him. \u201cThis coming from the same person who spent nearly an hour picking out a Christmas tree that time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m finicky. I don\u2019t deny it. But not all of us have your memory. You see something and the picture of it is burned in your brain forever, but the only greenery I can identify is the kind I can smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean this kind?\u201d she asked, picking up her paintbrush. She dipped the tip into the container of green paint and quickly drew the outline of a marijuana leaf on the corner of the canvas.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, that kind, but you probably shouldn\u2019t have done that. You fucked up your painting.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head with frustration, sticking her paintbrush in a container of murky water. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Carmine. It was already fucked up.\u201d</p> <p>He gaped at her. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that it was already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, tesoro, you can\u2019t say that shit!\u201d He cut her off before she could repeat herself. \u201cDo you know what it does to me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, blushing, and her eyes darted directly to his crotch. Yeah, she knew exactly what it did to Carmine. Closing his eyes, he let out a groan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d apologize, but I can\u2019t honestly say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you shouldn\u2019t apologize then,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou should always mean what you say and say what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never say anything mean,\u201d she added.</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s not a part of the saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s bullshit. Sometimes you have to say something mean.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Carmine incredulously. \u201cThere\u2019s never a time when you have to say something mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName one.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t balk at a challenge, not even one that came from her. \u201cWhen someone says something mean to you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you just walk away,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what if you can\u2019t walk away? What if they won\u2019t let you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think saying something mean is going to help you if that\u2019s the case?\u201d</p><p>She had Carmine there. \u201cWell, what if you got something on you, like in your teeth. Shouldn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s not mean. That\u2019s helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s something permanent though, like your nose? What if you have a crooked, fucked-up nose?\u201d</p><p>Her hand immediately went to her face, her fingers running down the ridge of her nose as she eyed Carmine hesitantly. He groaned, realizing it sounded like he was telling her that. He recalled how self-conscious she had been years before and felt like an asshole. Way to go, DeMarco. Insult her next time . . .</p><p>\u201cNot you, tesoro,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean you. Your nose is fine. Fucking great, even. I\u2019m just saying, you know, hypothetically . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hypothetically, why would it be necessary to tell me? It wouldn\u2019t be hurting you, so why hurt me?\u201d</p><p>She had Carmine again. \u201cWell, what if your painting sucked? Like this tree\u2014what if it was honestly the worst tree ever painted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if it was for a grade, and I had to tell you so you wouldn\u2019t fail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for a grade.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with disbelief before glancing back at the canvas. \u201cYou painted a marijuana leaf on schoolwork?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Her nonchalance stunned him. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. She fucking laughed. If she were ever going to prove Carmine right, it was then. There was seriously something wrong with her.</p><p>\u201cI can start over,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll paint something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI like this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, eyeing the painting peculiarly again. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s our tree,\u201d he said. Hadn\u2019t they just been through that? \u201cWe climbed that motherfucker together twice. Fell out of it once. That makes it special.\u201d</p><p>The smile that curved her lips warmed Carmine from the inside. He loved that smile. It meant she was happy\u2014that he had made her happy. There was no better feeling than that. After spending so many years doing nothing but disappointing everyone who came into contact with him, it was nice to do some good for once.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Maybe I\u2019ll paint over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, make some happy clouds to go with your happy little magical tree,\u201d he joked.</p><p>They stood there for a moment, engulfed in a serious silence as she mused over her painting, before Carmine grabbed her and pulled her to him again. She spun around with a laugh, wrapping her arms around him in a hug, but froze after a second when her hands slid down his back, reaching his waistband.</p><p>\u201cOh God, please tell me that\u2019s not . . .\u201d She trailed off, pulling out of the hug. \u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you think it is.\u201d</p><p>She gripped his waistband, her eyes narrowing. \u201cYou brought a gun in here, Carmine? You can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a sign on the door that says so! You can\u2019t bring concealed weapons in this place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTesoro, relax. I carry it everywhere\u2014you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s unlawful!\u201d</p><p>Now it was his turn to laugh. \u201cWe live in Chicago. Me just breathing in the direction of a gun is illegal. Would you rather I get rid of it completely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her answer was quick and firm, catching him off guard. She looked at Carmine with certainty and he shook his head. \u201cSo you\u2019d prefer me defenseless?\u201d</p><p>She blanched. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d</p><p>She huffed at the interruption and completely ignored him. \u201cBut why do you bring it places like here? I get that you need it for work, but why when you\u2019re with me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou never know when something might happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? You never know when it might rain, but I don\u2019t see you carrying an umbrella everywhere just in case.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at the absurdity of the comparison, even though she was completely serious. \u201cThe weatherman usually warns me when that\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t get warnings? Corrado doesn\u2019t tell you when something\u2019s going to happen? What happened to intuition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but I can\u2019t always plan. Sometimes I only have time to react.\u201d</p><p>She thought he was paranoid. Christ, he probably was paranoid, but rightfully so. He knew how ruthless the streets could be and if she were thinking clearly, she would see it too. He understood, though. His life still scared her. Hell, it scared Carmine just as much, but the best way to deal was to always be prepared.</p><p>And regardless of what she insisted, sometimes you had to be mean to make it. It was how the game was played. If you aren\u2019t the predator, you end up the prey.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he added, \u201clast I checked, a little rain couldn\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut lightning can if it\u2019s a storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think an umbrella would help you in that case?\u201d he asked, throwing one of her earlier arguments back at her.</p><p>He waited for her to respond, figuring she would have something to say, but all he got was silence\u2014completely tense, unnerving, motherfucking silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d he asked after a moment, knowing they were at an impasse and getting nowhere fast.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen trust me about this, okay? We can argue about trees and phrases and any other thing you feel passionate about, but just give me this.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, frustrated, but he knew that sound meant she was giving in. \u201cFine, but I get to pick where we go tonight.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYeah, about that . . .\u201d</p><p>It was a Friday, which had become their day. Their schedules conflicted a lot, with her in school and Carmine out doing whatever he was told to do, but Friday nights were the exception. It was when the two of them got to be together and do the things normal couples did, like seeing movies and going to fairs. It was the one night a week when they put everything aside, when they didn\u2019t have to think about the chaos in their lives, and they could finally just be.</p><p>Corrado seemed to understand, so he usually left Carmine alone that day. Usually being the key word. Sometimes he threw a wrench in their plans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this thing tonight. Everyone\u2019s supposed to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of thing?\u201d she asked, her eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>\u201cJust a thing,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cThe new underboss\u2019s son is getting married or whatever so they\u2019re having a get together at Sicillitas.\u201d</p><p>Typically those kinds of events took place at the Boss\u2019s house, but Corrado wasn\u2019t like the guys who used to run things. He tried to keep the Mafia out of his home, so special occasions were often spent in someone\u2019s business now. Sicillitas was an upscale Italian restaurant owned by one of the Capos.</p> <p>\u201cSo you have to go,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d he corrected her. \u201cCorrado specifically said \u2018You and Haven.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She frowned. He didn\u2019t blame her. He didn\u2019t want to go either, but Corrado was all about showing a strong front. He had gone out on a limb and vouched for her, something that made a few of the guys question his judgment. Haven integrating smoothly into their world was important to him.</p><p>Plus, even if Corrado would never admit it, Carmine was pretty sure he actually liked her being around.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t stay long,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThe first chance we get, we\u2019ll get the fuck out of there and do whatever you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>He watched as she gathered her stuff, cleaning up paints and throwing away the discarded papers. He felt bad for not helping, but he knew he would do more harm than good. This was her sanctuary, and you just don\u2019t go fucking with someone else\u2019s safe place.</p><p>She put on her coat and grabbed the painting of the tree before turning back to Carmine. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked. She nodded and smiled softly, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. No, they were filled with dread, the happiness he had given her moments earlier forgotten.</p><p>It made his chest ache. He needed a drink. Or two. Or ten. Something\u2014anything\u2014to dull the bitter ache of disappointing her.</p><p>Carmine led her out of the studio and she got into the passenger seat of the Mazda, clicking her seat belt in place as he climbed in beside her. The drive home was silent, awkwardness surrounding them, seeping through Carmine\u2019s skin and twisting his insides. He hated when things got like that between them, because he never knew what to say to her. Sorry you\u2019re annoyed, tesoro. I can\u2019t help I\u2019m a loser and Get used to it, since I\u2019ll probably keep disappointing you just didn\u2019t seem to cut it, even though it was how it usually made Carmine feel.</p><p>She said not a single word when they arrived home, grabbing her things and getting out of the car before he could even shut off the engine. She used her key and disappeared inside without waiting for Carmine. He took his time and she was nowhere to be found when he finally made his way into the house. He went straight for the refrigerator, opening the freezer and grabbing the chilled bottle of Grey Goose. He pulled the top off, tipping the bottle back and taking a long swig.</p> <p>He leaned against the counter and sipped on the vodka. His chest still ached, the alcohol doing nothing to ease his guilt, as he listened to the shower turn on and back off again on the second floor.</p><p>He heard her footsteps in the hallway eventually and replaced the top on the bottle, slipping it back in the freezer as Haven made her way downstairs. The moment he saw her, his heart skipped a beat. Her damp hair was slightly wavy, the dark locks nearly identical in color to her plain black dress. Her bare feet slapped against the wooden floor, exposing strikingly red painted toenails, but her skin, while scarred, remained untainted by makeup.</p><p>Simple, but beautiful. That was her.</p><p>Haven eyed Carmine peculiarly when she saw him lingering in the kitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, her eyes drifting to the freezer before settling back on him. He didn\u2019t blame her for her suspicions. She knew him well.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d It was true. Sort of. He wasn\u2019t doing a thing but standing there.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d she clarified.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said again. Not so true that time.</p><p>\u201cUh, okay,\u201d she mumbled, still watching Carmine as she walked to the sink. \u201cAre you going to change before we go?\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at his clothes. He had on a tie, at least\u2014seemed good enough to him. \u201cDo I need to?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think Corrado would be happy about the shoes.\u201d</p><p>His gaze shifted to his Nike\u2019s. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, pushing away from the counter. He started to walk away but Haven grabbed his arm to stop him. He turned around, looking at her curiously, and she yanked Carmine toward her as she stood up on her tiptoes.</p><p>He froze, dumbfounded, as she smashed her lips to his. When he finally got his wits about him, he parted his lips to kiss her back, but she abruptly pulled away, letting go completely. She took a step back. \u201cYou were drinking.\u201d</p><p>There was no anger, not an ounce of hate in her voice. She wasn\u2019t accusing Carmine\u2014it was a simple statement. He had been drinking.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d he replied. She nodded and turned away to look out of the window. He stood there for a moment, but she didn\u2019t speak again. The subject was closed, nothing else to say.</p><p>He headed upstairs to the bathroom and glanced in the mirror, surveying his reflection after splashing water on his face. He hardly recognized himself some days. Dark, heavy bags aligned his bloodshot eyes, his skin dry from the fickle Chicago weather. He had slicked his hair back that morning with pomade so it appeared a shade darker, making him seem paler than usual.</p><p>He went into the bedroom and grabbed a pair of black shoes from the closet, sitting down on the edge of the bed to put them on. Haven walked in while he was tying them and scrunched up her nose. \u201cYour shoes are scuffed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not like the military where I need to shine the sons of bitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he replied as he glanced at his watch. It was already fast approaching eight o\u2019clock, when Corrado had told Carmine to be there. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>Carmine waited as she slipped on a pair of black heels, and they both grabbed their coats before heading out again. Haven was quiet as she got in the car, not speaking as he pulled away from the house. He fiddled with the radio anxiously, needing a distraction, and Haven just stared at him with a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Carmine asked, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She stressed the word, her answer speaking volumes. She was sending a message with that motherfucker. It was a You asshole, who do you take me for? I can\u2019t believe you thought you could fucking fool me kind of nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, knowing what she wanted to hear. She wanted him to apologize for drinking, but he couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for disappointing you,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she replied, reaching over and stroking his cheek before running her fingers through the hair near his neckline. She hit a snag and he grimaced. \u201cWhat I hate is when you do your hair like this.\u201d</p><p>He glanced in the rearview mirror at himself. Corrado preferred them to look clean-cut, but he hated it, too. \u201cI kinda look like my fath\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gripped the steering wheel tightly, unable to even get the entire thing out. It had been four months . . . about sixteen weeks . . . one hundred and twenty-something days . . . and the wound was just as raw as it had been that fateful night. He still saw it sometimes when he closed his eyes, reliving the moment his father had taken his last breath.</p><p>Sometimes it was so hard he could barely breathe, in so much pain he felt like he was the one with the bullets lodged in his chest.</p><p>Haven massaged Carmine\u2019s neck as he focused on the road, trying to get himself back under control.</p><p>\u201cSo since someone\u2019s getting married, does that mean I can have whatever I want?\u201d she asked offhandedly, distracting him from his thoughts.</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it true when someone gets married, you can ask a Mafia boss for something and he can\u2019t refuse?\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for what she had said to register. He laughed. \u201cHave you been watching The Godfather?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not true, anyway,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThey say the day of the Boss\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding he won\u2019t refuse anyone a favor, but it\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you want, though?\u201d he asked curiously. \u201cIf you could have one wish granted, what would you ask for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d he replied. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really anything anyone could give me.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Carmine incredulously. \u201cThere is something someone could give you. Actually, it\u2019s what I\u2019d ask for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour freedom.\u201d</p><p>Carmine wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cWell, too bad it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, too bad.\u201d</p><p>They arrived at the restaurant within a few minutes. He led Haven inside and saw his uncle right away, sitting at a table in the back with Celia. A slew of men gathered around them like a massive human shield of protection, but Celia managed to spot them through the crowd. She waved, the movement catching Corrado\u2019s attention. He looked over as they approached, his expression blank, but Carmine could see the annoyance in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUp,\u201d he barked at the two guys sitting across from them. They didn\u2019t hesitate before pushing their chairs back, vacating them, and Corrado motioned toward the now empty seats. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Haven immediately took a seat in the first chair, looking at Carmine apprehensively. He gave her a smile, trying to be reassuring, but the truth was he was just as nervous.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Corrado said, glaring at Carmine from across the table.</p><p>He glanced at his watch: five minutes after eight. \u201cI guess I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cI tried to be on time, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing.\u201d His voice was sharp and Carmine shut up right away, a few people quieting down as they looked in their direction. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for tardiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m just saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re saying, Carmine,\u201d he interrupted again. \u201cAnd I\u2019m saying there\u2019s no excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sorry,\u201d Haven blurted out.</p><p>Corrado looked at her peculiarly, his expression unreadable. \u201cIs he?\u201d</p><p>She nodded hesitantly. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least there\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>Things were tense as Corrado continued to stare them down, Haven still fidgeting and making Carmine even more anxious. After a moment Celia sighed and shook her head, turning to her husband. \u201cIf you\u2019re done throwing your weight around, I\u2019d like to eat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrado finally broke eye contact with Carmine to look at her. \u201cI\u2019m not throwing my weight around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re just a big bully. You act like he blatantly ignored what time to be here. It was just a few minutes, no harm done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time,\u201d Corrado retorted. \u201cIt might not mean anything right now, but five minutes can be a matter of life and death in other situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, other situations. Meaning not this one, so give the boy a break.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a boy, Celia,\u201d Corrado said, his expression darkening a bit.</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d she argued. \u201cHe\u2019s my nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my soldato.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was my nephew first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s mine forever.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine froze when Corrado spoke those words, a sickness brewing in the pit of his stomach. He had witnessed a lot of ridiculous conversations in his life but having them argue over him was surreal.</p><p>Celia pushed her chair back and stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to the ladies room.\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head when she stormed away and the underboss, sitting to his left, clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cAh, chi non ha moglie non ha padrone.\u201d</p><p>Carmine smirked at his words and Corrado smiled, but it was forced. He was furious that Celia had challenged him in front of his men. He reached for his glass on the table in front of him, taking a drink as Haven leaned toward Carmine.</p><p>\u201cWhat did that guy say?\u201d she whispered, trying to be quiet, but Corrado overheard her.</p><p>He set his glass back down and answered before Carmine had a chance. \u201cHe said a man without a wife is a man without a master.\u201d</p> <p>She tensed. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot you don\u2019t speak Italian,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you ever thought to learn?\u201d</p><p>The color drained from her face at being put on the spot, the eyes of everyone nearby going straight to her. Most people within the organization knew by now she was a Principessa by birth, even though few of them ever had any actual contact with her. They were intrigued, naturally. Carmine understood their curiosity, but that didn\u2019t mean it annoyed him any less.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Carmine?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Carmine and he immediately felt bad, seeing the panic in her eyes. She was trying her best to stay cool on the surface, but he could tell she was a mess inside. \u201cHe\u2019s taught me some, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I assume you know the bad words, then,\u201d Corrado said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know other things, too, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>She looked at Carmine again, like she expected him to rescue her, but he couldn\u2019t. Even if he tried, Corrado would stop him.</p><p>She realized after a second that he wasn\u2019t going to say anything. She turned back to Corrado, picking at her fingernails under the table. \u201cLike ti amo and sempre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ciao. Buongiorno. Grazie. Prego.\u201d Her pronunciation was spot on. It was simple, but it was better than nothing. \u201cAnd uh, Vaffanculo?\u201d</p><p>They all just stared at her, the silence managing to grow even more awkward.</p><p>After what felt like an hour, Corrado\u2019s expression softened and a smile tugged at his lips. He let out a laugh\u2014a genuine fucking laugh. \u201cThat was a curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She turned bright red. \u201cCarmine uses it a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t surprise me a bit.\u201d</p><p>There was quiet chatter as everyone relaxed, the Boss\u2019s demeanor influencing the others. The tension receded from the room and Haven loosened up, her posture no longer stiff. Celia returned, she and Corrado both relaxing as they whispered to each other. Carmine watched them, their natural chemistry obvious. Despite everything, the fighting and violence and outright bullshit their lives could sometimes be, they were happy together. They loved each other and it was the love that got them through everything else. As long as they had that, nothing would tear them apart.</p><p>Carmine glanced at Haven, reaching under the table and taking her hand. He squeezed it and she smiled softly, gazing back at him. He saw that same type of love in her eyes, the kind of love that was damn near unbreakable.</p><p>There was food and drinks, conversation and laughter. Time passed swiftly and Carmine found he actually enjoyed himself. A smile continuously graced Haven\u2019s lips as she talked to people, not seeming at all nervous to be around his kind.</p><p>His kind. He hated saying it, but it was true. La Cosa Nostra was his family. And like a real dysfunctional family, he fucking hated them most of the time.</p><p>He looked around the restaurant, seeing all types of people having dinner. There were couples and families, friends and business associates. All seemed content and relaxed, completely oblivious to the danger in the room with them. It was strange to Carmine how people didn\u2019t even flinch from their presence, like they were desensitized to violence and pain. They seemed ignorant to the fact that lifelong criminals surrounded them, their children and wives breathing the same air as cold, calculating murderers.</p><p>Well, most seemed oblivious. His gaze fell upon a man in the corner by himself, his attention focused on the tables surrounding them. His eyes locked with Carmine\u2019s after a moment, and even across the room he could see the coldness. The man certainly wasn\u2019t what he would call a friendly face.</p><p>Carmine stared him down for a while before the man stood, tossing some money on the table and walking out.</p><p>The night continued on, as did the food and drinks. The crowd thinned, thoughts of that man going right out along with the others.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you guys anything else?\u201d a waitress asked eventually, stepping over to their table. It was nearing ten in the evening. Corrado and Celia were a few feet away, talking to the soon-to-be bride and groom.</p><p>Haven shook her head, stabbing at the tiramisu on her plate with a fork. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>The waitress glanced at Carmine and he nodded, picking up his glass and holding it out to her. She walked away without a word, returning with another vodka and Coke. He thanked her, taking a drink as she moved on to the next table.</p><p>Haven set her fork down and looked at Carmine, her eyes wandering past him. \u201cDo you know how they met?\u201d she asked, motioning toward the couple.</p><p>\u201cIt was arranged,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cAn arranged marriage? They do that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and nodded at the same time, a half-assed answer since he wasn\u2019t sure how to explain it. \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other since they were kids. They were just . . . put together, I guess. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense, but it\u2019s how most of them do it. They just pair off with other people in the life. It\u2019s easier that way.\u201d</p><p>She looked downright perplexed for a moment before understanding crept into her features. \u201cLike Michael and Katrina.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd their parents before them. Pretty much everyone in here did it. They don\u2019t like outsiders coming in, so they stay in the inner circle. My father broke protocol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, tesoro. You\u2019re one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t know that, and I definitely wasn\u2019t in your inner circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have, though?\u201d she asked. \u201cWould you have come back here and eventually found someone like everyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s no one else for me,\u201d he replied. \u201cThese people care about bloodlines and rank and power and shit, but none of that matters to me. I\u2019d never pursue a woman because of who her father is. Chances are I\u2019d just hate her. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, most of the women in the life are spoiled, uptight bitches who feel like people owe them. And I refuse to accept the fact that I owe anyone a thing . . . except you, maybe. So, no thanks.\u201d</p><p>Haven shook her head. \u201cSo you\u2019d just be alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m gonna be miserable either way, I\u2019d rather be miserable alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you asking, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wondered about it all,\u201d she said, still watching the couple. \u201cDo you think those two love each other, at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he replied. \u201cSometimes what they feel is real. I know Celia wouldn\u2019t stay with Corrado if she didn\u2019t love him, so it\u2019s possible those two will get married and be happy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think you would have ever tried?\u201d</p><p>Her questions made his head spin. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you think it\u2019s important to have someone around who understands?\u201d</p><p>Before he had a chance to even think about how to respond to that, Corrado and Celia started back in their direction. Celia took her seat while Corrado paused beside Carmine, eyeing him warily. \u201cHow many drinks have you had?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, looking at his half-empty glass. \u201cUh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you have to think about it is answer enough,\u201d he said, holding out his hand. \u201cGive me your keys.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s heart pounded hard as he took in his uncle\u2019s stern expression. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the keys to the Mazda. Corrado snatched them from him.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, tossing the keys to Haven. \u201cMake sure he gets home safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThere you go throwing your weight around again,\u201d Celia commented.</p><p>Corrado let out a slightly bitter laugh. \u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t have a wife yet, so I\u2019m the only master he\u2019s got for the time being.\u201d</p><p>Carmine fought the urge to roll his eyes as he picked up his glass when Corrado was called away from the table again. He turned to Haven after downing the rest of his drink. \u201cYou ready to go, tesoro? I\u2019ve had my fill of family for the time being.\u201d He peeked at his aunt Celia. \u201cNo offense, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d Celia said. \u201cGo, have fun.\u201d</p><p>Haven stood and smiled as they walked away. They almost slipped out undetected, but Corrado spotted them as they neared the door and called Carmine\u2019s name. \u201cBe available in case I need you, and next time wear cleaner shoes. How hard is it to shine them? It takes all of five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>Haven looked smug about it, but her expression shifted quickly when Corrado spoke once more. \u201cHaven?\u201d</p><p>She went rigid. \u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did well tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up. \u201cThank you, sir. I\u2019m glad you invited me.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grabbed Haven\u2019s hand and tugged on it, wanting to get out the door before Corrado decided he had something else to say.</p><p>\u201cWere you telling the truth?\u201d Carmine asked as they strolled through the packed parking lot. \u201cAre you glad he invited you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey were all actually really . . . nice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure. The nicest motherfuckers I know, tesoro\u2014like rainbows and sunshine.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, bumping against Carmine playfully. \u201cYou know what I mean. They weren\u2019t cold to me like I thought they\u2019d be, since I am . . . or I mean, I was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t stupid,\u201d he interrupted, squeezing her hand. \u201cCorrado would kill them if they disrespected you.\u201d</p><p>She seemed taken aback and stopped beside the car. \u201cHe\u2019d really do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course he would,\u201d he replied. \u201cCorrado doesn\u2019t have kids, and you\u2019re the closest thing he\u2019s got to a daughter.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe vouched for you. In their minds, he gave you life. I mean, come on, Haven. He demanded your presence tonight, knowing you wouldn\u2019t want to be here. He only tortures his real family that way. You\u2019re in, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cLike it, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cKeys?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed dryly, pushing it away. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m driving.\u201d</p><p>She gave Carmine a playful wink as she walked around to the driver\u2019s side. He rolled his eyes and grumbled, feigning annoyance, although he didn\u2019t mind if she drove. He trusted her. Always had and always would.</p><p>She started the car as he put on his seat belt, knowing she wouldn\u2019t leave the parking lot until he did. She adjusted the mirrors and fiddled with the seat so she could reach the pedals and he held his tongue, refusing to get upset over something so petty. Years ago he would have snapped, but losing her once gave Carmine a new outlook. The seat\u2019s position could be fixed, as could the mirrors. The entire car could be replaced, for that matter, but she was one of a kind.</p><p>Carmine glanced around as she situated herself, spotting a form trudging through the parking lot. His eyes narrowed as something clicked in his mind, recognition dawning. It was the man from the corner in the restaurant, the one that had left at least an hour before. He kept his head ducked as he weaved through the cars, but there was no doubt in Carmine\u2019s mind that it was the same man.</p><p>The guy slipped into a dark Chevy Camaro. He drove past them as Carmine quickly studied the car, getting a brief glimpse at the Illinois license plate. All he could make out were the first two letters, JK.</p><p>\u201cDo you know that guy?\u201d Haven asked, noticing he had been watching him.</p> <p>Carmine shrugged it off. \u201cNo. He has a nice car, though.\u201d</p><p>The drive home from the restaurant was a hell of a lot different than the drive to it. Haven drove the speed limit\u2014if that\u2014while he lounged in the passenger seat, alcohol buzzing through his veins. Haven excused herself when they arrived home as Carmine locked up, making a point to enable the alarm for the doors and windows.</p><p>He strolled into the kitchen and took out his gun, sticking it in a top cabinet. Grabbing the bottle of Grey Goose from the freezer, he leaned against the counter and took a swig, closing his eyes and savoring the burn as it coated his throat. It was only a minute later that he heard Haven approach and he opened his eyes, seeing her in the doorway. \u201cWhatcha wanna do, tesoro?\u201d</p><p>She said nothing as she slowly strolled in his direction, having discarded her heels somewhere between the door and Carmine. He took a second drink as she paused in front of him, and she grabbed the bottle when he finished, gently taking it from his hands. Hesitating, deliberating, she brought it to her lips and tipped the bottle back. She grimaced as the liquor filled her mouth, the swallow bitterly painful by the look on her face.</p><p>Reaching behind Carmine, she tipped the bottle and slowly dumped the rest of it down the sink drain, her eyes remaining on him the entire time.</p><p>Carmine had a brief moment of panic. His insides seized up and he felt sick to his stomach, watching the liquor disappear. He pushed the feeling back, refusing to let it control him. He could stop if he wanted to . . . if he needed to. It wasn\u2019t the end of the world. There were more important things in life, and he didn\u2019t need the vodka to make it through his days.</p><p>He chanted that in his head, willing himself to believe it.</p><p>Haven grabbed his tie then, the knot loosening as she tugged on it. He offered no resistance, putting up no fight as she pulled him away from the kitchen counter and led him toward the stairs. She let go eventually but he didn\u2019t falter, blindly and wordlessly following her upstairs. His feet were heavy like concrete slabs, his body weary and mind just as tired, but obedience ran through his veins.</p> <p>He closed the bedroom door when they made it there, the single click of the lock echoing loudly through the still silence. He glanced at Haven, watching in the light from the glow of the moon as she unzipped her dress and let it drop to the floor. The pressure in his chest, the burn and craving of the addict, lessened a bit when she turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the first time we made love?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worshiped me that day,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, thinking about it, you worshiped me every time. You were so attentive and always made me feel your love, but I never really had the chance to do the same. I tell you I love you all the time, and I do . . . I love you so much, Carmine . . . but I don\u2019t show you enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held her hand up to silence him before he could object. \u201cJust shut up, okay? Why do you always have to talk?\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow at her, a surprised chuckle escaping his lips as he waved for her to proceed. Sassy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t show you enough,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou do so much, you go through so much in life, and you need to be shown love, too. You deserve to be worshiped.\u201d</p><p>Carmine remained right in front of the door, not daring to move. He held his breath, watching intently as Haven removed the rest of her clothes and stood in front of him completely naked. He slowly scanned her, drinking in every drop of her petite frame, his eyes tracing her soft curves. The silvery scars that coated her skin glowed under the moonlight, intricate patterns that told countless stories\u2014some of which only he would ever know. They were secrets she had told him, secrets he would take with him to the grave, whether that be tomorrow or a century away.</p><p>She stepped forward, grabbing his tie again, but this time she undid the knot and tossed it aside. Slowly, carefully, she unbuttoned his shirt as he remained still, fighting the urge to reach out and caress her skin. She removed his shirt, her hands tracing his abs before reaching for his belt buckle, staring into his eyes as she unfastened it.</p><p>He licked his lips, his mouth suddenly dry as the nerves inside of him bubbled up. His heart hammered as his pants dropped to the floor, her hands shoving his boxers down to his ankles. A cool chill ripped up his spine and he shivered as the air hit his erection, making it jump as it throbbed harder than he could ever remember it being before.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered, falling back against the bedroom door as Haven dropped to her knees. She took him in her mouth, warmth enveloping him, goosebumps immediately springing to every centimeter of exposed skin. \u201cOh, fuck.\u201d</p><p>He knew he wouldn\u2019t last long. He couldn\u2019t. Within a matter of minutes, as she sucked and licked and stroked, he could feel the pressure building in his gut. He wanted to warn her, but he couldn\u2019t find the words. All he could do was curse and sputter, gripping the back of her head as he spilled down her throat.</p><p>She climbed to her feet when he finished, her hand still wrapped around him, gently stroking as he grew hard in her palm again. She kissed his chest, making her way to his neck, before he leaned down and captured her lips with his.</p><p>The rest of his clothes were discarded on the floor before she pulled him over to the bed, making him lie down. She didn\u2019t hesitate, no wavering as she climbed on top of him, sinking down into his lap. He filled her completely, deeply, her body tight and formed to his like leather against damp skin, clinging, suffocating, taking his strained breath away.</p><p>He lay with his eyes open, watching her move, savoring her passion. He could feel her devotion, her desperation, her craving; he could feel her need, her want, her love. He could feel it all each time she shifted her hips, their bodies slapping together as he filled her to the hilt. And he could hear it in her voice, her throaty groans and raspy words when she cried out his name again and again as orgasm shook her to the core.</p><p>She drove him madder with every moan, every thrust pushing him further to the brink. He wanted to flip her over and pound into her, take her hard, ravish every inch of her and claim her flushed body as his own, but he didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t. There would be plenty of time for that later. Now it was her time, her rules, her game.</p><p>And it was a game he was elated to play. The sensations building inside of him stirred up something, a vaguely familiar euphoria, the high of all highs . . . it infiltrated his cells, blanketing his entire body until he felt like he was floating on air.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t take a bitter bitch named Molly to do it this time.</p><p>45</p><p>They lay in bed together later that night, her head on his bare chest, her long hair a tangled mess. Carmine rubbed her back as her fingers explored the trail of fine hair leading down his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Haven whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s happened to me.\u201d</p><p>The best thing. It was a far cry from the disgrace he felt like earlier. The conviction in her words made him want to believe it. Even though he still thought she deserved better, that she deserved more, he wondered if maybe, just maybe, he could be good enough.</p><p>She fell asleep before he could find the words to share the sentiment, her soft snores filling the room. Carmine lay there holding her, but despite his exhaustion, he couldn\u2019t fall asleep. His mind worked a million miles a minute, a feeling overtaking him that he couldn\u2019t push away. It invaded his body, nagging and prodding, putting Carmine on edge. He was alert, noise intensifying the paranoia. Something was off\u2014he could feel it.</p><p>Carefully, so as not to wake Haven, he slipped from underneath her and climbed out of bed. He tiptoed across the room to the window and pulled some slats of the blinds apart to look out into the night. It was nearing three in the morning, the sky pitch black and the city quiet. Carmine surveyed the street, looking for any sign of trouble, and tensed when his eyes fell upon a car out front.</p><p>A vaguely familiar-looking dark Chevy Camaro.</p><p>He stepped back from the window and gave Haven a quick glance before heading out of the room. Instinct took over, every move calm and calculating. He found his pants and pulled them on before grabbing his gun downstairs. He made sure it was loaded as he quietly slipped out the back door. He headed around the house and came up behind the Camaro, eyeing the license plate.</p><p>The moment he saw the letters JK, his adrenaline kicked into overdrive.</p><p>Staying in the shadows, he watched the car for a bit. The man was alone with the driver\u2019s side window down, his attention focused away from Carmine\u2019s house. Every time headlights flashed nearby he would watch them like a hawk until they passed. He was waiting for something, but Carmine wasn\u2019t sure what until a set of headlights shone their way. The man ducked as a black Mercedes sped by them before swinging into a driveway about a block away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrado.</p><p>Carmine wasn\u2019t sure what to do, torn between reacting and alerting Corrado, but he didn\u2019t get much time to consider his options. The driver\u2019s side door swung open and the guy climbed out, keeping his head down as he started down the block. Without even thinking Carmine followed him, dodging streetlights while trying to keep up with his pace. The man slowed when he neared Corrado\u2019s house, staring at it peculiarly like he was trying to assess how to get inside. The living room light was on and Carmine could see shadows, Celia\u2019s laughter faintly filtering out of a cracked window.</p><p>The man ducked beside Corrado\u2019s house and Carmine hesitated, taking a deep breath and clutching his gun before darting behind him. The invader had almost made it to their backyard when he heard Carmine\u2019s footsteps. He swung around, alarmed by the presence, but it was already too late.</p><p>Carmine slammed him into the side of the house, shoving his gun against his temple. \u201cIf you move, I\u2019ll blow your fucking head off.\u201d</p> <p>He cursed and shook as Carmine patted him down, frantically pulling everything out of the guy\u2019s pockets. He found a gun in his coat and made sure the safety was on before sticking it in his waistband.</p><p>Grabbing the man\u2019s wallet, Carmine flipped it open and yanked out his driver\u2019s license. \u201cOisin Quinn. What kinda name is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt me,\u201d he begged. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for trouble!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Carmine spat. \u201cYou don\u2019t lurk around this neighborhood with a gun if you aren\u2019t looking for trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear it\u2019s a mistake!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d Carmine asked, pulling him away from the house and shoving him into the backyard. He stumbled but caught himself before he fell, and hesitated for a second before he took off sprinting through the yard.</p><p>For a brief moment, Carmine remained frozen in utter disbelief. He had just let go of the guy. How fucking stupid could he be?</p><p>Adrenaline kicked in again. Carmine aimed with his finger on the trigger, a hair away from pulling it, but lowered the gun and took off after him instead. Carmine managed to catch him, tackling him in the grass at the edge of the yard. Panicked, the man swung, trying to fight Carmine off, and his fist connected with the right side of his jaw. Pain ripped through his cheek, sending him over the edge.</p><p>If he wanted a fight, Carmine was going to give him one.</p> <p>He pulled his arm back that clutched the gun, slamming him straight in the face with it. A lifetime worth of aggression came pounding from his fists, disappointment and anger, shame and heartbreak. Carmine didn\u2019t know the man, but that mattered not\u2014he took his pain out on him, battering him with pent-up hostility he needed to let go of.</p><p>After he was beat down, Carmine pulled him across the yard and forced him on his knees right outside Corrado\u2019s back door.</p><p>\u201cStay there, motherfucker,\u201d he spat, giving him a swift kick in the side out of frustration. His jaw ached and he was out of breath, blood splattered on his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certainly glad you decided not to shoot him.\u201d</p><p>The voice caught Carmine off guard. He looked up, seeing Corrado standing motionless at the back door, watching them. \u201cFuck, how long have you been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t help me?\u201d he spat, annoyed that Corrado had just watched.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to have it handled,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, it was quite entertaining.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine glared at him. \u201cEntertaining? There\u2019s nothing entertaining about this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Carmine said, reaching into his waistband for the guy\u2019s gun. He cursed yet again when he came up empty-handed and glanced around, realizing it had fallen out during their scuffle. He found it a few feet away and picked it up, handing it to Corrado when he stepped outside. \u201cHe could\u2019ve killed me.\u201d</p><p>Corrado laughed dryly. \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating. You had him, no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have fucking known that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I could. He didn\u2019t do his homework if he parked in front of your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you . . . ?\u201d Carmine stopped, narrowing his eyes when it struck him. \u201cWait, you knew he was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d he replied. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sly, Carmine. Even you noticed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he grumbled, aggravated. \u201cI did all of that for nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was for nothing,\u201d Corrado replied, smiling with amusement. \u201cLike I said, it was entertaining.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head as the guy knelt there, crying with his head down. \u201cWho is this Oisin Quinn asshole, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that his name?\u201d Corrado asked as he took the guy\u2019s driver\u2019s license. \u201cI\u2019m assuming the Irish sent him. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>The guy whimpered. \u201cPlease! I\u2019m sorry, just . . . please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beg,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cTell me who sent you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he cried. \u201cThey paid me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho paid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy, he said it would be easy!\u201d</p><p>Corrado squatted down beside the guy and grabbed him. Carmine could see signs of his anger boiling over and took a step back. One thing Corrado despised was being underestimated. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, no. I mean, they gave me your address, told me where I could find you tonight. They said it would be in-and-out.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head, stunned by the idiocy, although a part of him was undoubtedly on edge.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break it to you, but somebody wanted you dead,\u201d Corrado told the guy. \u201cThey knew you wouldn\u2019t walk away from this . . . from me. You don\u2019t send a nobody after the head of La Cosa Nostra. I made you the moment you walked in the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed as he tried to think back, looking for any sign that Corrado had been on edge. He ran through the night in his mind before their very last conversation struck Carmine. \u201cMotherfucker, you knew this would happen!\u201d</p><p>Corrado smiled slightly, almost like he was proud. Jackass. Instead of replying, he waved his hand dismissively. \u201cGo home, Carmine. I\u2019ll finish this.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled to himself and walked away, hearing the guy yell as he made his way around the house. His cries were cut off damn near instantly by a small pop, almost like the sound of a little snapping firecracker. A single shot with a silencer, he guessed. He definitely wasn\u2019t hanging around to find out for sure.</p><p>Jogging home, Carmine hoped like hell no one had seen him.</p><p>The house was quiet, everything still. Heading into the kitchen, he washed his hands before tucking his gun back away for safekeeping. The empty vodka bottle still sat on the counter beside the sink, taunting Carmine. After what he had just gone through, he could have used a drink.</p><p>You don\u2019t need it, he told himself. You\u2019re alive. You have your girl. There\u2019s nothing more you need.</p><p>He made his way upstairs, the bedroom door open, the bed nothing but a tangled mess of sheets and blankets\u2014no Haven anywhere to be found. Quietly, he crept down the hall and saw a bit of light dancing on the wall from one of the spare rooms. He paused in the doorway, seeing her in front of her canvas with a small paintbrush in her hand. She wore a pair of Carmine\u2019s black boxers and a plain white t-shirt. They hung loosely on her, practically swallowing her frame.</p><p>She was working on the painting of the tree again, the marijuana leaf magically gone and blended into a stormy looking sky. He took a few steps closer, smiling at the sight of her working. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, ADT called and woke me up,\u201d Haven said. \u201cApparently someone went out the back door and forgot to disable to alarm. Lucky I could get to it before they alerted the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck.\u201d That would have been a disaster. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she responded. \u201cI have your back.\u201d</p><p>Carmine chuckled under his breath at her wording, her tone playful, but he knew without a doubt she meant what she said. She had his back. Anything he needed, any time he needed her, she would be right there and do whatever he asked. She wasn\u2019t just his support system\u2014his life vest as he drifted along a tumultuous river of turmoil\u2014she was his everything. Without her, he would sink.</p><p>Haven turned around, her brow furrowing as her eyes scanned Carmine. \u201cWhat in the world were you out doing? You\u2019re filthy!\u201d</p><p>He glanced down, seeing the dirt and grass stains covering his jeans. He shrugged as she laughed, reaching over to pluck a leaf from his unkempt hair. He realized how crazy he must have looked\u2014barefoot and shirtless, covered in filth.</p><p>\u201cJust had some shit to take care of, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been playing football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been playing football,\u201d he muttered, rubbing his jaw. \u201cEither that or I had my ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where you go at night when you disappear? A secret underground fight club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say, tesoro. You know the rules,\u201d he replied, laughing it off. \u201cAnyway, the painting looks good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured out what it was missing,\u201d she said, sticking her paintbrush into a container of water before pointing out the two shadowy figures clinging to the branches. \u201cUs.\u201d</p><p>Carmine smiled, wrapping his arms around her from behind. Leaning down, he kissed the nape of her neck. \u201cWell, it\u2019s perfect now. I know sometimes it\u2019s hard seeing what\u2019s right in front of you. I\u2019ve personally fucked up a few times missing what should\u2019ve been obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what you said earlier, about needing someone around who understands you,\u201d he replied. \u201cBecause you\u2019re right\u2014it is important. When I left you back in Durante, I thought I was leaving for that reason. I thought I was coming here to be with people like me, who live the same life I do, but I was wrong. These people don\u2019t understand me. They can\u2019t. They might know what I\u2019ve been through, but they have no clue how it feels. How it feels to lose your mother to this shit and to be robbed of a childhood. How it feels to have to pay for everyone else\u2019s mistakes. They don\u2019t get it, but you . . . you do. You\u2019re the only one who ever has. I thought we\u2019d be okay apart, but I was sorely mistaken. I don\u2019t need much, Haven, but I do need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you, too, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou make me feel safe.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, kissing the top of her head. Twenty minutes earlier he had practically stared down death, tackling a man who probably wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to kill him, and yet she still felt safe with him. Despite everything, she trusted him. She believed in him. She loved him.</p><p>And he loved her . . . more than anything in the world. She had given herself to him again, every barrier between them broken down. All of those unanswered questions, all of the worry, every single bit of it had been resolved the moment they came back together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHaven,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could have anything, I know what I\u2019d ask for now.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back from their hug to look at him with genuine curiosity. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Carmine took a step back, reaching around his neck to pull off the gold chain. He unfastened it, removing the small ring, and eyed it in his palm momentarily before dropping to his knee. \u201cIf I could have anything in the world, it would be for you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, all of the air was sucked from the room. She stared at Carmine with shock and his heart pounded furiously as he waited for her to say something . . . any-fucking-thing.</p> <p>After a moment, tears formed in the corners of her eyes and one slid down her cheek. He brushed it away quickly as she smiled, the sight putting Carmine at ease. That smile was the only answer he needed.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ask for your freedom back instead?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be shit without you.\u201d</p><p>46</p><p>This is completely unnecessary,\u201d Haven grumbled, gazing out the darkly tinted side window. Buildings whipped by at a steady pace as they drove through the streets of Chicago, the scenery a blur in the darkness.</p> <p>\u201cMr. DeMarco disagrees, ma\u2019am,\u201d a voice said politely from the front seat.</p><p>\u201cCalling me ma\u2019am is unnecessary, too,\u201d she said, glancing at the driver. She noticed he was watching her in the rearview mirror, nervousness written on his face. It was obvious he was new, not wanting to mess up his first chance to prove himself.</p><p>\u201cSorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d he responded, his voice low as he averted his gaze.</p><p>She smiled softly as she looked back out of the window, the irony of the situation not at all lost on her. It astonished her how much had changed, their lives altered in ways they never would have imagined at the beginning. Haven often thought about everything that happened to lead them where they were, curious how things might have turned out had the circumstances been different. She knew it was senseless, because it was impossible to change anything, but she couldn\u2019t help but wonder.</p><p>No matter how many times she thought it through, it always went back to a single event that had been the start of it all\u2014the murder of her grandparents.</p><p>Grandparents\u2014she doubted she would ever get used to saying it. She never considered a family outside of her mother. Carmine offered to explain what he knew, promising he would be more open with her in the future, but it was actually Corrado who told Haven the whole truth. He relayed stories he had heard about the type of people they had been, a strong family full of pride. Corrado said they had been overjoyed to have a daughter. It was startling to hear about her mother\u2019s beginnings and to learn how much she had been wanted . . . how much she had been loved.</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d Haven glanced back over at the driver and saw he was watching her again. \u201cThere was an accident on Highway 41 that blocked northbound traffic. I had to take a detour, but it\u2019ll only be a few minutes longer.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her watch, faintly making out the time in the darkness\u2014a quarter past ten in the evening. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize for any inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd please, call me Haven.\u201d</p><p>She gazed back out the window for the rest of the trip. He didn\u2019t speak again until he pulled up in front of the large white house, parking the limo along the curb. He got out and glanced around cautiously before opening her door. She climbed out of the car. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, knowing it was pointless to correct him again, and pulled out some cash. He tried to refuse her tip, saying it was an honor to drive her, and she rolled her eyes as she stuffed the money in his coat pocket.</p><p>The house was dark and silent, nobody home. Haven kicked her shoes off right inside the door before heading into the kitchen, grabbing a glass from the cabinet and pouring some water into it from the faucet. Leaning against the counter, she took a sip as her eyes scanned the kitchen. There were used paper towels on the table with some cups sitting out, and the dishes definitely hadn\u2019t been done during the day. Part of the counter was covered in crumbs and an empty jar of peanut butter sat beside the sink, the lid halfway on with a dirty knife laying beside it. Something sticky had also been spilled, the floor in desperate need of mopping.</p> <p>She sighed as she looked away from the mess, her eyes drifting toward the calendar on the wall. It was chaotic, writing scribbled all over it and days crossed out, but nothing stood out more than one date at the bottom.</p><p>June 29</p><p>The square was circled with a red marker and Haven smiled as she read the words neatly written in the box: wedding. It had been a year since they had found their way back together, and in a mere five days they planned to make it official.</p><p>Marriage. It was still hard to believe they had come that far. It hadn\u2019t been easy because they couldn\u2019t wrap themselves in a bubble like they had done in Durante. They had to be a part of that world, had to integrate themselves into it and discover where they fit. It was occasionally a source of conflict as they sought to find balance between them as a couple and them as individuals, but it wasn\u2019t so bad that they couldn\u2019t work through it together. They disagreed on details, like how to be safe, and while she sometimes found it overwhelming, she tolerated a lot of what Carmine wanted. She would never get used to the bodyguards or car services, but she knew it was a small price to pay for Carmine\u2019s peace of mind.</p><p>Because peace of mind was something Carmine rarely got.</p><p>Haven took another sip of water before setting the glass down on the counter. She started to walk away but hesitated, turning back around and grabbing the glass again. She put it in the dishwasher and quickly gathered the other dishes that had been left laying around. The sticky floor would have to wait but the rest she couldn\u2019t walk away from, because despite everything that was different, some core things still remained the same.</p><p>Like Corrado had said: Cambiano i suonatori ma la musica \u00e8 sempre quella. The melody\u2019s changed, but the song remains the same.</p><p>Carmine took a deep breath to steady himself, inhaling the scent of greasy cheese and spicy pepperoni. His stomach rumbled, churning ruthlessly. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was actual hunger or purely his frazzled nerves.</p><p>He stepped into the busy pizzeria and spotted Corrado sitting alone at a table along the side. Carmine\u2019s gaze remained focused on the shiny, checkered linoleum as he approached his uncle, ignoring the intense look he received from the register.</p><p>\u201cCorrado,\u201d Carmine greeted him. \u201cI mean, uh, sir.\u201d</p><p>Corrado didn\u2019t bother looking up. He simply kicked the chair out across from him as he pulled a piece of pizza from the small box on the table. It smelled strongly like onions and peppers and sausage.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s stomach churned harder. Definitely nerves.</p><p>He took a seat, trying to avoid smelling the food by breathing through his mouth. Neither spoke as Corrado ate, casually slouched in the chair as if he had not a care in the world. After he finished, he closed the empty box and sat back, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . well, I mean, we . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven and I,\u201d he clarified. \u201cWe wanted to know if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she here?\u201d Corrado asked, cutting him off. \u201cIf she has a problem, she\u2019s more than capable of coming to me herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a school thing tonight.\u201d Carmine sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem anyway. It\u2019s more like a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call me up and say it\u2019s important\u2014so important I take time out of my dinner for you\u2014and it\u2019s because you want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis better be good.\u201d</p><p>Carmine took a deep breath, cringing as he inhaled the scent of the food, and forced the words from his lips before he lost the nerve. \u201cYou know we\u2019re getting married tomorrow . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know,\u201d he replied. \u201cI received my invitation and made plans to come. I am still invited, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. There\u2019s no problem. I already made sure to clear your schedule for the weekend, so you shouldn\u2019t have any problems consummating the marriage.\u201d</p><p>Carmine cringed at his wording. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it? I\u2019m getting impatient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to know if you\u2019ll give Haven away.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stared across the table at him, unmoving, barely blinking, as if he hadn\u2019t heard Carmine speak at all. He had, though, and after a minute or so he slowly shook his head, as if trying to process the words. \u201cGive her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, walk her down the aisle when we get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer dad, well . . . you know. And I\u2019d ask my dad, but well . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>Corrado had killed them. Carmine didn\u2019t say it out loud, but they both thought it.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s eyes widened. He had expected a staunch denial. \u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage.\u201d</p><p>He blanched. \u201cI mean, uh . . . so you\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Carmine smiled, relief settling in, but it wasn\u2019t near enough to calm his frazzled nerves. Just being within a block of that building put him on edge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fidgeting,\u201d Corrado pointed out. \u201cWere you that nervous to ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cI was, but that\u2019s not my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at his uncle, baffled how he could seem so comfortable. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it?\u201d Corrado eyed him with confusion. \u201cI eat here all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but . . .\u201d He leaned over the table, whispering. \u201c. . . his kids.\u201d</p><p>Corrado had killed them, too. Both of them.</p><p>Corrado\u2019s eyes drifted past him toward the front register. Turning, Carmine eyed the owner, John Tarullo, curiously. He only vaguely recognized the man from when he was a kid, remembering eating here a few times with his parents. He knew it had been John, though, that saved him that October day. He owed him a lot\u2014his life, to be precise\u2014but Carmine could hardly stand to look at the aging man.</p><p>He was a walking, talking, unhappy fucking reminder of everything Carmine had been through.</p><p>Sensing the attention\u2014or maybe it was purely coincidence\u2014John chose that moment to look at the two of them. His expression remained stoic, strictly business, but Carmine could sense the deep sadness in his dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cHad I let them live, had I let them continue as they were, my family would\u2019ve been jeopardized. So no, it doesn\u2019t bother me, but losing one of you? That might.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stood, heading for the door, and nodded politely to John Tarullo before disappearing outside.</p><p>After taking a shower and putting on some comfortable clothes, Haven made her way downstairs and saw the light on in the kitchen. Carmine stood in front of the refrigerator with the door wide open, glaring inside of it, home from wherever he had been while she was at school. She didn\u2019t ask, and he didn\u2019t tell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t find anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He shut the door, his eyes scanning a takeout menu stuck to the front of it with magnets.</p><p>\u201cI can make something,\u201d she offered. \u201cYou have to be tired of eating out.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled in amusement, cocking an eyebrow suggestively. \u201cDepends on what I\u2019m eating out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPervert.\u201d She could feel the heat rising into her cheeks, knowing it was useless to try to hide it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you love it,\u201d he said playfully.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d There was no use denying it\u2014he knew Haven well.</p><p>Carmine laughed as he turned away, his attention going back to the menu. \u201cI\u2019ll just order Chinese. It\u2019s late and you shouldn\u2019t have to cook, especially considering you already cleaned the kitchen once tonight. Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that shit. I could\u2019ve done it, you know. I would\u2019ve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you would\u2019ve,\u201d she said truthfully. Carmine never did certain things, like laundry or mopping, but he was good at picking up after himself. He didn\u2019t enjoy it, but he did it for her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the cordless telephone from the wall and dialed a number quickly. \u201cYeah, I need a delivery. The name\u2019s Carmine DeMarco,\u201d he said when they answered, pausing briefly as they looked up his name. \u201cYes, that\u2019s me. I need an order of the pork mu shu wraps, some Mongolian beef, the kung pao chicken, and two orders of your won ton soup. I don\u2019t know, large? Oh, and some egg rolls. How many come in an order? Two? Is that it? That\u2019s a fucking rip off.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Haven, raising his eyebrows. \u201cDid I miss anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it. And don\u2019t forget the fortune cookies,\u201d he said into the phone, his brow furrowing. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t have any fortune cookies? You\u2019re a Chinese restaurant. You have to have fortune cookies. What? No, I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re complimentary. Don\u2019t give me that bullshit. I don\u2019t feel fucking complimented right now. Find some.\u201d</p><p>He ended the call, slamming the phone down on the counter, making Haven flinch. He pulled open the freezer door and looked inside. Haven knew immediately what he was doing, having acted on impulse out of frustration. He stared at the empty spot where the vodka bottle had once been stored before slamming the door again and opening the refrigerator.</p> <p>Haven grabbed the can of Coke from his hand and gently rubbed his back. \u201cFortune cookies aren\u2019t that serious,\u201d she said, nudging him aside to grab a glass from the cabinet. Carmine leaned against the counter and watched as she made a cherry Coke. \u201cYou don\u2019t even eat them. You think they taste like cardboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you do,\u201d he replied. He fidgeted and appeared agitated, rubbing the palms of his hands on his pants anxiously. \u201cYou like them.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly as she handed him his soda. \u201cWell, thanks for thinking of me, but it was unnecessary. Just like sending that limo for me was unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the cookies weren\u2019t, but the limo was definitely necessary,\u201d he said, taking a sip of his drink. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t walk home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I could\u2019ve taken the bus,\u201d she replied. \u201cI kind of like it, anyway. I never got to go to school and ride the bus or anything. Makes it feel authentic.\u201d</p><p>He stared at Haven doubtfully. \u201cYou weren\u2019t taking the bus home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a big deal,\u201d he retorted, raising his voice. \u201cThe bus stop isn\u2019t close to the house so you\u2019d still have to walk in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a few blocks over,\u201d she replied, hoping to reassure him so he would calm down. \u201cIt would\u2019ve only taken a few minutes if I cut down the alley by\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haven stopped speaking abruptly when it struck her what she was saying. Carmine stood frozen, his body rigid. The bus stop was near the old theater a few blocks away, down from where Carmine\u2019s piano recital had been held that October night in 1996. The alley was the one Carmine had taken with his mother, the one he hadn\u2019t gone near since.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she conceded. The odds of something actually happening to her were slim, but once again it was more about his peace of mind. \u201cNo bus at night, but I still want to take it during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know that prefers public transportation,\u201d he grumbled, not happy with her compromise but he didn\u2019t disagree.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t see the point in driving if I don\u2019t have to,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd limos are too flashy. I like fitting in but you sending a car to pick me up from class doesn\u2019t help that. If it gets late and I can\u2019t take the bus, I\u2019ll call a taxi.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed dryly. \u201cAnd you say I\u2019m stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are stubborn,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just rubbing off on me.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a moment before his lips curved into a smile. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll rub something off on you, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she groaned, shaking her head as she looked away from him.</p><p>He chuckled at her reaction before sighing, resigned. \u201cNo taxi, but I can make it more low profile. They have cars that aren\u2019t as conspicuous. If I feel like I need to send a car, I\u2019ll send one of them. Otherwise, whatever, I guess the bus is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re good to me, you know.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and started to respond but was cut off by his cell phone ringing. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation he bolted from the room.</p><p>There was a knock on the door eventually. Carmine reappeared and stepped outside. Haven\u2019s curiosity got the best of her, so she made her way to the kitchen to peek out the window. Her brow furrowed when she saw Carmine standing on the front step with two men, neither of whom she recognized. They all seemed tense, the conversation between them serious\u2014business, she assumed. Her heart rate quickened as it usually did when she witnessed him at work, a bit of fear naturally brewing inside her.</p><p>Carmine suddenly glanced in the direction of the window, his expression hardening when they made eye contact. She stepped out of his sight, not wanting to anger him, and looked toward the street when a car pulled up to the curb. The two men briskly walked past the window and Carmine opened the front door, heading straight for the office again as the deliveryman approached the house with their food.</p><p>Before he could knock, Carmine came back out with his wallet and opened the front door. \u201cYour total is $47.75.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, that\u2019s fucking expensive,\u201d Carmine muttered. Haven strolled toward the doorway of the kitchen and paused, watching as he thumbed through his cash. He pulled out a fifty and handed it to the guy, hesitating before grabbing another five dollar bill. She smiled as he handed it to him for a tip before grabbing the bag of food and shutting the door.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so nosy,\u201d he said when he spotted Haven standing there.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t being nosy. I was just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame damn thing,\u201d he muttered under his breath before adding, \u201cJust be careful, okay? You know that shit makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>Haven grabbed a soda from the fridge for herself and picked up Carmine\u2019s cherry Coke, following him into the living room. They settled onto the couch and ate dinner, chatting casually as they watched television. After they were full Carmine put the rest aside, pulling out a white paper bag and opening it. He laughed as he poured the contents out on the coffee table. Haven looked in shock at the dozen fortune cookies, reading the writing on the clear plastic covering them. They had ordered from Satay, but the cookies came from a place called Ming Choy.</p><p>\u201cYou scared them into buying fortune cookies from another restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably should\u2019ve tipped more for that shit, huh?\u201d he said, unable to hide his amusement. He grabbed one of the cookies and tossed it on her lap before picking up another for himself. He took the cookie out, breaking it apart quickly to pull out his fortune.</p><p>\u201cThe important thing is to never stop questioning,\u201d he read before tossing it down and grabbing another. \u201cThat\u2019s just fucking stupid.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and pulled her fortune out. \u201cYour dream will come true when you least expect it,\u201d she said, reading the strip of paper as she took a bite of the cookie, earning a grimace from Carmine. \u201cMy dreams already came true: family, friends, school, marriage. Couldn\u2019t ask for much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t married yet, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She smiled as she gazed at the scrap of paper. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>The next afternoon, Haven stood in front of an antique full-length mirror, taken aback by her reflection.</p><p>Her hair was curled, the top half pulled back, as a small gold tiara kept her veil in place. Her white dress was simple, one shouldered and long with a train in the back, and she had on a pair of high heels. It wasn\u2019t flashy but it was undoubtedly beautiful, the way she had always envisioned it.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes as her thoughts kept shifting to her mother. Haven missed her terribly and wished she could be there, imagining how proud she would be to see her at that moment. It was everything she wanted for her, everything she told Haven she would find in the world. Once upon a time she had doubted her, thinking it was impossible, but now it was becoming real.</p><p>The door behind Haven opened and she glanced behind her as Corrado walked in. She quickly turned away from him, nervous, as Corrado nonchalantly paused behind her in the mirror. He was quiet for a moment, his silence doing nothing to ease her anxiety.</p><p>\u201cPrincipessa della Mafia,\u201d he said finally, his voice calm. \u201cWhen Vincent first confessed to me who you were, I told him I couldn\u2019t see it. I said you didn\u2019t look like one of us.\u201d</p><p>Haven fidgeted, her heart pounding so hard in her chest that it hurt.</p><p>\u201cI see it now,\u201d he said, staring at her reflection in contemplation as the corner of his lips turned up into a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t see it before.\u201d</p><p>His declaration caught Haven off guard. She gaped at him and he cleared his throat, still uncomfortable with anything even remotely close to affection. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a moment.\u201d</p><p>He walked out without another word. Tears pooled in Haven\u2019s eyes when she heard piano music start up, thoughts of her mother returning. She recalled when she saw her that final time in Blackburn, remembering the last words she ever spoke. She said she would always be with her, in her heart, and the world was a better place with Haven out there in it. She wanted her to live her life, to be happy and follow her dreams, and that day she knew exactly what her destiny was: Carmine.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mama,\u201d Haven whispered into the empty room, giving one last look at her reflection before grabbing her bouquet of white roses. She joined Corrado in the hallway, taking his arm as he held it out to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He led Haven into the church and they paused at the beginning of the aisle, giving her a moment to take it all in. Her vision blurred from dizziness, the sight before her overwhelming. The pews were packed full of people, some of whom she didn\u2019t recognize, and they all stood up the moment they entered. She knew a lot of them weren\u2019t there for her, the members of the organization and their families, but she didn\u2019t mind. They came for Carmine, and out of respect for the man beside her.</p><p>Haven glanced toward the front, her eyes falling upon Carmine. He stood frozen in spot, a look of wonder on his face. Haven lost the battle against her tears, a few streaming down her cheeks as they started down the aisle.</p><p>Corrado let go of Haven when they reached the front, nodding at Carmine before making his way over to the front pew with Celia. The music stopped and the priest said a brief prayer, followed by a collective shuffling as everyone sat back down. Haven handed Tess her bouquet to hold as Carmine continued to stare at her, happiness radiating from him in waves. She scanned him quickly, something she always did when she saw him . . . always looking for injuries, making sure he remained intact, and she laughed when her eyes fell upon his feet.</p><p>\u201cNike\u2019s?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat happened to your shoes?\u201d</p> <p>His smirk grew. \u201cI forgot them.\u201d</p><p>Her tears continued to fall. He quickly brushed a few of them away while the priest started addressing them. \u201cCarmine and Haven, have you come here freely and without reservation to give yourselves to each other in marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d they said simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cWill you honor each other as man and wife for the rest of your lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d they said again, not even having to think about it.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t customary, but the bride and groom have asked to be able to speak and the church has happily agreed to grant their request.\u201d</p><p>The priest glanced between Carmine and Haven curiously and she cleared her throat, trying to get the lump that was forming to disappear. \u201cThe first time you asked me to marry you was three years ago. You told me it didn\u2019t have to be that day, or the next day, or even that year. You just wanted me to swear I would when I was ready. I said yes, of course, and I meant it with everything in me. We were young and maybe we were na\u00efve, thinking we had it all figured out, but one thing I never doubted was that we were meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Haven paused to wipe her cheeks as more tears spilled from her eyes. \u201cWhen I first met you I wasn\u2019t sure what to think. You were nothing like anyone I\u2019d ever met before. The things you made me feel were scary, and I wanted nothing more than to stay away from you, but I couldn\u2019t. I was drawn to you. You gave me hope. You believed in me and helped me, and most of all, you loved me. Me. Out of all the people in the world, you picked me. I was used to being overlooked, used to being invisible, but you saw me. I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today without you. I love you, Carmine Marcello DeMarco, and I want you to know I\u2019m ready now. I\u2019m ready to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSempre,\u201d he whispered, choking on the word. He was trying to keep his composure, not wanting to crack in front of so many people.</p><p>\u201cSempre.\u201d Haven meant it with every fiber of her being. He was hers forever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you remember our first encounter, the morning in the kitchen in North Carolina, and what a disaster it turned out to be,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect anyone to be there. I dropped my orange juice and you started to clean it up, trying to help, and I, uh, well, you know what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Haven smiled sadly at the memory. He had been so angry back then . . . so broken. Carmine still had cracks in him, scars from where he had once shattered, but he was holding himself together now and that was what mattered.</p><p>\u201cWhat you don\u2019t know, though, is that as we sat like idiots in that puddle of juice, all I could think about was how beautiful you were. How beautiful you are. You were scared and confused, and I know I wasn\u2019t helping that, but underneath it all you were just beautiful, Haven. You had me the very first time I laid eyes on you. I remember thinking later that morning you were going to complicate my life.\u201d He paused as he laughed to himself. \u201cAnd complicate it you did. Everything I knew, everything I believed . . . all of it went out the window. You turned me upside down and made me feel again. You saved my life, even though I didn\u2019t realize it needed to be saved. I thought I was fine, that I didn\u2019t need anyone else, but I was wrong, because I do. I need you. Christ, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes widened as the priest inhaled sharply. Carmine stopped talking, realizing what he had just said. \u201cShit,\u201d he spat instinctively, stammering. \u201cThis is a god\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haven knew what he was going to say before the word slipped out and clamped her hand over his mouth before anyone else heard. He stared at her cautiously with panic in his eyes. Haven smiled softly, so he wouldn\u2019t think she was upset, and he visibly relaxed. When she removed her hand, he leaned forward, brushing his lips against hers. She kissed him back, parting her lips and softly moaning as his tongue came into contact with hers.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, man,\u201d Dominic said, grabbing Carmine and pulling him away. \u201cYou\u2019re getting ahead of yourself.\u201d</p><p>The priest cleared his throat, and Carmine let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cSorry, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to finish?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d Carmine shook his head. \u201cI think I\u2019ve said enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo since it is your intention to enter into marriage, join your right hands, and declare your consent before God and his Church,\u201d the priest said, obviously wanting to get the service over with. Carmine grasped Haven\u2019s hand, linking their fingers together and squeezing gently.</p><p>\u201cCarmine, do you take Haven to be your wife? Do you promise to be true to her in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love her and honor her all the days of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven, do you take Carmine to be your husband? Do you promise to be true to him in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love him and honor him all the days of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have declared your consent before the Church. May the Lord in his goodness strengthen your consent and fill you both with his blessings. What God has joined, men must not divide.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged rings at his word and her hand shook as Carmine slipped the simple gold band on her finger, the one she knew belonged to his mother. She gazed at it, emotion overwhelming her when the priest declared them husband and wife.</p><p>\u201cNow you kiss,\u201d Dominic said, nudging Carmine. Haven glanced up again and saw Carmine glare at his brother before focusing on her, his face lighting up with love. He grasped her chin gently and leaned forward, her eyes drifting closed as their lips came together.</p><p>His kiss was sweet but there was passion behind it . . . passion she looked forward to feeling for the rest of her life.</p><p>47</p><p>Just a few more.\u201d</p><p>Carmine tried to stop squirming, but the suit was beginning to suffocate him. It felt like they had been standing there for hours as the photographer snapped picture after picture, posing them in every position imaginable in order to get a good shot. He did his best to keep his eyes focused on the camera, but his attention was drawn to the woman beside him.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Haven said quietly, sensing his discomfort.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cEveryone smile!\u201d the photographer shouted. Carmine smiled on demand, ready to get it over with, and he snapped off a few pictures in quick succession. \u201cThat\u2019s a wrap.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled in relief and loosened his tie. \u201cThat shit took forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d Haven laughed. \u201cIt was only like twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grabbed her hips and she yelped as he quickly pulled her to him. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Haven DeMarco. It was that bad, because it was twenty minutes that I couldn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>He smashed his lips to hers, kissing her deeply, and Tess groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop fucking looking,\u201d he spat, pulling away from Haven long enough to get the words out. He went right back to kissing her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading inside,\u201d Dominic said, patting Carmine on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t keep everyone waiting too long.\u201d</p><p>They stood there for a while, continuing to kiss, as everyone else filtered into Luna Rossa for the reception. Eventually she pulled away from him, panting as she tried to catch her breath, her cheeks flushed. \u201cMaybe we should go inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d he said, trailing kisses down her jaw line as he made his way to her neck. \u201cLet\u2019s leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave, Carmine,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people are here for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he whispered. She laughed, pushing away from him, and he sighed. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re right. We need to go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d she said, grabbing his hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I think we\u2019d have a lot more fun if we were alone right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be plenty of time for that later, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as fuck hope so.\u201d</p><p>She started to walk away, tugging on his arm, and he begrudgingly moved from his spot. They were met by loud applause the moment they stepped inside. Haven blushed and ducked her head, and Carmine chuckled as they walked down the path toward the head table that had been set up. She thanked everyone as they took their seats, waiting for the staff to bring out the food. Plates were set in front of them as someone came over with a green glass bottle and filled their glasses. Carmine nodded in greeting as he poured the bubbly liquid in his glass, picking it up and bringing it to his nose. He grimaced at the smell and Dominic laughed from his seat nearby, swirling his drink around in his glass.</p><p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d be at my little brother\u2019s wedding drinking sparkling white grape juice,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWe have white jasmine sparkling tea, too,\u201d Haven chimed in. \u201cAnd vignette wine country sodas. They look just like champagne but are alcohol free.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sighed and set his glass down without taking a drink, not liking the turn the conversation was taking. It was an open bar for the guests\u2014Corrado\u2019s gift to them, he had said\u2014but Carmine was still banned from drinking in the place.</p><p>They stopped discussing it when everyone had their plates. Carmine picked up his fork and poked at the food, his stomach queasy. His palms were sweaty and he started shaking his leg under the table, feeling uncomfortable in his own skin.</p><p>The compulsion to drink still lingered in Carmine. He craved the liquor, his body screaming for just a little taste to keep it satiated. He could practically feel the burn in his throat, needing a little of that warmth in his chest again for old times\u2019 sake . . . just enough to keep the panic attack at bay.</p><p>He knew that didn\u2019t work from experience, though, because he had given in to it before. It begged for a tiny sip but that was never enough, because once he got it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. A sip turned into two, which turned into an entire bottle, which eventually led to waking up the next morning with a splitting headache, a very pissed off boss, and no recollection of what the fuck happened the night before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, he had no desire to go there again.</p><p>Haven reached under the table and grabbed his thigh, forcefully stilling his leg. He glanced at her cautiously and she smiled, no signs of anger in her expression. She could usually tell when he was struggling. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he replied. The tension started receding from his body as he gazed at her. She glowed, and his chest swelled with emotion at the twinkle of happiness in her eyes, hoping she saw the same thing shining back at her. She meant everything to Carmine. His love for her was stronger than anything else, more potent than the drugs or alcohol had ever been. She was his world, his fucking life, and now she was his wife.</p><p>His wife . . . who would have ever thought Carmine DeMarco would have a wife?</p> <p>\u201cYou should eat your food,\u201d she said quietly, her smile turning mischievous as she turned her attention back to her plate. \u201cYou\u2019ll need the energy later.\u201d</p><p>He groaned at the insinuation and stabbed the meat on his plate. It seemed to be some kind of pork, but he wasn\u2019t entirely sure. Celia had handled the caterers because neither Haven nor he really cared much about the formality of receptions. He was all about ordering some pizza and letting the motherfuckers help themselves, but evidently that wouldn\u2019t fly with the company they kept. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Haven. I\u2019ll have plenty of energy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not worried,\u201d she said as she took a bite. \u201cYou should be, though.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he started eating, already feeling better. The shakiness was usually fleeting, although the thoughts were always in the back of his mind.</p><p>He was taking a drink when Dominic stood, tapping the side of his glass with his fork, calling for everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cI think everyone here knows who I am but in case you don\u2019t, my name\u2019s Dominic. I\u2019m Carmine\u2019s older and wiser brother, although he\u2019d never admit that. He has, however, admitted that I\u2019m the best man, and as the best man it\u2019s my duty to stand up here and try to embarrass his ass,\u201d he started. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I could say about Carmine, so many words out there to describe him that it\u2019s almost impossible to know where to start. He\u2019s stubborn, foolish, finicky, moody, erratic, quick to judge, and even quicker to react. I tend to think he\u2019s pretty ugly, too, but that\u2019s just my personal opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Carmine muttered, running his hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to add he has a foul mouth, which you all got to witness today. The priest is probably blessing the church again right now,\u201d he said humorously. \u201cSome lesser-known qualities about Carmine are that he\u2019s protective over the people he loves, and he fights for what he believes in. He comes off as being selfish, but he\u2019s probably the most selfless person I know.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s Haven, who has to be the most patient person alive to put up with him. At first she and Carmine seemed to be complete opposites, the timid, na\u00efve girl that was experiencing everything for the first time and the jaded, reckless boy who was pretty much sick of it all. I don\u2019t think any of us could\u2019ve predicted that these two people from different ends of the spectrum would meet in the middle, but they did. They balanced each other, found peace in each other, and together they managed to find love. I know that sounds cheesy, like I\u2019m quoting a damn Julia Roberts movie or something, but it\u2019s the truth. What they have is rare.\u201d</p><p>Carmine glanced at Haven and she smiled, reaching under the table to take his hand as Dominic continued.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you all know this, but in high school my brother was kind of a hotshot football player,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be clich\u00e9 or anything, but one thing my own marriage taught me is that relationships are like football in a lot of ways. It\u2019s a team sport and you have to work together to be successful. There are highs and lows, good plays and bad calls, and if you\u2019re going to step out on the field, you need to be ready to play the game. Big mistakes get you benched, and, depending on how bad you screwed up, they can cost you a fortune before you\u2019re allowed back on the playing field. There will always be rivals, people trying to knock you out of the game, but if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll end up with a nice ring to show for your hard work. But it\u2019s not over there, you know. That\u2019s when it really starts, because for the rest of your life you\u2019ll be trying to prove to everyone that you, out of everyone, deserved to be given that ring.\u201d</p><p>He paused, snickering to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s not the biggest way relationships are like football, though. No matter what you do, no matter what happens, the point of both is to score as much as you can. Without scoring, the entire thing is really just a waste of time.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine chuckled as Tess flung her napkin at Dominic. He laughed and playfully blew her a kiss before diving right back into his speech. \u201cI think I should wrap this up. My old lady\u2019s throwing penalty flags,\u201d he joked, holding his glass up. \u201cSo on behalf of my wife, Tess, and I, I want to toast the couple. To Carmine, who couldn\u2019t do better, and to Haven, who quite frankly, couldn\u2019t do worse.\u201d</p><p>They raised their glasses in toast as Carmine kissed Haven. The DJ spoke up, announcing it was time for the first dance. Panic flashed in Haven\u2019s eyes as he took his jacket off. She hesitated before letting him lead her out onto the empty dance floor. He could tell she was uncomfortable with everyone watching, but she tried her best not to let her nerves show.</p><p>He pulled her to him when \u201c18th Floor Balcony\u201d started playing, his hands on her hips guiding her as they started swaying to the music. She put her arms over his shoulders, her fingers playing with the hair at the nape of his neck as she stared into his eyes. He could see the tears she fought back, her eyes sparkling under the lights.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d she replied, her smile growing. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for fucking up the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You didn\u2019t mess it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cursed at Father Alberto, Haven,\u201d he said. \u201cI broke the third commandment. Or maybe it\u2019s the second . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the third,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not that big of a deal. I mean, that\u2019s not the only commandment you\u2019ve broken and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last one, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d he asked, laughing when she shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t break any others standing in the middle of a church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but it could\u2019ve been worse,\u201d she said. \u201cYou managed to make it through the entire thing without saying the F word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor only the second time in my life,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cExactly, so you should be proud. It\u2019s quite the accomplishment for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cI wanted to do the shit right, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIt was very you, Carmine. I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way.\u201d</p><p>The song ended, and everyone converged onto the dance floor. Dominic immediately pulled Haven away and Dia took her place without hesitation, rattling on excitedly through two songs. He stole Haven back on the third, wanting to be with his bride, and they danced until it was time to cut the cake. The incident was a disaster, turning into a full-blown food fight as they flung frosting around and tried to smash pieces in each other\u2019s faces. More of the cake ended up on people than in their stomachs as they laughed and wrestled.</p><p>Afterward they got cleaned up, and Carmine took his seat as Haven prepared to throw her bouquet. Dominic sat beside Carmine, still stuffing his face.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, bro, a Catholic wedding?\u201d Dominic asked, his words mumbled with his mouth full. \u201cDid you take confession beforehand? I bet that took hours.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shoved him, knocking the cake off his fork. \u201cWe talked about eloping, but it didn\u2019t feel right. She dreamed about this her entire life and I couldn\u2019t let her memory of the day be of some fat jackass in an Elvis suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Dominic replied. \u201cI figured you guys would get married like Mom and Dad did . . . something small and intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we thought about that, too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my idea to have the big wedding, though. Nothing about us is traditional and I wanted to at least do this, have this one thing, so we could say we did shit right. And quite frankly, I wanted the whole world to see it. She spent her life in hiding, thinking people were ashamed of her and that she was worthless. I wanted her to be seen.\u201d</p><p>Dominic smiled, amused by something. Carmine ran his hand through his hair anxiously. \u201cI know that probably sounds fucking stupid . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it sounds, I don\u2019t know . . . sweet? Almost as sweet as this cake.\u201d</p><p>A throat cleared behind Carmine then. He turned, freezing when he saw Corrado. He hadn\u2019t heard him approach, which wasn\u2019t surprising considering he had a knack for sneaking up on people. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see you in my office, Carmine,\u201d he said, his tone matching his expression. Stiff. Emotionless. Tense.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cCan\u2019t it wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Corrado walked off, leaving Carmine nervously sitting there beside his brother. He rocked in his chair for a few moments, purposely delaying it, before getting up and following his uncle down the hallway. When he reached the office, he saw his uncle sitting behind his desk. Carmine stepped inside and closed the door.</p><p>He waited for Corrado to tell him to have a seat, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cA man\u2019s word means as much as his blood,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s an old Sicilian expression your grandfather used to say. Your word\u2019s your salvation. What a man says, what he swears to, carries as much weight as who he is and what he does.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared across the office, keeping a straight face despite the anarchy going on inside of him. He watched as his uncle reached into a desk drawer, pulling out a small caliber .22 handgun and a large knife. The blade was serrated, six inches in length. Corrado placed them on the desk in front of him before closing the drawer.</p><p>\u201cYou gave your word over two years ago,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn exchange for help, you bartered your freedom. You promised allegiance, and that\u2019s something I take seriously. When I gave myself to the life decades ago, I knew it was for as long as I breathed. Some men have it handed to them, like Vincent, but I fought hard to prove myself. Antonio made me. He made me prove I was dedicated, that I wanted it, and I did. I like to think that\u2019s why I\u2019m still alive today and your father\u2019s no longer with us.\u201d</p><p>A light laugh escaped Corrado\u2019s lips. It sounded to Carmine a lot like amusement mixed with cynicism. \u201cIt only took a few months for your grandfather to give me his blessing to marry his only daughter, but it took years before he trusted me enough to let me inside his organization. Because to men like us, it comes first\u2014before our families, before our friends, before everything, it\u2019s La Cosa Nostra.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Picking up the knife, Corrado eyed it intently, running his fingers carefully along the blade. \u201cBefore we\u2019ll welcome you in, you first have to bleed for us. Nowadays it\u2019s usually a simple prick of the trigger finger, a tiny droplet of blood on a piece of paper. Painless, leaves no lasting scar, no mark identifying them as a man of honor. But back in my day, it was real. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Carmine swallowed, trying to wet his painfully dry throat. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you bleed for Salvatore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cAll he wanted was my word.\u201d</p> <p>Corrado continued to gaze at the knife. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>For a brief second, Carmine blanched in fear, but there was no hesitance in his steps. He knew there couldn\u2019t be. He extended his right hand and Corrado grabbed it, roughly yanking him closer and pinning it against the desk.</p><p>\u201cA man\u2019s word means as much as his blood,\u201d Corrado repeated. \u201cSal only wanted your word, but I require your blood.\u201d</p><p>Carmine squeezed his eyes shut when he felt the knife against his skin. Gritting his teeth, he forced himself to stay silent as the jagged blade cut into him. It slowly sliced across his palm, a searing burn igniting his hand as it tore into his flesh.</p><p>When it was over, Carmine opened his eyes again and relaxed, but he was too soon. Corrado grasped his hand tighter, violently closing it into a fist. Stabbing pain shot up his arm and he couldn\u2019t hold back the strangled grunt that forced its way from his chest. Tears of agony stung his eyes, but none fell down his cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cYou asked me to give Haven away, and I agreed,\u201d Corrado said, still holding him there, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t just talking about walking her down the aisle. You want her? You love her? You\u2019ve bled for her. She\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>He pushed him away from the desk and pulled out a rag to wipe the blood from his knife. Carmine clutched his wounded hand to his chest, keeping it fisted. After Corrado\u2019s knife was clean, he placed it back in the drawer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the girl, but you can\u2019t have the organization,\u201d Corrado continued. \u201cYou\u2019ll never prove yourself worthy of the oath, and nothing you can do will change my mind. You\u2019ll never be a man of honor. You\u2019re not cut out for this life, and I refuse to just hand it to you like Vincent had it handed to him.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at him as those words sunk in. He had no clue what to say, or if a response was even warranted. His words weren\u2019t cruel, no anger was in his voice. It was emotionless, spoken matter-of-factly. He would never be one of them. That was that.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, your personal debt to La Cosa Nostra has been satisfied,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cYou owe nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Carmine blinked rapidly. \u201cThat means . . .\u201d</p> <p>Corrado waved dismissively. \u201cIt means you\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>Free. That word echoed through Carmine\u2019s mind so feverishly he nearly forgot about the throbbing in his bleeding hand. \u201cGo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever you want,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou should probably consult Haven first, though. Something tells me she wouldn\u2019t be so forgiving the second time around.\u201d</p><p>Dumbfounded, all Carmine could do was blink and nod in agreement.</p><p>Corrado stood up from his desk and walked around to face his nephew. Grabbing his arm, he pried his hand open and pressed the rag against the wound. The bleeding had slowed, but it still stung ferociously. After cleaning it up, Corrado wrapped it with a white bandage. \u201cNow get out of here. Walk away.\u201d</p><p>Carmine started to turn but stopped, those words washing through him, comforting the ache inside of him. Walk away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of running,\u201d Haven had said. \u201cI want to be able to walk away.\u201d</p><p>Without even thinking about it, he flung himself at Corrado, wrapping his arms around his uncle in a hug. Corrado\u2019s body remained rigid as he just stood there, caught off guard by the display of affection. The hug was over in a matter of seconds.</p> <p>\u201cCan I ask you something, Uncle Corrado?\u201d Carmine asked when he reached the door.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Carmine motioned toward the .22 still laying on the desk. \u201cWhat was the gun for?\u201d</p><p>His answer was immediate. \u201cIn case you hesitated.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWould you really have shot me for that?\u201d he asked, pausing for two beats before shaking his head, not giving him a chance to respond. \u201cActually, you know what? Don\u2019t answer that. I don\u2019t even wanna fucking know.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and stepped out of the office, the sound of Corrado\u2019s laughter following him.</p><p>Corrado sat in his office after Carmine left, staring at the gun. It wasn\u2019t even loaded.</p><p>After a moment, he picked it up and opened his desk drawer. He dropped the gun in, staring down at it as it clanked against the unlabeled VHS tape. He had nearly forgotten it was in there, but the words he had heard as he watched it were ones he would never forget. He could still hear Frankie\u2019s voice and see his flickering face as he confessed.</p><p>\u201cIn the spring of \u201873, Carlo offered Ivan Volkov thirty thousand dollars to take out Salvatore\u2019s brother-in-law. He wasn\u2019t the first one hired. Seamus O\u2019Bannon was approached first, but he wanted nothing to do with killing a man\u2019s family.</p><p>Carlo and I . . . we tailed Ivan. We didn\u2019t think he\u2019d really do the job, and we were right. When he showed up at the house, he realized Federica and the baby were home. He left, I guess to come up with a new plan, but Carlo said we\u2019d gone too far to walk away.</p><p>He shot them. Killed them both. Then he went into the baby\u2019s room. She was sleeping. He pointed his gun to her head, but I couldn\u2019t let him do it. I took her instead. I mean, I get it. Leave no witnesses. But what kinda witness does a baby make?</p><p>I took her to Sal, and all he had to say was, \u201cI don\u2019t care what happens to her as long as I don\u2019t have to look at her face.\u201d But I had to look at her face, and I have to look at her daughter\u2019s face, and I can\u2019t do it anymore. Every time I see them, I feel the guilt all over again. I want to be rid of them, I want to never have to see them again, but something stops me every time.</p><p>If they disappear, no one will ever know who they are. No one will ever know what we did . . . what he did. But they\u2019re proof. And someday, somehow, I know it\u2019ll come back to haunt him, but I think he knows it, too.</p><p>I think he\u2019s going to have me killed next.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stepped out of his office a few minutes later, pausing when he reached the main floor of the club. The place was still quite packed, the guests dancing the night away and drinking heartily at the bar. Half of them didn\u2019t even notice the bride and groom had left, too wrapped up in their own lives to even take a look around them.</p><p>It was something Corrado was used to in people. Selfishness. They thought only of themselves and their own desires, their ego too big for them to be able to reach past it. Corrado wasn\u2019t innocent of it himself. For many years, he only saw black and white. It was his way or no way, and his way was always right.</p><p>But somewhere along the line, that changed. Maybe it was his own death that did it, or maybe it happened when he delivered death, but one day he opened his eyes and finally noticed the gray between the layers. It was subtle, but it was there, and once he saw it, he couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>The others, though, would never see it. They would never understand. They were all built one way, put together piece by piece like droids\u2014no conscience, no remorse, no guilt. They lost track of the things that mattered over time, and without realizing it, Corrado had, too.</p><p>He strolled through the club, grabbing a long-stemmed red rose from one of the dark glass vases on the tables. Twirling it in his hand, he strolled up to his wife and held it out to her. \u201cFor you, bellissima.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as she took the flower from him. \u201cWow, what did I do to deserve this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he replied, smirking as he added, \u201cand everything.\u201d</p><p>A smile lit up her face as he took her arm, leading her past the others into the center of the dance floor. He motioned to the DJ and the vibrating bass of a pop song abruptly cut off, Sinatra\u2019s version of \u201cLuna Rossa\u201d starting up seconds later.</p><p>His hands firmly grasped her hips as he pulled her close. Celia wrapped her arms around his neck, clutching the rose along his back. They swayed to the music, staring into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo Carmine and Haven ran out of here awfully fast,\u201d she mused.</p><p>\u201cDid they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Carmine looked like he was injured. I asked what happened, but he told me not to worry about it. He looked happy, though. Ecstatic, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>She continued to stare at him, questions clouding her confused eyes. She wouldn\u2019t ask, and he knew it. He appreciated her restraint. But this time, he felt she deserved an answer. This time, he felt she needed to know.</p><p>Leaning down, he softly kissed her mouth, a bit of her red lipstick smudging on his dry lips. She laughed, wiping it away with her free hand as he whispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything except help him.\u201d</p><p>48</p><p>Later that night, a call for a three-alarm fire went out through the emergency wire. Firefighters raced to the scene and filled the parking lot, trying to combat the vicious blaze in the darkness but to no avail. Fire ravished Luna Rossa, completely gutting the building and obliterating the landmark social club.</p><p>The massive pillar of smoke could still be seen across town come daybreak, but Corrado was none the wiser. He remained snuggled up in his bed at home, his strong arms wrapped around his wife as the two of them slept late for the first time in years.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the police knocked on the front door of the Moretti residence that Corrado learned the news: his life\u2019s work had gone up in flames, stolen from him by arsonists. They promised a full investigation, but Corrado didn\u2019t need one. He knew right away who had done the job.</p><p>Finally, after all that time, the Irish had exacted their revenge.</p><p>Had anyone else been in charge, a full-scale war would have broken out in Chicago then, demolishing the Windy City as the factions hunted one another, determined to take each other out, but Corrado was smarter than that.</p><p>After a few botched jobs and a failed assassination attempt on Corrado\u2019s life, the feud ended swiftly with a massacre at an underground gambling game run by O\u2019Bannon. Men swarmed the place in the middle of the afternoon, disarming and slaughtering the gamblers one by one. The Irish never knew what hit them.</p><p>For good measure, and maybe a laugh or two, Corrado\u2019s men set the building on fire before they walked away.</p><p>The media called it the Saint Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre Part II even though it happened in the late fall. The headline on the front page of the newspaper the next day read REPUTED MAFIA BOSS TAKEN IN FOR QUESTIONING, but was followed up shortly by THE KEVLAR KILLER WALKS FREE AGAIN. Everyone knew he had ordered it, but Corrado had a solid alibi, one nobody could dispute: He and his wife had been meeting with contractors, finalizing plans to build Luna Rossa once again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Those weren\u2019t the only plans in the making. While all this was happening, Haven and Carmine were across the country, safe and sound in the tiny ghost town of Blackburn. On the ground where the Antonelli ranch once stood\u2014the ranch Corrado had purposely destroyed\u2014the shell of a new building had already appeared. The three-story structure, designed from scratch, would someday house the first official Safe Haven.</p><p>\u201cI want to build thirty-three of them in all,\u201d Haven had said. \u201cA place for people like me to go to start their new lives. When they run, I want them to have somewhere to go. I want them to know they\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>TEN YEARS LATER . . .</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>Leaves crunched and twigs snapped as the little girl tramped through the shadowy forest, her dirty bare feet sinking into the cool ground. The plush grass tickled as it slipped between her toes but she kept a straight face, not daring to laugh.</p><p>No, laughing wouldn\u2019t be good. Not here. Definitely not now.</p><p>Keeping her head down, eyes fixed on the ground, she followed the small trail that wove through the trees. She could hear the single set of footsteps stomping along behind her, could feel the pair of narrowed eyes burning holes into the back of her head. It made her muscles tense and she clenched her small hands into fists, wincing. Cuts and scrapes routinely adorned her body, the newest ones covering her palms. They burned, the skin rubbed away as drops of blood oozed from the filthy surface.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>She stepped out of the trees and into the large clearing, the last remnants of bright North Carolina sunshine streaming on her as the sun started to set. Her feet suddenly moved faster then, carrying her away from the protection of the trees, but she wasn\u2019t fast enough.</p> <p>A strong hand clamped down on her shoulder from behind, instantly stalling her movements. \u201cOh no, where do you think you\u2019re going, girl?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders the best she could. Where was she going? She didn\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t as if she could escape him.</p><p>He let out a dry laugh at her lack of response. \u201cHaven, look who I found.\u201d</p><p>The woman swung around where she stood in the yard, panic on her face as her hands clutched her swollen stomach. She looked like she was carrying a watermelon under her pink shirt, but the little girl knew it was really a baby\u2014her daddy told her so. A little brother named Nicholas, but she secretly hoped they would be nice and give her a sister instead.</p><p>But nice wasn\u2019t a word she would use to describe them. No, they were anything but happy with her right now. A brother it would be.</p> <p>Yuck.</p><p>Her mama let out a deep sigh that seemed to cover the entire clearing, wrapping them all in a sense of relief. \u201cWhere was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the woods,\u201d he replied, still keeping her locked in place. \u201cShe was climbing a big ass tree, as usual. Fell out of the motherfucker, too. She\u2019s lucky she didn\u2019t break her neck.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head exasperatedly. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. She is your daughter, after all.\u201d</p><p>The hand on the girl\u2019s shoulders disappeared seconds before her dad stepped around her, a pair of small pink Nike\u2019s swinging in his hand. She had discarded them in the woods as she ran along the path, preferring to go barefoot. She was like her mama that way. She couldn\u2019t stand to feel restrained. She liked to be free to run and jump and play and climb trees even though Daddy said it wasn\u2019t safe.</p><p>Her dad strolled through the yard, kissing her mama quickly before going inside the big three-story house. They had been coming there to Durante every summer since she was a baby, although the girl couldn\u2019t remember those first few years. Usually Uncle Dominic and Aunt Tess came along with her cousin Vinnie, but they took him to a football camp this year, so they wouldn\u2019t make it to visit until later.</p><p>Aunt Dia was in town, though, with her new girlfriend. They came by a few times but were staying with other family, so it was just them for now\u2014just her and her parents in the big, old house.</p><p>She thought it would be fun, not having to share anything, but it turned out the lack of chaos only led her to get into more trouble by herself.</p> <p>The little girl still didn\u2019t move from the spot in the yard, firmly rooted in the ground as her mama approached. She wiggled her toes, digging into the dirt, trying to distract herself, and couldn\u2019t stifle the giggle that escaped her lips that time.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d her mama asked, crouching down in front of her.</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders again, head still down, as she whispered, \u201cIt tickles, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Maura Miranda DeMarco could only be described as a tiny tornado, a ball of energy that couldn\u2019t be tamed. She was tiny, shorter than the average seven-year-old, but her size didn\u2019t impede her at all. She would jump any hurdle, climb any obstacle, and solve any problem in her way. A combination of both of her parents\u2014her dad\u2019s daring personality with her mom\u2019s strong exterior\u2014she had proven to be a force of nature since the day she was born.</p><p>Her appearance, though, contradicted her fiery personality. Long lashes framed a set of big green eyes, eyes she had gotten from her dad, while soft waves of brown hair fell into her face. Her pale complexion had a constant pink flush to her round cheeks, splashes of freckles dotting her nose. She looked like a porcelain doll, vulnerable, breakable, when she was anything but.</p><p>The girl was tough as nails. If you asked her dad, he would say she came into the world screaming and hadn\u2019t shut up since.</p><p>Usually bold and unrestrained, Maura was uncharacteristically quiet as she stood in front of her mama in the yard.</p><p>Reaching over, her mom grabbed Maura\u2019s hands and pried her fists open, surveying the bloody scrapes. Wordlessly, she led her into the house, taking her straight to the kitchen and sitting her on the counter beside the sink.</p><p>\u201cYou know better than to run off like that,\u201d she said quietly, washing out her daughter\u2019s wounds. \u201cWe have to know where you are at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you have to remember.\u201d Her mama paused, sighing. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Not safe seemed to be her parents\u2019 favorite thing to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Really, really, really sorry.\u201d Maura stared at her with wide eyes. \u201cReally, Mama.\u201d</p><p>A smiled tugged her lips. \u201cI believe you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>A throat cleared behind them. Her dad stood just inside the kitchen, leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I believe you. You didn\u2019t throw in enough \u2018reallys.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Daddy!\u201d Maura said, nodding so furiously she nearly knocked herself off the counter. \u201cReally, really, times twenty-nine hundred thousand million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many is that?\u201d</p><p>Maura opened her mouth to reply but only offered silence. She looked to her mama after a moment for an answer. \u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot,\u201d Maura agreed, turning back to her dad. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Her mama excused herself as her dad strolled over to the counter, stopping in front of Maura. She gazed at him with her big green eyes, hesitance with a tinge of fear lurking in them.</p><p>She thought she was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you scared your mother,\u201d he said. \u201cShe hates it when she can\u2019t see you. She\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll go missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever?\u201d Maura asked. \u201cLike those other people Mama talks about that no one sees?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s scared you\u2019ll disappear.\u201d</p><p>Maura stared at him, her forehead scrunched up as she processed his words. \u201cWhere would I go if I disappear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d just be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t be able to see you and Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna disappear, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why do people?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy does anyone disappear? Why don\u2019t we find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hidden,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s forever, but sometimes, after a few years, someone finally sees them and makes it their mission to save them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Mama!\u201d she declared, her face lighting up as she put together the pieces. \u201cGrammy Maura saved Mama, right? That\u2019s what you say!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd before that, your grandfather saved your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Her bright expression dulled a bit. \u201cBut then they disappeared again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey died,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s different. We know where they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He sighed exasperatedly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Heaven, I guess? But they\u2019re still with us, too. That\u2019s what I meant. We carry them around in our hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they with Grammy Miranda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re all together up in Heaven, doing whatever the fuck people do there.\u201d</p><p>Maura\u2019s eyes widened as her mouth formed an \u2018o\u2019 in shock. \u201cYou owe money for the swear jar! Four quarters!\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said a swear! And outside you said two swears! Four quarters!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s only three.\u201d</p><p>Maura smiled, whispering, \u201cThat was four, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her when he realized she had tricked him, tickling her sides. Giggles erupted from her, filling the kitchen with the sound of carefree, childish laughter. She grasped at his hands, kicking her small feet, and nearly nailed him in the crotch. He clutched her tightly, pulling her off the counter and swinging her around in a circle before setting her on her feet.</p><p>Taking her small hand in his, he led her outside and pulled her over toward the giant tree at the corner of the house. \u201cYour mother used to climb this tree, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said. \u201cShe climbed it like a champ.\u201d</p><p>He picked Maura up, pushing her toward the tree. She grasped the closest branch and pulled herself up, wiggling out of his arms. She climbed up onto it, fearlessly scaling it, and sat down against the thick trunk a few branches away. Her dad stood just below her, watching and waiting, but giving her enough space to explore on her own.</p><p>Fireflies flickered in the yard as the sky darkened. She reached out and caught one of the bugs, giggling.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, maybe it is the same,\u201d she said, letting the bug go. \u201cMaybe the people who disappear are just like Grammy Maura and Grammy Miranda and Papa Vincent. If I disappeared, I\u2019d still be in your heart like them, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThey\u2019re gone, and I know that. I know they\u2019re never coming back. But your place is right here with your mother and me. Don\u2019t you ever forget that. If you disappeared, I\u2019d tear the fucking world apart until I found you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Maura stared down at him inquisitively, pondering his words.
