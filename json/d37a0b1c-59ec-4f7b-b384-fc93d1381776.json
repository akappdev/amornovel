Looking at the city from the bell tower of Saint Germain, the Duke of Fletcher could see candles flaring in store windows, and though he couldn\u2019t smell roasting goose, holly leaves and gleaming berries over doors signaled that all of Paris had turned its mind toward a delicious banquet of gingerbread and spice, of rich wine and sugared cakes. An ancient joy shone in each passerby\u2019s eyes and spilled from children\u2019s laughter. Magic sang in the wild peals of church bells that kept breaking out first in one church and then another, in the way each sprig of mistletoe sheltered sweet kisses. It was Christmas...It was Christmas in Paris, and if there was ever a city made for love, and a season made to enjoy it in, the two of them together were as intoxicating as the strongest red wine.</p><p>In fact, philosophers have argued for years whether it is possible to be in Paris and not fall in love...if not with a ravishing woman, then with the bells, with the baguettes, with the gleam of the illicit that touches every heart, even those of proper English noblemen. The duke would have answered that question without hesitation. He had thrown away his heart after one glance at Notre Dame, had succumbed to the siren call of delicious food after one bite of French bread, and had finally\u2014absolutely\u2014irrevocably\u2014fallen in love with a young and ravishingly beautiful member of the opposite sex.</p> <p>From where Fletch stood in the bell tower, Ponte Neuf leapt the Seine in a voluptuous curve, and all Paris shimmered below him, a forest of spires and roofs, dusted with snow. Every gargoyle sported a long silver nose. Notre Dame floated queen-like above the other more narrow and anxious spires that seemed to beg for God\u2019s attention. The cathedral ignored such slender anxieties, counting herself more beautiful, more devoted, more luxurious than the others. Christmas, she seemed to say, is mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost miraculous, how we feel about each other.\u201d</p><p>Fletch blinked and looked down at his bride-to-be, Miss Perdita Selby. For a moment Notre Dame, Poppy and Christmas were confusingly mixed in his mind: as if a cathedral were more erotic than a woman; as if a woman were more sacred than the holiday.</p><p>She smiled up at him, her face framed by soft curls, the color of white gold streaked with sunlight, her mouth as sweet and ripe as any French plum. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s too good to be true, Fletch? You don\u2019t, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Fletch said promptly. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful woman in the country, Poppy. The only miracle is that you fell in love with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s no miracle,\u201d Poppy said, putting a slender finger squarely on the dimple in the middle of his chin. \u201cThe moment I saw you, I knew that you were everything I wanted in a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d He put his arms around her, regardless of who might be watching. It was Paris, after all, and while there were plenty of English gentlefolk here, standards weren\u2019t as rigid as they were back in London.</p><p>\u201cWell, you are a duke,\u201d she said teasingly.</p><p>\u201cYou just love me for my title?\u201d He bent his head to kiss her on the cheek. Her skin was inexpressibly creamy and soft. It drove him into an ecstasy of lust...a French-inflected lust, the kind that wanted to kiss a woman from the very tip of her toes to the top of her ears, that wanted to lick and snuffle and eat her, as if she were more delicious than a truffle (which she would be).</p><p>It was not the kind of lust he ever felt before he came to France. In En gland, men looked at women as vessels in which to plunge and buck. But Fletch could feel himself changing and growing, the power of Paris and love. He wanted to worship Poppy\u2019s body, taste the sweet salt of her sweat, kiss away her tears of joy after he brought her to the ultimate happiness.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Poppy said, laughing. \u201cYour title is all important. I didn\u2019t even notice how handsome you are, or the way you treat ladies with so much respect, or the fact that you dance so beautifully, or\u2014or this dimple.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDimple?\u201d Fletch was bent on kissing her again, and he meant to distract her into talking as long as he could so she would relax into the intimacy of it. Little Poppy was the sweetest girl in the world, but she was devilishly hard to kiss. Every time he managed to get her alone, there was always some reason why he couldn\u2019t hold her, why he couldn\u2019t kiss her. At this rate, they would have to wait until their wedding night to indulge in any and all of the wanton things that paraded through his mind twenty-four hours a day.</p><p>\u201cIn your chin,\u201d she said, nodding her head. \u201cThe dimple was what really made up my mind.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, a little disgruntled. \u201cI hate this dimple. In fact, I may well grow a beard to cover it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you couldn\u2019t do that!\u201d she sighed, caressing his chin. \u201cIt\u2019s so adorable. You can tell just from looking at it what kind of man you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what kind of man is that?\u201d he asked, bending his head again and never guessing how much her answer would resound in his mind in years to come.</p><p>\u201cHonorable, and true, and\u2014and everything a woman could possibly want in a husband. All the ladies agree; you should hear the Countess Pellonni\u00e8re. She says you\u2019re delicious.\u201d</p><p>Fletch thought that Poppy might have missed the point of the countess\u2019s admiration. \u201cThey all say that?\u201d He was close enough to her mouth that he made a sudden dive at it. For a second he thought she was yielding; those sweet rosy lips of hers that kept him up half the night in a fever of lust softened under his assault. But when he added a little tongue to the mix\u2014</p><p>\u201cEeek! What are you doing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKissing you,\u201d he said, dropping his arms from around her shoulders because she was whacking him with her muff and it seemed the right thing to do.</p><p>\u201cThat is disgusting,\u201d she said, glaring at him. \u201cDisgusting! You don\u2019t think that duchesses go around doing that sort of thing, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing?\u201d he asked helplessly.</p><p>\u201cKissing like that. You put your\u2014your saliva in my mouth!\u201d She looked truly horrified. \u201cHow could you think that I would allow something like that? I\u2019m disgusted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Poppy, that\u2019s what kissing is like,\u201d he protested, feeling a chill wisp of alarm down his backbone. \u201cHaven\u2019t you seen people kissing under the mistletoe? You can ask anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I ask anyone,\u201d she said in a heated whisper. \u201cTo ask anyone would be to allow them to know of your perversion\u2014and I would never do that. You are going to be my husband, after all!\u201d A strange mixture of adoration and reprobation crossed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d he exclaimed in relief. \u201cAsk the Duchess of Beaumont. She knows exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>Poppy frowned. \u201cMy mother says that the duchess is the most unprincipled Englishwoman in Paris. It\u2019s true that I am very fond of Jemma, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s disapproval of the duchess,\u201d Fletch said, \u201cmakes her the very person to ask about a little question like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Jemma is not kissing anyone,\u201d Poppy objected. \u201cWhy, Mother says that the duke barely even visits her. He finally came last summer, when Parliament was out.\u201d She gazed up at him, her blue eyes impossibly innocent. \u201cHow could I ask her about kissing you? It would make her feel sad that her own marriage is so terribly empty, when ours will be so lovely.\u201d She put a hand on his cheek, and suddenly none of it mattered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you ask or not,\u201d he said, pulling her into his arms again. At least she let him hold her. That would have to do until they wed. \u201cWe can work it all out on our wedding night.\u201d He was determined to bring his beloved Poppy the same pleasure that he would find in her body. He\u2019d read all about it in a French book, stumbling along through the strange words. And he was astute enough to realize that none of the semi-professional encounters with women he\u2019d had before coming to Paris had had anything to do with his partner\u2019s pleasure. In fact, thinking of their practiced moans made him shudder.</p><p>If Paris had taught him anything, it was this: he could sleep with Cleopatra herself, and if she wasn\u2019t enjoying the act, he didn\u2019t want anything to do with it. When a Parisian woman smiled, her smile was an invitation that had everything to do with her pleasure, and little to do with his. When a Parisian woman smiled at him, Fletch remembered C\u00e9cile, who told him that his lips were as beautiful as cherries, or \u00c9lise, who uttered little screams when she saw him unclothed. Of course, \u00c9lise and C\u00e9cile belonged to his first month in Paris, before he fell in love. Now his heart was full of Poppy...and his loins would love to follow his heart.</p><p>But Poppy, leaning against his broad shoulder, frowned to herself. What exactly did Fletch mean by saying that they would work it out? That sounded as if this type of kissing was something he had his heart set upon.</p><p>Poppy was a practical little soul, at the heart. She could see that her husband\u2019s easygoing manners and sweet eyes masked a sturdy determination to get his own way. One only had to look at his windswept locks to see that. Never a touch of powder! Her mother clucked, but Fletch refused...and Poppy had to admit that he looked well with raven locks tumbling around his neck.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Jemma,\u201d she promised. He was kissing her ear, and she liked that. In fact, she enjoyed many of the things Fletch did, like putting his arms around her (as long as he didn\u2019t disturb her hair), and kissing her ear and her cheek and her chin, and even her lips, except when he became a trifle too forceful in that respect.</p><p>Her mother had instructed her very firmly on that front. \u201cYou must allow him to brush your lips with his,\u201d she had said. \u201cAfter all, he is a duke. You will be a duchess. In order to catch a duke, one must allow certain indignities.\u201d</p><p>At the time, Poppy had laughed at the idea that Fletch\u2019s lips on hers could be seen as an indignity. Joy had flooded her soul that she was so lucky. She was in love with a duke, and that made her mother happy. A duke (darling Fletch) was in love with her...and that made her happy. In fact, the world was all sunshine and light, if she could just work out this kissing business.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you how nice it is,\u201d Fletch said coaxingly. When his voice deepened like that, Poppy wanted to do anything he wished, though of course she would never have told him so. One mustn\u2019t let men know how much power they have, her mother often said. And she was right, of course.</p><p>But she obediently bent her head up towards his, and he brushed his lips across hers. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d she said encouragingly. \u201cWhy, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The next moment he pulled her so sharply into his arms that she felt her stays poke directly into her breasts; her brooch unhooked and fell to the stone floor. \u201cFletch!\u201d she cried. He took advantage of that, and stuck his tongue directly into her mouth. Directly! And\u2014and swept it about, as if she were some sort of cupboard he were cleaning.</p><p>\u201cAwk, urg, no!\u201d she shrieked, shoving him away. For a small woman, Poppy had a lot of strength.</p><p>\u201cBut Poppy...\u201d</p><p>Not even his sad eyes could make her change her mind about this. \u201cI love you, Fletch, you know that.\u201d She narrowed her eyes and waited.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much I love you,\u201d he said, giving her a coaxing little smile.</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile back. \u201cYou simply have to learn that there are things that\u2014that an English lady doesn\u2019t do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He looked a bit confused, and Poppy had a flash of pride. For once, she knew something he didn\u2019t!</p><p>\u201cMama says that ladies have different rules for intimacy than\u2014than, say, our lavandi\u00e8re does,\u201d she explained to him, carefully keeping even the slightest bit of condescension out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t kiss? Of course ladies kiss. And washerwomen too, no matter whether they\u2019re French or English!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may kiss,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there are different kinds of intimacies practiced by the different classes, of course. Just as we wear different clothing, and eat different foods. And different nations too. We are fundamentally different. My mother says that English gentlewomen have very little in common with the French.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her and Poppy nearly blinked. Could that look be, just a little, well, disappointed? She hated disappointing people. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d she asked, a catch of anxiety in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d he said, rather slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou can see it yourself, Fletch, if you compare our monarchy to that of the French. The English court is virtuous, whereas the French court is riddled with scandal. My mother says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, the English court is as rife with scandal as is the French. The distance of the Channel just makes it look cleaner. Their rumors don\u2019t make it across the water.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy thought about that. \u201cSo you mean that last week, when there was all that fuss about Lady Serrard flirting with L\u2019Anou...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never heard about it in En gland, obviously, but it was all we talked of for days. Yet it came to nothing. We never hear English tittle-tattle, any more than they will hear of Lady Serrard\u2019s supposed indiscretion.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a fair point,\u201d Poppy conceded.</p><p>He grinned down at her and her breath caught in her throat. She couldn\u2019t help thinking that Fletch was far too beautiful for her.</p><p>The eyes of all the French ladies followed him, even those of the Countess Pellonni\u00e8re. He often didn\u2019t appear to notice, but Poppy did. Looking up at him now, she felt as if she could turn to stone, admiring his beautiful eyes (black in the center with a luminous gray rim), his lean body, the way he moved so gracefully, even when just walking. A lady had once sighed and said that to watch the Duke of Fletcher make his bow was to see the male body at its utter peak of grace. How on earth could such a nonpareil have fallen in love with her, Poppy, short for Perdita and just short in general?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the only one with that question in mind. French ladies looked at her and tittered behind their fans. They drifted past, congratulating her on her cleverness or called her a mignonne, which was next thing to calling her an infant.</p><p>Last night Fletch wore a mantle of black Epingle velvet embroidered with black jet beads to a ball given by the Duchess of Orleans. With his hair in a simple queue at his neck, he combined a rakish care-for-nothing air with the garments of an \u00e9l\u00e9gante. French ladies dropped their fans to smile at him, with that special pout they kept for delicious men. She had watched him smile in return, and then bow before the Countess d\u2019Argentau, dancing with her for the second time.</p><p>\u201cSit straight!\u201d her mother had barked at her. \u201cYou are going to be his duchess, not that rag-tale piece of nobility. Don\u2019t peer like a lovesick nursling; you lower yourself by noticing her attentions to him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut Mama,\u201d Poppy had said, pushed into honesty by the twist in her gut, \u201cthe countess is so much more beautiful than I. And her gown is so much more revealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are attired perfectly for a young girl making her debut,\u201d her mother had said, looking her over. \u201cAnd if your face and figure are not the height of regularity and beauty, no one could say that I spared the least expense.\u201d That was true. Her mother favored two ruffles where one might do, and often decided on five instead. Poppy\u2019s skirts were festooned with strings of seed pearls, and her bodices were trimmed with ermine.</p><p>But Poppy thought (secretly) that something simple might suit her better. Her frame was so small that side panniers, a long train, and a markedly large hairstyle, no matter how fashionable, made her feel like a decorated child.</p><p>Fletch tipped a finger under her chin. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to send you into a daze, Poppy. I picked up your brooch, but I\u2019m afraid the pin is bent. I\u2019ll have it fixed for you.\u201d</p> <p>It was foolish to worry. Fletch was here\u2014and he was hers. She smiled at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Fletch turned the brooch over in his hand. \u201cWhat an odd cameo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only cameo of a bird I\u2019ve ever seen. The Wedgwood company made it in honor of Queen Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how is a flying crane with a crown on its head supposed to honor the queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolish, isn\u2019t it? But look here\u201d\u2014she pointed it out to him\u2014\u201cthe craftsman was marvelous. You can see each feather in the wingspan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the crown makes it look as if the bird has horns,\u201d he objected.</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s a small problem in the execution, though I still like it.\u201d She tucked her hand under his arm. \u201cShall we return? It\u2019s quite chilly, and I wouldn\u2019t want Mama to become concerned about me.\u201d And then, because he still looked a little distant in a way that she didn\u2019t like, she added: \u201cI\u2019ll ask Jemma exactly what ladies do and don\u2019t when it comes to kissing, Fletch. I promise.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later they walked out the door of the abbey. Paris lay on either side of them, dreaming in the chilly morning air until suddenly the air came alive again with a wild ringing of bells, liquid notes falling from the tower above them, echoing off snowy brick walls and steep cathedral spires.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas,\u201d Poppy said, feeling a sudden rush of joy. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite day of the year. I adore Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore you,\u201d Fletch said, stopping. \u201cDo you see what I see, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she breathed, looking up at him and not wherever he was pointing.</p> <p>\u201cMistletoe,\u201d he said, putting his arms around her. \u201cMistletoe hanging in thin air.\u201d</p><p>Poppy closed her eyes and tipped up her face. It was just the right sort of kiss: sweet, short and loving. Then they began to walk back, Poppy picking her way over cobblestones lined in a thin gleaming sheet of ice.</p><p>A young woman hurried toward them, head down, a long loaf of bread tucked under her arm. Fletch felt as if he could smell the warm, fresh bread, and then before he knew it, he was imagining the luxurious curve of her breast pressed against the warm crust. He would\u2014</p><p>He wrenched his thoughts away. When he and Poppy were married, he would have fresh-baked bread delivered to their chambers, and he would break it apart and eat it from her body, as though she were a platter for the gods.</p><p>\u201cYou have such a curious smile on your face,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.Only you.\u201d</p><p>Poppy smiled to herself, and an old Parisian who passed reflected that he, one of the world\u2019s connoisseurs of beauty, had never seen a lady quite so exquisite. In her face and figure were years of English and French ancestry, and having been raised mostly in France, every aspect of her figure and costume was \u00e0 la mode. But it was her eyes, and the way she looked only at the tall Englishman striding beside her, that made her shine with that particular joy that makes even the plainest person beautiful.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he sighed. \u201cL\u2019amour!\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 1</p><p>Four years later</p><p>AN EXCERPT FROM THE MORNING POST, APRIL 22, 1783</p><p>The buzz of the past few days amongst the ton has been the challenge that the Earl of Gryffyn offered the Duke of Villiers. It seems that the earl has stolen away the duke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. We cannot comment on the veracity of this report, but we would note that dueling has been strictly prohibited by our gracious sovereign...</p><p>Town house of the Duke and Duchess of Beaumont A morning party in celebration of the Earl of Gryffyn\u2019s victory in a duel</p><p>\u201cThe Duchess of Fletcher,\u201d the butler announced with a magnificent bellow. When he said nothing about the duke, Poppy looked behind her...but Fletch was gone. He had drifted away to some other part of Beaumont House without bothering to be announced. Or inform her of his intentions.</p><p>She could feel her smile turning rigid so she picked up her skirts and edged down the three marble steps into the ballroom. Side panniers made it difficult enough to negotiate doorways and stairs, but this morning her French maid had outdone herself. A veritable cascade of frills, curls and bows towered over Poppy\u2019s head, the whole of it draped with strings of small pear-shaped pearls. Walking was challenging; stairs were truly dangerous.</p><p>Not that it wasn\u2019t worth it. She was fiercely determined to achieve an elegance to match her husband\u2019s. Fletch and his costumes were the toast of London; she would never allow it to be said that his duchess shamed him. She didn\u2019t want anyone to be sorry for her. Ever.</p><p>Naturally Fletch hadn\u2019t said a word about her costume in the carriage, though he must have realized that her gown was new. Perhaps he thought its embroidery (in shades of gold and pearl) was too formal for a morning occasion. Poppy took a deep breath. If she\u2019d learned anything from her four years of marriage, it was that one cannot guess what a man is thinking.</p><p>She revised that thought. Certain male thoughts were crystal clear.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d came a deep voice at her ear. \u201cMay I escort you to the other side of the ballroom, where there is less of a crush? The Duchess of Beaumont is to be found there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored,\u201d Poppy said to her host, curtsying just deeply enough to acknowledge his rank without disbalancing her hair. The Duke of Beaumont was attired in a simple coat of dark green velvet with turned-back cuffs of sage green. Of course, men rarely dressed as formally as women. She placed her hand lightly on his arm and they strolled through the ballroom, nodding at acquaintances. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought to see you this morning,\u201d Poppy said, before she realized that was rather impolite.</p><p>The duke\u2014a consummate politician known jointly for his disdain for infamy and his infamous duchess, Jemma\u2014gave a rueful smile. \u201cUndoubtedly this party will be the scandal of the week, since it is held to celebrate a duel. To be quite truthful, in the normal run of events I would likely avoid this particular gathering. But as it is my own duchess holding the party, and in my own house, more commotion would result if I did not attend.\u201d</p><p>Poppy felt a rush of sympathy for the poor duke. He was one of the most important men in the House of Lords, a man whose conviction, eloquence and power were known all over En gland. The last thing he needed in his life was scandal. And though she dearly loved Jemma from their days together in Paris, she had to admit that gossip-mongers adored the Duchess of Beaumont for good reason; everything Jemma did seemed to cause a sensation.

I haven\u2019t seen her since before I married, when we both lived in Paris. She must be happy to find that her brother won the duel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally we are all relieved that the occasion ended without undue bloodshed,\u201d Beaumont said evenly, his voice showing how much he disliked the idea of celebrating his brother-in-law\u2019s illegal foray into dueling. \u201cAnd here is the duchess herself.\u201d</p> <p>He bowed, and left. Jemma looked even more elegant than she had four years ago in Paris. Though she was wearing panniers too, her skirts weren\u2019t stiff like Poppy\u2019s but soft and flowing. And whereas Poppy\u2019s hair was curled into rigid little snail shells, Jemma\u2019s hair was shaped into soft curls, so lightly powdered that its natural gold color shone through. Her beauty had deepened; the sensual air that Poppy remembered was even more pronounced.</p><p>\u201cJemma,\u201d Poppy exclaimed. \u201cHow lovely you look!\u201d</p><p>Jemma turned and gave a little shriek of welcome. \u201cIt\u2019s Poppy!\u201d she cried, snatching her into a hug. Then she backed up and narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhat has happened to the little mademoiselle I knew so well in Paris? You are exquisite! You put us all to shame. Look at us, three duchesses, and you are the only one who looks the part.\u201d</p><p>Poppy had already realized that she had grotesquely miscalculated the formality of the party. No wonder Fletch said nothing of her gown. Poppy smiled apologetically at the lady standing beside Jemma. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never met,\u201d she said, dropping a curtsy. \u201cJemma is engaging in hyperbole. I am no duchess. My name is Lady Isidore Del\u2019Fino.\u201d Lady Isidore was wearing a gorgeous costume of soft rose-colored cr\u00eape-de-chine. If Jemma was all sleek perfection, Lady Isidore looked like a ripe cherry, seductive and delicious. Poppy\u2019s heart sank even deeper.</p> <p>\u201cIsidore, this is the Duchess of Fletcher. Isidore is almost a duchess,\u201d Jemma said, giving Poppy\u2019s arm another affectionate squeeze. \u201cShe married by proxy and is just waiting for her duke to return from his travels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might add that I\u2019ve been waiting ten years,\u201d Isidore said, with such a funny wrinkle of her nose that Poppy started laughing. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to meet you, Lady Fletcher,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about your charitable endeavors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I shall not be joining,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI ought to make that clear to you now, darling, before I disappoint you. I\u2019m no more charitable than I was when we knew each other in Paris. In fact, probably less so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be less so?\u201d Isidore demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve been living in Italy for the past three years, but I paid many a visit to Jemma,\u201d she explained to Poppy. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I ever saw her exert herself to sew a charitable seam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my moments,\u201d Jemma said. And then added: \u201cI consider charity to gentlemen my particular area of expertise.\u201d</p><p>Her look was so mischievous that Poppy broke out laughing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so strange to think of you married, darling,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou would hardly believe it, looking at her now, Isidore, but Poppy was the sweetest little poppet you ever saw. She used to wander around the French court with her eyes as round as\u2014as plums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile everyone laughed at me,\u201d Poppy said to Isidore, snapping open her fan. \u201cTo call me na\u00efve would have underestimated the truth. I was in a stupor of surprise most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never laughed!\u201d Jemma cried, loyally. \u201cThey were too riveted with jealousy to laugh. You see,\u201d she told Isidore, \u201cPoppy appeared in Paris with her mother and within a week\u2014nay within the hour!\u2014she snapped up the most eligible bachelor in the city, the Duke of Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have seen him!\u201d Isidore said, giving Poppy a smile. \u201cIn Italy we call such a man bellissimo.\u201d</p><p>Poppy gave her a tight smile. There was a limit to how many times a woman wanted to be complimented for her husband\u2019s beauty. It always made Poppy feel like a bracket-faced harpy who had managed a miracle.</p><p>\u201cPoppy seduced Fletch straight from the arms of the Parisian court. I think the Duchess of Guise has not yet forgiven you. She still mutters about English fledglings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you fall in love at first sight?\u201d Isidore asked. \u201cI would so like to do that, but it never seems to happen. Perhaps I could have fallen for your husband. Although,\u201d she added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to think that I will look to your husband now.\u201d</p><p>Jemma broke in. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Isidore. Poppy has Fletch at her feet. She\u2019s not one to become nervous about your charms. You see,\u201d she said, turning to Poppy, \u201cIsidore\u2019s rather awkward position\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, legally married though I haven\u2019t seen my husband since I was in leading strings,\u201d Isidore interrupted.</p><p>\u201cMeans that she tends to make married ladies nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even talk to a married man,\u201d Isidore complained.</p><p>\u201cYou can certainly talk to mine if you wish,\u201d Poppy offered.</p><p>\u201cThere! I told you, Isidore. The two of you should become dear friends. Fletch is hopelessly in love, and so Poppy wouldn\u2019t blink even if you flirt with him. Isidore,\u201d Jemma said, turning to Poppy, \u201cdoes have a disconcerting habit of making gentlemen fall in love with her, though I assure you that she does no more than talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise not to flirt with your duke,\u201d Isidore said, giving Jemma a blinding smile. \u201cBut we shall be friends. The truth is that I find the Duke of Fletcher almost troppo elegante for me. I am greatly taken by men of a rougher cast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know just what you mean,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cA pirate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone loves a pirate,\u201d Jemma said sadly. \u201cSometimes it seems so cruel that I find myself married to a politician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no pirates in English society,\u201d Isidore observed. \u201cStill, I would resign myself to a man without piratical attitudes if he would lavishly adore me as your husband does, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Poppy.\u201d And, desperate to change the subject: \u201cI\u2019m sure that your husband will lavishly adore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he recognizes me,\u201d Isidore said with a little hiccup of laughter.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>THE MORNING POST (CONTINUED)</p><p>We do not comment on the veracity of this report, but we cannot help but wonder whether the Duke of Beaumont will be the next to challenge Villiers, given the rumor that the duchess, recently returned from Paris, is playing an intimate game of chess with the said duke...</p><p>\u201cWhat you need is a mistress. For Christ\u2019s sake man, you\u2019re going to wither up and blow away. You\u2019ll be sprouting bubbies, if you don\u2019t watch out.\u201d</p><p>Fletch curled his lip. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. If I grow breasts I\u2019ll let you have a look so you can finally see what a woman\u2019s chest looks like.\u201d</p><p>Frederick Augustus Gill, the future Earl of Glasse, responded with an amiable curse, and they went back to leaning against the wall and watching the exuberant, chaotic scene before them. The room was full of titled gentlemen, shouting about the Earl of Gryffyn\u2019s victory in a duel with the Duke of Villiers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFive minutes!\u201d Fletch heard one red-faced man shout to another. \u201cThat\u2019s the way to do it!\u201d</p><p>Gill shuddered and took a deep swallow of brandy. \u201cDid you see the moment when Villiers brought out that pass in tierce? I thought Gryffyn was a croaker for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGryffyn had Villiers from the beginning,\u201d Fletch stated. \u201cIt was all a matter of his deciding the moment to take the duke out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying Villiers lost a lot of blood before the surgeon got himself together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe should be all right. It was a clean blow through the shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGryffyn is a lucky man,\u201d Gill said with a little sigh. \u201cYou should see the way his fianc\u00e9e looks at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a romantic,\u201d Fletch sneered.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t used to be so hard-edged,\u201d his friend said, startled into a rebuttal. \u201cYou act as if you\u2019ve got a stick up your ass. For God\u2019s sake, get yourself a mistress! So your wife\u2019s not interested in your bed. Practically every man in this room has experienced that. You could give the average English gentlewoman fifteen quinces, and they wouldn\u2019t strike up a flush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to the mistress you think I should take,\u201d Fletch said, with deadly boredom in his voice. \u201cI had no idea you were so interested in my bedroom activities.\u201d</p> <p>Gill\u2019s face flushed; he said something unrepeatable. And left.</p><p>Fletch sighed and drank from his glass again. He was a fool. It had been years. He needed a mistress. He needed to admit to himself that his marriage was a failure. He needed to...</p><p>Poppy floated by on the far side of the room. Her breasts swelled from the stiff little bodice of her gown. He hardened instantly. It was like the tortures of Tantalus to desire someone who never desired him. To be married to someone like that was like being tied to a well and never allowed to drink.</p><p>Yet the very idea of going to her chamber door made him wilt instantly. She would let him in, of course. Oh, her mother had tutored her in that. She would chatter and smile, but he was no fool. He could read the wary resignation in her eyes. Not to mention the way she would slip off her nightgown, lie down on the bed (his only triumph: she no longer insisted on being inside the covers) and suffer his attentions.</p><p>He drank again.</p><p>Suffer was the right word.</p> <p>No matter what he did, she just lay there. In the beginning he had lavished time on her breasts, hoping that she would suddenly start panting and writhing beneath him, the way \u00c9lise had when he barely touched her. \u00c9lise had directed him about her body as if he were learning a new sport. \u201cThere,\u201d she said softly, and then, \u201charder,\u201d and then, \u201coui!!\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake, he was sick of thinking about \u00c9lise.</p><p>Poppy, on the other hand, sometimes stroked his head. She would kiss him, even allow him to put his tongue in her mouth occasionally, but she never responded to anything. In the beginning, he thought she was inexperienced.</p><p>Then a year passed, and another year, and she never grew any more interested, never raised a finger, never turned pink\u2014let alone calling out \u201cYes, yes!\u201d His thinking had changed.</p><p>Now he was pretty certain that it simply would never work with Poppy. He stopped going to her chamber a few months ago. She said nothing; he said nothing. She was secretly relieved. She was probably celebrating it with all her friends.</p><p>And yet he still loved her.</p><p>Which was hell. She floated by again, laughing. Everyone loved Poppy. What was not to love, with the sweetness of her eyes, and the kind way she listened to every foolish complaint anyone told her? She never told her dragon of a mother to take herself to the devil, even when the woman ran Poppy from pillar to post, so pleased to have a duchess for a daughter that she showed her off like a trained monkey.</p><p>Poppy never rebuked her, never said a word.</p> <p>In short, she was an angel.</p><p>Bloody hell, angels were boring to take to bed.</p><p>Still, his innards revolted at the idea of paying a woman to bed him. Take a mistress, take a mistress\u2014that was Gill\u2019s advice. He\u2019d be paying a woman to fake interest then. Paying her to pant and moan.</p><p>Yet there were other English gentlewomen...women who were interested in bedding and even, perhaps, in him. The Duchess of Beaumont had just returned from Paris, and the whole world knew that Jemma and Beaumont never slept together and hadn\u2019t in years. What\u2019s more, she had been playing a scandalous game of chess with the Duke of Villiers\u2014and everyone knew that if Villiers won two out of three...the duchess herself was the prize.</p><p>Well, now Villiers was incapacitated. Lost a lot of blood, they said. Probably be in bed for weeks, if not a month.</p><p>Fletch pushed himself away from the wall and twitched up the high collar of his coat. The duchess had an eye for male finery; Villiers was the best-dressed man in London. But Fletch had brought over his own French tailleur; he thought he had a bit of an edge.</p><p>He stood up, and put down his empty glass. Walked forward. Very few would have recognized the fresh-faced young Englishman who walked the Pont Neuf only four years ago. Back then he had been sweet-faced, as Poppy had told him, with a dimple in the middle of his chin.</p><p>Now...</p><p>His hair was pulled back in a sleek tie that emphasized his cheekbones. In a fit of anger at Poppy he had grown a little, close-trimmed beard, covering the dimple she loved. And he walked with the controlled, hungry prowl of a man who hasn\u2019t had decent sex in years and is thinking of doing something about it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but acknowledge how ridiculous it all was. As his marital life had dwindled to a visit a month and even less, he had fashioned himself ruthlessly into the kind of man who drew all women\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Except his wife\u2019s, of course.</p><p>He wore one color only\u2014not for him the bright extravagances of the Duke of Villiers. For Fletch, clothing was not about making a statement about one\u2019s aggression, but about making clear his erotic appeal. His breeches were almost sewn on. They slipped, smooth as silk\u2014and they often were silk\u2014over thighs bulging with muscle from his daily pounding rides. His coats were designed to display his shoulders, to flaunt his chest, cut away from his flat stomach.</p><p>The only thing left from the unassuming duke who first arrived in Paris and fell in love with an English girl was his habit of wearing his hair unpowdered. He still did, but less from a dislike of the powder itself than from the realization that when he pulled his hair from its ribbon, unruly locks tumbling to his shoulders gave the impression that he just rose from a bed in which he had been well pleasured.</p><p>In short, Fletch knew perfectly well what an elaborate fa\u00e7ade he had created. Only Gill knew he was a fraud. Only his old friend Gill knew how shocked the women who followed him with hot eyes, dreaming of his acrobatic stunts in the bedchamber, would be if they knew he was practically...practically a virgin, it felt sometimes.</p><p>Poppy played her part; he had to give her that. She even blushed in his presence sometimes. He had no idea how she held up the charade, and could only think that duplicity came naturally to her.</p><p>He could see her in the corner of his eye\u2014to his disgust, he always seemed to know where his wife was\u2014but he didn\u2019t walk in her direction. Instead, he started to move deliberately in the other direction.</p><p>In that moment, he gave up.</p><p>He needed a lover. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>THE MORNING POST (CONTINUED)</p><p>The Duchess of Beaumont, recently returned from Paris, is playing an intimate game of chess with Villiers...and reportedly with her husband as well. There has been some suggestion that these games are played in the bedchamber\u2014even in the bed itself! This paper is moved to query the effect on the country\u2019s moral fiber of the host of female libertines recently returned from Paris...</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with my party?\u201d the Duchess of Beaumont demanded. \u201cThere are no naked singers, and I promise you I\u2019m not planning to strip off my own clothing. Though if it wasn\u2019t such a cold morning I might consider it, just to vex Beaumont, since he has condescended to attend with all his parliamentary types.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d her brother Damon said wryly, \u201clet\u2019s just say that it\u2019s the first party I\u2019ve ever attended in celebration of an illegal duel. I suspect there are those who might\u2014just might\u2014think it in rather poor taste.\u201d</p><p>If there was one thing Jemma was absolutely certain of, it was that she never displayed poor taste. Outrageous taste, yes. Occasionally vulgar taste, because there is nothing more delicious than an occasional dollop of vulgarity. But poor taste? Never!</p><p>\u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d she stated. \u201cThe people who decry this festivity will be only those whom I did not invite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvite?\u201d Damon said. \u201cHow could you invite anyone? I thought these people just followed us home from the duel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuick,\u201d Jemma said, taking her brother\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s move toward the other side of the room. Lady Chaussinand-Nogaret is approaching, and I can\u2019t bear the way she always chastises me for dressing in an overly Frenchified manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks French to me,\u201d Damon said, with a characteristically ignorant view of clothing. Lady Chaussinand-Nogaret was wearing a dress of French violet, but it was trimmed with puckerings of blue satin that no Frenchwoman would tolerate, let alone paired with a hat ornamented with marabou plumes.</p><p>Jemma steered him to the right. \u201cOf course these people didn\u2019t follow us home from the duel,\u201d she said. \u201cI invited them all. I had my secretary up half the night writing out cards, and they were delivered an hour before your duel began.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did those cards say?\u201d Damon said, starting to laugh. Mr. Cachemire paused before him and congratulated him on an excellent bout.</p><p>\u201cDid you note his wig?\u201d Jemma said, after Mr. Cachemire drifted on, trailing perfume and hair powder behind him.</p><p>\u201cTwo pounds of false hair at the least,\u201d Damon said. \u201cBut really: what on earth did your invitation cards say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey invited everyone to a festivity in honor of your success,\u201d Jemma replied, tapping him with her fan. \u201cYou see how much sisterly devotion I show you. I anticipated your win before you reached the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your husband,\u201d Damon said. \u201cI must remember to thank him for attending the party. Though perhaps I should apologize for issuing the challenge at all. I know how fiercely Beaumont feels about illegalities.\u201d</p><p>Jemma spied her husband in a huddle of men, and then noticed Miss Charlotte Tatlock in the midst, her thin hands flying in the air as she said something. She must have made a salient observation, because even Lord Manning was nodding with approval. Tatlock or Fetlock, Jemma thought to herself. The woman looks like a horse. I don\u2019t care how intelligent she is.</p><p>Deciding there was nothing more pretentious than a woman who claimed to love politics\u2014or politicians\u2014she moved in the opposite direction, dragging Damon with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you scowling at?\u201d he enquired.</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s propensities.\u201d</p><p>Damon groaned. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than the inner details of a marriage; please don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly matched by brothers who engage in scandalous duels,\u201d she added. \u201cVilliers is going to be all right, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course he is,\u201d Damon said. \u201cI was very careful; the blade went just where I planned and didn\u2019t touch the bone. The truth is that your party will likely cause more scandal than the duel itself. Poor Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>All morning the ducal butler, Fowle, had been opening the grand salon doors and droning out names of various peers. But at this name Jemma\u2019s and Damon\u2019s heads both swung around.</p><p>Fowle spoke rather louder than he needed to, and as the ballroom had gone suddenly silent, his voice boomed over the heads of the assembled.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace, the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>THE MORNING POST (CONTINUED)</p><p>The host of female libertines recently returning to London is not limited to the Duchess of Beaumont, though perhaps she carries with her the most notorious reputation...reportedly, the duchess\u2019s friends of the same rank are as untamed and unprincipled as she. In short, duchesses of a desperate disposition...wild to a fault and liable to obey no man\u2019s word.</p><p>Fletch knew exactly the type of woman he wanted to find. Someone who would be interested in pleasure, but not love, someone who would come with no emotional ties.Someone who would actually touch him.</p><p>The thought steeled his determination. Damn it, he\u2019d spent enough nights lying in an empty bed, pleasuring himself by thinking\u2014like a paltry, fourteen-year-old\u2014about his wife\u2019s delectable little body. He had to get over that. He had to leave that behind.</p><p>What he needed was a bout of enthusiastic sex with someone. Anyone who desired him. He met Lord Randulf \u2019s eyes and changed that sentence. Any woman who desired him. His crafted eroticism, he had quickly discovered, pleased indiscriminately.</p><p>He saw the Duke of Beaumont in a cluster of politicians to the side, doubtless poring over tedious matters of state, as that type were always wont to do. Fletch had yet to take up his seat in the House of Lords. He was too busy riding off his sexual frustration.</p><p>And mooning over Poppy, he said to himself with a sickening jolt of self-hatred. Beaumont looked up and welcomed him with a smile. \u201cDo you know Lord Holland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a great supporter of your father\u2019s on the debating floor,\u201d Holland said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. Your dear wife and mine, Your Grace, serve on the Board of Directors of Queen Charlotte\u2019s Lying-InHospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Fletch murmured. \u201cMy wife is remarkably devoted to her causes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019s my wife,\u201d Holland said with a twinkle. \u201cKeeps \u2019em busy, what? Wish we could say the same about Beaumont\u2019s duchess here, but she dances to her own piper!\u201d</p><p>Beaumont\u2019s face instantly became frigid. \u201cHer Grace\u2019s charitable activities may not be well known, but they are no less bountiful. Not long ago I found my wife closeted with a young woman collecting for Chelsea pensioners, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to imply nothing less,\u201d Holland said.</p><p>But it was obvious in his tone that he felt the Duchess of Beaumont was a liability. That was one good thing about Poppy, Fletch thought.

He had no real idea what either party stood for, and at the moment he didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass. His priorities were rapidly becoming clear: he was going to rut his brains out (to use the coarse country phrase) and then he would go to Lords and start being the sort of man his father was. He could figure out the actual politics of the thing later. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, gentlemen?\u201d He swept a bow and wandered on.</p><p>Two rooms later, he found exactly what he was looking for.</p> <p>Lady Nevill.</p><p>She was slightly older than he, with precisely the sort of French elegance that he remembered. And he\u2019d heard about her. Her husband had been incapacitated in a carriage accident; who could deny her the pleasure of an affaire now and then? The ton\u2019s pity was such that she was never denied an invitation to any event, although everyone knew perfectly well that she had thrown away her reputation long ago.</p><p>She was luscious, deeper-breasted than Poppy, with long er legs, and a loose-limbed air about her that suggested she would throw her legs around a man\u2019s neck and ride him for all he was worth.</p><p>The lady was talking to Lord Kendrick, who had to be old enough to be her father. He paused to watch and instantly knew that she was aware of him. He could see it in every lineament of her body, all those invisible, sweet ways that women had of registering interest in a man. He was probably one of the most observant men in the world when it came to that sort of thing, since he kept looking for signs of desire in Poppy\u2014and not seeing any.</p><p>It was different with Lady Nevill. She turned her head and met his eyes straight on. No subterfuge, no silliness, no flirtation.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t smile. He let his eyes smile instead.</p><p>She said something to Lord Kendrick, moved toward him. He walked a step or two, bowed before her.</p><p>\u201cDo we know each other?\u201d she said, laughing a little.</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cIt is much nicer this way,\u201d she said. \u201cOne can hardly ever endure the conversation of old friends, whereas that of new friends can be irresistible.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were a strange dark golden color; she was as sensuous as a purring cat in the dark. \u201cI shall do my best to be irresistible,\u201d he said, feeling as if he were grasping at sophisticated conversation. He and Poppy never had conversations laden with double entendres.</p> <p>She tapped him on the arm with her fan. \u201cThere is nothing a woman desires more than...\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be desired.\u201d Her voice was husky and suggestive. Maybe Poppy truly was unusual in that respect. She didn\u2019t want to be desired. He shook the thought off. Poppy was his wife. Lady Nevill was...</p><p>\u201cHow does the lady in question choose among all those who desire her? For their numbers must be legion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the maddened swine in the Bible?\u201d She unfurled her fan; her eyes laughed over the edge. They were delicately marked with a sensual line of kohl. \u201cThe lady simply looks for the least pig-like, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they hide their curly little tails?\u201d He laughed right back at her.</p><p>\u201cLadies are never interested in anything little,\u201d she said softly. Fletch let the corner of his mouth rise in brief appreciation of her jest. She was perfect: interested in his body for the pleasure it would bring her.</p><p>\u201cI outgrew my short pants long ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet you are still so young!\u201d Her eyes raked his body from head to foot, lingering in places where Poppy never bothered to look. The Frenchwomen had exclaimed over his endowments. He wouldn\u2019t disappoint her.</p><p>\u201cNot so young,\u201d he said, almost sadly.</p><p>\u201cNone of us can claim eternal youth.\u201d He could see in her eyes just a shadow of regret that echoed his.</p><p>\u201cYet you look as beautiful as a girl of eighteen,\u201d he said, taking her hand to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t want to be that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I were only eighteen, after all, I should be young and just married. Which is what you appear to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried four years,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, that doesn\u2019t come within the purview of just married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must stop telling each other truths this very moment,\u201d she said, her eyes dancing. \u201cThere is nothing more disconcerting\u2014or dreary\u2014than a conversation laden with veracity.\u201d</p><p>But Fletch was enjoying a conversation in which the truth was desire, and the words were nothing. \u201cThe most dreary conversation,\u201d he said, \u201cis one in which all the truths are unspoken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I can see that you are no newlywed. A wearisome topic, marriage,\u201d she said, tapping him again on the wrist with her fan. \u201cSince there seems to be no one here to introduce us, sir, perhaps we should do the honors ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Fletch was suddenly overcome by a giddy delight, by the pure pleasure of being in the company of a woman who wanted to touch him, who used her fan as an extension of her fingers. \u201cBut surely there is no need...I can guess who you are. A goddess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not say Venus, if you please. I find that good lady remarkably tiresome, and so overused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking mythologically. But if I were...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen of Troy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. Poor Helen. Young Paris simply scooped her straight away from her older husband\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that her husband\u2019s bed was involved,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI assure you that it was. Paris arrived on the shores of\u2014the shores of\u2014where the devil was that, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreece,\u201d she said, giggling. Her laugh was a century away from a girl\u2019s excited giggle; it was a sultry chuckle that heated his groin. \u201cI am fairly sure that we are talking about Homer\u2019s epic about the Trojan War, are we not? In which Paris left Troy and came to Greece to steal the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t come to steal her,\u201d Fletch objected. \u201cHe was promised her, was he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, men. They always think they have been promised some woman or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we so demanding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout fail. In my experience, men live in a fever of expectations about promises they think they were given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor example?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that their wives will desire them forever...that they will be desirable forever...that their breath will always be sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut women are just the same. Oh, the promises men break without ever knowing that they made them! When all along women break their promises right and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you must tell me.\u201d Her eyes were dancing in the most delicious way. \u201cWhat promise did I ever break to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t broken any yet,\u201d he said, allowing his voice to drop a register into a deeper intimacy. \u201cBut you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d She raised a delicate eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAlas and alack,\u201d he said, sighing. \u201cA man says he loves a woman, and she invariably believes that he worships her. Yet we men are so awkward at kneeling. We do it without much conviction.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head dolefully. \u201cAnd still a man invariably expects that a woman will kneel in front of him with...utmost enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>Fletch had a sudden, enlivening idea of precisely what she would do, kneeling before him. The smile lurking on the edge of her lush lips suggested she might even enjoy it.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t guessed my name yet,\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cI know you are Lady Nevill,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know the most important thing of all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour proper name, of course.\u201d He picked up her hand. \u201cOne learns much from a woman\u2019s intimate name. I hope you aren\u2019t a Mary...so puritanical.\u201d</p><p>She giggled at that, and the sensual sound of it raced down his legs. \u201cI\u2019m not Mary.\u201d</p><p>He traced a small pattern on her wrist. \u201cThere are many English names that evoke a kind of sturdy Englishhood,\u201d he said. \u201cI find it hard to put you together with a name like Lucy or Margaret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely I don\u2019t look like a sturdy Englishwoman!\u201d</p> <p>He took up her invitation and surveyed her from head to foot. Her eyes had a wicked slant, tipped up at the edges and emphasized by the kohl. Her lips were lushly red, crimson almost. Her bodice was stiffly laced and low; her breasts were much larger than Poppy\u2019s and plumped above their restraint, as if begging for a man\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said slowly, feeling desire as a palpable ache. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t look sturdy to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hint,\u201d she said. \u201cIt begins with an L.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d he said, \u201clike a flower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo wholesome.\u201d Her eyes danced again.</p><p>\u201cLettice.\u201d</p> <p>She put up her nose. \u201cI am not a garden vegetable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a great-aunt named Lettice and I\u2019ve always liked it. Laetitia?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cLorelei?\u201d A nice name, she declared, but not hers. \u201cLiliane?\u201d</p><p>Finally, she gave in and told him. \u201cLouise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouise...\u201d He rolled the word on his tongue. \u201cVery nice.\u201d</p><p>Her throaty giggle was reply enough.</p><p>Fletch laughed\u2014they were both laughing\u2014</p><p>When Poppy suddenly appeared with Gill and St. Albans beside her. \u201cHello,\u201d she said.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t smiling.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p><p>THE MORNING POST (CONTINUED)</p><p>Such is our plight when duchesses of a desperate disposition\u2014wild to a fault and liable to obey no man\u2019s word\u2014are nurtured on the Continent, and return to our shores. One can only hope that such virtuous young duchesses as the esteemed Duchess of Fletcher, noted throughout the land for her charitable activities, will not find herself drawn into this circle of Amazons.</p><p>Jemma could feel a weight fall from her shoulders that she hadn\u2019t realized was there. Yes, her brother was fine. But her friend...her chess partner...Villiers?</p><p>The duke stood in the doorway, seemingly oblivious to the scrutiny of several hundred pairs of eyes. He looked, perhaps, a trifle white, but otherwise he was as extravagantly elegant as ever.</p><p>The word cloak brings to mind black velvet: but Villiers wore a sweep of rosy silk, edged in a stiff little ruffle of deep violet taffeta. The ruffle bore a gorgeous pattern of embroidery that resembled iron lattice work; in all Jemma\u2019s years in Paris, at the Court of Versailles, she had never seen such an exquisite costume. His black hair, streaked with white, was pulled back and tied with a velvet ribbon that perfectly matched his cape.</p><p>\u201cThe cape will protect his shoulder injury,\u201d Damon murmured as they both made their way toward the door. \u201cSmart fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no one like him,\u201d Jemma said, finding herself smiling like an idiot. Villiers walked a dangerous boundary, between masculinity and its opposite and yet\u2014as always\u2014his flamboyant clothes managed to make him look more male. Of course, his features weren\u2019t in the least feminine: not that large nose and rough-hewn chin.Especially combined with his customary laconic, bored expression.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t another man in En gland who could have worn the cloak. Correction: there wasn\u2019t another man in England who would have dared to wear the cloak. But Villiers looked like a prince\u2014the kind of prince who has a harem of dancing women, what\u2019s more.</p><p>Jemma turned sideways to slip her hoops between two gawking ladies and swept into a deep curtsy before Villiers. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said, \u201cyou do us too much honor.\u201d</p><p>Villiers made her as deep a leg. \u201cThe day I miss one of the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s entertainments will be the day you mea sure me for a coffin. And\u201d\u2014he turned to Damon\u2014\u201cthough your brother has done his best to fit me for that uncomfortable bed, I find that I survive to fight another day.\u201d</p><p>Damon\u2019s bow would have honored an emperor. \u201cBut never with me again, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust not indeed,\u201d Villiers said, walking forward and giving his surprisingly sweet, if rare, smile. \u201cI find losing uncomfortable and should not wish to repeat the occasion, Gryffyn. You do realize that I lost to both brother and sister in only two days?\u201d</p><p>Jemma smiled. \u201cIf you refer to the chess match between us, Your Grace, you have lost but the first game of our match.\u201d</p><p>Villiers glanced around at the hushed guests, who instantly turned away, ineffectually pretending that they weren\u2019t hanging on every word of their conversation. The smile playing around his mouth was devilish. \u201cI thought perhaps we could begin that second game today, Your Grace. After all, as I understand it\u201d\u2014and he glanced about again\u2014\u201csome foolish men have bet over two thousand pounds on the outcome. It would be an unkindness to delay their curiosity as to the final winner.\u201d</p><p>There was a little murmur in the room, as if a sudden sweep of wind had blown over a field of wheat. In the last weeks, betting on the match between the Duchess of Beaumont and the Duke of Villiers had reached a frenzied pitch. Villiers was widely proclaimed to be the best chess player in En gland, and the fact that Jemma had beaten him in their first game would likely drive the betting to new heights. Not to mention the fact that\u2014</p><p>The Duke of Beaumont appeared at Jemma\u2019s shoulder and swept a deep, diplomat\u2019s bow. \u201cI am enchanted to see you,\u201d he said to Villiers, not even a shadow in his tone indicating that he was both estranged from Villiers and engaged in a parallel match of chess with his wife. Not to mention the fact that most of London believed that Jemma herself was the prize, to be given to the winner, whether it be her own husband or Villiers.</p><p>Naturally, Jemma fully intended to win both matches herself.</p><p>\u201cI was sorry to hear that you suffered injury this morning,\u201d Beaumont said, acting as if his brother-in-law had nothing to do with that wound. \u201cShould you be resting, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, rest,\u201d Villiers said idly. \u201cSo often overrated, particularly when there is a chance that one might play a decent game of chess. Indeed, Beaumont, I had hoped that your duchess would open a new stage in our match. You see,\u201d he added, \u201cI dearly hate to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only playing one move a day,\u201d Jemma said to him with mock severity. \u201cYou cannot hope to know whether you will win or lose based on today\u2019s move, Your Grace.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI shall endeavor to frighten you with my brilliance,\u201d Villiers said, \u201cblunting your intelligence so that you throw in the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tremble at the thought. But I agree with my husband that you must be in need of rest. If you would accompany me to the library, perhaps we might begin that game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be honored,\u201d Villiers said. He made a leg to Beaumont, and Jemma noticed with a little pinch of anxiety that he seemed a bit unsteady. Villiers was never unsteady, for all he affected high red heels.</p><p>She took his arm. \u201cThe library?\u201d he said to her, sotto voce, as they walked through the crowds. The chattering peers fell back on either side as if they were royalty progressing to the throne. \u201cI so enjoyed the more intimate setting of our first game.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma threw him a reproving glance. \u201cIf you insist on beginning play during a party, you must accept a public setting. I shall certainly not invite you to my bedchamber in the midst of one of my own events.\u201d</p><p>Villiers nodded to Lord Sosney and turned back to her. \u201cI realized something during that match with your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou plan to take lessons in swordfighting?\u201d she asked with feigned innocence, smiling at Lady Rapsfellow, whose eyes were nearly bulging from her head with curiosity. \u201cYes, your ladyship, we go to play the first move in our second game. Would you like to join us?\u201d</p><p>Lady Rapsfellow gibbered with enthusiasm and fell in behind them.</p><p>Villiers bent his head toward her ear and said, \u201cHave you heard of that old legend about the Pied Piper who pipes the rats away from town?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all a plot to throw your concentration off,\u201d she said, laughing up at him. \u201cBut do tell me, what did you realize during the duel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I am not stupid, I quickly understood that I was at your brother\u2019s mercy,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThat gave my mind a peculiar clarity. I believe the experience is common to men tumbling down waterfalls and the like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamon would never have killed you,\u201d Jemma said, nodding to two ladies whose names she really didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cI assumed that the good name of his fianc\u00e9e was worth less to him than the life of an errant duke, but one never knows,\u201d Villiers responded. \u201cAt any rate, I wish that I could say that I had a change of heart that will send me to a monastery or some other place of good works, but alas, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI fell under a carriage in Paris once, and regrettably my first thoughts on waking up had to do with the condition of my pelisse rather than the state of my soul.\u201d</p><p>A footman stood at attention, holding open the library doors. They swept through, followed by some forty or so guests. Villiers seated himself opposite Jemma at the chess table with a magnificent sweep of his cloak.</p> <p>Lord Randulf minced up behind Villiers. \u201cI believe you began your most recent game at Parsloe\u2019s with a pawn to Queen\u2019s Bishop Four,\u201d he said to Villiers. \u201cWill you strike out in a new direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Villiers said, moving a pawn to just that place.</p><p>\u201cNovelty is always risky,\u201d Jemma said, throwing Randulf a smile as she made her own move.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d Lady Rapsfellow said in a shrill undertone. \u201cIt\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>Lord Randulf took her arm. \u201cWhen a game is played at one move a day, it\u2019s a tedious slow business, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t they have to think about it more?\u201d Lady Rapsfellow persisted as Randulf steered her toward the door.</p><p>Jemma met Villiers\u2019s eyes. There was a little smile there. \u201cI do mean to think more,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t count yourself the winner yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never underestimate my opponents,\u201d Jemma replied.</p> <p>Those who watched were flooding back out of the library as quickly as they arrived. \u201cWhat did you realize during your duel with my brother, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>He slanted a look around the empty library and then leaned against his seat, heavy-lidded eyes watching her. \u201cThat I had made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Jemma was conscious of a feeling of disappointment. \u201cOnly one? I\u2019ve made so many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the advantage of me, then. I make few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne might add, in your own estimation,\u201d Jemma put in.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. But when I make mistakes, I do it in a grand fashion,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI made a mistake with Benjamin...the Duke of Berrow.\u201d Jemma raised her eyes but he forestalled her. \u201cI know that you know of Benjamin\u2019s suicide, and of my role in his death. You and I agreed to be friends; it may be that my friendship is a tainted thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not agree. It is true that Benjamin chose to kill himself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter losing a game of chess to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is no reflection on your friendship. Benjamin always rushed into actions that he later regretted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue...true.\u201d</p><p>He was looking down at his hands, his eyes shadowed by long eyelashes. Suddenly he looked up and she felt herself growing a bit pink at something in his eyes. \u201cI have decided to make no more mistakes with friends,\u201d he said, his voice rough.</p><p>\u201cIf you win a game from me, you may feel free to point out my errors,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so hideously competitive that I will certainly kill you rather than myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d he said unemotionally.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cBut you see what good friends we can be? My passion for chess is equal to Benjamin\u2019s, but when I lose a match the only thing I want is to play again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is chess your only passion?\u201d</p><p>She sat for a moment, before deciding to answer truthfully. \u201cI suppose it is. I hold my friends and husband in great esteem; I adore my brother. But my heart is in chess. I have observed that those who are masters at the game rarely find deep passion elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would appear to confirm your theory, since I have no family to adore and thus my interests have lingered on the opposite sex in a fleeting way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs have mine,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201c\u2019Tis a grave fault that has resulted in a great deal of scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I am not so dismissive of the possibility of love as you are. You made me an offer of companionship a few weeks ago,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI told you then that I would not cuckold my old friend Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>Jemma froze. She had offered an affaire, in a fit of rage at her husband, and Villiers had refused.</p><p>\u201cI have changed my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the five minutes I was at the mercy of your brother\u2019s sword, I remembered that I have never loved a woman. And that it is one of the experiences that I dearly wished to have many years ago. I cannot explain how it has so unaccountably passed me by.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s lips felt stiff. \u201cSurely you are not saying that you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said consideringly, \u201cbut I could do so. I believe, in fact, that you are the only woman I have met whom I could love. Love is always a decision, you know. Though I love chess, I find the wish in me to love something else as well. Perhaps you and I, Jemma, could find love together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless we are incapable of true love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe that of yourself?

And\u201d\u2014he raised his eyes again, and the shock of it went to the bottom of her spine\u2014\u201cand Elijah. Your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Beaumont were childhood friends,\u201d she said. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was golden, you know, even then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was full of plans, to change the world, to change the village. He talked of them constantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still full of plans,\u201d Jemma said feelingly. \u201cI do believe he thinks the House of Lords wouldn\u2019t function without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was always so,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cTo be fair, I believe he may be right. He is not only intelligent, but incorruptible, which is a rare value in a politician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your friendship?\u201d</p> <p>There was a queer lopsided smile on his lips. \u201cWhat ever happens to men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name was Bess. I wish I could speak rhapsodically about her, but the truth is that I hardly remember her face. Though I loved her dearly\u2014or thought I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Beaumont did as well?\u201d Jemma laughed a bit. \u201cI can just imagine the two of you, sparring over Bess\u2019s attentions. From her name, I gather that she was not a marriageable young lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a cousin named Bess,\u201d Villiers said, standing and offering her his arm. \u201cBut of course you are right. Bess had an altogether worthy position drawing beer in the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the two of you sat night after night, mooning over her blue eyes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I sat alone. You have to understand that this nose of mine was even bigger in my youth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won Bess anyway,\u201d Jemma said, feeling quite sure she knew precisely how attractive a young Villiers would have been. She herself wouldn\u2019t have lasted a moment against those eyes with less cynicism, more eagerness, his bottom lip, his hair...</p><p>\u201cI did. Until Beaumont decided that he wanted her instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds unfair\u2014and quite unlike him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there were wheels within wheels, as there so often are,\u201d Villiers said, sighing as he opened the library door. \u201cBut all I meant to say, Jemma\u201d\u2014and his voice lingered on her name, turned it into a caress\u2014\u201cis that I was mistaken to refuse your generosity.\u201d</p><p>Jemma wasn\u2019t sure how to reply.</p><p>He turned to her and made, suddenly, a deep bow. \u201cWith fair warning, Your Grace. I shall do my very best to entice you.\u201d And then he turned with a swish of his magnificent rose cloak, and walked away.</p><p>Jemma stood like a clod in the corridor and watched him leave.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>THE MORNING POST (CONTINUED)</p><p>And should the circle of Amazons open its arms to our young, unmarried sprites, the chaste and virtuous children of our best nobility, one hates to think of the effect. Young ladies are vulnerable, yes, vulnerable\u2014to the lure of sin, the sweet lure of sin!</p><p>All laughter disappeared, replaced by civil smiles and deep bows.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d said St. Albans, a sharp-tongued fellow with a lamentable fascination with gossip. Who happened to have Fletch\u2019s wife on his arm.</p><p>\u201cLady Nevill, your servant,\u201d said Gill.</p><p>Fletch contented himself with bowing. He should introduce Poppy to Lady Nevill. Poppy was as beribboned and decorated as a box of French sweets, her hair carefully arranged into a towering stack of bows and curls.</p><p>The worst possible thing happened, then.</p><p>\u201cWhy Your Darling Grace,\u201d Lady Nevill said. \u201cHow are you this morning?\u201d</p><p>Poppy dimpled at her. \u201cLovely, thank you, Louise. I thought I\u2019d be exhausted after all that sewing we did yesterday, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSewing?\u201d Fletch said hollowly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I was yesterday morning,\u201d Poppy said to him. \u201cThe sewing circle for Queen Charlotte\u2019s hospital. Louise and I kept sewing and sewing, and drinking cups of tea, for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should keep better track of your wife, Fletch,\u201d St. Albans said, obviously trying to turn the whole awkward mess into a light joke.</p><p>\u201cI never know where she is,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cIt would be most tedious to track one\u2019s wife like a grouse in hunting season. I find it easier to proceed on the grounds of total ignorance of her whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always tell you of my plans,\u201d Poppy said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cYou must all think I am very slow,\u201d Lady Nevill said, looking to Fletch. \u201cI gather this gentleman is your charming husband, Poppy, about whom you\u2019ve told me so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes it is,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry; I thought you knew each other. May I present my husband, the Duke of Fletcher? Fletch, this is a very good friend of mine, Lady Nevill.\u201d</p><p>He made a leg. Lady Nevill dropped a deep curtsy. Her eyes were completely different now. She was friends with Poppy, damn it.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now you young children must forgive me. I see a dear friend on the other side of the room whom I must greet. Au revoir!\u201d</p><p>Fletch bowed again. It was as if they had never flirted. As if he were no more than any other man. And he could tell from the delicious way she said au revoir that she even spoke French.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>There was a moment of silence after she left.</p><p>\u201cYou were both laughing so hard,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cCould you share the joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. Anger was starting to burn in the back of his throat. Rage at her, rage at life...</p><p>She dimpled. \u201cI take it you were telling each other naughty jokes? I\u2019m certain that I could understand anything Louise enjoyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Fletch said. The other men were absolutely silent. He knew his voice was laden with scorn and near disgust. He couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>She blinked and then her sprightly smile popped out again. \u201cThen I shall give you all the pleasure of explaining it to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be joking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some things that ladies of your type never understand.\u201d</p><p>She pulled herself taller. \u201cLadies of my type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the type, St. Albans,\u201d he said. But St. Albans wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes. \u201cGood to the bone. Practically achieving sainthood right here in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFletch,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cDo not speak to me like this, I beg you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d For the first time he looked at her directly in the face. \u201cWe never say anything significant to each other any longer. In fact, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve exchanged an interesting word in a year.\u201d</p><p>She was rather white. \u201cThat is not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName one interesting sentence,\u201d he said, jeering at her.</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cI told you last week that I loved you. Under the circumstances, that was remarkably interesting.\u201d She spun on her heel and left.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Gill said. He forgot he was wearing a wig and tried to run a hand through his hair. His wig fell off and plopped on the floor. It looked like a dead hare, lying on the carpet.</p><p>Fletch\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cI\u2019m sick of her childish views. I can\u2019t stand any more of her cheerful little comments about every damn thing. If I dropped dead in the street, she\u2019d probably kneel down next to me and coo some platitude about how much I will enjoy heaven.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe loves you, not that you deserve it,\u201d Gill said.</p><p>\u201cWho cares if I deserve it?

This paper fears for the souls of every duchess in London!</p> <p>Poppy never used to cry before she became a duchess.</p><p>Unfortunately, having a spouse had turned Poppy into a waterspout. She cried herself to sleep. She cried in the oddest moments, for example, in between meetings of the Charitable Society for the Reception of Repenting Prostitutes and the meetings of the board of Lady Charlotte\u2019s Lying-InHospital. Now she ran down a long corridor of Beaumont House, wiping away the tears as they rolled off her chin.</p><p>How could he? How could he have said that, and in front of his friends? She knew they didn\u2019t talk very much. She knew\u2014she knew there was something terribly wrong.</p><p>But try as she might, she couldn\u2019t make it work. She woke every morning determined to make Fletch love her again, the way he used to before they married. She never betrayed the faintest irritation at the way he stalked around the house. Never, ever, did she irritate him by pointing out that they would have no children, given that he visited her bed once a month, if that. She never commented when he grew a silly little pointed beard, though he knew well that she loved his dimple. In truth, the goatee was vastly becoming.</p><p>But it was like everything else in the past few years. Fletch had turned himself into a distinguished, incredibly beautiful stranger. He wore clothes of a kind that dazzled and frightened her. He wore that little beard. He hired a French valet and a French chef, and rattled away to both of them in the language.</p><p>While growing up, her mother had made her study pianoforte for hours a day, saying the skill was essential to marriage. But if she offered to play for Fletch after supper, he would get a look of grueling boredom on his face, cross his arms over his chest, and sit until she finished a piece. Then he would stand, bow politely enough, and say his goodnight. Without kissing her.</p> <p>She slowed to a walk. When had Fletch stopped kissing her? The very thought made her hiccup with tears, but after a bit she found a handkerchief and tried to think about it. She couldn\u2019t remember. The last kiss...she didn\u2019t realize it was the last kiss.</p><p>The last kiss he would ever give her, perhaps!</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she discovered that someone was standing before her, touching her cheek and saying something that Poppy realized that she was leaning against the wall and howling. Literally howling with sobs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I,\u201d she said, and peered through her swollen eyes. \u201cOh dear!\u201d she wailed, collapsing into Jemma\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2019m so\u2014so\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jemma gave her a kiss and said, \u201cHush,\u201d and then said to someone over her shoulder, \u201cYou did precisely the right thing, Isidore.\u201d</p><p>Then Jemma gave her another kiss, as if she were a little girl, and said, \u201cDarling, Isidore fetched me as soon as she realized you were in distress. Now, come in here, and Isidore will come too.\u201d</p><p>Poppy let herself be put on a sofa without saying a word and Lady Isidore Del\u2019Fino sat opposite. Her mama had said that she should never share the particulars of her marriage, that it was disloyal. But every time that Poppy said anything about marriage to her mama, her mother would say that she had to train Fletch into a sense of his responsibilities and proper behavior.</p><p>\u201cDoes he respect you?\u201d she would demand.</p> <p>And Poppy would nod. She wasn\u2019t absolutely sure of the truth of that, because she had seen something very close to disgust in Fletch\u2019s eyes lately. But the alternative was so horrible that she couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u201cIf he respects you, there is nothing to worry about,\u201d her mother would pronounce. \u201cDo not say a word to anyone about your disappointments in Fletcher, and he will pay you the same favor. This is the nature of marriage.\u201d</p><p>More tears welled in Poppy\u2019s eyes at the thought. She didn\u2019t feel like adhering to the nature of marriage anymore. Especially when Jemma sat down next to her (at least as close as they could be, given the size of Poppy\u2019s panniers, and said, \u201cNow what on earth is going on, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Fletch,\u201d she said, hiccupping. Her handkerchief was sodden with tears, so she accepted Jemma\u2019s. \u201cMy marriage\u2014I can\u2019t say it!\u201d She sobbed a bit more instead.</p><p>After a while Jemma said, \u201cMarriages are like lap dogs. Everyone boasts about having a good one, but the only ones I ever see are devoted to scratching the paneling and jumping on people. Failures, in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Poppy hiccupped again, loudly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, gasping a little. \u201cI always\u2014always hiccup when I\u2019m upset and mama says it is a most disgusting habit, but I truly am not in control of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as scratching the paneling with your claws,\u201d Jemma said reassuringly. \u201cNow what\u2019s happening in your marriage? Or should I say, what can possibly be happening in your marriage that hasn\u2019t already happened in mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure this is just the conversation to make me very glad not to be living with a husband yet,\u201d Isidore said, while Poppy tried to stop crying. \u201cHas your husband taken to wearing rouge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only asked because I\u2019m certain that Viscount St. Albans put a little something on his cheeks, and he and Fletcher are close friends, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey doesn\u2019t mean they share a pot of rouge,\u201d Jemma said. She squeezed Poppy\u2019s hand again. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better after you tell us, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s\u201d\u2014but Poppy couldn\u2019t say it. The enormity of her suspicion was just too cruel to contemplate. \u201cHe was abominably rude to me in front of his friends,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said\u2014He made it clear that our marital activites are not all that\u2014that he desires.\u201d Tears welled up again. \u201cBut since he never comes to my bedchamber, I don\u2019t see what I could do about that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that in front of his friends?\u201d Jemma said. Her voice rose about two octaves. It made Poppy feel better just to hear it.</p><p>\u201cBastardo!\u201d Isidore hissed.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cWhat a bastard thing to do. What exactly did he say, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I walked up with\u2014with\u201d\u2014Her voice faltered.</p><p>\u201cWith whom?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cViscount St. Albans,\u201d Poppy said reluctantly, \u201cand Gill.

And then it all went wrong!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least he had the decency to wait a year,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI was only married a few weeks when I walked into Beaumont\u2019s chambers in Westminster to find him tupping his mistress on the desk.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s gasp was matched by Isidore\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Poppy cried.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me that,\u201d Isidore said, at the same moment.</p><p>Jemma smiled a bit tightly. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort of information one offers to one\u2019s friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Sarah Cobbett,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cWhich is really irrelevant, because I gather he\u2019s pensioned her off, or what ever it is they do with women when they\u2019re done with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t know her,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose the good thing is that they can\u2019t pension us off,\u201d Isidore said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re stuck with us for life,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cThough Fletch would love to pension me off. He looks at me in such a way.\u201d Her voice trembled and she steadied it. \u201cI just wish I knew what I did wrong! Something I said? Or did? Now he loathes me. He truly does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaumont was a bastardo as well,\u201d Isidore said.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that I still love him,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI can\u2019t help it. Ever since I realized how much he dislikes me, I\u2019ve tried and tried to just cast him out of my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cCast him out of your heart? You\u2019re a poet.\u201d</p><p>Poppy hiccupped loudly.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t do it?\u201d Jemma continued. \u201cI had a foolish fondness for Beaumont in the early weeks of our marriage, but after I found him with his mistress\u2014and, I must admit, after he told me that he loved the woman\u2014I did not find it overly difficult to excise him from my heart. At the moment, he appears to be flirting madly with Miss Charlotte Tatlock, and I find it merely irritating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Poppy asked damply. \u201cI\u2019ve tried and tried this year, but I can\u2019t help it. I still love him. If he\u2019s in the room, I\u2019m happier. And if I don\u2019t know where he is\u201d\u2014her eyes filled with tears again\u2014\u201cI suppose he\u2019s been off consorting with other women. I didn\u2019t even think of that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was the woman he was speaking to?\u201d Isidore asked.</p><p>\u201cLady Nevill,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cLu\u2014\u201d The name was broken by a particularly loud hiccup. \u201cLouise! But\u2014but I can\u2019t believe that Louise...and yet they were smiling in such a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Louise,\u201d Jemma said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that Louise respects her marriage vows, though with her poor husband incapacitated as he is, no one makes much of a fuss about it. But Louise has her own code of honor and she would never sleep with your husband.\u201d She reached out and pulled the bell cord.</p> <p>A footman opened the door directly. \u201cMay I help you, Your Grace?\u201d he said, staring at the far wall. \u201cFowle asked me to stand outside and ensure that you were not interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you please ask Lady Nevill to join us, if she\u2019s still in the house?\u201d Jemma asked. \u201cWe would like a tray with all sorts of comforting things on it like gingerbread and hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>The moment the door closed again Poppy said urgently: \u201cYou cannot tell Louise of my suspicions, Jemma! She\u2019ll be mortified that I thought so poorly of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe she will either,\u201d Isidore put in. \u201cI don\u2019t know her as well as you do, since I cannot abide all those charitable organizations that you both toil in. But I\u2019ve had several very interesting conversations with her. I like her.\u201d</p><p>Since Isidore was as opinionated and prickly as her Italian ancestry implied, this was high praise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so mortifying,\u201d Poppy said in a low voice.</p><p>But Louise walked in that very moment, took one look at Poppy and, presumably, Poppy\u2019s swollen red eyes, and came straight to her side. She went down on her knees and took both of her hands. \u201cIt was merely a flirtation, darling. Nothing more. I had no idea that he was your husband.\u201d</p><p>Poppy smiled at her, trying to make the corners of her mouth turn up more joyfully. \u201cI knew that, Louise. I\u2014I\u2019m afraid that\u2014that Fletch was a bit abrupt with me after you left and so I indulged in a great weeping fit.\u201d</p><p>Louise rocked back and looked at Jemma. Jemma\u2019s eyebrow went up ruefully; Poppy caught it out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit,\u201d Poppy said, sniffing.</p><p>Louise stood up and said to Jemma and Isidore, \u201cDarlings, I would drop you a curtsy, but I\u2019m used to Poppy telling me what to do in committee meetings.\u201d She sat.</p><p>Poppy folded her hands. \u201cLouise, my husband was flirting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to say no,\u201d Louise said, biting her lip. \u201cDoes it sound better if I say that I was flirting with him? But only because I had no idea who he was. He\u2019s terribly handsome. You\u2019re a fortunate woman!\u201d She finished with such a celebratory smile that Poppy half expected her to cheer.</p><p>\u201cIsidore,\u201d Poppy said, \u201chas Fletch ever flirted with you?\u201d</p><p>Isidore looked surprised. \u201cNo. But then I have hardly met him. Perhaps next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are terrifying,\u201d Louise told her.</p><p>\u201cJemma, has Fletch ever flirted with you?\u201d And Poppy held her breath, because she knew how much Fletch admired Jemma.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Jemma said promptly. \u201cHe\u2019s perfectly friendly but not at all desirous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was\u201d\u2014Poppy swallowed\u2014\u201cdesirous of further acquaintance with you, wouldn\u2019t you say, Louise?\u201d</p><p>Louise turned a little pink. \u201cOnly because I didn\u2019t know who he was,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe planned to be unfaithful with you,\u201d Poppy said flatly. \u201cMy marriage is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how much it takes to kill a marriage,\u201d Jemma put in. \u201cMine was over, in that sense, years ago. And yet here I am, returned to London and planning to create an heir.\u201d</p><p>Isidore raised an eyebrow. \u201cAn heir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that be before or after you finish the chess matches with the Duke of Villiers and your own husband?\u201d Louise asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cMy point was that your marriage is not over, Poppy. It\u2019s merely entered another phase.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cAre you still making an heir if Villiers wins the chess match?\u201d Isidore asked, looking even more curious.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am!\u201d Jemma said. \u201cNot that Villiers will win. I\u2019m just warming myself to the task of beating him resoundingly. But Beaumont and I haven\u2019t seen each other under intimate circumstances for eight years. It\u2019s not something I am looking forward to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy marriage as I thought of it is over,\u201d Poppy said, interrupting.</p><p>They were all silent, so she took that as agreement. \u201cMy husband is no longer in love with me.

Lemon squares, as Cook feels they are very comforting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is lovely,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>Poppy took a deep breath and accepted a muffin dripping with butter. \u201cI shall have to make adjustments, that\u2019s all. Do you know , it\u2019s better to know the truth? I\u2019ve felt terrible for the past year, trying and trying to make things better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, darling, when men stray,\u201d Jemma said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the fault of women like Louise!\u201d Isidore said, giggling madly.</p><p>Louise raised an eyebrow and said, \u201cQuiet, youngster, or I\u2019ll swat you with a lemon square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s calling whom a youngster?\u201d Isidore asked indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-two years old, Louise Nevill, and you can\u2019t be more than three years over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d Louise said, adding, \u201cbut I am extremely well-preserved.\u201d</p><p>Poppy finished her muffin, and let the conversation of her friends wash over her. It had seemed so stark and death-dealing to think that Fletch didn\u2019t love her anymore. As if she had nowhere to turn, and no one to love her. But now\u2014</p><p>\u201cI love you all,\u201d she said, sniffing a little.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to cry again?\u201d Isidore asked. \u201cBecause I love you too, at least as much as I know of you, but not if it\u2019s going to make you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love you too, darling,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should leave,\u201d Louise said, putting down her napkin. \u201cI would truly not wish to intrude, and you have my every assurance, Poppy, that your husband will remain terra incognita as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stay,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cAfter all, now that I\u2019m leaving Fletch, I need to know what to do next.\u201d</p><p>She truly enjoyed the shocked silence that followed her statement.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>THE MORNING POST (CONTINUED)</p><p>If the soul of every duchess in London is at risk...let us not neglect the souls of their august partners, the dukes. While the gossip columns rage with stories of drunkenness and infidelity, there are those rare few, like the Duke of Beaumont, who seem to grace their high rank. Yet we have been credibly informed that even this most revered of politicians has shown untoward interest in a young lady, Miss T\u2014. We protect her name in the hope that these reports are mere folly.</p> <p>He interrupted her. \u201cYou used to call me Elijah in private. The party is over; you needn\u2019t address me as Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>Jemma almost pitied her husband, although the emotion was inconceivable. Yet he looked so confused\u2014and stupid, in a manly sort of way. \u201cI came back to London for you, Elijah.\u201d She hesitated. How to say the unspeakable?</p><p>\u201cBecause my heart may be giving out,\u201d he said, a line appearing between his brows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also getting old,\u201d she said, trying to make him smile, God knows why. \u201cI\u2019d better have that child now or I\u2019ll find myself incapable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d His smile was no more than a twist of his lips.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no real evidence that your heart is giving out, is there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe doctors see none, but I have the feeling they have no idea what a failing heart would look like.\u201d He did smile at her now, a ruefulness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cYou could have passed out that day in Lords because you drank too much at luncheon.\u201d</p><p>She saw the truth in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you never drink to excess. Lord almighty, Elijah, is there anything you do wrong?\u201d</p><p>A queer little silence greeted her.</p><p>\u201cBesides marrying me, of course.\u201d She said it with dignity.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jemma said, feeling a curious wish to make the bleak look in his eyes go away, \u201cyou\u2019ll be very happy to hear that my brother is taking his disreputable fianc\u00e9e to the country. Your reputation is saved,\u201d she said, leaning forward and tapping his finger. His fingers looked strong and durable. Surely his heart was the same.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMy reputation appears to be intact; I just received a missive from Pitt asking me to address the House of Lords and prepare them for his enclosure tax. The more pressing question seems to me to be when we begin our next chess game. Tomorrow, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you not to dwell on the fact that you just won the first one,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI see no reason to dwell on it,\u201d he said, smiling at her. \u201cI fully intend to win this game as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would mean no third game,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTrue, and won\u2019t that make the ton irritable. They are so looking forward to hearing of our third game. Blindfolded and in bed, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He was watching her closely, so she raised her eyes and met his. \u201cIndeed, those were the terms of the match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou appear to have beaten Villiers in the first game,\u201d he said. He sounded casual, but she knew him better.</p><p>\u201cWe began our second this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA subject that fascinates everyone from the younger chambermaid to the highest duke in the land,\u201d Beaumont said.</p><p>There was a moment and Jemma realized what he had said. \u201cYou, my lord, are the highest duke in the land.\u201d</p><p>He rose and looked down at her. He had taken off his wig at some point. His hair was cut so short that it left his face unguarded, his beautiful cheekbones, tired eyes. \u201cI would not wish you to think that I don\u2019t find the outcome fascinating,\u201d he said. And then swept her a bow.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>THE MORNING POST (CONTINUED)</p><p>We will close our report with an admonishment to these Desperate Duchesses...pleasure yourselves as you will, but remember that your dukes will do the same. And when a duke strays, he may well stray permanently and to the detriment of your welfare!</p><p>Nine in the evening The same day</p><p>Fletch didn\u2019t come home for hours. Supper passed, but Poppy didn\u2019t allow herself to be dressed for the night. Instead she sat, bolt upright as her mother had always taught her, and stared at the wall. The only\u2014only\u2014good thing about the day was that her mother refused to go anywhere near the Duchess of Beaumont, so she had not been at the party. While she would undoubtedly hear of Fletch\u2019s insult by the next morning, that gave Poppy a very small window in which to think her own thoughts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not her mother\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>There was a great difference. Somehow she\u2019d fallen into the habit of letting her mother command. It was easier to go along with her, to keep her happy. When she was unhappy...</p><p>Poppy shuddered a little. She had never liked screaming, not from the time she was a little girl. It wasn\u2019t that her mother didn\u2019t love her. She did. She really did. Sometimes Poppy had to remind herself of that, because being Lady Flora\u2019s daughter sometimes felt like being something that belonged to Lady Flora. A possession.</p><p>She still remembered sitting for hours as a little girl and pretending to be a hassock. A foot stool. Because if she could just stay very small, and very quiet, her mother would forget she was there, and then she wouldn\u2019t scream about people and places and things that had gone wrong.</p> <p>The memory made Poppy feel guilty. It wasn\u2019t as if her mother screamed at her\u2014at least, not most of the time. It was just that gales of anger would sweep around Poppy\u2019s head until she felt as if she were in the middle of a great thunderstorm. If Lady Flora noticed Poppy, she generally would scream. There were so many ways in which Poppy could improve.</p><p>What she felt was weary. Tired of people who disapproved, people who were impossible to please, people who made her feel inadequate. Stupid. That was the one clear thought she had in her head. She didn\u2019t want to be screamed at by her mother. And she didn\u2019t want to see that closed, disgusted look on Fletch\u2019s face ever again, even if that meant she never saw him again.</p><p>A tear fell on her hand, but the truth of it was clear.</p><p>Even if she never saw him again.</p><p>Fletch finally came home around ten in the evening. She heard the bustle that always accompanied Fletch, the footman taking his hat, his manservant fussing over his coat, his hair, his...</p> <p>It felt quite good to curl her lip.</p><p>He came to her chamber as soon as Quince informed him of her request, of course. Until this evening she and Fletch had always been entirely courteous to each other. He stood in the door a moment, looking like a fashion illustration from Journal de la Mode. It made her tongue-tied, especially in this last year, as he grew more like a valet\u2019s dream, and thus she more inarticulate.</p><p>\u201cPlease come in,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this morning,\u201d he said. He stopped in front of her, his eyes serious for once. Not scornful. \u201cI should never have spoken that way in front of my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer that you expressed yourself to me before others,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cBut I noticed Gill showed no surprise, so I gather you have already discussed our marriage with him. Perhaps you should tell me everything that you\u2019ve told Gill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGill is an old friend,\u201d he said, his eyes going opaque at once. \u201cMen say things to each other in the heat of the moment that they don\u2019t mean. Gill was surprised; he gave me a proper scolding after you left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo give him my gratitude,\u201d Poppy said, folding her hands. The conversation was veering toward hostility. She could feel herself curling into a little mouse, running away to some part of her head where she wouldn\u2019t be shouted at. She took a deep breath and told herself to be brave.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down, Fletch.\u201d</p><p>He sat.</p><p>\u201cI should like to know what you think of our marriage. Not because I want to argue with you, or...\u201d</p><p>He sat down, looking so tired that her heart wrung and she almost jumped to her feet to ring for tea and a hot bath to be drawn. But she bit her lip and forced herself to stay put.</p><p>\u201cI think we are probably doing as well as any other duke and duchess in En gland,\u201d he said, looking at her with a rueful twist of his lips. \u201cBetter than the Duke and Duchess of Beaumont, certainly. I\u2019ve been acting like an ass, Poppy. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He did sound sorry, not that it mattered much. \u201cStill,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat do you wish was different, Fletch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all fall into foolish ideas sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand those ideas. I feel as if I\u2019m always trying to be something that you want, but I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect as you are, Poppy. I\u2019ve been a fool. Let\u2019s say no more of it.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019re not happy with our marital intimacies.\u201d</p><p>The silence grew like stale bread, with the stink of a rotting egg. Bravery seemed a very stupid concept.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I was not aware of your unhappiness?\u201d Poppy asked. \u201cFrom the moment we fell in love, you\u2019ve wanted me to be different. And yet I am precisely the kind of wife that I understand. I\u2014I don\u2019t know how to be other than myself.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. She saw it under her lashes. \u201cNo doubt I have made untoward demands on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you like me to be?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. She gathered her courage and kept blundering on because it all had to be said. She couldn\u2019t bear another conversation of this nature. \u201cI\u2019m really asking you, Fletch. I keep wondering how I disappoint you, and I don\u2019t know. What am I doing wrong? I have tried to do everything you asked of me, stayed quiet when I thought you wished me to, modeled my behavior on yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have not disappointed me.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach was so sour that she almost felt as if she might throw up right here, sitting in her own bedchamber. She clenched her hands instead, under a fold of her gown so that he couldn\u2019t see it. Her face was completely calm; she knew that. \u201cWhat do you expect? Or perhaps I should ask, what do you wish I would do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me once that ladies are different from washerwomen, do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>She smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019ve done so much work in hospitals in the last two years that I can tell you that women are not really very different. I don\u2019t remember saying that. What was it in reference to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to kiss you other than with a closed mouth.\u201d</p><p>Now he had that furious look again.</p><p>\u201cBut I allowed you to do so,\u201d she said, forcing all her fear into her stomach and not letting her voice wobble. \u201cOnce we were married, I have tried very hard never to say no to you, Fletch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have done your best, Poppy, I know that. And my hopes were na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what did you expect me to do!\u201d</p><p>His head jerked up at the sharpness in her tone.</p><p>\u201cYou always look disappointed. You demand, and demand, without saying what you want. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have wanted you to\u2014to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d She hardly recognized the hardness in her own voice.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy yourself,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cEnjoy yourself, enjoy me, it\u2019s all the same.\u201d</p><p>She bit down so hard on her lip that she could taste blood, metallic and strange. \u201cI do enjoy myself.\u201d</p><p>He rose at that and walked to the window. \u201cI\u2019ve been blaming you for something that is outside your control, and it\u2019s grossly unfair. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his back and knew that her marriage was indeed over. She couldn\u2019t give him what he wanted. They would never be happy together, and she would always disappoint him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t stand that anymore.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Two days later April 24</p><p>The Duke of Villiers lay in bed. His shoulder burned in the spot where the rapier thrust had gone through, with an intensity unabated by cold compresses. \u201cThe brandy makes it worse, dammit,\u201d he said through clenched teeth.</p> <p>It was mortifying to discover just how much he did not like pain. At the moment, for example, he was pretending to be lying down simply due to surgeon\u2019s orders but in truth he wasn\u2019t sure he could rise. It must be blood loss.</p><p>\u201cBrandy kills infection, Your Grace,\u201d his valet told him. As if he were some sort of idiot child.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that it shouldn\u2019t be done; I\u2019m just saying that it increases the\u2014the discomfort.\u201d Surely men didn\u2019t suffer pain. Anyway, this didn\u2019t feel like pain. It felt like something on a much higher magnitude, like a red-hot poker straight to the gut.</p><p>\u201cMore barley water, Your Grace?\u201d Finchley said.</p><p>Villiers narrowed his eyes and watched his valet sweep about the room. Finchley was the sort of valet who would have made a better duke than Villiers himself. Villiers knew it; Finchley knew it. Villiers had presence, arrogance and blood lines. Finchley had presence, arrogance, a ducal way of walking, a penchant for wigs and high heels, and\u2014alas\u2014no blood lines.</p> <p>Finchley turned around and Villiers realized he had forgotten to answer. The odd thing was that Finchley\u2019s face looked exactly like his old nanny\u2019s. In fact, for a moment, he saw her broad disapproving face superimposed over Finchley\u2019s long-jawed one. He watched in fascination as Finchley and Nanny\u2019s nose wavered and seemed to come together.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinchley, do you have any relatives in Somerset?\u201d Villiers said, narrowing his eyes again to try to bring Finchley\u2019s noses down to one. Which\u2014he was fairly certain\u2014was the right number of noses for a face like Finchley\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever, Your Grace. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou share a great deal with my childhood nanny,\u201d Villiers muttered, not wanting to admit that what Finchley shared was a nose.</p><p>Finchley didn\u2019t like the idea of sharing anything with a nanny; Villiers could see that. His back became even more erect, and his chin went further into the air. In short, he looked even more ducal, barring the fact that he still had two noses.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten Nanny\u2019s nose had that wart on it,\u201d Villiers said, almost dreamily. \u201cI loved her anyway, you know. Perhaps that\u2019s why I\u2019ve never married...do you think it was because I\u2019ve not found a woman with a wart on her nose, Finchley? Do you suppose that\u2019s the reason? If you, Finchley, were a lady with a wart on your nose, do you suppose I would marry you?\u201d</p><p>Finchley\u2019s mouth fell open for a heartbeat and then he said: \u201cYour Grace, I shall summon the surgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would get that nose removed, if I were you,\u201d Villiers said, squinting at him. \u201cAfter all, you had a fine nose before. A ducal nose, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace. If Your Grace will excuse me.\u201d He moved toward the door.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI\u2019d like a glass, Finchley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA glass! Bring me that small mirror. I need to see how many noses I have.\u201d That seemed to get Finchley moving. He plumped a small mirror into Villiers\u2019s hand and left the room as if the bats of hell were after him. In fact, Finchley looked rather like a gargoyle, not a bat. It was the two noses.</p><p>For a moment Villiers was almost afraid to look in the mirror. Would he too have grown an extra nose?</p> <p>But no. There he was...big nose and all. He felt it cautiously. There was only one. He still didn\u2019t look like a duke. Dukes had pale complexions and long delicate features, like a superior kind of hunting dog. Or they were remarkably beautiful, like his old friend Elijah. But he\u2019d grown practiced over the past few years at not thinking about Elijah, otherwise known as the Duke of Beaumont, and so he dropped that thought immediately.</p><p>In contrast, Villiers looked like a docksman. His hair was jet black\u2014except where there were streaks of pure white. His hair would probably turn all white now. The shoulder didn\u2019t seem to be burning quite as much. In fact, he felt a floating sensation, which was a pleasant change.</p><p>At least his eyebrows were still black. A woman had told him once that he had the eyes of a snake. By closing one eye, Villiers discovered that he could almost see what she meant. The one open eye was black as midnight. Peculiar, really.</p><p>He only had one nose, but he was a damned ugly specimen, anyway.</p><p>The door burst open as that hopeless fool of a surgeon, Banderspit, charged in, followed by Finchley. Finchley had lost a nose and looked entirely normal. Banderspit, on the other hand, was sprouting red feathers from the back of his head. It looked most peculiar.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Banderspit said, moving over to the bed and pawing at Villiers\u2019s forehead in a distasteful way, \u201ca fever is come upon you. We shall have to bleed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d Villiers said, laughing. \u201cI was already bled. Fought a duel, didn\u2019t I? And lost. Damn it!\u201d He sat up. \u201cI have to get to Beaumont House. It\u2019s time for our next move!\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later he found that he was struggling against Finchley and Banderspit, who were holding him down to the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he roared. \u201cTake your hands off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d Finchley asked in a quavering voice that was unlike his usual ducal drawl. \u201cAre you yourself again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am always myself,\u201d Villiers said promptly. \u201cIt may not be pleasant, but it\u2019s the only choice I have.\u201d</p><p>Banderspit wiped his forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do it immediately,\u201d he said to Finchley.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleed you, Your Grace,\u201d Banderspit replied.</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d Villiers said, suddenly remembering again that he had to go play chess with the duchess. \u201cI must play my piece! I must play my piece.\u201d He started to rise, only to find that Finchley was practically throwing himself onto his uninjured side.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Villiers said, rather coldly. \u201cI have always shown you a measured amount of affection, Finchley. Do you keep to the same boundaries. I have no wish to share a bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are these pieces he\u2019s talking about?\u201d Banderspit asked Finchley.</p><p>\u201cSurely you know that His Grace is playing a chess match with the Duchess of Beaumont?\u201d Finchley said.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Villiers interjected. \u201cAnd she won the first game, dammit.\u201d</p><p>Finchley ignored him. \u201cHis Grace is anxious to continue their current game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne move a day,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cIf we go to a third game, it\u2019s in bed and blindfolded. Surely you can understand that I must win this game.\u201d He grinned at the portly doctor. \u201cIf only to blindfold the duchess.\u201d</p><p>Banderspit looked appalled. \u201cThe Duchess of Beaumont? Are you talking about the Duke of Beaumont\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the dowager duchess,\u201d Villiers put in. He was beginning to feel a most unpleasant spinning sensation. \u201cI\u2019d never bed her. Nor play her at chess either. Though the two activities aren\u2019t so far apart as you might think.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Banderspit said, snapping his mouth shut. \u201cIt is not for me to comment on the morality or immortality of your games, Your Grace. Though I cannot but comment that the Duke of Beaumont is a highly respected man in the Parliament, and one working night and day to bring about a change in government\u2014to give En gland a government that will be respected and free of corruption!\u201d</p><p>Villiers blinked at him. \u201cI like those red feathers you have coming from the back of your wig,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen women doing that sort of thing with their wigs, but never a man.\u201d</p><p>Banderspit\u2019s hand touched his wig briefly, and then he straightened up. \u201cFetch me my assistant,\u201d he snapped at Finchley. \u201cWe must proceed at once.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p> <p>The Duke of Fletcher\u2019s town house April 30</p><p>\u201cI have listened to you for years, Mama,\u201d Poppy said calmly. \u201cLuce, please be careful with my enameled brushes. I\u2019m very fond of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stop packing those things this minute,\u201d Lady Flora snarled at Poppy\u2019s maid. Luce froze. When Lady Flora commanded, people around her tended to stop short, as if a celestial command had been visited on them. \u201cWe do not trot away from a husband, in some sort of ignominious retreat! I did not raise you for this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Mama,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cYou raised me to be a duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duchess is the wife to a duke,\u201d Lady Flora said with clipped logic.</p> <p>\u201cSo I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust that is not an insolent tone I hear.\u201d</p><p>Poppy looked at her. From years of practice, she knew that her expression would appear open and inquiring, the epitome of innocence. \u201cOf course not, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wife never leaves her husband. Not even if he\u2019s as much of a dunce as your own father. I never left him.\u201d</p><p>Poppy nodded obediently. From what she understood, her mother had discovered that marriage did not agree with her approximately one hour after the ceremony, and she had always freely imparted her wisdom in that arena to her only daughter. \u201cThere\u2019s no use marrying unless it\u2019s to a duke,\u201d she had repeatedly told Poppy when her daughter was just a mop-headed babe toddling through the nursery. \u201cA duke, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>As was often the case for Lady Flora, events had aligned themselves precisely as she wished.</p> <p>\u201cI always wanted you to marry a duke,\u201d she said now. \u201cAnd for once you did as I requested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, I always do as you request,\u201d Poppy said, handing the prayerbook from her bedside to Luce.</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment. Have you given any thought to this decision to leave your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have thought of nothing else for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been a foolish little thing,\u201d her mother said dispassionately. \u201cI thought you were a fool when you were burbling of love for Fletcher, but I shall think you worse than a fool if you leave him. Your role in life is to be a duchess. I did not raise you to be a disgrace.\u201d</p><p>That was true, Poppy thought. In fact, her role as a duchess was to be precisely what it was when she was a mere daughter: to support, compliment, adorn and otherwise support one Lady Flora, the mother of a duchess.</p><p>\u201cI told you to stop packing,\u201d Lady Flora snapped at Luce. \u201cAre you as deaf as you are ugly, girl?\u201d</p><p>Poppy drew herself to her full height, which was a little higher than her mother. \u201cLuce will continue packing, Mama, because she is my servant and I have instructed her to do so.\u201d She looked steadily into her mother\u2019s steely blue eyes. \u201cAnd Luce is not ugly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow dare you contradict me!\u201d Lady Flora\u2019s eyes had been compared to a soft summer sky and a delicate pansy; if her wooers could see how those eyes bulged they might have rethought their sonnets.</p><p>Poppy almost quailed, so she turned away to gather up her journal to give to Luce instead. Then she took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cFace me when I\u2019m speaking to you,\u201d her mother shrilled. \u201cFor God\u2019s sakes,\u201d she turned on Luce. \u201cWill you leave the room rather than lurking here like an untrained dog?\u201d</p><p>Poor Luce turned a stricken face to Poppy, who nodded. The maid fled, closing the door behind her with a clap that made Poppy jump.</p><p>\u201cUntrained,\u201d Lady Flora remarked. \u201cI would have terminated her employment long ago, for all she\u2019s got a good hand with hair. She has an insolent look and she is ugly with that potato nose. I don\u2019t believe in lying to the lower classes. It isn\u2019t good for them. It would be better for her to understand her place in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving this house,\u201d Poppy stated. \u201cI am leaving my husband. You can either accept that, or not accept that, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not accept it, and I shall never accept it. You are a duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still going to be a duchess. I\u2019m just not going to be a duchess going through the sham of a marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duchess belongs in her husband\u2019s town house. Do you think I ever contemplated leaving your father\u2019s house? Why should I? Because he was an idiot? Men are idiots; he was hardly alone in his shame. Because we disliked each other? A woman who doesn\u2019t grow to dislike her husband is a simpleton. How long do you think I liked your father?\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head, wishing again that she remembered her father. Wishing that he had stayed alive long enough to know whether he liked his daughter: that would have meant one of her parents did.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was a fool before I married him,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI grew to dislike him after our first night together. I\u2019ve told you about that, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man was a disgusting reprobate,\u201d Lady Flora said. \u201cDisgusting. He smelled like a stoat and he acted like a bull. But I didn\u2019t let you go into that night unprepared, the way I had to, did I?\u201d</p><p>The lurid shudder that accompanied her words had the same effect on Poppy as it had ever since her mother began talking of marital intimacies. She felt sick. \u201cNo, Mama,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always told you the worst, prepared you. I told you men were tedious, if useful. I prepared you for their revolting habits in bed. I would consider myself to have failed as a mother\u2014yes, failed\u2014if I had allowed you to marry anyone below a duke, or if I had sent you into marriage without knowing what lay ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>As Poppy watched, her mother caught sight of herself in the mirror and turned to the side for a better view. Because she couldn\u2019t see her entire hair style, she bent her knees; even then she couldn\u2019t see the whole of it, as it had three distinct stories, the first ornamented with blue bows, the second with loops of pearl and the third with a blue satin ribbon. She looked ready to be presented at court, and never mind the fact that it was a mere morning visit to her daughter.</p><p>Poppy sat down, even though it was a disgrace to do so in the presence of her mother. But then, she thought wearily, duchesses can sit before mere ladies.</p><p>As if her mother heard her thoughts, she erupted into a tide of anger against her parents for handing her to Mr. Selby when she could have commanded the highest in the land, if only they\u2019d had faith in her. \u201cLook at me!\u201d she demanded. \u201cJust look at me!\u201d</p><p>Poppy looked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you, daughter, and I won\u2019t lie now. You married a duke but I\u2019m more beautiful than you ever were, even at this grotesquely advanced age of mine. If there was an appropriate duke, I could marry him now. If I wished, of course.\u201d She straightened up and patted one last blue ribbon in place.</p><p>\u201cMy point,\u201d she said, \u201cis that you\u2019re a fool to even think of leaving your husband. What will you gain? You won\u2019t be free until he dies, and he doesn\u2019t show any sign of that.\u201d</p><p>Poppy thought it was most unbecoming of her mother to sound so disappointed at the prospect of Fletch\u2019s good health. But then her own father had given up and died fairly shortly after marriage, and her mother likely thought that was the natural way of things. \u201cI don\u2019t want Fletch to die,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThen why leave him? Explain that, Perdita. I see absolutely no reason for the two of you to part. You should simply allow him to go his way, and you go yours...\u201d She paused, with a frown. \u201cIs it a matter of the bed?\u201d</p> <p>Poppy had the oddest sensation that her mother had been struck by a moment of sympathy.</p><p>Sure enough, her mother made a grimace that might have been compassion on any other woman\u2019s face, and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cI know it\u2019s disgusting. I remember, Perdita. I do remember. A woman can never forget the pain and indignity of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>But her mother was properly in stride now. \u201cHis engorged instrument, so purple and revolting in every way...it made me vomit, you know. I vomited, right there in the room. That didn\u2019t even stop him. It didn\u2019t. No, he\u2014he laughed and proceeded. It\u2019s hard to believe now, but it took me at least three months before I gathered enough strength to bar your father from my bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>Poppy had never heard that before. \u201cYou barred him? I thought you said Father visited you once a week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, he did, after I readmitted him. In the beginning, though\u2014he didn\u2019t take me seriously, can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head. It was hard to imagine anyone not taking her mother seriously.</p><p>\u201cI crowned him with a full chamber pot,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cUg!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I had had my monthly,\u201d her mother said with satisfaction. \u201cI planned it so.\u201d</p><p>Poppy felt as if she, too, were going to throw up.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is that once I readmitted him to my presence, he was chastened and understood precisely what his role was in the bedroom,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI allowed him to visit me once a week until you were conceived. Then since his land wasn\u2019t entailed, and you could inherit it all, I told him that I never wanted his disgusting male organ to touch my skin again.\u201d</p><p>Poppy organized her features into something like a smile.</p><p>\u201cI can see that your husband would likely be not as easy to tame as mine,\u201d her mother said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not been thinking enough of you, child.\u201d</p><p>Poppy just stopped her mouth from falling open. Her mother patted her on the shoulder. \u201cHow often does he visit his mistress?\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Fletch has a mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo mistress,\u201d her mother gasped. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve been forced to ser vice him all these\u2014how many years is it?\u2014by yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been married four years. But it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevolting!\u201d her mother spat. \u201cA sordid way for a duke to behave. One has to suppose that he\u2019s trying for an heir. Yet if he\u2019s been trying this long with no fruit, the man is almost certainly incapable.\u201d She patted her shoulder again.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I am,\u201d Poppy said wretchedly.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou\u2019re good strong stock, and you have my blood in you. Your father and I got the task done in a reasonable period of time. No, if need be, you\u2019ll just have to pick out someone else and provide the heir. It\u2019s a woman\u2019s job, unpleasant though it may be. When the time comes, I\u2019ll choose an appropriate consort for you, just as I did your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t pick out Fletch, Mama,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cWe chose each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d her mother said briskly. \u201cI selected him the moment he appeared in Paris. It was charming that the two of you played at love so prettily, though I dare say it did make it harder for you when the sordid truth finally dawned.\u201d</p><p>Poppy swallowed. \u201cWhat is the sordid truth, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage is a convenience,\u201d her mother said bluntly. \u201cWomen would never indulge men in their filthy habits otherwise; but by marriage, a man buys a woman and she agrees to bear him children. That\u2019s what your jointure paid for: you received one-third of the duchy on signing your marriage lines, after all. And that\u2019s why it makes it difficult that you want to leave him.\u201d She patted Poppy again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m thinking about it. I would never want you to think that you couldn\u2019t tell your mother when you are at the end of your rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly\u2014\u201d But she didn\u2019t get to finish the sentence, of course. Sometimes Poppy thought she went for a week without finishing a sentence in her mother\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized that you had endured four years of\u2014of that,\u201d her mother said, staring into the distance. \u201cI know you were prepared for the act; I made sure of that. But still, a mother\u2019s soul recoils at the idea of her daughter undergoing what you must have endured. I think you\u2019re right. You should leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave. It will force Fletcher to find a mistress; men are at the mercy of their lusts, you know. They can\u2019t control their vices. It\u2019s unusual for a man to maintain interest in one woman over five years, so I\u2019m sure he merely needs some encouragement. You mustn\u2019t hate him too much. At least he bathes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Poppy murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll move into this house,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI\u2019ll soon bring him to a sense of the error of his ways. You\u2019re too young and too malleable, Poppy. You don\u2019t have the backbone I had when I crowned your father with that chamber pot. For goodness sake, you\u2019ve suffered four years! I feel like a terrible mother for not guessing your pain.\u201d</p><p>To her astonishment, Poppy saw that her mother\u2019s blue eyes were actually a bit misty. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mama,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care for you,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI know that you probably find me overwhelming occasionally; we have different personalities, and I\u2019m not good at concealing the truth when I see it. But I do care for you, Perdita, and I always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Mama,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s jaw set. \u201cI\u2019ll show that husband of yours the proper way to act toward his duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Her mother raised a hand; just so a general might stop an entire army in its tracks. \u201cI shall not be as blunt as is my natural wont. I shall use cunning. I shall be subtle. I will let the poor young fool draw his own conclusions. Then, when I judge that he has a better understanding of his rights and responsibilities, you shall return and the two of you can live in harmony.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut if you stay here, Mama\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her mother frowned. \u201cI see what you mean.

Why on earth would you wish to stay with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you not stay with Lady Wartley? She\u2019s such a wonderful presence on the hospital board, and I know she has a sincere affection for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would feel more comfortable with Jemma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should never have allowed that acquaintance,\u201d her mother said. \u201cIt was all very well in Paris, but who would have thought such a light-skirt would find her way back to En gland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend, mother. I wish you wouldn\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call a spade a spade,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI always have. The woman\u2019s a light-skirt, and that\u2019s all there is to it. I pity her husband, Beaumont, that I do. On the other hand, she is a duchess. You have my permission to pay her a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Mother,\u201d Poppy said, standing up and dropping a curtsy that was just a shade disrespectful, \u201cI have an appointment. Do request any refreshments you may desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d her mother said thoughtfully, \u201cthis might be enjoyable? I always thought that if circumstances were different I would do well on the stage.\u201d</p><p>Poppy almost felt a pang of sympathy for Fletch.</p> <p>\u201cI shall begin with a fit of hysteria. I have observed that men dislike hysteria above all else. That will put his house hold in a proper frame of mind.\u201d Her mother took her face in her hands; to Poppy\u2019s alarm her mother\u2019s eyes were misty again. \u201cI have been a terrible mother, to thoughtlessly leave you in this house for years,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d Lady Flora ceremoniously kissed Poppy on the forehead. \u201cMother is in charge now. By the time I signal for your return, Perdita, your husband will be a new man. I promise you that. He will beg you to return home, and you can set your own terms. Just think of me\u201d\u2014and there was a rare gleam of humor in her eyes\u2014\u201cas the chamber pot that Fletcher has yet to encounter.\u201d</p><p>Poppy got as far as the bottom of the stair and then leaned against the banister, hand on her heart. Could she really leave Fletch to what ever punishment her mother had in mind? When she thought about his behavior, flirting with Louise\u2014yes, she could.</p><p>He deserved her mother.</p><p>One problem was that while she was certainly friends with Jemma, there were far more women she knew better, women whom she joined on committees, women with charitable ambitions. Women whose reputations were snowy white compared to Jemma\u2019s.</p><p>All of London knew that Jemma had had affaires in those years she lived in Paris, apart from her husband. All of London was watching the chess matches Jemma was playing with her husband\u2014and the Duke of Villiers. Jemma was a bad woman.</p><p>Which was precisely why Jemma was just the right person. She wouldn\u2019t condemn her. Or try to talk her into returning.</p> <p>And her mother would never darken the door of a strumpet like Jemma, duchess or no. If Lady Flora thought men were fools, she thought that women who voluntarily dabbled with them worse than fools. Slut, she would hiss, on hearing the least bit of gossip about a woman. She had only allowed Poppy to be friends with Jemma, all those years ago in Paris, because her disdain warred with her snobbism. After all, Jemma was a duchess.</p><p>Poppy finally let go of the banister, realizing that her hands were damp with sweat. She straightened up and asked the butler for her pelisse. Then she said, \u201cI shall trust you, Quince, to tell the duke that I am leaving the house to him.\u201d</p><p>The butler\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cYour Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to live elsewhere,\u201d she said, buttoning her pelisse under her chin. It was quite chilly for the end of April. \u201cI doubt he will mind much. If he has anything to say about it, I expect I\u2019ll see him at Lady Vesey\u2019s ball later this week.\u201d</p><p>The butler\u2019s mouth snapped shut and he bowed. \u201cMay I offer the house hold\u2019s regrets, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s head was spinning with the freedom of speaking her mind. \u201cWhy should you? It will be much easier without a duchess in residence, you know. I expect that the duke will be out most of the time, just as he is now, and you won\u2019t have much work at all.\u201d</p><p>Quince seemed to be flummoxed, so she patted him on the arm. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind calling the carriage for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said with a gulp, and bowed.</p><p>Poppy sat down on a chair in the antechamber and hummed a little to herself. The anteroom was large and austere and it made her very happy to think how much she disliked it. It was cold. Forbidding.</p><p>The thought wandered through her mind that Jemma might be surprised by her visit, but she dismissed it. The important thing was that she felt quite happy. Relieved, really.</p><p>Fowle, Jemma\u2019s butler, had such a kind face that Poppy almost grew tearful when he asked if she would remove her cloak. And a few minutes later, Jemma entered the sitting room.</p><p>Poppy stood but no words came to her mouth.</p><p>Jemma paused in the doorway, the very picture of French elegance, from the tip of her curled hair to the pink silk toes of her slippers.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pleasure to see you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Poppy gulped. \u201cI thought that I would return home to Mama. But in fact she is going to stay in my house and\u2014and mother Fletch.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked. \u201cDid you say that Lady Flora is going to mother Fletch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes indeed,\u201d Poppy said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone mothering Fletch, let alone your mother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I pay you a visit?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>\u201cI would love that above all things,\u201d Jemma said, dropping a kiss on Poppy\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt must be providence, given that my brother dragged my beloved ward off to the country and left me all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true that they will marry by special license?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>Jemma sighed. The truth of it was that her ward had been caught practically in the very act of intimacy with her brother\u2014and in an open boat!\u2014so a hasty marriage was prudent for all concerned. \u201cI believe that my brother is so consumed with passion for his new wife that he cannot wait,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be very good company,\u201d Poppy said, feeling tears welling up again. \u201cI just\u2014I don\u2019t feel like being\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I left Beaumont I cried for weeks,\u201d Jemma said, her eyes looking a little haunted. \u201cWeeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that,\u201d Poppy said, choking a bit. \u201cI mean, I think I might do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re in just the right place,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI shan\u2019t bother you, but if you wish for company all you have to do is ask. Cry away!\u201d</p><p>Poppy couldn\u2019t help smiling, even through her tears.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cThe only way to abate the fever is to bleed him,\u201d Banderspit said. \u201cThat or to cup him. He\u2019s had this fever for over a week now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finchley looked down at the duke. He seemed peaceful, but even as he watched, Villiers opened his eyes and began to struggle up again. Finchley jumped forward and held him down.</p><p>\u201cI must play!\u201d the duke bellowed.</p><p>\u201cEven then, his mind may be permanently disordered,\u201d Banderspit said, his mouth curving downwards in a disapproving sniff. \u201cA man with his moral tendencies is obviously already on the very edge of derangement. A wound of this sort is enough to put his mind into a permanent state of restlessness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Finchley cried, relaxing his grip on Villiers\u2019s arm, since the duke had relapsed again into a semi-dreaming state. \u201cThe duke is perfectly sane in mind and body. He simply has a fever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe piece! I must make my move!\u201d Villiers whispered. His voice was a little hoarse, so Finchley put a glass of water to his mouth. Some of it spilled down his throat. He\u2019d never seen his master so vulnerable, not even once.</p><p>\u201cWe should get a priest to him,\u201d Banderspit said briskly. \u201cAs I said, a man of such moral turpitude will likely die of it. He has no reason to live other than degenerate desires, and that\u2019s no inspiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not the case!\u201d Finchley cried.</p><p>\u201cHas he family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously he\u2019s not married,\u201d Banderspit said with a sniff. \u201cThough it appears that he\u2019s working to ruin other people\u2019s marriages.\u201d</p><p>Villiers was tossing again. He opened his eyes and fixed them on Finchley\u2019s face. \u201cFinchley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d Finchley said, bending over.</p><p>\u201cI have to play the piece, Finchley. You know that. She\u2019ll have to come here to me because I shan\u2019t rise today. Send her a message.\u201d His hand loosened and his head dropped back to the pillow.</p><p>\u201cRaving,\u201d Banderspit said. \u201cI doubt that bleeding him will do any good. You\u2019ve waited too long.\u201d</p><p>Finchley had his doubts about bleeding. Hadn\u2019t the surgeon bled the second footman, and the man languished in the attics for a month before he died? Finchley always thought that he would have gotten better on his own, if they hadn\u2019t taken blood from him.</p> <p>\u201cI agree with you,\u201d he said to Banderspit. \u201cBleeding is unlikely to help.\u201d</p><p>Banderspit cast him a suspicious glance. \u201cI am His Grace\u2019s chosen surgeon,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve no right to call anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Finchley said, automatically pressing down on the duke as he tried again to rise and go play his chess piece.</p><p>\u201cI shall return this afternoon,\u201d Banderspit announced. \u201cIf His Grace is no better, and I have no expectation that he will be, I will bleed him no matter what you say. Though his morals are not to my liking, I have taken my oath under God to do all I can for sinners as well as the blessed.\u201d</p><p>Right, Finchley thought. Especially when the sinners of this world pay you so well. He got Banderspit out of the room and then turned around. Villiers was tossing from side to side.</p><p>There was no help for it. The duchess had to play her piece.</p><p>He went to the door and called for the butler.</p><p>Chapter 13</p> <p>Fletch emerged from his carriage after spending a tedious afternoon with Gill feeling rather thoughtful. He had all the slightly resentful shame of a schoolboy who\u2019d broken a window. Of course he would make it all better with Poppy. It had been a week and surely she had calmed down by now. He had a diamond necklace snug in his pocket. Maybe he\u2019d just leave it in her bedchamber and let that be his apology.</p><p>But no: thinking of the shock in her eyes, he knew that he had to do the thing properly. The thought made him recoil. There was nothing fun about Poppy anymore. The only fun was in flirtation.</p><p>He handed his cloak to Quince.</p><p>\u201cIf you please, Your Grace,\u201d the butler said with an unusual tone to his voice.</p><p>Fletch paused.</p><p>\u201cIf I might speak to you in private.\u201d</p><p>Fletch ground his teeth. He wanted to get it over with Poppy and then have a strong drink. \u201cCan\u2019t it wait, Quince? I have something to say to the duchess and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>A voice interrupted him from the top of the stairs. \u201cYour Grace!\u201d</p><p>He looked up and felt a perfectly horrible day grow more awful. He bowed smartly. \u201cI shall greet you in a moment, Lady Flora. Quince has something urgent to tell me.\u201d And without waiting for an answer he walked into the west drawing room.</p><p>\u201cWe probably have five minutes before she hounds me here,\u201d he told the butler. \u201cDid the chef dismiss all the kitchen staff again?\u201d He answered himself. \u201cIf he had, you\u2019d be telling the duchess. So what can I do for you, Quince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis concerns the duchess,\u201d Quince said.</p><p>Fletch raised an eyebrow. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked me to give you a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>Quince didn\u2019t hand him a slip of foolscap. \u201cI believe her to have indicated, Your Grace, that she will be residing elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResiding\u2014what the de vil are you talking about? Isn\u2019t she upstairs with that harridan of a mother of hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Quince said. \u201cLady Flora is here quite alone, and has been engaged in hysterics for the past hour or so. Perhaps longer. It seems longer,\u201d he added with feeling.</p><p>Fletch felt an icy calm. Poppy was clearly kicking up her heels. But how could she storm out of the house and leave her mother behind?</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d Quince bleated.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Fletch said, heading toward the door.</p><p>Quince spoke in a low voice. \u201cLady Flora instructed her maid to go to Selby House and return with her clothing.\u201d</p><p>Fletch stopped, his hand falling from the door. \u201cQuince,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me you are joking and I\u2019ll double your wages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Quince said, \u201cShould this event come to pass, I envision doubling most of the staff \u2019s wages in order to keep them.\u201d</p><p>Fletch reached the hallway just as Poppy\u2019s mother descended the last step. He saw her with the clear eyes of shock. Poppy had run off and it was going to cause him serious annoyance to bring her back. And whose fault was it? Poppy\u2019s mother. And whose fault was it that his bride loathed the bedchamber? Her mother. And whose fault was it that Poppy spent most of her time in hospitals and charities? Her mother.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much about Lady Flora that revealed her true nature. She dressed with all the formality of a queen and generally commanded that sort of attention. In truth, she was beautiful. Her figure was alluring, which was unusual in a woman in her forties. But it was her face that made her truly dangerous. Fletch admitted, from the depths of his rage, that it was a bewitching face, more so even than her daughter\u2019s. It was the face of a woman who was accustomed to doing exactly as she liked, when she liked and how she liked. It was the face of a woman who rarely encountered opposition to her commands: in short, she had come to regard herself as something akin to the Queen of En gland. Or perhaps, given that Lady Flora scorned those who spent their lives in one small island, the female equivalent of the Tsar of Russia.</p><p>Fletch bowed so abruptly that his chin might have cut the air if such a thing were possible. \u201cLady Flora. I regret to say that you seem to have caught us at an unfortunate moment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glided up to him and put a hand on his arm. \u201cYou poor dear,\u201d she said.</p><p>Fletch blinked. To this point, his mother-in-law had always treated him with the same regard with which she regarded every gentleman: as if he were a slightly more gilded version of a manservant.</p><p>\u201cI feel responsible,\u201d she cooed. Yes! It was a coo. Fletch ground his back teeth and didn\u2019t shift backwards, as was his instinct. \u201cI obviously failed in raising my daughter, and through that, I failed you. I have been in the greatest agony of mind for an hour; you must understand, the agony of a mother\u2019s heart is like no other.\u201d</p><p>Fletch opened his mouth but her lovely lips just kept moving.</p> <p>\u201cThen I realized that there is only one person in the world who can solve this dilemma, who can make up for the extraordinary behavior of my daughter\u201d\u2014and for a moment Fletch saw her blue eyes harden into something like glass\u2014\u201cand assuage my own overwhelming sense of guilt. I shall stand by your side, Your Grace, I shall not desert you, even though my daughter has done so. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fletch cleared his throat. \u201cLady Flora, I have every confidence that my wife will return to the house by nightfall; there is no need to put yourself into such anxiety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wish that were the case,\u201d she cried, her voice rising a little. \u201cYet I must admit that I know Perdita better than you do. She is nothing if not amenable\u2014until she\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fletch caught the flash of Lady Flora\u2019s white teeth. \u201cShe had it from my late husband, may God rest his soul,\u201d Lady Flora said. \u201cI very much doubt that Poppy will return to your house, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she will!\u201d Fletch growled, moving backwards so that her hand fell from his sleeve. \u201cNow if you will allow me, madam, I will ask Quince to accompany you to your house himself, since you are distressed.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at him as if she hadn\u2019t heard him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the house keeper and get everything under control immediately. I won\u2019t have you discomforted in the slightest by this absurd flight on the part of my daughter!\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t even a twitch in her eye to admit that there was something incongruous about a mother offering to replace a daughter. The only thing Fletch could imagine was that Lady Flora, like her daughter, was the sort of person who never thought of bedroom matters.</p><p>Fletch\u2019s only thought was of flight. \u201cI do apologize, Lady Flora. I am due at an urgent appointment.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him with all the warmth of a ravening tiger. \u201cDo make yourself comfortable wherever you wish to go. Everything will be in order for you in this house.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, she turned away and began barking at Quince about house keeping and menus and her maid and sheets. It was amazing how quickly her smooth tone peeled away when she addressed a servant.</p><p>\u201cOh, Your Grace!\u201d she carrolled, as a footman was opening the door.</p> <p>He turned back to her once more.</p><p>\u201cDo give my best to my daughter, should you happen to speak to her.\u201d</p><p>Fletch bowed. The funny thing was that Lady Flora\u2019s hair was a still vibrant golden color; it didn\u2019t look as if it were made of snakes. But surely...</p><p>His butler bowed by the door, holding out the coat he had just taken off. \u201cQuince,\u201d he said, pausing, \u201cwho was that goddess whose hair was made of snakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedusa, Your Grace,\u201d Quince said. \u201cOne glimpse at her hair and a man was struck to stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so,\u201d Fletch said thoughtfully, heading toward his carriage. Poppy would understand that she had to come home.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>May 1</p> <p>The wig was damnably heavy, but no itchier than the one he wore every day. The hooped petticoat was more of a problem. \u201cHow do you sit down in this?\u201d he asked Mrs. Ferrers, the house keeper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing but small side panniers,\u201d she observed. \u201cNow those of twenty years ago were something terrible, they were. This will do little more than give you a woman\u2019s shape.\u201d</p><p>Finchley glanced down at the bodice of his sky-blue gown and snorted. \u201cMy hips aren\u2019t the only part in need of padding, Mrs. Ferrers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be much easier if you\u2019d allow one of the house maids to do it for you,\u201d she said. \u201cBetty, now. She has a properly dramatic way with her.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe duke would never forgive me for allowing a woman to see him in his current state. Never.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Ferrers pursed her lips. \u201cBetty can\u2019t afford to lose her place. She\u2019s got those three sisters of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour arms look terribly hairy, Mr. Finchley, if you don\u2019t mind my saying so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a shawl? I tried to get into that red gown with the long sleeves, but it didn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you look as best a man can look in a woman\u2019s costume. I\u2019ll give you a shawl, and we\u2019ll tuck a lace fichu into the bodice; you\u2019ve a bit of hair showing there as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could shave it off,\u201d Finchley said doubtfully.</p><p>Mrs. Ferrers backed up and eyed him.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace is dreadfully feverish. He hardly opens his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll he\u2019d have to do was squint to see those arms of yours, and he\u2019ll think he\u2019s having a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, Finchley went off to do the necessary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he said grimly, some time later. Mrs. Ferrers wrapped a length of cloth around him. \u201cThere\u2019s not a shawl large enough, Mr. Finchley; this is the Easter cloth from the small dining room, and I think it looks quite pretty.\u201d</p><p>Finchley didn\u2019t look in the glass, just turned to go.</p><p>\u201cWalk lightly now,\u201d Mrs. Ferrers reminded him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to stamp in there and have His Grace open his eyes from surprise. You\u2019ll need to talk soft and high.\u201d</p><p>Finchley paused in the doorway of the bedchamber and said in his normal voice, \u201cYour Grace, may I present the Duchess of Beaumont, who has come to play a chess move in her game with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d the duke said, sitting up and tumbling off his nightcap. \u201cDammit, it\u2019s as dark as a wolf \u2019s mouth in here. How are we to play in the dark, Finchley? Bring us a lamp.\u201d</p><p>Finchley tucked himself down by the bed and cooed in a high voice, \u201cBut Your Grace, I can see perfectly well. Surely we can simply continue?\u201d</p><p>Villiers blinked at Finchley, who pulled back nervously. But Villiers was apparently fooled, because he said: \u201cYou look like a white ghost, Jemma. All wrapped in white like that. It\u2019s not a look that will set London on fire, in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>Finchley took the chess board handed to him by the footman. \u201cNow I shall move my pawn so, Your Grace,\u201d he chirped. \u201cDo you make your move, and I\u2019ll leave you to take a good night\u2019s rest.\u201d</p><p>The duke seemed to be having trouble staying awake so Finchley nudged the chessboard a little closer to him. Villiers opened his eyes and stared at the pieces. \u201cJemma,\u201d he said finally, \u201cdoes the rook ever stand up on his hind legs and buck when you look at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Finchley squeaked. He exchanged looks with the footman.</p><p>Villiers reached out a hand and then paused. His hand froze in the air above the pieces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d Finchley quavered.</p><p>Slowly, slowly Villiers turned his head. His eyes narrowed, and he looked from the very tip of Finchley\u2019s wig, over his cleanly shaven chin, paused for a moment on the reddened skin that showed above his bodice.</p><p>\u201cFinchley,\u201d he said, sounding clear-headed and utterly sane, \u201cI think I may be losing my mind. Would you be contributing to that situation for some reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Finchley,\u201d Finchley said.</p> <p>\u201cNo? Then the Duchess of Beaumont has truly changed her spots. I can only assume that some distress has led to this change in your apparel.\u201d</p><p>Finchley swallowed. \u201cYour Grace has been quite worried that you would miss your move with the duchess,\u201d he ventured.</p><p>\u201cI am disagreeably sweaty,\u201d the duke said. \u201cI should like a bath immediately. I certainly couldn\u2019t entertain a duchess in this condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I thought.\u201d He had to ask. \u201cYour Grace, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did I regain my wits? The Duchess of Beaumont opened this game with a pawn to Queen\u2019s Four, Finchley. The idea that she would then take a knight to King\u2019s Rook Three was enough to shock me out of a fever dream. She would never move a knight to the edge of the board in the opening moves. I gather that I have not been in my proper head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>He peered around the room. \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday,\u201d Finchley said, and then added, reluctantly: \u201cYou\u2019ve been ill for well nigh ten days, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>The duke\u2019s eyelids closed. \u201cWhat do they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctors, fool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could be ill for quite some time,\u201d Finchley said. \u201cBanderspit has seen cases linger for months with this sort of fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinger? Linger and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecover!\u201d Finchley said, cursing his choice of words.</p><p>\u201cWrite a note to the duchess and call off our match for the time being,\u201d Villiers said, ignoring him. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better call my solicitor here as well. Now, while I\u2019m still in my right head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d Finchley said. \u201cYou do come out of the fever in the mornings, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no memory of that.\u201d He rubbed his head. \u201cI feel as if that benighted duel took place yesterday.\u201d</p><p>To Finchley\u2019s practiced eye, the fever was already coming back again. \u201cI\u2019ll summon your solicitor tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>His master\u2019s eyes focused on him. \u201cYou\u2019d better remind me that I\u2019m dying before he comes, Finchley. I won\u2019t have the faintest idea why he\u2019s there.\u201d</p> <p>It broke his heart, but he bowed his head and said: \u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Two weeks later May 15</p><p>Jemma was rereading The Noble Game of Chess when her maid Brigitte scratched on the door and told her that the Duchess of Fletcher was asking to see her. She leapt to her feet. \u201cPoppy, darling, how lovely you look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m the worst of house guests.\u201d</p><p>Poppy certainly was an unusual house guest. She stayed in her room and, by account of the maids, did nothing but read. And cry, Jemma thought. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than an invisible house guest,\u201d she said reassuringly.</p><p>Poppy reached out and touched her book. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought there were books written just about chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, there are many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must forgive my innocence. I do know that you are very, very good at the game...And that you are playing matches both with the Duke of Villiers and with your husband.\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked at her guest from under her lashes and gave a mental shrug. Poppy might as well know the worst. \u201cOne move a day,\u201d she said. \u201cIn each match. If either match goes to a third game, the third will be played blindfolded\u2014and in bed.\u201d</p><p>There was silence. Then: \u201cWhy?\u201d Poppy finally asked. She didn\u2019t look a bit shocked, just surprised. \u201cWhy would you want to play in bed? Won\u2019t the pieces tip to the side and you\u2019ll lose your spot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Another moment\u2019s silence. \u201cI suppose it was your husband who came up with that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it was the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth matches? I grow frightened that this might be a case of pride goeth before a fall,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI was rather shocked when I lost the first game to my husband. At the moment both games are postponed until Villiers recovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not lose this game as well? Then you avoid the whole third game business,\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>Jemma blinked. \u201cAre you suggesting that I deliberately lose a game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>The question was inconceivable, but there was a more interesting point behind it. \u201cWould you deliberately lose the game to avoid an encounter in bed?\u201d</p><p>Poppy turned a little pink. \u201cPlaying chess in bed sounds quite uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Jemma leaned back in her chair. Her guest was perched upright, her back as straight as if it were soldered with iron. Poppy was exquisite although\u2014now that Jemma looked more closely\u2014rather brittle-looking, as if she might burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cI gather the bedchamber is not a place where you and your husband are in accord,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cI always did my best. But Fletch is not happy with me. And yet, I have tried! If\u2014if my mother only knew the things I did with him, and yet it wasn\u2019t enough!\u201d</p><p>Disturbing possibilities raced through Jemma\u2019s mind. She hadn\u2019t lived in Paris for eight years without hearing a great deal about human depravity. And Poppy\u2019s sweet little face and yellow curls looked...young. She felt a little sick. \u201cPerhaps it is better that the duke meandered off to greener pastures?\u201d she asked.</p><p>There was a strangled silence on the other side of the table, a silence that did not seem entirely to agree. Yet if Poppy were being veritably abused, she would presumably long to see the back of her husband.</p><p>\u201cExactly what does Fletch request of you, Poppy?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said wretchedly. \u201cI suppose I am a prude. He said as much once. And after that I tried\u2014I really tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take off my nightgown,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>Jemma nodded. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it off before getting into bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I lie down on the bed and I never make a fuss about anything he might do.\u201d</p><p>Jemma didn\u2019t have a patient nature. \u201cAnd what exactly is that, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe rootles about,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cHe\u2014he\u2014does what he came to my chambers for. I never make any fuss,\u201d she added. \u201cI hope that he knows that he\u2019s welcome to take as long as he possibly could wish. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d</p><p>Poppy burst into tears. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me, isn\u2019t there? I\u2019ve been thinking about it. Other women are different. Except my mother, of course. I must take after her. There\u2019s Louise, flirting with Fletch and it wasn\u2019t a matter of falling in love with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jemma didn\u2019t answer immediately, so she demanded: \u201cLouise wasn\u2019t thinking of love, was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Jemma replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2014if you play this third game in bed with the Duke of Villiers, not to mention your husband\u2014you wouldn\u2019t be entirely dismayed to find yourself there, would you?\u201d Poppy demanded.</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe will sweep the board to the side and\u2014and then you will enjoy it, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich man are we talking about?\u201d Jemma asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cEither of them,\u201d Poppy said, catching a sob.</p><p>\u201cI think I shall be able to beat my husband,\u201d Jemma said, thinking about it. \u201cAnd Villiers\u2014\u201d But then she broke off, realizing that the point was not whether she could win the games, but what would happen if she didn\u2019t. \u201cBed with my husband will happen sometime, of course, because I returned from Paris just so that we could make an heir. One must go to bed in order to create children. Poppy, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did!\u201d Poppy wailed. Her little face was all blotched with tears now, and she looked red and angry and grieved all at the same time. \u201cI went so far as to tell Fletch that! How can we have children if he never visits my bed? He should make it his duty! My mother said that father visited her punctiliously until that event occurred, but Fletch\u2014Fletch is only interested in\u2014well...\u201d What ever she said disappeared into a mumble of sobs.</p> <p>\u201cI expect that Fletch is interested in pleasure,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you call it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Poppy\u2019s tear-streaked face contorted. \u201cI just don\u2019t know. I tried...I did everything he wanted. I let him do anything he wanted, kiss me all over even though it was\u2014was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Jemma was beginning to wonder whether Poppy\u2019s marital problems might be more than she could reasonably hope to help her with. \u201cWhy wrong?\u201d she asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cMy mother...\u201d but what ever it was Poppy meant to say, she was sobbing too hard.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a cup of tea,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThen I will tell you exactly what I have ever done\u2014or allowed a man to do\u2014in bed. So prepare to be shocked.\u201d</p><p>It took two cups of tea, but finally Jemma and Poppy were seated on the little sofa before the window and Poppy was looking at Jemma expectantly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of what one allows a man to do to one,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cTake an apple puff, Poppy; they\u2019re delicious. It\u2019s a matter of what one requires a man to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo darken the room,\u201d Poppy said nodding. \u201cI told Fletch that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to do with lights. The crucial thing to remember is that men find it very easy to please themselves and women don\u2019t. Therefore, your pleasure should be foremost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Poppy\u2019s face drooped. \u201cBelieve me, Fletch knows that. He\u2019s asked me so many times whether I like this or that, that I felt as if I could scream if he asked another question. No answer satisfies him. I can say no, and he doesn\u2019t stop. If I say yes, he doesn\u2019t stop either. Or if he does, he\u2019s angry at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice that Fletch shows interest in your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much,\u201d Poppy said with feeling.</p> <p>To Jemma\u2019s mind, they had reached the heart of it. \u201cAre you saying that nothing Fletch does feels good?\u201d</p><p>Poppy bit her lip. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me, isn\u2019t there? One night Fletch told me that I should be instructing him in what to do. I should tell him exactly what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easier than relying on a man,\u201d Jemma said encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014I just want to do it right,\u201d Poppy said despairingly. \u201cEver since the first night after we married, I\u2019ve never been right. He wanted me to do this, or do that, and I didn\u2019t even know what he was talking about. And then everything he did was so embarrassing. I don\u2019t think he has any idea what well-bred women are supposed to be like!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly true. I have to say, Poppy, that Fletch sounds much more interesting than most English men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s interesting,\u201d Poppy said morosely. \u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful now. I\u2014I keep looking at him, and I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m lucky enough to be married to him. And then he looks at me with such scorn and I remember how much of a failure I am, and I just wish he were married to someone else. That way I could love him from afar\u2014and I would. I can\u2019t imagine loving anyone but Fletch. If we weren\u2019t married, he wouldn\u2019t hate me so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that Fletch\u2019s standards are entirely too high,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBeaumont and I never showed any sort of ability in bed together, but that certainly wasn\u2019t a source of concern to him.\u201d She stopped short, remembering that their marriage had fallen apart when she discovered her husband making vigorous love to his mistress in his chambers at Westminster. \u201cOr perhaps I just didn\u2019t see it that way. After all, Beaumont had his mistress, though I didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I married, Mama told me that Fletch would have a mistress,\u201d Popppy said. Her voice wavered a little but she raised her chin. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he would because\u2014because he loved me so much. But I expect I can get accustomed to the situation. I can become accustomed to anything. I have, after all, lived with my mother for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListening to you, I could almost be grateful for my mother\u2019s early demise,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI never really knew her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother loves me. She really does. And she sees in me all the possibilities that she lost when she was forced to marry my father. She says he was never clever, and of course, he wasn\u2019t titled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA distasteful comment to make about one\u2019s husband,\u201d Jemma said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cShe told me once that the cleverest thing my father ever did was die young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubstitute cruel for distasteful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when she took over the estates, she made them quite enormously profitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe enclosed all the land and put sheep in the fields where the tenants used to farm.\u201d</p><p>The fate of the tenants hung in the air between Jemma and Poppy.</p><p>\u201cI am not very good at rebelling,\u201d Poppy said with a helpless little shrug. \u201cI am not a strong sort of person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might surprise yourself,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou are certainly surprising me. And I have no doubt but that your mama is surprised as well.\u201d</p><p>Poppy smiled for the first time. \u201cHorrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>June 5</p><p>It was the beginning of June; the Duke of Villiers had been ill over a month. Yet still he tossed on the pillow, his cheeks stained cherry red, words tumbling from his lips like leaves from a tree in autumn. Finchley found himself terrified. He scared off Banderspit, who still wanted to bleed him. He shouted at Mrs. Ferrers when she wanted to give the duke sips of fresh cock\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t come out of this by morning,\u201d the doctor said as he departed, \u201che won\u2019t come out of it at all. Mark my words. A patient can\u2019t survive with that fever if he doesn\u2019t drink.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No one could get the duke to take more than the smallest sip of water. The last real drink he\u2019d had had been during that brief period of sanity when Finchley tried the chess gambit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s chess,\u201d Finchley said to Mrs. Ferrers. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that speaks to him. Listen!\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the duke, voice cracked and hoarse from talking all night, said, \u201cThat\u2019s two pawns in return for the sacrifice...\u201d His hands waved pieces in the air: they had to give him chess pieces or he plucked them from the thin air, and that was so ghoulish that Mrs. Ferrers said it quite gave her a turn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fetch the duchess,\u201d Finchley stated.</p> <p>\u201cThe Duchess of Beaumont? I thought as how you said that the master would never forgive you for letting the duchess see him in this condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more he will,\u201d Finchley said, looking at his master. Villiers\u2019s hair was all sweaty again, his face red and pinched. \u201cBut he\u2019ll die soon. I have to try it.\u201d</p><p>He took the duke\u2019s own carriage, and stamped up the steps to the town residence of the Duke of Beaumont. But it wasn\u2019t all clear sailing. \u201cI won\u2019t have that,\u201d the Beaumont butler, Mr. Fowle, said, on hearing his request. \u201cThe duke has enough to plague him without his duchess calling on Villiers at his home. Half of London is already thinking that they\u2019re on their way to a tryst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sick unto death,\u201d Finchley said desperately. \u201cNo one could think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d the butler replied. \u201cYou know perfectly well Villiers could be a corpse in that bed, and the stories will have him doing a lively dance in the sheets. The only thing is to speak to Beaumont himself. Because if the duke accompanies the duchess, why then there\u2019s nothing to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think he would?\u201d Finchley said. \u201cYou know that Villiers and Beaumont aren\u2019t the best of friends.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Fowle drew himself up. \u201cHis Grace may not approve of Villiers\u2019s actions, but he would never desert a man in need.\u201d</p><p>No more would he. A moment later Finchley\u2019s story was tumbling out before the duke.</p><p>\u201cDamn these duels,\u201d Beaumont said. \u201cAnd damn Gryffyn for challenging Villiers in the first place. Bring me my greatcoat, Fowle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duchess?\u201d Finchley asked.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess has retired to bed,\u201d Beaumont said. \u201cIf Villiers needs to play a game of chess, I\u2019ll play with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe must drink water,\u201d Finchley said, feeling desperate. \u201cI tried to play chess with him, Your Grace. It\u2019s not just that he needs to play chess; I\u2019m afraid that no one but the duchess will do. Please, could we rouse her? Please?\u201d</p><p>Beaumont looked at him for moment. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have Villiers drinking within the hour, I\u2019ll drive back here myself and cart my wife over to the house. Will that be sufficient?\u201d</p><p>Finchley bowed. \u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>It was only a few weeks since Elijah had watched Villiers\u2019s grand entrance to Jemma\u2019s party. But now Villiers\u2019s eyes seemed to have sunk into his head. There was a horrible lividity around his forehead that made the red spots in his cheeks burn brightly.</p><p>The duke walked forward, pulling off his greatcoat and throwing it behind him. Villiers was holding a rook in the air and as Elijah cocked his ear, he heard him mumble something about a backward queen\u2019s pawn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he had told Finchley. But he couldn\u2019t talk to Villiers, not with a footman bathing Villiers\u2019s forehead, and Finchley breathing heavily to his right, and the house keeper peering in from the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll ask you all to leave.\u201d</p><p>Finchley started to say something, so Elijah hit him with the look he gave recalcitrant legislators in the House of Lords.</p><p>Once the room was quiet, Elijah pulled the chair closer. \u201cVilliers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There was no appreciable response. \u201cYour Grace!\u201d he said more loudly. \u201cVilliers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis white queen is being smothered,\u201d Villiers said. He didn\u2019t even glance in Elijah\u2019s direction, just waved the rook in the air.</p><p>Elijah picked up a glass of water and tried to bring it to Villiers\u2019s lips, but the rook struck the glass and he almost dropped it onto the covers.</p><p>\u201cSmothered,\u201d Villiers said hoarsely. \u201cIt\u2019s being...\u201d His voice died into a cracked mumble.</p><p>He\u2019s going to die, Elijah thought. Villiers\u2014Villiers, who\u2019s that? They hadn\u2019t really spoken in years, but this was no Villiers. This was Leopold, his oldest, dearest friend. Somewhere under that mop of sweaty hair and reddened eyes was Leo, the first person he had ever loved in the world.</p><p>He put down the glass and snatched Villiers\u2019s rook. That got a response. Leopold\u2019s reddened eyes swung about and he said, \u201cBlack is desperate. He has no more checks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d Elijah said, using his most forceful voice. \u201cLeopold, I\u2019ve come to play a game of chess with you.\u201d</p><p>Villiers tried to pull the rook away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my rook,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI always play white, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Villiers\u2019s eyes fixed on him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cElijah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah,\u201d Villiers said dreamily. And then: \u201cOh no, Elijah\u2019s a duke now. He\u2019s married to a duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a duke too,\u201d Elijah said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m come to play chess with you.\u201d</p><p>Villiers struggled to sit up, so Elijah hauled him up on his pillows. \u201cFirst you must drink some water. Then you may make a move.\u201d</p><p>There was something different about Villiers now; he was inhabiting his own body again. Elijah avoided his eyes and picked up the chess board, swiftly putting the pieces in their places. Then he picked up the glass of water and put it to his lips. Villiers was staring at him over the glass, but he opened his cracked lips\u2014and drank.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cElijah. The Duke of Beaumont.\u201d Elijah smiled a little. \u201cJemma\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma doesn\u2019t have a husband,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Elijah moved a pawn to Queen\u2019s Four.</p><p>Villiers reached out his hand but Elijah stopped him. \u201cNot unless you drink.\u201d</p><p>Villiers took a gulp and then picked up a black pawn. His hand trembled, but he managed to move his pawn to Queen\u2019s Four as well.</p><p>Elijah took out a knight. Once prompted, Villiers drank and then, his hand shaking terribly, managed to move a pawn to Queen\u2019s Bishop Four.</p><p>\u201cJemma is not married,\u201d Villiers said, when the glass of water was almost gone. \u201cI know she\u2019s not married because she doesn\u2019t look married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does she look?\u201d Elijah asked with interest.</p><p>Villiers gulped the last of his water and held out his glass. \u201cI seem to be unaccountably thirsty.\u201d He moved his queen forward.</p><p>Elijah found it rather vexing to realize that he was playing a man who was verifiably out of his mind, and yet that madman was spinning a pretty web around his queen. \u201cWhy do you say that Jemma doesn\u2019t look married?\u201d he asked again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe looks like a woman who\u2019s never been properly loved,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know this, but she\u2019s actually married to a fellow I used to know.\u201d</p><p>Elijah cast him a quick look, but Villiers was frowning at the board.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re no longer friends,\u201d he said, making his move and taking an unprompted drink of water.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the fellow loves her,\u201d Elijah said.</p> <p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cShe told me that he loves his mistress, which is a bloody strange thing under the circumstances, but apparently he told her so himself.\u201d</p><p>Elijah ground his teeth. Of course, he had said such a bloody foolish thing but it was years ago. Could it be that Jemma remembered? One had to suppose...</p><p>\u201cI should like to be married to her myself,\u201d Villiers said, sounding quite chatty now that his voice wasn\u2019t so hoarse. He had almost finished the second glass of water, so Elijah poured more into his glass.</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d His own voice sounded like two pieces of iron rubbing together.</p><p>\u201cShe knows her way around a bed,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cDid you really move your rook to King\u2019s Seven? That was remarkably foolish.\u201d He promptly took the piece. \u201cShe knows her way around a bed, and yet she\u2019s remarkably intelligent. I would bed her, but I\u2019m afraid I would lose her. Stupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d Elijah managed. His queen was in danger; he saw his queen was in danger and he could do nothing. Even in a fit of fever and madness, when Villiers couldn\u2019t seem to recognize who he was, he had spun a web of black pawns around him and now a black rook was looming.</p><p>\u201cI want her, but I want her friendship more,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve lost this game. What did you say your name was? The doctor, aren\u2019t you? I do feel better.\u201d He picked up Elijah\u2019s queen and lay back against his pillows. His eyes drooped closed but he said something.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Elijah said, bending over.</p><p>\u201cLord, what fools these mortals be,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>Could he be quoting from Shakespeare in the midst of a fever? Elijah ventured to put the back of his hand against his forehead and he seemed cool enough. It was Elijah who felt as if he had a fever. A fever of rage.</p><p>Villiers opened his eyes again. \u201cJust be sure to take Betsy out before you leave, would you?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBetsy? Betsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dog,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cShe\u2019ll need to go out. She\u2019s been keeping me company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your dog,\u201d Elijah managed. \u201cShe was my dog, though she died many years ago!\u201d</p><p>For a moment Villiers\u2019s eyes opened all the way and he looked at him. \u201cWhy, so she did,\u201d he said, sounding surprised. \u201cIs that Beaumont? Did you keep the dog and the woman as well? Are you married to the barmaid now? Lucky sod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cDrink some more water.\u201d There was something in his voice that seemed to snap into Villiers\u2019s consciousness because he frowned. But he drank the entire glass Elijah handed him.</p><p>Elijah took the glass back, then picked up his greatcoat.</p><p>\u201cIf you have Betsy,\u201d came the voice from behind him, \u201cand you have Jemma too, then...then you have everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It was not the first time in Elijah\u2019s life that he realized how unimportant \u201ceverything\u201d can feel.</p> <p>Finchley was outside the door. \u201cHe drank five glasses of water,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI expect he needs to piss. I\u2019m not prepared to hand him a chamber pot; I\u2019ll leave that up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Finchley said, and there were tears in his eyes. \u201cWill you come again?\u201d</p><p>Elijah tightened his lips. \u201cIf you need me, I\u2019ll come,\u201d he said. \u201cSend me word in my chambers. You say he doesn\u2019t have the fever in the mornings?\u201d</p><p>Finchley nodded.</p><p>\u201cMake him drink five to six glasses of water. Not just sips. He has to drink enough for the whole day.\u201d</p><p>Finchley clasped his hands. \u201cI will, Your Grace. I will. And you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need me, I\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>July 13</p><p>Poppy wasn\u2019t used to being angry. Now she had a little coal of rage under her breastbone. She\u2019d been nurturing it ever since Fletch sent a note indicating that he intended to pay her a call.</p><p>A call! It had been over two months and her husband had decided to pay her a call.</p><p>What had she done to Fletch that he should be so rude to her? Loved him, that was all. Loved him even when he grew that little beard, and became so bewilderingly elegant, and stopped breakfasting with her.</p><p>There were limits to any woman\u2019s patience. Although patience didn\u2019t seem to be the word for the twist of poker-hot anger she felt on remembering how Fletch smiled at Louise. He smiled at Louise the way he used to smile at her. And then it all dropped away when he saw her, and there was nothing but scorn and dislike in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe used to love me,\u201d she told her reflection in the glass. It looked back at her, precisely the same face that Fletch first fell in love with. She wore the same clothes\u2014or near enough as made no matter. She maintained appropriate standards when they were married. She tinted her lips before coming to breakfast, and was never seen in dishabille.</p><p>But the weight of Fletch\u2019s silent demands was always with her. More French, she thought. He wanted her to be French, even though she wasn\u2019t French.</p><p>Her marriage had turned out to be just like her relationship with her mother. Her mother\u2019s demands were different. Be beautiful. Be powerful. Be obedient. But the important ones were the ones Poppy could never achieve: you\u2019ll never be as beautiful as I am, her mother had remarked many a time. You\u2019ll never charm men the way I do. I would have married a duke...</p><p>An awful thought struck Poppy: what if she had never been in love with Fletch? What if she had simply obeyed her mother\u2019s command to marry a duke...and he was an available duke? Now she thought of it, Fletch was the only unmarried duke she met in Paris after her debut.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand Fletch. She didn\u2019t even feel as if she knew who Fletch was\u2014so how could she be in love with him? The awful pressure in her chest eased a little. She had only thought she loved him.</p><p>She had no choice but to love her mother, no matter how badly she disappointed her. But she could choose not to love Fletch, and she could choose to make his disappointment irrelevant to her.</p><p>I need to make my own choices, Poppy thought. Decide for myself. What do I want to do with my days? Never go back to that house, said her heart. Stop trying to please my husband. Stop trying to love him.</p><p>What she really wanted was time to be Poppy, rather than the Duchess of Fletcher. With a sudden rush, ideas crowded into her head: things she wanted to do, books she wanted to read, places she wanted to see. She almost felt giddy with the joy of it. She didn\u2019t need to be a duchess. She could be just herself. Poppy.</p><p>She could live alone. Look at Jemma. Jemma had left her husband and set up her own house. She could do that as well. And she could travel! Giddy images of Paris, the Nile, the wild Americas, came to mind.</p><p>There was a little tap at the door, and her maid said, \u201cHis Grace requests your presence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned toward her lip color, and dropped her hand. She didn\u2019t love Fletch. She had never loved Fletch. Why should she make herself beautiful for him?</p><p>She walked down the stairs and found she was actually smiling. How long had it been since she genuinely smiled in Fletch\u2019s presence? Probably over a year. She had spent all that time wound tight as a top, trying desperately to figure out how to please him, how to make him love her.</p><p>Walking into the drawing room was a bit difficult because\u2014though it was unimportant, she quickly reminded herself\u2014Fletch was so beautiful. His hair was like ebony, with a sheen like midnight. His nose was straight and his eyes slanted under his eyebrows, making him look just faintly exotic. If he wasn\u2019t so infernally beautiful, he wouldn\u2019t be so demanding.</p><p>\u201cPoppy!\u201d he said, turning around with a frown. That made it easier. He was always frowning at her, and she was sick of it.</p> <p>She smiled at him, a different smile than the one she normally gave him. It wasn\u2019t a cringing puppy smile, begging for love. \u201cYes, Fletch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to come home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be coming home,\u201d she said, seating herself. \u201cI\u2019m staying with Jemma for the foreseeable future. She won\u2019t retire to the country until December because of Beaumont\u2019s involvement in the House of Lords; I shall stay with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just skip all the fuss, please, Poppy? Surely we\u2019ve known each other long enough so that you could simply forgive me and come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do forgive you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh good,\u201d he said, looking as if he\u2019d never had a doubt of it.</p><p>\u201cAlthough you were abysmally rude to me in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did apologize. I will never do such a thing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were flirting with one of my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t the faintest idea\u2014\u201d he said, and stopped.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said thoughtfully, tapping her finger on the chair, \u201cthat one is a bit more difficult to explain away, isn\u2019t it? It is true that Louise is one of my friends. A dear friend, unfortunately for you. But of course there are many women in London with whom I am positively unacquainted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, looking uneasy for the first time.</p><p>\u201cSo I think we can both agree that you should simply look farther afield,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>His mouth actually fell open a bit, which was very pleasant to observe.</p><p>\u201cWe should make some plans,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cObviously, we shall have to co-habit again at some point in the future...shall we say five years or so? When you feel that the question of an heir becomes pressing, I assure you that I will be compliant. I had felt that I wanted a child early in our marriage, but now I realize that it would be far, far wiser to wait. I have things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d He sounded stunned.</p><p>\u201cYes. You and I have separated in an amicable way, and so we can plan everything without acrimony. I would suggest five years and then we shall have to live in the same house hold again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could plan for more than five years, but we run the risk of childlessness. After all, we have been married four years with no issue.\u201d</p> <p>He just stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWe can discuss these arrangements later,\u201d she said with another encouraging smile. \u201cFletch, was there something you wished to say at this point?\u201d</p><p>Though she was being tremendously cheerful, the hot little coal of rage was still under her breastbone. She paused, but he seemed to have been struck dumb.</p><p>\u201cJemma assures me that she would love me to retire with them to the country for the Christmas season. She will be bringing a large party with her. After that, I thought I might return to France for a few years, but I\u2019m not certain of my plans yet. I hope to travel widely.\u201d The little coal of rage prompted her to say, very sweetly, \u201cBut never fear, Fletch, I will be certain to give you my direction. I know it would be most incommodious if you had no idea where your wife was. No one wants to have to track his wife like a grouse in hunting season.\u201d</p><p>He finally opened his mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean the comment in this light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you where I am going, and you won\u2019t have to worry about me. Oh! I forgot. You never do worry, do you?\u201d</p><p>His brows knit. \u201cYou sound most unlike yourself, Poppy. I am truly sorry that I have made you angry.\u201d</p><p>He looked so perplexed that she actually laughed, a genuine little laugh. \u201cI\u2019m angry, Fletch, but I\u2019m as angry at myself as you. I should never have married you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I married you because my mother told me to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you married me because you were in love with me!\u201d</p><p>She smiled again because it felt good to tell him the truth. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t, Fletch. My mother told me from the moment I was seven years old that I was to marry a duke. You were the first English duke who arrived in Paris, and so I married you. Yes, I thought myself in love with you, but now I\u2019ve discovered that I made a mistake. Which is\u201d\u2014she pointed out\u2014\u201ca very good thing, as you clearly made the same discovery some time ago.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d she prompted. \u201cBecause it seems to me that you not only realized you were not in love but you decided to seek companionship elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>The silence grew between them until she couldn\u2019t stand it. For all she wasn\u2019t in love with him, it was terribly humiliating to have one\u2019s husband be so uncaring. \u201cI really don\u2019t see any point in our discussion continuing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed anything yet!\u201d Fletch protested.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to come home now,\u201d he said, exhibiting the kind of stubbornness that characterized little boys in the orphanage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not coming home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d For a moment, the world froze on its spiral. Because, despite herself, despite her talk and her bravery and her lack of love, there was a little part of her heart\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour mother,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy mother.\u201d The aching part of her heart closed its doors. For a second she thought she might cry and then she grabbed control. \u201cWhat about my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew quite well that your mother has moved into our house,\u201d he said, glaring. \u201cIt\u2019s been two months, and she shows no sign of leaving.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was very pleased to discover that Fletch\u2019s glare didn\u2019t bother her in the least. \u201cI\u2019m certain that you can handle her.\u201d</p><p>Fletch\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat are you up to, Poppy? Where is all this wild talk coming from? Did the Duchess of Beaumont put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Jemma about my plans,\u201d Poppy said truthfully. \u201cBeyond asking her if I could stay with her through Christmas. And I certainly haven\u2019t told her the conclusions I\u2019ve drawn about our marriage. Naturally, she knows what you think of our marriage. Most of London has heard it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound spiteful,\u201d Fletch said.</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t mean to. I\u2019ve spent so much time trying to charm you that I suppose it was bound to wear thin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour mother\u2014\u201d he said, helplessly.</p><p>The coal of rage got a little larger as she realized that the only thing he really gave a damn about was the fact that her mother was living with him. Poppy knew perfectly well that her mother was a rather unpleasant person to live with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to my mother,\u201d she said, resolving to do just that. She would thank her for staying with Fletch.</p><p>\u201cPoppy!\u201d he said, sounding urgent, for once.</p> <p>But Poppy was done.

He\u2019s still in the grip of a fever most of the day, according to a note I had from his valet this morning. He may be out of immediate danger, but he still has to beat the fever. Shall we begin our second game of the match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should start a second game until Villiers is capable once again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Simply because the first two games played in tandem doesn\u2019t mean that the others have to. It was proximity that lent itself to the distasteful supposition that you were choosing between myself and Villiers.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, but he was studying the black queen. His eyelashes cast a shadow on his cheek. \u201cYou challenged me to a match only on hearing of my match with Villiers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat parallel was in your mind, and thereafter in the minds of Londoners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we play our game now, while Villiers is incapacitated, it will quell the feverish interest in the next occupant of your bed.\u201d</p> <p>It must be the politician in him; he was utterly dispassionate in discussing his wife\u2019s bed. Of course, his reputation was all important. \u201cIs there a chance that Villiers will not survive?\u201d she asked, fiddling with a bishop.</p><p>\u201cThe fever has a grip on him. I would think him a lucky man if he lives.\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt sick at the thought. \u201cOh God...\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cWill it break your heart, Jemma? Because if so, I\u2019m truly sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreak my heart? No. I haven\u2019t known him long. We were getting to be friends, though, and I enjoyed that. I am so sad to hear that he is dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps more than friends,\u201d he said. His voice was wooden.</p><p>\u201cMy heart is a singularly strong instrument,\u201d she said, resenting the conversation, resenting the way he was prying into her feelings. \u201cYou broke it long ago, Elijah, and I\u2019ve never given it away since.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cI?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you not think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2014we shared little, I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it, perhaps,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cWe shared little and yet I built a castle out of it. I suppose the word marriage has that nonsensical effect on women sometimes. But it was a salutary lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>Jemma studied her husband from under her eyelashes. He didn\u2019t have that whip-thin exhausted look to night, the one where his eyes turned shadowed and his cheekbones stood out. He looked a bit tired, but not sick to the bone. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the House of Lords these days?\u201d she ventured.</p><p>\u201cScots and brandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScots?Oh, because of the Scottish representation in Lords?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve been reading about that tangle? I thought you weren\u2019t interested in politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am as interested as any sensible person,\u201d Jemma said, startled. \u201cI haven\u2019t a great deal of time to study all the newspapers, but I do my best.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop herself. \u201cThough I\u2019m sure I have less understanding than your Miss Tatlock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is an extraordinary woman,\u201d Elijah said, with a hint of pride in his voice. \u201cFor someone of her sex and age, she really has an intuitive understanding of politics. She made a suggestion at the Royal Society today that made Lord Rollins take notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jemma decided she quite disliked Miss Tatlock. \u201cHow did that come about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave a lecture there today,\u201d Beaumont said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not in parliament. Miss Tatlock runs the Ladies\u2019 Membership. Most lectures are reserved for regular members, but the ladies are invited to join us on occasion.\u201d</p><p>Jemma thought about whether she was supposed to know about her husband\u2019s lecture and decided not, since no one had bothered to tell her. \u201cHow enterprising of her to attend your lecture. Dare I wonder whether she had a hand in your invitation?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cEnterprising?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it too harsh a word? The two of you were linked again in last week\u2019s Morning Post, you know. Apparently you drew eyes by having an intimate conversation at Lord Rochester\u2019s musicale. I wonder what she thinks will happen to me if she manages to impress you with her manifold virtues?\u201d</p><p>He surprised her by not pretending to obtuseness. \u201cPerhaps she thinks you might be fading due to a wasting illness. I notice that young women in the grip of love have no difficulty thinking that miracles will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel perfectly healthy,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cShall we play chess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you would prefer not to resume our match,\u201d Elijah suggested, \u201cperhaps we might play a game on the side.\u201d</p><p>Neither one of them said the obvious: if Villiers could not play out his match, the appetite for their parallel match would die with him.</p><p>\u201cA sound idea. We\u2019ll play a game or two for the pleasure of it, and wait for Leopold to improve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeopold?\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cVilliers\u2019s given name...surely you knew it?\u201d Jemma asked, her face carefully innocent. \u201cI thought you two were the best of boyhood friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had not realized that you were quite as intimate as that.\u201d</p><p>Jemma moved a pawn forward, the lovely rhythm of pawn to king, queen and castle swelling into her heart and soul and stealing away all those elusive worries about Beaumont\u2019s health and Miss Tatlock, and Villiers\u2019s fever.</p><p>An hour later she grinned at her husband. \u201cNow I feel better,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said sourly.</p><p>\u201cYou won our first game,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cthe one that counted. This is a game which naught sees but us, and yet I am very pleased to have won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s begin our second game in the match,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t want to wait for Villiers to die. It\u2019s too ghoulish.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, set up the board quickly, and moved a pawn to Queen\u2019s Four.</p><p>He moved his pawn to the same position and that was that. For today.</p><p>He uncoiled himself from the chair, and stood up, all six feet plus of him. Jemma stayed where she was. Her husband was a tremendously handsome man. It was no wonder, really, that he cut such a wide swath through the Parliament.</p><p>\u201cI came here to ask you a question, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou returned from France so that we can create an heir. I wondered if you had any schedule in mind for that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In other words, when would they go to bed together? Despite herself, Jemma felt a little prickle of interest.</p><p>But he kept talking. \u201cI ask because if Villiers were to win his match, Jemma, I think it should alter our plans.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cYou assume that I am the prize for the match, and I assure you that I do not wager myself nor my body on the chessboard.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read his eyes at all, and cursed silently at his politician\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cOur problem is not whether or with whom you share your favors,\u201d he said evenly, \u201cbut the fact that should Villiers win this chess game, all of London will think you are bedding him. Whether you do so or not is irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly think it\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d she answered, stung. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that your heir might end up being of Villiers\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstand me,\u201d he said, patient as always. \u201cI am well aware that you are not the sort to accidentally grow large with child.\u201d</p><p>It was a notable insult, delivered with all the calm precision of an arrow to the heart. And yet Jemma always found herself warring between truth and logic. The truth was that she had been unfaithful to him while living in Paris. And of course she had no children of those unions. The fact that he had been blatantly unfaithful to her\u2014and presumably was to this day, with one mistress or another\u2014didn\u2019t carry the same weight.</p><p>\u201cIf you and I were to conceive a child during this period of intense interest in Villiers,\u201d he continued, \u201cI fear that most people would consider that child a cuckoo. At the very least, they would show an unbecoming interest in the child\u2019s heritage that could damage his or her future happiness.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of asking you to give up the match, but I have made a practice of never asking politicians for the one thing I know they will not give, and I am holding to that policy in the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are feeling unwell,\u201d she said, \u201cI will resign from the match. Have you fainted again, Beaumont?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I believe you are right and it would be best to wait until the match is over before we engage in...intimacies.\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cIn that case\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat does not mean,\u201d Jemma said, looking at the chessboard, \u201cthat you are free to engage in a flirtation with the estimable Miss Tatlock. I am not like to die of a wasting disease; I feel entirely healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am enchanted to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I feel that the young woman will not share your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle was rare and all the more welcome for that. \u201cThe Duchess of Beaumont jealous! I never thought to see the day. I must say that this makes me feel even kinder toward Miss Tatlock.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve never been any good at sharing, Elijah. Surely you noticed that from our early marriage?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, but she didn\u2019t want his politician\u2019s words, his apologies. She gave him the smoky kind of look one gave a lover, reached up and pulled his head toward hers.</p><p>He tasted wonderful, like blackberries and spice. She meant to kiss him as a warning, as a promise, as a way to control him. But the moment after her hand curled around his neck, and their kiss deepened, she remembered the one important fact she\u2019d managed to forget while living in Paris: Elijah\u2019s kisses weren\u2019t like other men\u2019s. They did something to her. Melted her defenses, remade her into a foolish, vulnerable girl who cried for months after they separated.</p><p>She jumped back so quickly that she almost knocked over the chess table, then made sure her face reflected nothing of the utter panic she felt.</p> <p>\u201cA warning?\u201d he asked, eyebrow quizzical, eyes dark.</p><p>He always knew...he always knew what she was thinking. For a moment the pain revisited her like a slim shaft to the heart. Then she smiled. \u201cPrecisely, Elijah.Precisely.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>The same evening, in a</p><p>farless fashionable part of London...</p><p>When Miss Charlotte Tatlock stopped to think about the last few weeks, she got such a giddy feeling that her head spun. Giddiness was not her sister May\u2019s reaction, alas. May was in a frenzy of doubt and apprehension; she couldn\u2019t countenance the fact that Charlotte\u2019s name was being linked with the Duke of Beaumont. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it!\u201d she had squealed, over and over in the past fortnight. \u201cAs if you ever would...thank goodness, Mama is dead. Oh, thank goodness, Mama is dead!\u201d</p><p>After the fourteenth reiteration of May\u2019s gratitude in their parent\u2019s demise, Charlotte almost started wishing the same about the rest of her family: that is, May herself.</p><p>\u201cYou simply must stay away from him, away, away, away from him!\u201d May screeched many a time. And Charlotte had agreed, of course. May\u2019s ponderous fianc\u00e9, Mr. Muddle, had even taken it upon himself to inform Charlotte that a woman\u2019s reputation was her most golden possession. Charlotte had swallowed an angry retort and nodded soberly.</p><p>No one seemed to believe that the Duke of Beaumont had, in fact, made no moves to tarnish her reputation in the slightest.</p><p>All in all, she thought she behaved admirably\u2014except when she actually ended up in the same room with the Duke of Beaumont, of course. As soon as she saw his face, her heart would start to pound. And then she couldn\u2019t help it; she would tell him what she thought of the Gazette\u2019s report of his last speech in Parliament. He would bend his head just so, a bit to the side, and listen so gravely. And he heard her! He really heard her. They...</p><p>They...</p><p>They talked far too much, and she knew it.</p><p>And she knew, even if no one else did, that the duke didn\u2019t have the faintest interest in her as a woman. He never looked at her that way. Charlotte had never been one to fool herself. Her nose was too long and her fortune was too small to allow her to indulge in fantasies of her own beauty. Or her desirability, financial or otherwise.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see,\u201d she finally snapped at May, \u201cwhat you\u2019re implying is horribly painful to me. You\u2019re implying that the duke would actually like to\u2014to kiss me. And we both know that dukes simply don\u2019t kiss women who look like me. Not single women, not women with disagreeably small fortunes. Dukes never kiss spinsters!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that,\u201d May had said.</p><p>\u201cI am. You know I am. I\u2019m an old maid,\u201d Charlotte said, hating the world. \u201cI\u2019m an ape-leader. And a tabby, and all those other horrible words. The truth is that no one wanted me, May, and when you make play as if a duke would actually desire me, you just rub salt into the wound!\u201d Her voice rose in a way that had a dangerous little wobble to it.</p><p>May was never one for physical demonstrations of affection, but she gave her sister a prompt hug and said that if she were a duke, she couldn\u2019t think of a better thing to do than kiss Miss Charlotte Tatlock.</p><p>Charlotte smiled a bit mistily and said, \u201cAnd May, if you happened to have one of the most beautiful women in the ton waiting for you at home...to wit, Jemma, the Duchess of Beaumont, would you still want to kiss an old maid named Charlotte Tatlock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d May said stoutly, but Charlotte knew her point had gone home.</p><p>The duchess, after all, was exquisite from the top of her head to the tip of her toes. Charlotte had actually amused herself one day trying to ascertain the color of the duchess\u2019s hair. She decided it was like an egg yolk. That didn\u2019t sound very complimentary, but Charlotte meant one of the eggs that are delivered straight from the country. And when they crack open in your egg cup, the yolk is a deep rich gold, a kind of burnished brandy color, and yet there\u2019s the shine of good health, a sort of deep, natural beauty that was a year and a day from Charlotte\u2019s drab locks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Put the duchess\u2019s hair together with a lush figure and the unmistakable intelligence in her face\u2014\u201cShe is,\u201d Charlotte reminded her sister, \u201cthe best chess player in all France, or that\u2019s what they say\u201d\u2014and her argument was finished.</p><p>The husband of such a paragon...and Miss Charlotte Tatlock?Never.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>August 1</p> <p>Poppy didn\u2019t really expect Fletch to visit again, and he didn\u2019t.</p><p>She cried herself to sleep every night for another few weeks, dressing in the morning to look her very best, in case Fletch paid her a call. After all, her mother was still living with him. How could he survive?</p><p>Clearly, he survived. One morning Poppy dismissed her maid before her hair was curled and powdered, put on a dressing gown, curled up next to the window and watched the birds in Jemma\u2019s garden. Starlings hopped from branch to branch, took sudden flight and spilled up into the sky like gravy thrown into the air, settled back down on the branches to chat. She stayed there all day, wondering about starlings\u2019 nests and their conversations.</p><p>It was the kind of question her mother loathed. \u201cWhy waste your time?\u201d she would demand whenever Poppy ventured such a question. \u201cWhy waste my time?\u201d she would continue, leaving the room.</p><p>Jemma seemed to find it perfectly sensible that Poppy had stopped dressing formally. \u201cI often don\u2019t dress myself until the late afternoon,\u201d she said. Not that she knew anything about starlings.</p> <p>\u201cI only know about chess,\u201d she confessed. They both watched for a time. \u201cThey seem to be chattering to each other, don\u2019t they?\u201d Jemma asked, rather startled. \u201cI expect they\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a real friend before you,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cA pretty compliment but untrue! There\u2019s a salver stuffed with cards downstairs to attest that you have many friends, and not all of them are merely curious about your current situation. The ladies from your sewing circle for the penitent poor, for instance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sewing circle is for indigent mothers,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cThe reception of penitent poor meets at Lady Cleland\u2019s house, and we don\u2019t sew. In truth,\u201d she added gloomily, \u201cwe just talk about the immorality of prostitutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe seamstresses and gossipers have all paid you calls, though most of them have now retreated to the country,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cEvery charitable lady in the city has summoned up her courage and crossed my threshold. No! That\u2019s not quite true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone faltered?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould one picture Lady Langhorne faltering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jemma said, picturing that stout and invincible woman.</p><p>\u201cShe sent her card from the carriage, because presumably she could not bring herself to enter such a den of iniquity as Beaumont House when the duchess is in residence,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cSo tell me no more fibs about your lack of friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Poppy said, feeling weary. \u201cThey are friends of a kind. They wouldn\u2019t approve of my lying about in my nightgown all day long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s due to their virtue,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cHaving been born with a complete lack of virtue myself, I never worry about the harsh standards the rest of you put to yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn with a complete lack of virtue?\u201d Poppy said, laughing a little.</p><p>\u201cThe curse of the Reeves,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThat\u2019s my maiden name, you know. We\u2019re a scurrilous lot. I have an uncle who is stark raving mad. And my brother is hardly a model of sober behavior. The duel with Villiers was his fourth, you know. Is there anything I can get you, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooks,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI stupidly forgot my books at home and I have now read every volume on nature in your library.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNature? You mean about trees and such? I\u2019m surprised there are any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to read about animal life,\u201d Poppy said, \u201cthough I was in the middle of a very interesting treatise on the nature of air as contained in water, which I left at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe definitely don\u2019t have anything like that. How peculiar and interesting of you, Poppy. Why on earth haven\u2019t you sent a footman for your books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall send a list to Lackington\u2019s Bookshop.\u201d Then she added, rather slowly, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to read all the books I never had time to tackle. And I mean to take notes on them, Jemma, though there\u2019s no point to that, as my mother would say. I shall do so for the pleasure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be buried in three volume sets,\u201d Jemma said, hopping out of her chair. \u201cDo you know, I\u2019ve discovered that women can join the London Chess Club because they forgot to preclude the possibility in their rules? I\u2019m thinking of becoming a member just because everyone thinks that only men can be chess masters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cOnly men are supposed to become naturalists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must become a naturalist,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou must.\u201d</p><p>A month later September 1</p><p>\u201cDo you know what your husband is doing?\u201d Jemma asked, looking up from the breakfast table.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Poppy asked warily. Given that Fletch wasn\u2019t wasting his time visiting his estranged wife, she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to know his other activities.</p><p>\u201cIt says here that he made a lively speech in the House of Lords that was well received by both sides. How odd. Generally one side at least pretends to detest the speech. What do you think of going to Lady Wigstead\u2019s party this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>Jemma narrowed her eyes. \u201cI know just what you\u2019re thinking, Poppy, and it won\u2019t do. I\u2019ve given you a decent mourning period, because it\u2019s called for when a marriage expires. It\u2019s September. That\u2019s five months, long enough to recover. I took about that long, and I fancied myself in love with my husband. Though it was no love match, the way you had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I had,\u201d Poppy corrected her.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s something bewitching about waking up next to a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept together all night?\u201d Poppy asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cWe did. Frankly, what we did in that bed was never very interesting, in retrospect. But I used to like waking up when the morning light was just a faint yellow and asking him about what lay ahead of him. I was such an innocent that it\u2019s hard to imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought that he enjoyed our conversations, that I might make a difference to his day in the House. That he listened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. But he had no real interest in my advice; he listened courteously because courtesy is in his bones and his breeding. Beaumont is one of the most well-bred persons I\u2019ve ever met. The only time I saw him be truly rude was when I discovered him with his mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreadful,\u201d Poppy said, shuddering. \u201cOf course Fletch has a mistress by now. But every time I think about it, I feel sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sick. I was sick in the carriage on the way home. Even now if I think about the way her hair fell over the edge of the desk, I feel a twinge of nausea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you leave for Paris immediately?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. I was eager for explanations, for excuses, for anything. But along with his other faults, Beaumont is honest. He had told me he would leave his mistress, and apologized for what I\u2019d seen\u2014but then I asked him if he loved her. He hesitated for a moment and declined to answer, but it was too late. And he finally admitted the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved his mistress? My mother said that men form those relationships in a purely practical fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s axioms should be taken with a grain of salt,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cSarah was very beautiful. By the time we married, they\u2019d been together, if you can use that term, for three years. He says she\u2019s no longer his mistress now, but I don\u2019t know how their relationship ended. I do know that he had an attachment to her that was far greater than his attachment to me, with our stilted intimacies and my foolish comments in bed.\u201d</p><p>Poppy swallowed. \u201cIt sounds as if you and I are in similar marriages.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou saw Fletch flirting with someone,\u201d Jemma corrected her. \u201cBeaumont left my bed, after making love to me, and proceeded to his office, where he made love to Miss Cobbett. There is a world of difference there, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cYou know there isn\u2019t. If Louise hadn\u2019t happened to be my friend, he\u2019d be making love to her on a desk right now. Is that\u2014is that a common place for such activities?\u201d she burst out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jemma said. Then she grinned. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be so gloom-filled, Poppy. Not that many marriages survive, for one reason or another. I waited in Paris for three years, thinking that Beaumont would bring me back, but he didn\u2019t. And by the time he finally deigned to pay me a visit, I had discovered some pleasures of my own\u2014if not on a table top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that Fletch will wait three years before paying me another call?\u201d</p><p>Jemma leaned over and gave her a squeeze, but said nothing.</p> <p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t going to come, is he?\u201d It was a relief to say it out loud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how parallel our situations are,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cbut my guess is that he\u2019s rather surprised he hasn\u2019t encountered you at a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to parties?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>Jemma turned back the newspaper and pointed to a column entitled \u201cTaradiddle about the Ton.\u201d Just above Jemma\u2019s pink-tipped finger was a sentence that made Poppy\u2019s heart drop into her slippers.</p><p>The Duke of F\u2014found himself at the du Maurier ball last night without his duchess. The tiddle is that the said duchess may have departed for Venice. The Duke appeared unmoved by the buzz of interest and spent most of the evening in colloquy with Pitt\u2019s lords, who seemed overjoyed to welcome the sprig of fashion to their ranks.</p><p>\u201cHow Fletch must hate being called a sprig of fashion,\u201d Poppy said. And: \u201cI\u2019m in Venice?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey always get those things wrong,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIf they\u2019re not sure where you are, they make something up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go to a meeting of Lady Cleland\u2019s sewing circle,\u201d Poppy said, after a bit.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our duty,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cCaring for the poor and succouring the afflicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do it well,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI do give a great deal of money away. Beaumont\u2019s money, but believe me, an impoverished person far prefers the solid clink of coin to a poorly stitched sheet, which is about all that I can sew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering about money...What am I to do about money?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Fletcher certainly has plenty of money. I\u2019ve never heard otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have any,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even tuppence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have an allowance?\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head. \u201cFletch offered one, but Mother said that I should simply send him all my bills and leave the financial details to him. She gave me lots of advice about how I should react if he questioned my bills, but Fletch has never said a word, not even when I bought two hats\u2014and they were scandalously expensive\u2014in the same month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did your mother believe you shouldn\u2019t have an allowance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d But she did know. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m not intelligent enough to handle money,\u201d Poppy said, controlling her voice. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t say it cruelly, but she believes that very few women handle money well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says that to you, the woman immersed in studies of water and air and starlings? And are you saying that you haven\u2019t bought a thing in the years you\u2019ve been married without thinking about your husband\u2019s reaction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd before that, I suppose your mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Poppy said, feeling like the fool she was. \u201cI shall stay with you through Christmas, Jemma, but then I want to set up my own establishment. And I intend to travel a great deal.\u201d</p><p>Jemma raised an eyebrow. \u201cLet me guess...to the wild African plains?\u201d</p><p>Poppy grinned. \u201cActually, I was thinking of the NileRiver to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Nile will only be comfortable if you are veritably swimming in money,\u201d Jemma said firmly. \u201cI assume that your husband banks at Hoare\u2019s Bank, along with every other sprig of fashion in the capital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t call him that. He would hate it so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is a sprig,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cFor one thing, he\u2019s so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s older than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut younger than I, and worse, he makes me feel old with that little beard of his, and the way he slouches through a room, burning with something or other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is tiresome, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Poppy said, starting to laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s tediously beautiful,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cTediously so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not manly to be so perfect in every way.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was laughing delightedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat you need,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cis to withdraw a great deal of money and spend it however you like, without thinking twice about whether you\u2019re buying two hats or forty hats. And then we\u2019ll send Fletch a letter and tell him that you\u2019d like your allowance deposited into your own account at Hoare\u2019s Bank. It will be much easier for both of you that way. You can set up your own house hold, and travel wherever you like, and he won\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</p><p>It was all delightfully simple.</p><p>Faced with the smiling, confident faces of the Duchesses of Beaumont and Fletcher, Mr. Pisner of Hoare\u2019s Bank handed over the truly outrageous sum the duchess demanded without a quibble. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he told his manager, Mr. Fiddler, later, \u201cI knew who she was and it was her.\u201d That wasn\u2019t grammatical, but it was clear enough. \u201cAnd it were the Duchess of Beaumont as well, and the two of them as thick as thieves, you could tell. And then she told me, the Duchess of Fletcher that is, that she would like her own account at the bank, and that her husband will be depositing her allowance there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe world is going to hell in a handbasket,\u201d Mr. Fiddler observed. \u201cNot a man has control of his wife anymore.

She was slowly coming to understand that she knew almost nothing about her husband.</p> <p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s buy something you always wanted but didn\u2019t buy.\u201d</p><p>But Poppy couldn\u2019t think of anything.</p><p>\u201cA new gown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always bought them when I felt I had a need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cis buying something for which you have no need. For the pure pleasure of it. Not because there\u2019s a hole in your stockings, but because you love stockings.\u201d Then she started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Poppy said, smiling along with her.</p> <p>\u201cYour expression,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou look like a kitten with your first mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there is something,\u201d Poppy said shyly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you won\u2019t laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBut I promise not to hoot, will that do?\u201d</p><p>Poppy unfolded a small advertisement cut neatly from the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth?\u201d Jemma said, taking the scrap of paper. It was an advertisement. \u201cFor Sale: The horn of a strange beast recovered in Sisfreyan Babylon. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear about that beast?\u201d Poppy asked. \u201cIt was written up in the Gazette last year. They said that it had two horns above its nose and two twisting horns above each ear. The article said that it was as large as a horse and might easily have carried two men. And its fur was blue.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma had a look on her face that was something akin to that of Poppy\u2019s mother whenever Poppy showed her interesting snippets from the papers. \u201cWhy on earth are you carrying that about in your pocket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like to buy it,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cBuy it?\u201d</p><p>Poppy leaned forward and rapped on the roof. \u201cYer Grace,\u201d came back the booming voice of the coachman.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to go to Grudner\u2019s Curiosity Shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrudner\u2019s Curiosity Shop in Whitefriars,\u201d she shrieked. \u201cNow, please.\u201d</p><p>The carriage pulled ponderously to the right. \u201cGrudner\u2019s Curiosity Shop?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read his advertisements,\u201d Poppy explained. \u201cHe\u2019s got all kinds of wonderful things...once he had a cherry stone with one hundred heads carved on it. And an ostrich egg. Do you know what an ostrich is, Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Jemma said, leaning back and grinning at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very large, fat bird,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cMy father had a book of natural curiosities, and I kept it under my bed for years. All the maids knew, of course, but they never told my mother. Why are you smiling at me so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your eyes are shining,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYour eyes are shining and your cheeks are pink, and you look\u2014interested, Poppy. Really interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who wouldn\u2019t be? Did you know that Lord Prestle has a stuffed alligator? I would love to see that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stuffed alligator? What is an alligator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA monster,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cA veritable monster with huge huge teeth and tusks the size of a man\u2019s leg. That\u2019s how they described it in the Rambler\u2019s Magazine. It roams the wilderness in America and snaps up a whole man in one mouthful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness sakes,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou seem to be reading different articles than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first thing I\u2019m going to do is buy a cabinet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a stuffed alligator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in stuffed animals, particularly,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cWell, I am interested, but I think I\u2019m more interested in curiosities. There was an advertisement a few months ago for a clear crystal pebble with water trapped inside it, for instance. I almost asked Mother if I could buy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t feel that curiosity is an appropriate emotion for a duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must be a duchess in your mother\u2019s mold,\u201d Jemma said comfortably. \u201cI\u2019ve never had the faintest curiosity unless it was about discovering a new way to solve a chess problem. But I do have a question, Poppy. Why on earth were you asking your mother for permission about how to spend Fletch\u2019s money?\u201d</p><p>Poppy frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never ask anyone\u2019s permission for anything,\u201d Jemma said frankly. \u201cIt is a far more entertaining way to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see what you mean. I suppose I was just in the habit of asking Mama about things. Though I knew she would say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must stop asking her questions. I loathe people who say no.\u201d</p><p>Poppy started laughing. \u201cWho says no to you, Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very many people, which is just as it should be. Beaumont and I have a wrangle now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am beginning to realize that my mother says no about a great many things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFew of which are her prerogative,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThe more I hear about your mother, the more grateful I am for my paucity of relatives. I wouldn\u2019t trade my mad uncle for your mad mother any day of the week!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know, we haven\u2019t even written each other a letter in the last month? I expect she\u2019s furious at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s duchessing it in your place,\u201d Jemma said, with a distinct edge in her voice. \u201cShe held a soir\u00e9e last week, according to the gossip columns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always wanted to be a duchess,\u201d Poppy said, feeling a stab of loyalty. \u201cAnd she would have made a much better one than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow she is one,\u201d Jemma pointed out. \u201cWe dissolute duchesses live in Beaumont House, and all the proper ones can pay visits to your mother, and we\u2019re all comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Still September 1</p><p>The Duke of Villiers opened the elegant piece of embossed stationery, scanned it and let it fall from his hand. He was so terribly tired that he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care that one of his friends had sent him a long page of gossip. Apparently the Duke of Beaumont was indulging in a flirtation with Miss Charlotte Tatlock. They were seen speaking together at all events.</p><p>Elijah must be insane, to flirt with an old maid like Charlotte Tatlock, when he could be talking to Jemma. Though now he thought about it, he had the idea that Elijah had talked to Miss Tatlock through most of Jemma\u2019s last dinner party. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Villiers didn\u2019t even have the strength to read the rest of the letter, which was galling.</p><p>He had his chess board by the bed, but he couldn\u2019t seem to keep his mind on a good chess problem, even though Finchley set it up from Chess Analyzed, by Philidor, just as he had asked him to do.</p><p>His eyes kept slipping around his room, his empty, tedious room. He had redone it two years ago in a pale gray, the color of an early sky over the ocean, of a day when autumn is just turning into winter. He still liked the color. But it was empty...empty...terribly empty.</p><p>He could even find it in himself to regret the fact that his fianc\u00e9e had left him for Jemma\u2019s brother, though he didn\u2019t give a damn about that when it happened.</p> <p>\u201cMay I bring you some barley soup, Your Grace?\u201d Finchley said, hovering in the doorway like some sort of specter of death.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Villiers said. And then: \u201cNo, thank you, Finchley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA number of visitors called this morning,\u201d Finchley announced with some pride. He took a tray from a waiting footman and displayed it as if it were a baby. Sure enough there was a little heap of cardboard bits, embossed with the names of nobility, acquaintances, friends and the purely curious.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Villiers said. There was no one he cared to see among the heaps of cardboard. The truth was that he was depressed. He would have liked to see Benjamin. Benjamin would have rushed into the room like a breath of chill water, and Villiers would have had to say something sharp to him, and would have thought about clumsy-footed puppies and the like.</p><p>It was something, to come so close to death. And then to remember that his friend Benjamin had already died.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose,\u201d he said, just as Finchley was about to leave, \u201cthat the Duchess of Beaumont paid a call? Or the Duchess of Berrow?\u201d That would be Benjamin\u2019s widow.</p><p>Finchley bowed. \u201cNo ladies were among your visitors, Your Grace.\u201d He said it patiently, as though Villiers had forgotten all the social etiquette. Of course no ladies came. Why on earth would Benjamin\u2019s widow pay him a call? Doubtless she blamed him for Benjamin\u2019s suicide.</p><p>He would have thought that Jemma might have come. She had said they were friends, after all. One had to suppose that they weren\u2019t as good friends as that. It was hard to remember...his brain was all foggy.</p><p>\u201cThe Duchess of Beaumont didn\u2019t call, did she?\u201d he asked again, just to make sure.</p><p>Finchley got an odd expression on his face, but he shook his head. \u201cNo, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaved about her, did I?\u201d Villiers guessed. \u201cI suspect I said all sorts of things, Finchley. I have the oddest memories. Did the solicitor ever come?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d Finchley said. \u201cDo you not remember creating your will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Villiers said, lying through his teeth. Then he took pity on the uncomfortable manservant. \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p><p>Finchley disappeared and Villiers stared at his fingers in the light. They had grown thinner, almost transparent, really. Of course Jemma hadn\u2019t visited. She couldn\u2019t visit him. That would be tantamount to telling all London that they were having an affaire\u2014and the worst of it was that they weren\u2019t. In fact, Villiers had been stupid enough, as he recalled it, to turn down what might have been an invitation.</p><p>\u201cFool, fool,\u201d he whispered under his breath.</p><p>And then, thinking of Benjamin, \u201cFool.\u201d The fever was coming back, making his head reel. It lapsed in the mornings, but he felt it coming back now that luncheon was over, approaching like a dark velvet tide that would pull him under.</p><p>And for the first time, he thought: I might die. I really might die. And what a fool way to die, dueling over a fianc\u00e9e for whom he didn\u2019t give a fig. A life thrown away for a careless word, for a twist of steel.</p><p>Not that there was much to give up but a tangle of regrets and some lost friends. Benjamin...dead. Elijah. Elijah, married to Jemma. His life made his head ache.</p><p>There was one thing, though...</p> <p>One thing that had to be done.</p><p>Already his eyesight was wavering. \u201cFinchley,\u201d he called, hearing his voice crack.</p><p>His manservant appeared instantly. \u201cI\u2019ve got the fever again,\u201d he said, to forestall the patient hand on his forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll have some water please, and I need to write a note. Quickly, before it comes on.\u201d</p><p>But by the time Finchley came back with a sheet of foolscap, the fever had come, and Villiers couldn\u2019t remember what he meant to say.</p><p>\u201cThat woman,\u201d he managed. \u201cAddress it to her.\u201d</p><p>Finchley sat beside the bed and said, \u201cWhat woman?\u201d</p><p>To Villiers, his valet\u2019s lean figure grew longer, grew horns, swayed against the wall. He closed his eyes. \u201cWe were all friends, of course. What is her name? Charlotte, I think. Perhaps Charlotte.From His Grace, the Duke of Villiers.Greetings.\u201d</p><p>He forgot what he wanted to say and that he wanted to say anything, and fell into a pool of warm water that was inexplicably waiting behind his closed lids. He was floating in it, flying really, when Finchley\u2019s per sis tent voice came through the water, dimly, watery. \u201cYour Grace. Can you tell me this woman\u2019s last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d Finchley said. \u201cA woman named Charlotte. You are writing her a missive, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am? Charlotte? Do you mean Charlotte Tatlock?\u201d he said, knowing he sounded irritable. \u201cA rather odd young woman, long in the tooth.\u201d</p><p>Saying all that exhausted him and he fell back. A missive? What the hell is that? \u201cNo, no, I mean to say, tell her\u2014tell her\u2014\u201d The pool yawned at his feet again, welcoming, warm. Perhaps there were mermaids there with bright eyes who would make him feel warm and loved. Nourished. Perhaps...Surely Benjamin\u2019s widow\u2019s name wasn\u2019t Tatlock. Because Benjamin\u2019s last name...what was Benjamin\u2019s last name? \u201cTell her to visit me,\u201d he said. \u201cTell her that\u2014 tell her that I miss Benjamin.\u201d</p><p>He could hear Finchley\u2019s quill scratching and it made his head throb. \u201cNow go away, do,\u201d he said. \u201cDeliver it by messenger.\u201d</p><p>When the door closed, he closed his eyes and fell into the pool but there were no bright-eyed mermaids with sleek green tails, merely shifting shadows and heat. It was so hot that the pool must be heated by volcanos.</p><p>And so it went, until another dawn.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Grudner\u2019s Curiosity Shop was set well back from the street, its gabled windows crowded with a variety of what looked like rubbish.</p><p>Poppy sprang out of the carriage. She\u2019d wanted to visit Grudner\u2019s for years, ever since she learned of its existence, but her mother had said no. Grudner\u2019s was located in one of the liberties of London, Whitefriars, which was an area without rule or law, according to her mother. To Poppy, the street looked as dingy and crowded as any street and showed no obvious sign that it was located in a hub for criminal activity.</p><p>Jemma followed in a more leisurely fashion, making sure that her side bustles didn\u2019t touch the carriage door. \u201cI suspect that Mr. Grudner doesn\u2019t believe in cleaning,\u201d she said, looking in the window.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d Poppy said, pointing.</p><p>Jemma peered closer. \u201cAn old riding glove?

Besides, Poppy, did you know that Henry VIII never bathed? He didn\u2019t like water next to his skin, apparently. My uncle told me that the king\u2019s skin was as smooth as a baby\u2019s behind. But imagine...\u201d She shuddered. \u201cImagine the inside of that glove!\u201d</p><p>It was a small store, painted a pleasing cherry red.

May I show you something? Perhaps the glove of Henry VIII that you admired in the window?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Poppy said, smiling at him. \u201cI\u2019m interested in scientific curiosities, if you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lanhado from Africa,\u201d Mr. Grudner said. \u201cTen foot wing span, of course, and beautifully stuffed. I have to keep it in another location, but I could have it delivered to you tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot stuffed animals, but curiosities,\u201d Poppy explained. \u201cI intend to develop my own curiosity cabinet. I saw your advertisement for the horn of a Sisfreyan beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA notable piece,\u201d Mr. Grudner said. \u201cA true miracle, that.

He has one of the best collections in En gland, and most of it purchased from this very shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Poppy said, obviously entranced. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I didn\u2019t get to see the horn of the beast before it was purchased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe store is full of wonderful objects...Every lady should have her own curiosity cabinet. Can I show you the hand of a mermaid, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Jemma wandered away once Poppy was happily occupied in poring over Mr. Grudner\u2019s unsavory collection. She found a small picture made entirely of feathers and was trying to decide whether it depicted a monkey climbing up the back of a man\u2014or possibly a person climbing a flight of stairs or perhaps a cow next to a tree, when she saw a chess piece, sitting by itself on a small pedestal.</p> <p>It was the white queen, carved from ivory. She stood with a regal frown, her body shadowed by the enormous crown that bloomed on her head. The crown was a hollow sphere, exquisitely carved with open work, and when Jemma peered inside she saw inside another sphere, also open, and inside that, yet another.</p><p>\u201cExquisite, is it not?\u201d Mr. Grudner said, popping up at her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I have only the one piece. The entire set belongs to Lord Strange and I have not been able to convince him to part with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why on earth did he part with the queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t say for certain,\u201d Mr. Grudner said.</p><p>\u201cA chess set,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cis nothing without its queen. Useless. Why on earth would Strange give you the queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sold it to me, ha ha,\u201d Mr. Grudner said. \u201cDidn\u2019t get to be the richest man in En gland by giving away pieces of artwork like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he sell it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose he must have given up chess,\u201d Mr. Grudner said. \u201cHowever it may be, Your Grace, I assure you that this piece is quite lovely on its own. There are five nested spheres inside the crown, ending with the smallest ivory marble I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy called from the other side of the store. \u201cJemma, do look at this!\u201d</p><p>Jemma walked over, bringing the queen with her. For some reason she was reluctant to put down her fiendishly frowning little face, so obstinate even in the face of losing her king and the rest of her court.</p><p>\u201cI found a marvelous statue of a boy and a butterfly,\u201d Poppy said, holding it out.</p><p>\u201cA copy of an ancient Greek statue,\u201d Mr. Grudner said, \u201cand a very fine one, if I say so myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look at the detail on the butterfly!\u201d Poppy exclaimed.</p><p>Jemma looked, but it wasn\u2019t the butterfly but the naked youth kneeling before it that struck her as interesting. \u201cWho does the piece represent?\u201d she asked Grudner.</p><p>\u201cEros, or Cupid, in love with Psyche,\u201d he said. \u201cPsyche means butterfly in Greek, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Jemma asked, peering at the odd rock in Poppy\u2019s other hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a geode,\u201d Poppy said. She put down the statue of Cupid. \u201cLook. You open it like this.\u201d The two rough bits of rock fell open to reveal a gorgeous amethyst interior. \u201cIt\u2019s like a wild little cave that you can hold in your hand,\u201d she said. \u201cA fairy grotto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have put it better myself,\u201d Mr. Grudner said promptly, looking like a man who had no idea what a fairy grotto might be but knew that the phrase suggested pure profit.</p><p>\u201cI found this as well,\u201d Poppy said, ignoring him. She held out the pit of a fruit, a small one, perhaps an apricot. Delicately she pulled at it until it fell apart. Inside was a mess of the tiniest spoons Jemma had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s darling!\u201d Jemma said, suddenly remembering a little serving set she\u2019d had for a long-lost doll.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four spoons inside a cherry pit,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cThe smallest such in the world,\u201d Mr. Grudner put in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no cherry pit,\u201d Jemma stated. \u201cIt\u2019s a peach at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry, Your Grace,\u201d Mr. Grudner said stubbornly.</p><p>Jemma sighed. Clearly, Poppy was about to be fleeced of all the money she had taken from her husband\u2019s bank account and yet...why shouldn\u2019t she be fleeced if she wanted to? It was not a Reeve family habit to shelter people from making errors. Cherries, peaches, who cared?</p><p>But Poppy surprised her. She dimpled at Mr. Grudner and asked for a chair, and then charmed him into dusting it, and by the time she sat down and took off her gloves, and accepted a cup of tea, Jemma could see exactly where this was going. Sure enough, forty minutes later they walked out of the store leaving a bewildered own er, who had half convinced himself that he had practically given away the cherry stone to the duchess because she was...because she was...</p><p>Charming. He sighed and shook his head, thinking about what Mrs. Grudner, God rest her soul, would have said. It wouldn\u2019t have been pretty.</p><p>\u201cThe worst of it is that I had to pay full price for my chess queen,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAnd you bought everything for about half what he first requested. That\u2019s unfair!\u201d</p><p>Poppy dimpled at her in complete unrepentance. \u201cMy mother says that a lady never bargains for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you call the exchange that just went on there? That poor man asked for fifty pounds for the cherry stone, and you paid him, what, four?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy grinned. \u201cI call it\u2014I call it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just call it rebellion,\u201d Jemma said dryly. \u201cWould it be fair to say, Poppy, that in the process of leaving your husband, you have also left your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just how I see it,\u201d Poppy said, leaning back and opening the sack containing her cherry stone. \u201cTomorrow I intend to visit France &amp; Banting. By all accounts they make delightful curiosity cabinets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are cabinets built for cherry pits?\u201d Jemma asked incredulously.</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever seen a curiosity cabinet? The King of Sweden\u2019s was displayed at the LeverianMuseum last year, and I told my mother I was visiting the poor but I went to the museum instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a mutiny,\u201d Jemma said dryly. \u201cI trust she didn\u2019t discover your perfidy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully no. And you may be as sharp as you please, Jemma, but I assure you that it is hard to withstand my mother\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cLuckily, she\u2019s never shown me the faintest interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Poppy said candidly, \u201cis one of the reasons why I am so grateful that you took me in. My mother\u2019s concern for her reputation is such that she cannot visit me, no matter how she may wish to do so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew that my reputation would come in handy for something. You should hear Beaumont complain about how that same reputation is ruining his chances for this and that in Parliament. I shall have to inform him that it is actually of ser vice in keeping away mothers and other marauding armies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I shall request a cabinet of oak and ebony. I love the combination of black and brown woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Jemma said. She had taken out her Queen and was examining her again. In truth, she was a delicious chess piece. Her gown frothed in the back like the curve of an ocean wave crashing on the shore.</p><p>\u201cMr. Grudner said that your piece came from Lord Strange, didn\u2019t he? His is one of the curiosity collections that I would love to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame about Strange,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cEven I couldn\u2019t visit Fonthill, his estate, of course. Why, why do you suppose that he broke up the set and sold the Queen? It\u2019s such a cruel thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you visit Fonthill? I mean to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis reputation is ten times blacker than mine. The man has scandalized people who think of me as angelic.\u201d</p><p>Poppy leaned back. \u201cI mean to see his collection. And I want to go to the AshmoleonMuseum as well. And to the Royal Society. Mother never allowed me to go to their meetings, even though they regularly allow ladies to attend.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked at her. Poppy\u2019s face was as charming as ever, but Jemma suddenly realized that there was nothing soft about Poppy\u2019s jaw, and that her smile was as determined as it was sweet.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tatlock is the secretary of the Ladies\u2019 Auxiliary of the Royal Society,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cYou mean that young woman who flirts with your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think of her as Miss Fetlock,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt is an affectionate name, you understand.\u201d</p><p>Poppy smiled at her. \u201cI wish I could think up a mean name for Louise, but I\u2019m too fond of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere we differ. I have no liking whatsoever for Miss Fetlock, though I am the first to admit that my dislike is extremely unfair. As far as I know, she adores Beaumont from afar and he certainly would never risk his precious reputation to do more than converse with the poor woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen we must direct her attentions in some other direction,\u201d Poppy said firmly. \u201cAs it happens, I know a delightful young scientist, Dr. Loudan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t marry just any young man from Oxford, no matter how intelligent he was,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cShe\u2019s caught in the bounds of propriety, you know. One of those.Poor but a peer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the Honorable George Loudan,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cAnd he stands to be Viscount Howitt someday.\u201d</p><p>Jemma raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat a splendid idea, Poppy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall go to the next Royal Society meeting. At least, the next one to which they invite women. And I\u2019ll introduce the two of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth did you meet this scientist, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>To Jemma\u2019s amusement, Poppy got a little pink.</p><p>\u201cPoppy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote him a letter,\u201d Poppy confessed. \u201cYou see, he wrote a treatise on the three-toed sloth in Transactions of the Royal Society, and while I felt he made some astute comments, he overlooked an important point that Dr. Hembleton made in a previous article, having to do with their back claws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrote him a letter? About a three-toed sloth?\u201d What ever Jemma was expecting, it wasn\u2019t missives to do with sloths.</p><p>Poppy nodded.</p><p>\u201cIllicit correspondence with a gorgeous young man.\u201d Jemma leaned back, grinning. \u201cYou did say that he was gorgeous, didn\u2019t you, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>Poppy looked even more flustered. \u201cWell, of course, I wasn\u2019t thinking of his person when I wrote him a letter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you weren\u2019t,\u201d Jemma said, chortling. \u201cNot a thought. Never.Of course not. Did he write back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cHe wrote back, did he? Probably thought you were brilliant, didn\u2019t he? And\u2014just how many letters have ensued, Miss Holier-than-Thou Duchess?\u201d</p><p>Poppy looked a little faint. \u201cDo you really think\u2014see it\u2014do you think that he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows how he thinks? Men are a mystery to me. I love the idea that you\u2019re engaged in conversation, albeit epistolary, with one of the world\u2019s great scientists!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly think he\u2019s one of the world\u2019s great scientists,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cHe may be an expert on the three-toed sloth, but he makes frequent errors in his assessments of research. I suspect him of sloppy note-keeping.\u201d</p><p>And then, when Jemma kept giggling, she said: \u201cTruly, this is not an illicit flirtation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I suppose you showed all your letters to Fletch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be interested. Fletch doesn\u2019t care about sloths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose if the sloths were wearing little ermine-lined cloaks, it might be different,\u201d Jemma said mischievously.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Poppy said, and then started laughing. \u201cFletch is rather ridiculous, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBut ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never used to be like that,\u201d Poppy said a little sadly. \u201cIn the last year, he just became more and more polished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you turned to the purveyor of two-toed sloths. I would have done the same. Well, if I had the faintest inclination to discuss such a topic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree-toed, not two-toed. You would be interested,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cReally, you would! Dr. Loudan can be quite fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose he thinks you\u2019re fascinating as well?\u201d Jemma asked mischievously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, I have the sort of brain that simply can\u2019t forget a tiny detail I read somewhere. I\u2019m just like that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI forget everything,\u201d Jemma observed.</p><p>\u201cBut you remember every chess game you ever played. My brain works that way when it comes to articles about sloths and French marmoses. It\u2019s terribly inconvenient,\u201d she said feelingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnladylike,\u201d Poppy said, wrinkling her nose. \u201cI can\u2019t help it, though. I see a new book or an article on a subject that interests me and I become simply feverish to read it. My mother loathes that propensity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow strange,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean you, but the very idea of feeling feverish about a sloth, three-toed or not, is peculiar. You must know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never tell anyone. And you must promise to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this Oxford fellow simply embrace you and your detailed brain, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that scientists are not always excited to be reminded about details,\u201d Poppy said, looking rather surprised. \u201cSurely accuracy is of the utmost importance when it comes to natural study, but you would be surprised, Jemma, at how inexact some people can be. Dr. Loudan is occasionally quite reluctant to drop an idea, even when the evidence is against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever spoken to a naturalist. There are very few of them wandering around Paris. So do you really think we could interest the inexact but Honorable George Loudan in Miss Fetlock?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe curious thing to me, Jemma, is why you are so interested in removing Miss Tatlock from your husband\u2019s company. You acknowledge that he would never endanger his reputation. And she is a gently bred young lady. Your marriage is in no danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already saw my husband in love with another woman,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI left for Paris because I couldn\u2019t bear to be around him in that circumstance. That\u2019s one thing that Beaumont has never understood: marriage and reputation are not the most important things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a common problem,\u201d Poppy said thoughtfully. \u201cMy mother would agree with Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>September 2</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t know what to make of the letter when it arrived. She saw the ducal seal and snatched it from the house maid as if it might burn her fingers. And then she ran upstairs where May couldn\u2019t see it.</p> <p>Only to find to her disappointment that the seal was that of the Villiers family, and not that of the Beaumonts.Of course not. The Duke of Beaumont wouldn\u2019t write to her. He would never do that. He was solid, respectable, honorable...</p><p>She came back to herself with a start and stared down at the note. It was obviously written by a servant, and it stated that the Duke of Villiers would like her to pay a call. The Duke of Villiers?An unmarried man? How on earth could she do that? Why would he even expect that she would consider it?</p><p>And why would he want her to visit? He barely exchanged two words with her at the dinner party given by the Duchess of Beaumont, which was the only time they\u2019d met. And finally, who was Benjamin, the name mentioned in the letter?</p><p>The problem, Charlotte thought, was that her life was boring. She\u2019d been on the shelf more years than she cared to count. Her mother had always said that she had an intelligent countenance, and she knew that she was honest, fairly virtuous and chaste. Not that she\u2019d ever had a chance to be less than chaste, but a virtue is still a virtue, even if untested. But none of those qualities made life interesting.</p><p>May entered the room. \u201cIs that a letter from Beaumont?\u201d her sister demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that I received a letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe maid told me, of course,\u201d May said impatiently. \u201cI see that Mr. Muddle shall indeed have to have a word with His Grace. He is toying with your reputation in a most unkind fashion, sending you private letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Muddle will have nothing to do with the Duke of Beaumont!\u201d Charlotte cried, horrified at the thought of her sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 muddling his way through a conversation with the duke. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly ask it of him, May!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI most certainly could,\u201d May said, drawing herself up. \u201cMother would not have permitted the visit. And no one could have your welfare more at heart than my future husband, Mr. Muddle!\u201d</p><p>Charlotte hated the way that May\u2019s voice dropped when she said the word husband. And it wasn\u2019t just jealousy either. It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a letter from Beaumont,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d May sat down. \u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaumont has never written me and he won\u2019t. You just don\u2019t understand, May. He\u2019s not interested in flirting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are interested in flirting with him,\u201d May said, with a sister\u2019s shrewish perception. \u201cAnd sometimes that\u2019s even more dangerous to a woman\u2019s reputation, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was too depressed to answer, so they just sat for a moment until May said, \u201cWho\u2019s the letter from, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d May said. \u201cIs it a deathbed confession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfession?Confession to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d May cried, clasping her hands together. \u201cI believe he is already dead. Maybe it\u2019s\u201d\u2014her voice lowered to a curdled whisper\u2014\u201ca letter from a dead man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard this morning,\u201d May said. \u201cDead. The coal man had it on the best authority from the fishmonger in Gatrell Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful,\u201d Charlotte said, letting the letter fall from her fingers.</p><p>\u201cBut what did he want from you? I didn\u2019t think you even knew him.\u201d She reached for the foolscap.</p><p>\u201cHe attended the dinner party given by the Duchess of Beaumont that I was at last spring, but we hardly spoke. I think a mistake was made in the address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d May said, with her usual brand of tiresome logic. \u201cIt\u2019s plainly addressed to you, both on the overleaf and the letter itself.\u201d She read the note. \u201cHow peculiar. Of course, I know what he\u2019s talking about. And so do you, Charlotte. So do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do! It\u2019s that mad Reeve whom you danced with all those years ago. The one you thought would offer you marriage and instead he hived off to the country, mad as a march hare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t make me sound like such a fool!\u201d Charlotte snapped.</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d her sister said, \u201cobviously His Grace is referring to Reeve. They must have been friends, and he wanted you to know that on his deathbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept,\u201d Charlotte said, \u201cthat Reeve\u2019s given name is Barnabe, not Benjamin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough,\u201d May said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it hardly matters if the duke is dead,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cYou should drop off your card,\u201d May said. \u201cThe duke was thinking of you\u2014of you, Charlotte\u2014practically on his deathbed. It\u2019s the least you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never understood that custom,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cWhat ser vice does it do the dead person when I drop my card at his house? What good is that, pray? Suddenly all the carriages line up outside a house and small bits of paper fly back and forth, but does the dead person sit up in his coffin and count his visitors? No, he does not!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are unaccountably strange,\u201d May said.

It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s odd.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte folded up the letter. \u201cI\u2019ll drop my card at Villiers\u2019s house on my way to buy some physic for the downstairs maid. Her face is swollen again, and Cook wants mustard to make up a poultice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could send Roberts,\u201d May observed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t ladylike for you to traipse off to the market for herbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an old maid, remember,\u201d Charlotte said, with an edge. \u201cAnd I need some fresh air. It\u2019s quite odd to receive a letter from someone who just died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what everyone will think of it! I just hope they don\u2019t think that you were as close to Villiers as you supposedly are to Beaumont!\u201d She laughed shrilly at the very idea and trotted off.</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t bother to change her dress. She was neatly attired in a simple blue sacque gown. It was neither particularly flattering nor particularly fashionable, but it served. She stared down at it for a moment, remembering how resplendent the Duke of Villiers always appeared, clothed in fantastically embroidered costumes. When he appeared at the party following that fatal duel, he looked white, but gorgeous.</p><p>It was so sad. And now she thought of it, sad for the Earl of Gryffyn as well. One had to suppose that he would have to flee the country now that his opponent had died.</p> <p>Stupid men and their stupid duels. The butler was nowhere to be seen, so she had Roberts hail her a hackney. She wasn\u2019t in a mood to wait for their ancient black carriage to be brought around from the mews so she could shamble down the street, all their genteel poverty revealed in every rusty spot on that carriage.</p><p>\u201cFifteen, Picadilly,\u201d she told the driver. When they pulled up in front of Villiers\u2019s town house she realized for the first time the problem with a hackney. There wasn\u2019t a footman to deliver her card. \u201cHere, driver!\u201d she called. \u201cWill you be so good as to deliver my card?\u201d</p><p>He tugged his cap and took the card obediently enough. She watched through the window as he trundled up to the door, his driver\u2019s cape blowing in a stiff wind. It wasn\u2019t proper; one\u2019s card should be delivered by a footman, but she couldn\u2019t get over the fact that Villiers was dead. Dead men presumably didn\u2019t care for niceties.</p><p>A butler answered the door and took the card, but when Charlotte expected the driver to trundle directly back to the carriage, he didn\u2019t do so. Instead a footman slipped past the butler and came down the path. He opened the door of the carriage.</p><p>\u201cIf you please,\u201d he said, bowing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve misunderstood,\u201d Charlotte said, feeling horribly embarrassed. Who knows what that foolish driver had told them? \u201cI didn\u2019t come to pay a call; I would never do that at this moment of turmoil. I didn\u2019t mean to disturb the house hold, so we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p> <p>The footman bowed again. \u201cYour presence is requested, madam.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte pursed her lips. But who could see anything untoward in visiting the house of a dead unmarried man, after all? A man who wasn\u2019t breathing could hardly be viewed as likely to steal one\u2019s virtue.</p><p>So she climbed out of the carriage and marched up to the house. The wind was unseasonably nipping and cold, and she arrived feeling as if her cheeks were red and her clothes all in a twist.</p><p>\u201cWe are very grateful for your call,\u201d a butler said, bowing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not visiting\u2014\u201d she began, but before she quite knew what was happening, her pelisse was gone and she was being bundled up the stairs. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to view the body!\u201d she said. And then, thinking the butler hadn\u2019t heard her, she stopped on the stair and said, \u201cI am not here for a viewing, if you please.\u201d</p><p>The butler turned at the head of the stairs and peered down at her. \u201cYou wish a viewing? A viewing of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish for a viewing,\u201d Charlotte said loudly.</p><p>\u201cA viewing?\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte sighed and climbed the rest of the stairs. The butler was obviously deaf, and likely under a great deal of pressure. She noticed, for example, that he hadn\u2019t managed to swath the house in black, which surely needed to be done as soon as possible. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in viewing the dead body,\u201d she said as loudly as she could, once she reached the top. \u201cThe duke\u2019s body. I\u2019m not here to view it.\u201d</p><p>The butler\u2019s mouth fell open, and through an open door at the right, she heard a low laugh. \u201cI haven\u2019t been put up for viewing yet, have I?\u201d It was unmistakably the Duke of Villiers\u2019s voice.</p><p>Charlotte clapped a hand to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIf you please, Miss Tatlock,\u201d the butler said, seemingly unperturbed. \u201cHis Grace is receiving visitors.\u201d</p><p>She backed up a step. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered in a horrified voice.</p><p>A man with an anxious rabbity face popped out of the bedchamber and grabbed her by the elbow as she was about to retreat down the stairs. \u201cMiss Tatlock, I really must insist. His Grace has been so very ill, you see, and he expressed a wish to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him!\u201d she said, in a low voice, keeping an eye on the door. \u201cI thought he was dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d the duke said from inside. \u201cSo you might as well come in, whoever you are. I\u2019m having a sane moment, thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>But the rabbity man leaned close and said, \u201cPlease, Miss Tatlock, as an act of charity. He hasn\u2019t requested a visitor in over a fortnight.\u201d</p><p>And then Charlotte realized that of course the poor duke must be just on the verge of expiring. She had never been one for succoring the sick and dying. But obviously one could not refuse the opportunity when offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send your carriage around the park,\u201d the valet said, at least acknowledging the social rules that Charlotte was about to break by entering the duke\u2019s bedchamber.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hackney,\u201d she said. \u201cJust send it away, if you please.\u201d</p><p>And she walked past him.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Fletch couldn\u2019t go home. In fact, he could never go home. Lady Flora was there; she was always there. His drawing room was filled with scented ladies and their delicate laughter. If he ventured home for dinner, the meal would be fraught with unfamiliar foods and servants he\u2019d never seen before. He had the impression that most of his house hold had left. The house smelled different: scented.</p><p>\u201cCandles,\u201d Quince told him when he asked. \u201cLady Flora feels that every room should have its own ambiance.\u201d</p><p>One had to suppose that was what made thresholds so unpleasant; one exited one ambiance only to be greeted by something quite different and yet equally sweet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Equally unpleasant was the fact that Lady Flora always seemed to know where he had been. He went to Pitt\u2019s quarters in the Inns of Court, and she was ready with a comment about Pitt\u2019s Indian policy. He went for a ride with Gill, and that evening she commented that Gill was getting a bit old for his short pants.</p><p>\u201cGill doesn\u2019t wear short pants!\u201d he snapped, wondering if she\u2019d gone mad.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s merely a gentle comment about the earl\u2019s need to grow up,\u201d she told him. \u201cI hear he tries to draw portraits, like a veritable maiden. One has to wonder whether he\u2019s even had a woman, if you will excuse the indelicacy.\u201d</p><p>He did mind the indelicacy, though there was no way to say such a thing. He didn\u2019t want an indelicacy from his mother-in-law. In fact, he didn\u2019t want to see her ever, not at breakfast, nor at luncheon, nor waiting up when he returned, breathing concern. But not curiosity\u2014never curiosity, because she always seemed to know what he was doing.</p> <p>Occasionally she would inform him, in passing, where she was going or the changes she had made to this or that room.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask Poppy?\u201d he asked once, when she informed him that she was changing the hangings in the east parlor to a rich persimmon.</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d she said, looking as startled as if he\u2019d mentioned King George himself. \u201cPoppy? Of course not.\u201d And she walked away, looking as if the ghost of a daughter fled before her.</p><p>Fletch couldn\u2019t help thinking it was peculiar.</p><p>It had been months since he\u2019d even seen Poppy. Though of course he wasn\u2019t really looking for her, because he was establishing\u2014trying to establish\u2014himself in the House of Lords. But he had been to every party worth noting and she was never there. Yet she was still living with Jemma. Or perhaps not. No one would tell him.</p> <p>He had received a discreet note from his banker, informing him of Her Grace\u2019s private account; of course he dispatched a large sum of money immediately. One did, when one\u2019s wife left. That is, none of his friends\u2019 wives had actually left, but he felt the etiquette of the situation was obvious.</p><p>The question\u2014the real question\u2014was what he should be doing with himself.</p><p>He knew what Poppy thought he was doing. He was supposed to be indulging himself in the company of women.</p><p>In reality, he was spending most of every day in the House of Lords. He was bent on making a name for himself, making a difference in government. Making a difference to his country.</p><p>His wife thought he was simply frolicking with courtesans. And she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The thought was searing.</p> <p>Why should Poppy care? She never liked making love to him. And now she said she never loved him at all.</p><p>So why should that bother him?</p><p>He was due to luncheon with Fox, at Mrs. Armistead\u2019s house. And he\u2019d heard rumors of lovely women and intimacies...</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>The Duke of Villiers\u2019s bedchamber looked like the back of a waterfall to Charlotte: all dim and silvery with just a few candles strewn about. In the middle of the room was a resplendent bed, hung with watered gray silk embroidered with bluebells.</p><p>Villiers was lying against the pillows, looking very white and stark. His cheekbones were always pronounced; May had once proclaimed him alarmingly handsome, and Charlotte had thought it a fair comment. But now his skin seemed translucent. He waved a hand in greeting, and Charlotte saw it was painfully thin, his knuckles sharp-cut. A rush of pity gripped her.</p><p>\u201cPlease do me the honor of sitting,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for paying me a call.\u201d</p> <p>The manservant rushed forward with a chair and she sat.</p><p>Villiers didn\u2019t say another word, just looked at her. Charlotte was suddenly aware of every aspect of herself, of her windblown brown hair, her reddened cheeks, the unexciting ruffle at the bottom of her prim gown. The room smelled like peppermint and lime-water.</p><p>\u201cWhat may I do for you, Your Grace?\u201d she asked, trying to keep her voice low and calm, as befitted a deathbed.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I expect,\u201d he said.</p><p>Funny: he didn\u2019t sound as if he were dying. He sounded faintly amused and just a bit tired. Charlotte risked another look at him.</p><p>He had closed his eyes. Oddly enough, he was even more beautiful when ill. His skin was so white that his lashes looked fantastically long and dark against his cheeks. \u201cSurely there must be something I can do, since you wrote me a letter,\u201d she said, finally.</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d There was a faint tone of surprise in his voice that nettled her and she started to rise.</p><p>\u201cPlease forgive me. I must have received the letter in error.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease stay. I\u2019m sure I did write to you. I remember it now.\u201d</p><p>She subsided, wondering what one said to a dying man.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you did write me, I am wondering why you told me that you missed Benjamin, and whether you meant Barnabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarnabe?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know a Barnabe. I meant Benjamin, the Duke of Berrow. In truth I believed I was sending a note to his widow, but somehow the letter went astray. My fever recurs in the afternoons, and my mind becomes horribly confused. There are too many B\u2019s involved here, Barnabe, Benjamin and Berrow. Not to mention Beaumont. We met at the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s dinner party, did we not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we did. And I would be glad to contact the duchess for you, Your Grace,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI could do it immediately. Shall I ask your man for some writing paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that young woman Beaumont has set up a flirtation with,\u201d Villiers said suddenly. \u201cLord Thrush wrote and said that you revised one of Beaumont\u2019s speeches to Parliament and he thought you made it better.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte felt a blush edging up her neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t revise it,\u201d she said. \u201cI merely gave His Grace an idea of how to structure it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t do that Your Grace and His Grace business here,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cSurely my man told you that I\u2019m dying?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a dying fish yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cI wonder that being on my deathbed hasn\u2019t made me any more charitable. I don\u2019t feel in the least like consigning myself to almighty powers and turning myself over to good works, you know. Not in the least. My doctors have been telling me that I\u2019m dying for weeks now, and I haven\u2019t heard even a single note of the heavenly choir in my ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou show a great deal of confidence in the opinion of your doctors,\u201d Charlotte observed.</p><p>He smiled faintly. \u201cMy doctor would be much affronted if I decided to live. I have the distinct impression that he thinks one should only act under proper medical advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I suggest that you live just to affront them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent suggestion. If I weren\u2019t so tired, I would take it seriously. I\u2019m not used to visitors, you know. You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve seen in months, other than my valet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family?\u201d she ventured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one. I expect it would be even more tiring to die while people weep around you. You, on the other hand, show a refreshing lack of sentiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you that I would be tearful if I knew you a bit better,\u201d Charlotte said, smiling. It was hard not to like the phlegmatic way he was approaching the whole subject. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe must remain strangers then. Tell me something interesting, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a stranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The best strangers are the ones who tell you intimate truths about themselves and then are never met again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met that sort of stranger,\u201d Charlotte said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a woman and so they never let you alone. I spent a number of years on the continent. It\u2019s amazing what strangers will tell you if you\u2019re trapped together in a sandstorm, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in a sandstorm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if I were I would babble all my most intimate secrets, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any intimate secrets,\u201d Charlotte said, a little sadly. \u201cI wish I had, if only to enliven the conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re flirting with Beaumont, for one. Are you in love with him?\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte didn\u2019t think his eyes were condemning, just tired and curious. \u201cA bit,\u201d she said. \u201cBut really only because there\u2019s no one else to be in love with. He listens to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a politician. If he\u2019s listening to you, it\u2019s because you\u2019re useful to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. But I\u2019d rather be useful to him than useful to no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhereas I quite like being useful to no one. Of course, that does lead to disconcertingly empty bedchambers. I suppose if I\u2019d made myself useful to a woman I\u2019d have a flock of children in here now.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte glanced around. The room was exquisitely elegant and thoroughly male. The only accoutrement was a hairbrush, its handle covered in the same color as the walls.</p><p>\u201cI agree with your tactful silence,\u201d his deep voice said from the bed. He had his eyes closed again. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine children with me or me with children. What about you? Did you want children?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead yet!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWell, in terms of the ton I expect you practically are,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou\u2019re all of, what, twenty-six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six and you\u2019re engaged in a very public flirtation with a very married man...unless you\u2019d like to have an illegitimate son to a duke...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re offering,\u201d she snapped. She was stinging all over from his matter-of-fact assessment.</p><p>\u201cAlas, my candle is quite limp. Even your manifest charms couldn\u2019t light it at this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be rude. Just because you\u2019re dying doesn\u2019t mean that you must indulge yourself at my expense.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes very wide. \u201cIn truth, I didn\u2019t mean to do so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you did. I know perfectly well that my nose is too long, and my face undistinguished. And my clothing is all very well, but hardly of the latest mode. I look like what I am: an old maid with a paltry dowry who will never have children.\u201d And with that she burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell,\u201d came from the bed.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>She was a lovely woman. She was plumply curvy, with a dimple in the middle of her right cheek that drew a man\u2019s eyes like a magnet. Her figure bounced in the right places.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t have blond hair. Fletch couldn\u2019t have an affaire with a woman with Poppy\u2019s hair color. It wouldn\u2019t be right. This woman was a brown-haired cousin of Elizabeth Armistead, who was Fox\u2019s consort.</p><p>Consort: it was a kinder word than prostitute. Mrs. Armistead was beautiful, but more stately than her cousin.</p><p>Fox was across the room, discussing strategy. Fletch hardly knew any of the men in the room, which made it easier. The wine was deep and rich and burned its way to his stomach. It was dark and intense, like Cressida\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m married, you know,\u201d she said, after they\u2019d been talking for a while.</p><p>\u201cAs am I,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she laughed. \u201cEveryone knows the marital circumstances of dukes. I know all about you. And your duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d he asked, suddenly protective.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a most estimable lady,\u201d Cressida said. \u201cActually my husband isn\u2019t bad either. He\u2019s a tailor. He lives in Suffolk and pretends that he doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m up to. And I always go home for Christmas, and sometimes in the summer, if I can bear to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been married for nine years,\u201d she said, finishing her drink. \u201cI was married out of the cradle, of course. But since the moment when I decided that I couldn\u2019t abide another conversation about satin or thread, I came to live here at St. Anne\u2019s Hill. A lady-in-waiting, I suppose you could call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place to live,\u201d Fletch said, glancing at the damasked walls.</p><p>\u201cFox treats her very well,\u201d Cressida said. \u201cBut in case you\u2019re wondering, I\u2019m not available for this sort of arrangement. I\u2019m a lady-in-waiting, and not in waiting for a protector, not matter how noble.\u201d</p><p>Fletch laughed. He couldn\u2019t help liking her, with her odd flaring black brows. She wasn\u2019t entirely beautiful, but she was frank and very funny.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a tour of the house?\u201d she asked.</p><p>For a moment it felt as if the world held its breath. And then Fletch\u2019s mouth opened, and he heard himself say, \u201cYes, of course. Of all things,\u201d and then she took his hand, and she was smiling at him and they left the room.</p><p>It was that easy.</p><p>And it was easy enough to find themselves in a bedchamber too, a beautiful one all hung with rose and pale green. Cressida kept laughing, and saying sarcastic funny little things, and somehow Fletch found he was kissing her.</p><p>It was all different from kissing Poppy. Of course. Her mouth was\u2014well, bigger and wet and\u2014</p><p>Fletch knew it wasn\u2019t going right. But of course, she didn\u2019t know that. And somehow it grew imperative to him that she not guess. So every time she reached out toward his breeches, he pulled back. He kept kissing her, though, and caressing her.</p><p>Somehow she had only her chemise on a short time later, and he was still kissing her, and caressing her.</p><p>He was miserable.</p><p>Sick feeling, really. Poppy had left him months ago.</p><p>By all rights, he should have been congratulating himself. All those nights when he\u2019d worried that he\u2019d never be able to satisfy a woman again were proven wrong. But finally Cressida reached out and he didn\u2019t roll to the side fast enough and her body stilled because she knew exactly what she was feeling. Or wasn\u2019t feeling, as the case may be.</p><p>\u201cOdds bucket,\u201d she said, pulling her hands back. \u201cWhat are you doing, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wish you wouldn\u2019t play your games with me,\u201d she said, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cI was having fun with you, and now you\u2019ve made me feel shabby. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re one of those that prefer men,\u201d she said gloomily, sitting up and pulling her stays toward her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The twist in her mouth showed that denial was a common event. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m married,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose this is the first time that you\u2019ve considered being unfaithful.\u201d Cressida was pinning up her hair now, sounding more resigned than angry.</p> <p>\u201cPractically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing. Most of the gentlemen I\u2019ve met are unfaithful before the ink\u2019s dry on their marriage lines. What\u2019s gone wrong, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been in love,\u201d she said, looking at him with a strange combination of pity and sharpness in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like bedding me.\u201d It actually felt good to say it out loud. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t say no, but she only suffers it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome women are like that. Mind you, every woman feels like that sometimes. Touch me and I\u2019ll scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never says that.\u201d</p><p>Cressida took the pins out of her mouth and said, \u201cSome women never like the act. We had one girl here like that. She just couldn\u2019t tolerate it after a while and then one day she ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t a brothel,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cWhy did she have to run away?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer that. \u201cIf you change your mind and decide that you would like a woman in your bed who can really pleasure you, you know how to find me. And I\u2019m a bargain compared to some of those trollops out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She turned around and laughed at him. \u201cYou believed me?\u201d</p><p>He saw her with different eyes.</p><p>\u201cDuke,\u201d she said to him, \u201chow would a woman like me support myself in my old age? Do you think I can just traipse back to my husband any day of the week and he\u2019ll take me in? Oh, I go there for Christmas because he has to let me in as it would disappoint the boys too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of them.Smart little poppets.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to ask questions, though. I need to find a protector, one like Fox. One who will support me and buy me a house. Then maybe the boys could come to me, or I could visit them in a carriage. My husband would respect that.\u201d</p><p>Fletch thought it was unlikely that her husband would ever let his sons visit their fallen mother.</p><p>Perhaps she read it in his eyes; she turned away and poked the last pins in her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one, I can see that.\u201d She was gone before he could craft an offer. Did one give guineas? Or send jewelry later, by messenger?</p><p>He sat in the bedchamber and thought about jewelry. One sent jewelry, and had it arrive the next day, he decided. Even, or perhaps especially, when intimacies were disrupted.</p> <p>He went home before he remembered that Lady Flora would be waiting. She rustled forward to greet him. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said, holding out her hand. He bent to kiss it.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d she said. \u201cYou smell like roses, a woman\u2019s scent.\u201d</p><p>He straightened hastily. But she was smiling at him as if he\u2019d achieved something. Fletch cautiously moved backward.</p><p>\u201cI hope I do not insult by my candor,\u201d she told him, her blue eyes glinting in the candlelight. \u201cIt is my opinion that every young gentleman should find a female libertine who will entertain him. Some gentlemen seem to take longer to come to this realization than others.\u201d</p><p>Fletch gulped. Could she possibly be saying what she appeared to be saying? She was wearing a grotesquely high headdress, with ostrich feathers stretching feet above her head and brushing the candlelabra hanging from the ceiling. Alas, the candles were only lighted for formal occasions because otherwise she might have caught on fire.</p><p>An unkind thought, he told himself, and bared his teeth in an approximation of a smile.</p><p>\u201cI am glad to see some evidence that you\u2019re not one of our\u201d\u2014she tittered\u2014\u201cless than virile men. Every gentleman should have an Amazon of his own.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou do understand me, don\u2019t you, Your Grace?\u201d she smiled at him and Fletch thought he\u2019d never seen a woman who more resembled a wolf. \u201cMy daughter should not have to bear the burden of your dissolute desires. Perhaps the lady who scented her person and thus yours can become a regular habit for you. That might be enough to persuade my daughter to return to your side.\u201d</p><p>Fletch swallowed his rage and bowed again. \u201cI had no idea that my wife was quite so anxious for me to find female company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but men are so selfish, are they not?\u201d</p><p>She paused, which seemed to imply he was supposed to answer. \u201cNot to my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She raised a delicately arched eyebrow. \u201cOf course, those who are most selfish generally do not see themselves as such, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say, madam. Would you consider yourself to be selfish, for example?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cIn every sense of the word. To be selfish is to be self-interested. There is only one area in which I would not consider it a weakness and a distraction to think of another above myself: and that is where my daughter is concerned. For her sake, and only for her sake, do I put myself to such discomfort as to reside with you.\u201d She paused, and added, \u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>She hates me, Fletch thought. Well, the feeling is mutual. \u201cI presume that your Herculean sacrifice is not intended to last forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my daughter, I put my own comforts to the side.\u201d She dropped into a chair, giving an excellent imitation of a lady overcome by cruel exigencies that had her living in a ducal mansion with some fifty-four servants at her beck and call.</p><p>\u201cThen do allow me to know how I could persuade you to return you to your former comforts,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy, is it not obvious?\u201d she said, smiling at him as genially as if they were at a tea party. \u201cYour marital intimacies are distasteful to my daughter. You appear to be incapable of producing an heir, but I strongly suggest that you leave that little problem to the side for a year or so. Poor Perdita has done such an excellent job of servicing your disordered desires. It\u2019s too much to ask her to pick out a suitable gentleman to play your part in the marital saddle at this point. Goodness,\u201d she said, looking rather pleased with herself, \u201cthat was harsh, wasn\u2019t it? I find that I am divided between the strongest pity for poor Perdita and the naturally homicidal feelings that any mother must feel in this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomicidal?\u201d Fletch said, sitting down and crossing his legs. \u201cDear me, I see that the situation is rather more urgent than I thought. I gather that my embracing of a courtesan would be a positive interest to my wife. I wonder that she didn\u2019t tell me this herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerdita?\u201d Lady Flora said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cYou think that dearest Perdita could bring herself to tell you? I call a spade a spade, Your Grace. My daughter is a weak-kneed fool, with a soft heart. She could not bear to tell you how disgusting you are to her. I consider it my prerogative as her mother to tell you of her feelings. I told her that you simply didn\u2019t realize the truth.\u201d</p><p>Fletch couldn\u2019t bring himself to reply. All those nights...he knew Poppy wasn\u2019t enjoying herself, but he never thought she was discussing things with her mother. The very idea made his skin crawl.</p><p>Lady Flora was not one to allow silence to grow. \u201cMen rarely understand these things,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course your bodies disgust those of the delicate sex. Our sensibilities are sweetly tuned; our bodies beautifully curved, as all the poets celebrate. How could you think that a lady would honestly desire intimacy with a hairy...Well. I leave Poppy\u2019s feelings to your imagination.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fletch rose and bowed. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, Lady Flora, I find that\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was looking at him with amusement. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to beg her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg her to come back. Tell her you finally found yourself a courtesan and you won\u2019t use her like a common washer-woman any more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shall certainly speak to my wife,\u201d Fletch said, resisting the impulse to commit homicide. Though who he wanted to kill\u2014his mother-in-law or his wife\u2014he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cWhen Perdita agrees to return to your house, I shall naturally return to my own,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cThat should provide you with some impetus, should it not? I expect you wonder why I am so active in Perdita\u2019s behalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d he ground out, \u201cgiven your self-proclaimed selfishness\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him finish, of course. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Perdita should reside much longer with the Duchess of Beaumont. You do remember how my poor daughter fancied herself in love with you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move a muscle.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago. At any rate, she\u2019s a trifle weak in the head, my daughter, though it pains me to say it. If I leave her with that light-heeled duchess in Beaumont House, she\u2019ll fall in love again\u2014and it won\u2019t be with you, Duke. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a romantic. Forever thinking that men are more interesting than they could possibly be. You know that strange hankering she has to attend meetings at the Royal Society?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has?\u201d</p><p>Lady Flora smirked at him. \u201cI gather you aren\u2019t spending much time talking to Perdita? You didn\u2019t know of her utter fascination with naturalists? Why do I even ask?\u201d</p><p>Fletch shook his head. He felt cold from head to foot. \u201cAre you implying\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet. But there\u2019s no saying now that she\u2019s moved out of your house into Beaumont House where God knows adultery is merely a fashionable vice, and one much indulged in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall speak to Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as she moves back into this house, I shall return to my establishment,\u201d Lady Flora said brightly. \u201cAlthough I might point out that the dearth of children produced by you in the past four years implies that the offspring of a young scientist might be just the thing to revitalize the family tree!\u201d</p><p>Fletch had never hated anyone so much in his entire life. The feeling went through his head like a wildfire. His fingers shook slightly with the wish to\u2014to\u2014</p><p>She rose and walked rather quickly to the door. \u201cI wish you good night, Your Grace,\u201d she said. And paused, turning her head in such a way that one of her ostrich plumes bent against the doorframe. \u201cI trust that you will not inform Perdita of our conversation. She, poor angel, hopes to drift through life without talking about unpleasantries. But relations between men and women are always unpleasant, don\u2019t you think? I find that candor is a healthy way to cope.\u201d</p><p>She walked through the door, finally, and from where he stood Fletch could see two feathers proudly rearing to the ceiling and one hanging drunkenly over one ear. Which served her right.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Back at the Duke of Villiers\u2019s town house</p> <p>\u201cYou ought to be sorry,\u201d Charlotte said, hiccupping. \u201cYou are unkind, and the fact that you\u2019re dying is no excuse. I don\u2019t believe that you are, anyway. Dying people think of their immortal souls and speak kindly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he said, \u201cmy brain has turned to rubbish. Likely my soul has given up, knowing that I\u2019ll be shoveling coal down in Beelzebub\u2019s furnaces.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and wiped her nose with her handkerchief. \u201cWell, I must be leaving,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has been utterly charming, and I\u2019m so grateful that I was able to succor you in your last hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t go yet.\u201d He actually started to struggle up in bed.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re too weak to sit up. I certainly shall leave. I don\u2019t know you very well. I am sorry you\u2019re dying, but you obviously don\u2019t want me to read you Bible verses\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t offered,\u201d he put in.</p><p>\u201cWell, that is the comfort generally offered to patients in your condition.\u201d She stood up. \u201cI wish you the very best, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you must stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a huge mistake coming here, and you never wanted to see me anyway. Then I made a greater fool of myself and I think that I really have had enough humiliation for the day. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte got herself out the door and down the stairs before he could say another word. \u201cA hackney,\u201d she told one of the four footmen in the hallway.</p><p>She occupied herself until the footman returned by staring at the marble statues strewn around the entryway.</p><p>Villiers was strangely appealing. Perhaps all dying people were. But appealing or not, he had no call to make her feel so wretched.</p><p>Though he said nothing that wasn\u2019t the truth.</p><p>She almost turned to go back and tell him so when the front door opened and she left. It was better anyway.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>September 20</p><p>The Royal Society met at Somerset House. Jemma and Poppy arrived before its welter of brick archways and white marble walls, Jemma still protesting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to find it fascinating,\u201d Poppy told her. \u201cI\u2019ve read about Mr. Moorehead for years. He\u2019s travelled to the very edges of the world.\u201d</p><p>Jemma groaned. She groaned even louder when the first person they saw was Miss Tatlock, who was greeting people at the entrance to the society\u2019s chambers. Miss Tatlock smiled at them quite as if she wasn\u2019t notoriously in love with Jemma\u2019s husband.</p><p>\u201cThis is such a pleasure, Your Graces,\u201d she said. \u201cI am certain that you will find Mr. Belsize\u2019s talk incantatory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncantatory?\u201d Jemma whispered as they made their way into a large room, already crowded with people. \u201cWhat a jackass she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma!\u201d Poppy exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Poppy, didn\u2019t you think that she\u2019s revolting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cShe looks like a most intelligent young woman to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevolting,\u201d Jemma said with a shudder. She sat down and unfolded the paper Miss Tatlock had handed them. \u201cThe evening opens with a discussion of male tamarin monkeys. Excellent. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by short, hairy males.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Poppy said, elbowing her.</p><p>\u201cAnd then a lively debate between Mr. Brownrigg and Mr. Pringle regarding the question of whether Adam and Eve had bellybuttons. Poppy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s an interesting question,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cBut look, after that Mr. Moorehead will talk about his recent travels in Africa. That will be fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cGoodness, there are a lot of people here. There\u2019s Lord Strange. Do you think I ought to ask him to sell me the rest of the chess set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the window.Talking to that exquisite young woman.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, leaning against a beautifully arched stone window was a hawk-faced man, lean and excitable looking. He was talking to a young woman whose hair was more gold than Poppy\u2019s and whose lips were definitely redder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cI did warn you,\u201d Jemma said cheerfully. \u201cSo, do you think that he would sell me the rest of the chess set?\u201d</p><p>Just then Strange turned away and looked over the room. His eyes slid over Poppy and Jemma without hesitating, as if they were no more than potatoes waiting to be planted.</p><p>Poppy turned to Jemma. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t sell them to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you are prepared to bargain intimacies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy, you surprise me! I thought you were such an innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not blind to the fact that some men are uninterested in respectable women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all accounts he loved his wife dearly. She died after the birth of their child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe had a wife?\u201d</p><p>Jemma nodded and turned away to greet a friend, so Poppy sat there and thought about the fact that a nobleman notorious for his illicit liaisons had apparently desired his wife and loved his wife. But she was learning that this wasn\u2019t a fruitful way to think\u2014so she banished all thought of Fletch, at least until he bowed before her.</p><p>For a moment she just gaped up at him. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could say the same for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea you were interested in scientific matters, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>She rose, finally, and dropped a curtsy, wishing that Jemma would return, but Jemma had drifted away into a cloud of chattering noblemen. \u201cThis is my first visit,\u201d she said. And then: \u201cCould you leave, Fletch. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause this is very awkward,\u201d she hissed, sitting down.</p><p>He promptly sat down beside her.</p><p>\u201cJemma is sitting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot possibly be interested in things of this nature,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cAnd I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I would feel awkward if you were here. Please, may I ask you as a favor to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may ask but I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d He scowled at her and folded his arms. \u201cAfter all, you said we were to be friends.\u201d</p> <p>Poppy felt a pulse of anxiety that he was irritated. She gave herself a mental shake and said brightly, \u201cThen of course you\u2019re welcome to stay. Surely your friend Gill must be here? Isn\u2019t he coming to greet me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not here. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you never do anything without Gill?\u201d she suggested. \u201cBecause if you\u2019re at an intellectual pursuit, it must be an interest of Gill\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite an insult,\u201d he said in a very even tone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean it to be. Look, there\u2019s Dr. Loudan, and since I explicitly asked him to come, I must greet him. If you\u2019ll excuse me, Fletch.\u201d</p><p>She was gone.</p><p>Fletch stared after her in dumbfounded surprise. When he pictured meeting Poppy, he didn\u2019t imagine her prancing away from him. Or smiling up at a young man with a long nose and...Fletch felt his fists curl and he was on his feet before he realized it.</p><p>He walked through the crowd and eased behind Poppy where she couldn\u2019t see him. For some reason he was quite certain that she wouldn\u2019t welcome his presence.</p><p>\u201cI found the notes you sent me on the sloth\u2019s hind feet fascinating,\u201d she was telling this Dr. Loudan. He was short. Well, perhaps he wasn\u2019t short but he was shorter than Fletch. I could take him, Fletch thought contemptuously. Then, eyeing his shoulders, it would be a fair fight too.</p><p>But I could take him.</p><p>I will take him, said a thrumming beat in his head as he watched the scientist beam at Jemma. They appeared to be talking about sea otters. What did Poppy know of otters? Oddly, she seemed to know quite a lot, given that she was comparing the beasts to common English river otters.</p><p>Five minutes later, Poppy hadn\u2019t looked up from Dr. Loudan\u2019s face as he droned on and on about otters.</p><p>Fletch fell back a pace. As far as he could tell, she hadn\u2019t even glanced at him. He sat down, folded his arms, and waited.</p><p>Sure enough, as the audience began to tumble into their places, she made her way back to him, fussing a bit about where Jemma would sit.</p><p>\u201cJemma,\u201d he said, \u201chas made a new friend in Lord Strange. Wait until Beaumont hears that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Strange has an astounding collection of curiosities,\u201d Poppy told him. \u201cI understand that he mostly collects art, but he has a number of fascinating scientific relics as well. I would give anything to see his collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you within a furlong of his estate,\u201d Fletch hissed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what goes on there, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the word for it is orgies. I read all about them in a history of ancient Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you don\u2019t think that I\u2019d be tempted to join the festival?\u201d she asked him. The edges of her lips tipped up but there was no humor there.</p><p>Fletch opened his mouth but no words came out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d Poppy said coolly. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing you should be celebrating, Fletch. I\u2019m unlikely to cuckold you, after all.\u201d There was something so bleak in her eyes that Fletch\u2019s heart dropped in his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned her head away and waved at Jemma, who had seated herself on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of cuckoldry,\u201d Fletch said, fumbling for words. \u201cBut Strange is a dissolute man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dissolute,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI used to think that any man who took a mistress was dissolute. My sort of rank na\u00efvet\u00e9 exists only to be dispelled, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>At the front of the room, Mr. Moorehead was starting a discussion of a tribe called the Karamojong, who lived in Africa. Poppy and Fletch sat silently beside each other.</p><p>\u201cThat was appallingly boring,\u201d Fletch said when it was over.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Poppy said coolly. \u201cI intend to buy his No Room in the Ark at my first opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a nursery rhyme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have initiated a standing subscription for all travel and nature titles at Lackington\u2019s. You pay for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never discussed books like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth would we have to discuss? Unless you\u2019ve been hiding an interest in natural discoveries?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth but she wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cI assure you that if I read an article about new designs for clocks on stockings or a revolution in satin embroidery, I will be sure to draw it to your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rarely remind me of your mother,\u201d Fletch said, \u201cbut all of a sudden I see a resemblance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine that sort of event must be rather frequent, since you are living with her. How is everything with my dearest mama? I knew we\u2019d get around to speaking of her. There had to be some reason you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to talk about your mother!\u201d He almost bellowed it.</p><p>\u201cYou surprise me,\u201d she said. But the so-called \u201clively debate\u201d on the stage was quickly degenerating into a mud-slinging match between two bearded antiquarians. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since Poppy didn\u2019t look any more interested in Eve\u2019s bellybutton than he was\u2014although who knew, given all the secrets she\u2019d kept\u2014Fletch felt free to continue their conversation under cover of the choleric debate.</p><p>\u201cGod would never have placed false evidence on Adam\u2019s body,\u201d Mr. Brownrigg stated, looking as if he\u2019d addressed the point with the Almighty just last week.</p><p>\u201cYour mother seems fine,\u201d he hissed at Poppy. \u201cBut how are you?\u201d</p><p>She listened intently to Mr. Pringle\u2019s infuriated response to Brownrigg and turned to Fletch with a brilliant smile. \u201cI\u2019m having a marvelous time,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t remember being so happy in my life. I trust you are just as happy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cGod has no need for false history,\u201d Mr. Brownrigg said, going head to head and jowl to jowl with his opponent.</p><p>\u201cJemma says that you gave a speech in the House of Lords,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cWhat was it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was about Pitt\u2019s fitness for the position of First Lord of the Treasury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were interested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was an utter disaster.\u201d</p><p>She finally turned her head to look at him. \u201cWhat do you mean? The paper reported that your speech was extremely lively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLively, it was. And well received by the opposition,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cHalfway through I began arguing for my opponent\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d</p><p>Poppy gasped and\u2014to do her credit\u2014managed not to smile. \u201cHow on earth did you do that, Fletch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLordTemple asked me to present his point of view, and I thought it would be easy. Then halfway through my speech I realized that I didn\u2019t quite agree with the line of argument I was making\u2014so I turned it around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d He grinned a little, remembering. \u201cI thought wigs were going to start steaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have never thought it of you,\u201d Poppy said, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat part of it? Making a hash of the speech? From what you said earlier, I\u2019d think that was a natural for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking in Parliament. I never thought you cared about that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing but the color of my coat?\u201d</p><p>She was starting to look a bit guilty. \u201cI know that you take excellent care of the estate, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed it,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt became a farce, of course, when I realized that I was arguing the wrong side, but my fault: I should have taken the time to think it through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that took courage,\u201d Poppy said, touching him on the arm. \u201cAdmitting you were wrong, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t admit it,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cI just talked so much that no one had the faintest idea what precisely I said until I rounded into my conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam was formed from dust with no scars!\u201d one of the antiquarians said with huge emphasis.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished,\u201d Poppy whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? My guess is that they could go all night. They really hate each other, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t think so. I believe it\u2019s staged. Why, in the last issue of Philosophical Transactions, Mr. Brownrigg quoted Mr. Pringle and said that his treatise on the trochus shell was one of the best of its kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the trochus shell?\u201d Fletch asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I ordered the treatise on that basis, but I didn\u2019t find it very interesting. Pringle argued that the concentric rings on the shell indicated the number of seasons a clam had lived.\u201d</p><p>Fletch just blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cThat suggests that a clam grows a new ring every year,\u201d Poppy explained to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be,\u201d she said.</p><p>On the stage Brownrigg and Pringle were glaring at each other in one final burst of scientific fury before they stamped off. Watching them, Fletch guessed that Poppy was right and they were about to retreat into some back room to swig a glass of brandy together. The whole event was like an odd shadow of debates in the House of Lords.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were interested in shells and slothes and that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him, obviously puzzled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t interested in the concentric rings on shells, are you, Fletch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014you were in love with me!\u201d For some reason, Fletch had the strongest desire to say it. To tell her again. To make her take back what she said before.</p><p>Her eyes were clear and blue. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really, Fletch. We already discussed that. Neither of us was really in love. And anyway, this is\u2014this is different from all of that life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat life?\u201d Fletch felt as if he were desperately grasping at straws, trying to understand a foreign language.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2014this is my pleasure,\u201d Poppy said, looking around. \u201cDon\u2019t you see how interesting it is?\u201d</p><p>Fletch looked around. The room was shabby and crowded, mostly with men but with a fair sprinkling of ladies. To the right several people were having a spirited discussion of flying squirrels.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t really fly,\u201d a short plump man said, jutting his round plump chin forward. He had rusty colored hair that began somewhere around the middle of his head. If Fletch had ever seen a man in need of a wig, it was he.</p><p>\u201cYes, they do,\u201d a big-boned man replied.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a professor,\u201d Poppy whispered, nodding toward the second speaker.</p><p>Fletch noticed her eyes were shining and grunted.</p><p>\u201cDr. Fibbin proved without a shadow of a doubt that squirrels can fly a distance of forty to fifty feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFibbin is a fool,\u201d the half-bald one said.</p><p>Though he hated to admit it, Fletch agreed with him.</p><p>\u201cThey have a stuffed flying squirrel at the AshmoleonMuseum in Oxford,\u201d Poppy said, settling back beside Fletch. \u201cI have written for an appointment, and I\u2019m going to the museum in December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019ve been doing?\u201d Fletch said, dumbfounded. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you at any parties. You\u2019ve been going to museums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cThat is, I haven\u2019t yet. But I mean to. You know, the only time my mother allowed me to visit Somerset House was for a lecture on the customs of polite society, even though the Royal Society was meeting here at precisely the same time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re married,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cYou could have visited a museum any damn day you please, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I can,\u201d she said. \u201cHush, Fletch. Mr. Belsize is going to speak.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Belsize did speak. And speak. But Fletch just sat there, staring at the worn carpet and wondering why Poppy never felt free to go to a museum, and why he never knew that she wanted to go to a museum. A tiny thread in the back of his mind was also thinking about the upcoming debate in the House over Fox\u2019s East India bill.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not traveling to Oxford with Jemma,\u201d he said, as Mr. Belsize gulped a little water.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having my wife trot around outside London without me,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked at him with clear amusement in her eyes. \u201cFletch, if I want to go to Paris by myself, I will do so. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to Oxford,\u201d he said, folding his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy, if you don\u2019t let me escort you to Oxford, I\u2019ll tell your mother that you\u2019re suffering from a rare blood disorder and you need her by your side.\u201d</p> <p>She narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cI should have known this would all come back to my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn more ways than one,\u201d he muttered, and settled back into his chair. Mr. Belsize, refreshed, had launched into another lengthy tirade.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>On close observation, Jemma discovered that Lord Strange was as sleekly dressed as Fletch, and perhaps even more elegant.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, sweeping her a bow.</p> <p>\u201cLord Strange,\u201d she said, curtsying.</p><p>\u201cWhat an honor that you came to speak to me,\u201d Strange said. \u201cI see so little of proper women these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew your wife,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cSally was a dear friend.\u201d</p><p>His eyes changed instantly. \u201cSurely you were not sent to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Sally\u2019s godmother, Lady Fibblesworth, was a great friend of my family, and we happily visited as children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Fibblesworth was an admirable woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jemma agreed. \u201cSally used to visit us regularly until I married and then left for Paris. I wasn\u2019t in En gland when she made her debut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never really debuted. I was too wild, so they married me off. It was the luckiest day of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry that she is no longer alive.\u201d</p><p>He hunched a little. \u201cI share your feelings.\u201d</p><p>They appeared to have finished that conversation, so Jemma tried a different tack. \u201cDo you play chess, Lord Strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She liked his brevity. Good chess players rarely squealed about their abilities.</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014he added\u2014\u201cwhen I last played Philidor, he told me that you were the only person who has beaten him three games in a row. I have only beaten him once or twice, so you might not wish to waste your time with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou played against Philidor?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLast year in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must have a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only play when I\u2019m at Fonthill or in Paris.\u201d</p><p>Fonthill was famous for its beauty, three hundred acres that had been decorated at ruinous expense. Except that for a man with Strange\u2019s fortune, nothing is ruinous. But she said: \u201cFonthill? You must forgive me; I\u2019ve lived out of the country for the past eight years. Is that your residence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. You know, you\u2019re quite interesting, for one of your sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make a habit of never returning compliments of that nature. Men are so prone to thinking they are more interesting than the common run of their sex, when invariably they are nothing out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow raised in appreciation. \u201cI suppose I deserved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect we all deserve a great deal that we are not served.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to play chess with you. A shame. But it is one of my foibles: I don\u2019t play a game of chess that doesn\u2019t occur at Fonthill or Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall have to live without the experience then,\u201d she murmured, letting a little edge tell him what she thought of his foibles and his vanity.</p><p>But he surprised her and laughed. \u201cI could invite you to Fonthill, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lovely prospect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirtuous married women never visit me. Let me see. Could it be that I\u2019ve heard rumors implying that you are not quite so...virtuous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumors,\u201d she said sweetly, letting her eyes slide to the golden-haired lady standing to his right like a clothes-peg waiting to be animated. \u201cThey can be so imprecise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet often so accurate,\u201d he said, grinning at her. He was truly charming when he chose to be. \u201cI leave for Fonthill tomorrow. Perhaps you\u2019d like to pay a visit, Your Grace? I can promise you a great deal of entertainment, especially during the Christmas season.\u201d</p><p>Poor Beaumont\u2019s political reputation would never survive such a visit on her part. \u201cWhile I\u2019d never discount the pleasure of playing chess with you, I would like to discuss another matter. I bought a chess piece from Mr. Grudner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought the queen, did you? The African Queen, I call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should dearly love to buy her counterparts.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and then swept a grand bow. \u201cHas no one told you how remarkably obstinate I am? One doesn\u2019t reach my place in life without nurturing stubbornness. When you visit Fonthill, Your Grace, they will be a gift from your host. In the meantime, I would suggest that you make the acquaintance of Mrs. Patton.\u201d He nodded toward a tall woman standing in the middle of a group. \u201cShe is the only woman admitted to the London Chess Club. Presumably you could join her in those august ranks, and play chess whenever you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall certainly introduce myself,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cYou do know what they say about reputation, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say so much. One can hardly catalog it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fair hit! I like to think of reputation as nothing more than a second maidenhead.\u201d</p><p>Jemma smiled faintly. \u201cAs with virginity...the loss quickly suffered and the fruits enjoyed thereafter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely! I lost my reputation years ago. \u2019Twas naught but a word; the word is gone; the pleasure lingers.\u201d He bowed.</p><p>He was devilishly charming. If it weren\u2019t for her husband\u2019s reputation and the promises she\u2019d made, she\u2019d go to Fonthill in a minute. Strange had thrown down the gauntlet and it nettled her not to take it up.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think she\u2019d visit Fonthill. She saw it in his eyes, the faint disparagement, the unnecessary compliment.</p><p>It fired her with the wish to throw societal rules to the wind and pay him a visit. But how could she possibly go to that estate, with its scandals and daily parties, if the stories were true? She couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t do that to Beaumont.</p><p>Her French friends would have shrieked with laughter at her concern. They viewed husbands and honor subjects of interest to wives of the bourgeois. Somehow life was much more complicated in London than when she was gadding about the French court.</p><p>Jemma had lost the ability to be intimidated years ago. She had arrived in Paris as a young duchess without a husband, made her way to Versailles and began winning chess matches against Frenchmen. Any one of these three circumstances would be enough to daunt most ladies. But not, she was proud to think, a member of the Reeve family.</p><p>Thus it was quite interesting to discover that she felt just the slightest bit intimidated by Mrs. Patton. There was no obvious reason for it. Mrs. Patton was a slender woman with brown hair, rather eccentrically dressed, which fact alone ought to give Jemma a sense of superiority.</p><p>Most of the ladies in the room were wearing gowns with short ruffles and side bustles of one size or another, but Mrs. Patton had no curls, no ruffles and no bustles. Instead she was wearing a thigh-length jacket, shaped to her figure. Underneath the jacket was a periwinkle blue skirt that flared into long folds in the back. The final touch was the opening at the front of the jacket...which parted to reveal a waistcoat. A waistcoat! Jemma suddenly felt entirely too ruffled and belaced and beribboned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The group surrounding Mrs. Patton turned out to be discussing bookplates and typefaces, none of which Jemma knew the faintest thing about. Finally the discussion of barth-cast fonts (what ever they were) ended, and Mrs. Patton turned to Jemma. \u201cYour Grace, I have been longing to meet you,\u201d she said with a roguish smile. \u201cI have heard so much of your prowess at chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I the same of you,\u201d Jemma said, bowing slightly.</p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019m at your level. I was roundly beaten by Philidor last year when he visited London. But he told me of you, and fired my wish to have you be my compatriot at Parsloe\u2019s. Rather than cede my place in the London Chess Club to you, I am hopeful that we could be the only two of our sex in the chosen one hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it awkward being the only woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t find it uncomfortable. Occasionally a topic is broached that I find tedious, such as the relative merits of a given opera dancer. I find that a quick comment about the difficulties of swollen breasts while nursing children will return gentlemen to awareness of my presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I have nursed no children,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cI shall have to echo you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am certain that you can come up with your own topics by which to distress their sensibilities,\u201d Mrs. Patton said. \u201cMen are so hideously sensitive, you know. It\u2019s easy to throw them off their stride. I try not to do it while playing chess, of course, though sometimes one cannot help taking the advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would relish seeing you discomfit my husband. In fact, I would love to see you play him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but the Duke of Beaumont is a politician. That\u2019s another breed altogether.\u201d Mrs. Patton\u2019s smile was wry. \u201cI doubt that he plays chess with mere mortals. If he is half as busy as the papers make him out to be, he has little time for games.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am thinking of gathering a house party at Christmas time,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI should dearly love to both play you at chess and watch you vanquish my husband. I believe I would bet on you over a politician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am honored by your invitation,\u201d Mrs. Patton said, looking ready to refuse.</p><p>\u201cOh please,\u201d Jemma broke in. \u201cIt is months away; you can hardly do me the discourtesy to cry an earlier invitation. I have just returned from eight years in Paris, you know, and I have discovered few people with whom to play chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d Mrs. Patton said, \u201cand here I was under the impression that you had monopolized the market when it came to chess masters. Your paired matches with your husband and Villiers are being rather widely celebrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never played a woman with ability at chess, and I must confess to an unbearable curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fancy I shall find myself matched in cunning,\u201d Mrs. Patton said.</p> <p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI travel with children. Children and\u2014how could I forget\u2014a husband as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would all be welcome. One must have children about to truly enjoy Christmas, so yours will fill a need. We shall have a magnificent Twelfth Night party and put a bean in everyone\u2019s slice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you show yourself to be no mother,\u201d Mrs. Patton observed cheerfully. \u201cIt would be the Slaughter of the Innocents as they fought over who got the largest bean and thus got to be King for the Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cI shall promise to manipulate things so that you, dear Mrs. Patton, are Queen of the Pea, if you will come.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Patton laughed. \u201cThe chance to play chess and be queen, if illicitly gained? It\u2019s hard to resist. I expect my husband will be agreeable, but if he is not, I shall send you my regrets on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>Jemma adored her utter lack of fawning attention. She swept a deep curtsy, a duchess-to-duchess curtsy. \u201cIt will be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 30</p> <p>The Duke of Villiers to Miss Charlotte Tatlock November 20, 10 of the clock</p><p>Are you still angry at my rudeness? It has been months and I find myself still tied to this bed. In desperation I write to ask if you would read me Bible verses. Such wit and beauty as you have should apply itself to doing miracles, and I\u2019m sure such an influx of heavenly influence would be miraculous. My footman will wait for your answer.</p><p>Miss Charlotte Tatlock to the Duke of Villiers ByReturn</p><p>You are the most fantastical and unkind man to make fun of me. I leave it to you to judge what our heavenly Savior would think of your behavior.</p><p>P.S. I am truly sorry to hear that you are still unwell.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers to Miss Charlotte Tatlock 11:30 of the clock</p><p>I meant no unkindness. Please come talk to me. I am here with no one but the butler and the servants and some mice who squeak mightily in the night.</p><p>Miss Charlotte Tatlock to the Duke of Villiers ByReturn</p><p>Your solitude is obviously the reward for a life ill-spent.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers to Miss Charlotte Tatlock 1:00 of the clock</p><p>You are far too kind to be as priggish as you sound. I am like to die of the tedium. And I have to add that there is many a hanger-on feverish to be admitted to my bedchamber.</p><p>Miss Charlotte Tatlock to the Duke of Villiers ByReturn</p><p>Admit them. You have nothing to lose, and I have much to gain.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers to Miss Charlotte Tatlock 2:30 of the clock</p><p>Cruelty, thy name is Charlotte. Don\u2019t leave me to the ill entertainment of such as choose to visit. They come mawkishly only so they can describe my dying sighs, and the pitiful things I spoke, and how white in the face I am. I am persuaded that none of them will tell me I\u2019m a pestilent knave, as you did.</p><p>Miss Charlotte Tatlock to the Duke of Villiers ByReturn</p><p>Their ignorance is no reason for my discomfort, not to mention the loss of my reputation.</p><p>Miss Charlotte Tatlock to the Duke of Villiers November 29 [nine days later], 10 of the clock</p><p>I venture this letter because I received the unhappy news of your death this morning. I am surprised to discover that I much hope that the tidings are untrue. I cannot help but write to inquire.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers to Miss Charlotte Tatlock By Return</p><p>I live chiefly out of spite. My man tells me that I have been credibly announced to be dead three times, and once buried. I thought you wanted no more of me?</p><p>Miss Charlotte Tatlock to the Duke of Villiers 11 of the clock</p><p>I want nothing of you, but it would sit ill on my soul if I scorned the opportunity to read you a Bible verse.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers to Miss Charlotte Tatlock November 30, 10 of the clock</p><p>My fever came on yesterday afternoon and prevented my reply. My coach waits, but please do not delay, as I\u2019m afraid the fever is my constant companion. Could you possibly pay me a visit now?</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>November 30</p><p>Fletch had taken a carriage into Hyde Park because he didn\u2019t want to go home. Lady Flora was always there, springing to meet him. Even the way she said \u201cYour Grace\u201d spoke of withering dislike. Though the worst was when she called him Duke, as if they were intimates. It was wearying. One had to suppose that Poppy\u2014who had never said a word of reproach to him about her mother\u2014encouraged her prolonged visit as some sort of revenge. It was a damned successful one.</p><p>Once in the park, he couldn\u2019t stand the small confines of the carriage and took himself out for a walk, though it was gray and drizzling.</p><p>He strolled along the Serpentine and watched gray water drops dimple the surface of the water. The rain was cold on his cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy didn\u2019t love him.</p><p>She had never loved him. Her dragonish mother had coerced her into the marriage. The emotion at their wedding had been all his, which laid painfully bare the reasons for their pitiful intimacies. She didn\u2019t love him; of course she didn\u2019t desire him.</p><p>The rain was suddenly hot on his face, a hot drop here, a cold drizzle there.</p><p>\u201cBut I loved her.\u201d Fletch said it out loud, into the silence of the gray rain. \u201cI was in love with her.\u201d That Christmas years ago in Paris was emblazoned in his memory. \u201cI loved her. I\u2014I\u2014\u201d But he stopped before he said that he still loved her.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want him in the most fundamental way. She told him to find a mistress.</p><p>He walked until his heart was as dreary as the sky, until some sort of truth came to him.</p><p>He must be cursed, because he still loved her. He loved his wife. Even so.</p><p>And that meant that he couldn\u2019t survive alone for five years as Poppy suggested. He couldn\u2019t lie awake in the middle of the night and wonder what she was doing, with whom was she dancing. Naturalists, for God\u2019s sake. Out of all the things her mother said, that stung the most.</p><p>Poppy was infatuated with that Dr. Loudan, for example. A skinny, weedy thing with a propensity for cutting up dead rodents for examination.</p> <p>He\u2019d spent years fashioning himself into someone he wasn\u2019t, all to catch her eye. But she wanted spectacles. He pulled off his hat, raised his head and the rain sluiced over his face, over his carefully tumbled locks, spotting his shirt, chilling his fingers.</p><p>He had to do something with his life, make himself into the kind of man whom she would admire. She would never desire him; he accepted that. The scorn he saw in her eyes as she compared him to the professor...that was a scorn he felt for himself.</p><p>Their awkward couplings would surely improve slightly with further practice, but they had little to do with the fierce desire he felt, with the way his body longed to make love to her.</p><p>Yet he wasn\u2019t the sort of man to be unfaithful. He couldn\u2019t take a courtesan, or even a lady, to bed. The truth was that he didn\u2019t want a mistress. He started walking again, letting the rain beat into the back of his neck.</p><p>He could survive without Poppy in his bed.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t survive without her in his life. She had to come home. He would promise that he\u2019d never visit her room until they decided to have children. And he would promise to stop sulking.</p> <p>He\u2019d spent the last few years sulking. He had to give Lady Flora credit for that observation. He\u2019d sulked because life hadn\u2019t turned out the way he thought it should. Enough. Enough thinking about French women, and women\u2019s desire in general. In fact, the hell with desire.</p><p>Monks did it, didn\u2019t they? He didn\u2019t need sex in order to be a man. What he needed\u2014what he needed was Poppy. Because for some strange, stupid reason, she felt like the coffee he drank in the morning.</p><p>He needed her.</p><p>He turned around and started back for the carriage. He would make himself into someone she would be proud of, someone who wasn\u2019t interested only in the cut of his coat and the sheen of his hair.</p><p>If he admitted the truth to himself, he wanted to be one of the most important men in the House of Lords. He wanted to make a difference to the country, to be a man whose words were feared and welcomed, like his father\u2019s had been.</p><p>Then he would dispense with Lady Flora, which would be his gift to Poppy.</p><p>And finally he would lure her back to the house, before Christmas came again.</p><p>And then somehow, someday, he would woo his wife into loving him the way she used to. The way she loved him that Christmas in Paris, when she looked at him as if he were the world to her.</p> <p>When she loved him.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>The Rose Salon, Beaumont House December 6</p><p>\u201cI shall not go to Oxford,\u201d Jemma explained, \u201cbecause you have a perfectly good husband who has offered to accompany you, Poppy. I don\u2019t wish to be unkind, but I haven\u2019t the faintest interest in three-toed rats or what ever it is you are going to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a frightful beast, taking you around to all these boring events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it if I didn\u2019t enjoy being with you. But the truth is that I don\u2019t want to go all the way to Oxford. I really don\u2019t. Mrs. Patton is taking me to the London Chess Club tomorrow and I have every intention of joining, if they\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you should. Then you can shame the men by beating them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are turning into a bloodthirsty little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have always been a bloodthirsty little thing,\u201d Poppy retorted. \u201cI have a perfect model in my mother. That\u2019s why Fletch wants to accompany me to Oxford. So he can get away from my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at this,\u201d Jemma said, holding up a piece of foolscap. \u201cI\u2019ve had a letter from Roberta, my sister-in-law; she says that a bear went amok on her father\u2019s estate and ate a couple of rare ducks. I must answer this. Darling, you will be all right without me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s Fletch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband,\u201d Jemma prompted. \u201cYou\u2019ve been married for years, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all different now. I don\u2019t feel in the least comfortable with him. We may well argue. And what\u2014what if he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Jemma said comfortably. \u201cAnd if he does, you can boot him out of the carriage. You\u2019re a bloodthirsty woman, remember? Think of your mother.\u201d</p><p>Poppy thought of her mother. If Fletch misbehaved in her presence, her mother would likely toss him from the carriage and send a chamber pot flying after him. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are very useful on these little trips,\u201d Jemma said, drifting out the door with a final blown kiss. \u201cIn case a wheel breaks or some such.\u201d</p><p>Poppy marched out to Fletch\u2019s carriage, trying hard to pretend she was her mother.</p><p>He looked up from the papers he was reading and gave her a careless smile, and it took all her strength to nip off her welcoming grin. She was not\u2014not\u2014going to smile at him like a lovesick puppy.</p><p>He peered at her. \u201cAre you all right, Poppy? You look stiff as a poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to say again that you needn\u2019t accompany me, Fletch. I\u2019m sure you have a lot to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll just drop you off at the house,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWith your mother? Not on your life. I brought my work with me.\u201d He rustled his documents.</p><p>Poppy subsided onto the opposite seat and eyed Fletch. He was already deep into the sheaf of papers. It was infuriating that he was so appealing. Deliberately, she made herself think about Dr. Loudan. Loudan listened to her. He thought she was intelligent. She thought about the letter she\u2019d written Loudan that very morning, suggesting that his claim about the so-called muskrat found in Ceylon might have been incorrect, if one took into account the study published three years ago by Dr. Farthing. The animal couldn\u2019t be a muskrat, as Loudan maintained. Her mouth curved up.</p><p>Fletch didn\u2019t look up, but he said, \u201cSo what are you grinning about, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Loudan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grunted but didn\u2019t say anything to that. Still, it gave Poppy a little jolt of satisfaction. His Grace Beautiful Fletcher had to understand that there were men in the world who cared more about muskrats than they did about gorgeous clothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can\u2019t read in the carriage as I grow quite nauseated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excruciatingly foolish treatise on the trade bill with France. The off-repeated point of twelve pages is that French brandy costs too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the author intend to do about that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhine and complain,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock to see how much paper is wasted by fellows in Lords, nattering on and on about inconsequentials. Now if I was going to argue this bill, I\u2019d focus on the situation of English farmers. I have to give extra payments every year to the men working around my estate; it\u2019s impossible to survive with the price of wheat being what it is. This trade bill should ignore the brandy and bar French wheat from our shores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do so?\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just flipped to the next page.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Poppy asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d It felt good to ask a belligerent question. It was so un-Poppy-like.</p><p>\u201cI made a fool of myself in the House in case you don\u2019t remember.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at her.</p> <p>Poppy laughed. She couldn\u2019t help it. He looked so adorably disgruntled. \u201cBut you turned the speech around, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one understood my speech. My party, that is, Fox\u2019s party, thinks I did a fine job. They seemed to have no idea that I changed my mind halfway through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy language was a bit convoluted. Only Beaumont seems to have grasped it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma\u2019s husband? Yes, he\u2019s very smart, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thanked me for striking a blow for his side,\u201d Fletch said morosely. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point if people don\u2019t listen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to follow long speeches. I find that they\u2019re much more intelligible if someone makes a fairly simple point and repeats it at least twice, like the author of your paper on brandy. I don\u2019t suppose your speech was simple, Fletch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could it be simple? It\u2019s a complicated topic. This idiot\u201d\u2014he shook the papers in his lap\u2014\u201cboiled the trade bill down to one idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you understood it immediately, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rest my case,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>He eyed her. \u201cYou know, you never used to disagree with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were married then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are still married!\u201d</p> <p>There was a flash of real anger in his eyes that she enjoyed. But she shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s different now.\u201d</p><p>He waited until they were at supper at the Fox and Hummingbird, and Poppy had stated her intention to retire to her chamber.</p><p>Then he just blurted it out, with no preparation. \u201cThe truth of it is that whether your mother arranged our marriage, or whether it was all an illusion, I must be horribly obtuse, because I can\u2019t talk myself out of being in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Poppy had risen; she plumped back into her seat knowing that the look of surprise on her face must be almost comic.</p><p>\u201cI know this sounds stupid, given the way you feel.\u201d He looked grumpy, the way men do when they\u2019re talking about emotions. \u201cBut I can\u2019t have you thinking that I don\u2019t love you. Because I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmp,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised his hand. \u201cI need to finish. I love you and so I want you to know that I understand. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to like physical intimacy, at least not with me, Poppy. I can accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she whispered. Her heart felt as if it had fallen into a black well. Her whole life she\u2019d tried not to disappoint people. And now she\u2019d disappointed Fletch. It made her want to fling herself from the window.</p><p>He reached out and pried her fingers apart. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. And it\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s just the hand of cards we were dealt. Don\u2019t you see, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that I should\u2014I should have tried harder,\u201d she said in a little wooden voice that disguised how much she wanted to cry.</p><p>\u201cYou did try, didn\u2019t you?\u201d His eyes were so kind that she felt tears swell up in hers.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSo we give that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t give it up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that men can\u2019t give it up, but women can?\u201d He was smiling at her a little now, tugging at her hand to make her smile at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so kind of you to say so, Fletch. But I think we would really do better if you just went off by yourself for a while. Then when we decide to have an heir we\u2019ll come back together and do that.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go off with some light-heeled woman who would pretend to like me and pretend to desire me. And I don\u2019t want to have an affaire with a woman like your friend Louise either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did think of it. But if I imagine myself in bed with her\u2014or any other woman\u2014it doesn\u2019t work for me. Damn it, Poppy, don\u2019t you think it would be easier for me if it did work? I could skip out to Fonthill for the Christmas season and frolic with half the trollops in the kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it would be easier for you,\u201d she said baldly. \u201cAnd easier for me as well. Why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened and for a moment she thought she\u2019d hurt him, but then he just turned her hand over and said, \u201cWe\u2019re both spoiled goods. Because unfortunately when I asked you to marry me, it seems to have been a long-term proposition.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s mind reeled. Part of her was screaming silently with the joy of it, dancing a hornpipe at the back of her brain. But part of her was terrified. Now they were back where they were before, back in the bed where she would just disappoint him again because she couldn\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>He looked at her eyes and he must have seen exactly what she was thinking, because he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for that, Poppy. We\u2019ll do it exactly as you wish. No bed. None of that. I don\u2019t need it and you don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need it?\u201d This went against everything her mother had ever told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m discovering that bedroom activity isn\u2019t terribly important to me. You\u2019ve been gone for months and I haven\u2019t broken my wedding vows.\u201d</p><p>His eyes looked as if he were serious. Could it be? She herself was fine without marital intimacies. Why shouldn\u2019t Fletch be the same?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just skip that aspect until we decide that we want children,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure we can have children, Fletch. We tried for four years.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMy father and mother were married for ten years before they had me. And then it was another eight before my brother happened along, and then finally the twins followed. So in the end they had four.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould it bother you if we don\u2019t have children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.

We haven\u2019t made love for months now and I\u2019ve been doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>Poppy didn\u2019t really think he was fine. There was a tightness about him, the sense of a taut wire singing in the wind...but she didn\u2019t want to think about that. What she wanted more than anything was to believe him.</p><p>\u201cUnless, of course, you just don\u2019t like having me around,\u201d he said, rather awkwardly, as the silence grew.</p> <p>She let it grow some more. She didn\u2019t want him to think that she was going to be his willing little acolyte, slavishly grateful for his every glance. He was staring at the floor, looking rather miserable. Good.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to do this just because of my mother\u2019s presence in your house,\u201d she said. \u201cThough I know well that my mother has a great deal to do with your plea for my return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother has no part in my request.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe that for a moment, but she let it go. There was something more important that had to be said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to understand that I don\u2019t feel the same way as you do. I\u2019m not in love, though I am very fond of you, Fletch.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. A lock of hair fell over his eyes and he looked so delicious that she almost jumped up to put her arms around him and make him foolish promises. Maybe she could try harder...</p><p>No.</p><p>She had felt free in the last months, living at Jemma\u2019s, not worrying about her dress, and how she looked, and whether her husband would think she was stupid for buying curiosities, or whether he was coming to her bedchamber that night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moving back home,\u201d she added. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He looked stunned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs this because of that Loudan fellow?\u201d When Fletch frowned he looked thrillingly pirate-like, Poppy thought.</p><p>\u201cIn a way it is. I always thought it would be improper of me to go to the meetings of the Royal Society. I hid my books. I tried so hard to be a proper duchess and make you happy. I\u2019ve acquired a cabinet for my curiosities. I might as well warn you, Fletch, that it was quite expensive, as it\u2019s modeled on the cabinet owned by the King of Sweden. The other day I bought an ancient Greek coin for it. And I saw an advertisement for a string of Virginia wampum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never said you couldn\u2019t buy anything! You can have all the wampum you want, what ever that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like being a duchess at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a duchess,\u201d he said stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m your duke and you should be at home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is about my mother, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s about you. And me. I don\u2019t like finding you\u2019re not there for breakfast. And I don\u2019t like going to parties without you. I miss talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why. We haven\u2019t talked about anything particularly interesting in years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was interesting. Perhaps I like talking about boring things with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your mother\u2019s house,\u201d he said gloomily. \u201cWait until you see how she\u2019s changed the drapery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery formal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel as if I\u2019m living in Versailles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I take the pleasure away from her?\u201d Poppy said, grinning. \u201cShe always wanted to be a duchess.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cThen can I live with you and Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven for Christmas? What about Jemma\u2019s house party? Half of London is discussing it. You wouldn\u2019t leave me with your mother for the holiday, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see how I feel,\u201d Poppy said loftily. \u201cIt\u2019s to be a very intimate party. Surely you\u2019d be happier retiring to the country with Pitt, or some friend from the government?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be happier with you. Christmas always reminds me of being on the tower of Saint Germain des Pr\u00e8s with you, Poppy. Do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d Her heart was beating very quickly.</p><p>\u201cNow I think about it, I should have known from that absurd pin you were wearing that I\u2019d find myself talking to you about river otters. I was so fevered with love that I couldn\u2019t think straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were dazed by the season,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cChristmas can be like that.\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes. \u201cThe season had nothing to do with it, Poppy. Not for me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think what to say, and somehow the moment was lost. So she pretended he had said nothing. He looked at her, eyes serious, brow furrowed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him to be alone on Christmas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Jemma,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Jemma to send you an invitation.\u201d</p><p>His smile made her feel very peculiar, so she retired to her bedchamber.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>The next day December 7</p><p>The AshmoleanMuseum was a bloody boring place full of stuffed mice. Poppy got excited over a poor flying squirrel, but Fletch thought it looked pitiful, pinned to a wall with its tiny claws extended.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cit\u2019s pleading for its life. Begging. Set me free!\u201d</p><p>Poppy didn\u2019t pay any attention. \u201cLook at its fifth claw,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s bent backward, almost as if it had a thumb. Isn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d</p><p>Fletch thought the little squirrel was going to haunt him in his dreams. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be flying through the trees, though I don\u2019t believe it really can fly without wings,\u201d he said disgustedly. \u201cNot pinned to a board. It smells in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaxidermy is not a perfect science,\u201d Poppy said. But she obviously didn\u2019t give a damn about the odor.</p><p>Naturally the curator of the Ashmoleon was so overwhelmed by her blue eyes that he started opening all sorts of cabinets marked \u201cNot for Display.\u201d And then he started rootling around in the basement and coming up with dusty boxes full of extremely unsavory things.</p><p>\u201cA shrunken head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to screech,\u201d Poppy said, leaning over the disgusting little object as if it were made of gold.</p><p>The curator gave Fletch a scornful look, so he retreated to the entryway where the odor was less offensive and took out that blasted report of Linchberry\u2019s. It was bad. Twisted, even, in the way it thought only about French products and not English farmers.</p><p>He read it again and then got a bottle of ink and a quill off the curator; the man barely registered his request, he was so enthralled by Poppy. Fletch rolled up his cuffs and started writing. The trick was to keep it simple, the way Poppy suggested.</p><p>He\u2019d noticed during the last months of haunting the House of Lords, listening to every speech, that not a single man talked about himself. Everything they said was couched in so much fancy language that the forest couldn\u2019t be seen for the trees. Hell, that\u2019s what he had done himself when he decided to make a speech of his own\u2014which likely explained why no one had the faintest idea what he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If there was going to be a treaty with France, it had to take into account the way that treaty would affect English farmers. Not English noblemen, and their penchant for French brandy and French silk\u2014he cast an affectionate glance at the ribbed twill of his coat\u2014but English farmers. Men like Higgle, who farmed part of the Fletcher duchy. Higgle had the de vil of a time making ends meet, what with his eight children and the price of bread.</p><p>Fletch thought about it, started a paragraph, threw it away.</p><p>The Duke of Beaumont had given him a bit of advice one day: that if he truly wanted to obliterate an opponent, the key was to create a story that would catch everyone\u2019s attention. Higgle could be his story.</p><p>He started again, crumpled up the page when he was nearly to the end, threw it away.</p> <p>Finally he started over again, just talking about Higgle. The way the man worked from dawn til dusk, tilling the ground. The way he had all his children working in the fields with him, until Fletch made him stop and let the children go to the village school.The fact that he received less than a penny for ten pounds of wheat, but then had to pay seven pence for a loaf of bread.</p><p>By the time shadows started to grow in the museum entryway, he had five credible pages. And what\u2019s more, he knew that he could give the speech without looking at the paper, though it helped to write it down. It was simple, it was clear, and by God, it was powerful.</p><p>Just then Poppy came around the corner. He leapt to his feet. His wife looked as if she\u2019d been in a fight. Her pink polonaise gown was streaked with brown smudges, and the lace hem was torn. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d His voice echoed around the marble entry.</p><p>She blinked up at him, and he realized instantly that she was unharmed. Curls had fallen out of her elaborate arrangement; he\u2019d never seen her so disheveled. Even when they\u2019d made love she\u2019d kept her head still so her curls weren\u2019t rumpled.</p><p>Museums seemed to be the exception to that rule.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Munson let me see the collections that Captain Cook sent back from his second voyage. Even the ones in the basement that are uncatalogued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore flying squirrels?\u201d Fletch tried to brush a black smear from Poppy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an animal that\u2019s about twice the size of a large rat,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Fletch handed Mr. Munson a purse while Poppy wasn\u2019t looking. He\u2019d never seen her so excited. Her excitement had a terrible effect on his body; he was about to burst out of his breeches. Luckily, Poppy never paid the faintest attention to his body. It was just that her hair was flying, and her eyes were bubbling with excitement. Her cheeks were pink, just a soft rosy color on top of her cheekbones that made him want to kiss her there, and maybe bite her ear...</p><p>He realized she was staring at him. \u201cAre you quite all right, Fletch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour maid will have an apoplectic fit when she sees you. I was just thinking about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe odd thing,\u201d Poppy said, ignoring the question of maids, \u201cis that this animal carries its young in a pouch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a possum, though Captain Cook apparently decided it was in the family of dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Fletch said intelligently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI shall write Dr. Loudan immediately and tell him so. Even though its head resembled a dog\u2019s, the pouch puts it in an entirely different species. Do you see my point, Fletch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, handing her into the carriage.</p><p>\u201cThe Dog and the Partridge,\u201d he told his coachman, James. The name of the inn had an odd rightness about it, given Poppy\u2019s subject of conversation.</p><p>When he got inside the carriage, Poppy was still talking about the dog. In fact, he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d stopped for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cThe curator said that Captain Cook suggested that the animal liked fruit. He gave one an orange. No dog would eat an orange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d Fletch said.</p><p>They pulled up at the Dog and the Partridge, and Fletch stepped out into the damp twilight. The air smelled chill and raw, as if snow was on the way. Poppy still didn\u2019t seem to have realized how awful she looked, so Fletch just took her arm as if there were nothing untoward about her appearance.</p><p>Given the raucous noises pouring out of the public room, not to mention the fellow sleeping at the end of the corridor, the Dog and the Partridge was overrun by customers. The innkeeper came forward to meet them smiling the peculiarly tight grimace of a man with one too many guests in his inn.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d the man said, bowing nervously. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re able to accommodate you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe reserved the rooms,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cMy man should have been here hours ago. I am the Duke of Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid your man hasn\u2019t arrived yet,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cI have Andrew Whiston here, Your Grace, and he\u2019s attracted quite a lot of attention, as you can see.\u201d He didn\u2019t even jump when a sodden heap of a man reeled out of a door and crashed into the wall.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t arrived,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cHow can that be? The second carriage left Chalgrove when we did, early this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think there was an accident?\u201d Poppy asked, knitting her brow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d the innkeeper asked. He snapped his fingers and two postilions leapt to their feet. \u201cAccompany His Grace\u2019s men; search the Chalgrove Road.\u201d He turned back to Fletch. \u201cIt may be that they\u2019re stuck in the mud. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t another inn for at least an hour\u2019s drive. But I will do my best to accommodate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally I will reimburse anyone who is inconvenienced by our arrival,\u201d Fletch said.</p><p>Another man crashed out of the door and noisily began throwing up just outside the door. Poppy shuddered. \u201cWho is Andrew Whiston?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe King of Beggars,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cOnly twenty-eight inches high, he is, and he\u2019s quite a curiosity in these parts. Comes out from London once a year and sings us a few songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a drunkard, but a very short one,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cSpends every night drinking in Surr\u2019s wine vaults when he\u2019s in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe do love his liquor,\u201d the innkeeper said, turning about. \u201cAnd the lads love to share it with him, if you take my meaning. I\u2019ll do everything I can to make you comfortable. I can put you in a good chamber now, but I\u2019ll have to see about a private dining room for yourself and your lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need two chambers,\u201d Poppy chirped up, \u201cplus accommodations for my maid, of course.\u201d</p><p>A look of panic crossed the innkeeper\u2019s face. \u201cI gave away my rooms already, Your Grace. I can likely put two of my guests together, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t turn people out altogether.\u201d</p><p>Fletch took his wife\u2019s arm. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to turn anyone out into the cold and dark, are we, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and said, \u201cAbsolutely, we are. If you pay them double, Fletch, they\u2019ll probably be quite grateful.\u201d</p><p>He always knew that women were the crueler sex. But there was something slightly unnerved in her voice that he found interesting. \u201cUnkind wench. I don\u2019t turn people out into the dark. It\u2019s coming on to snow. That isn\u2019t right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pursed her lips but he turned away. \u201cHer Grace has kindly agreed to these uncomfortable arrangements,\u201d he said to the innkeeper, who bowed so low that his nose surely touched his knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll prepare a private parlor,\u201d the man said, leading the way to the stairs, \u201cand the very best meal that you\u2019ve ever had in Oxford, that I can promise you. Just give me an hour to prepare the parlor, Your Graces, and you\u2019ll be completely comfortable, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep in the parlor,\u201d Poppy murmured to him, on the way up on the dark little stairs.</p><p>\u201cI certainly will not,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cI\u2019m covered with dust and you are covered with worse. We are both going to have baths, supper, and then go to sleep. Remember, Poppy, I\u2019ve put bedtime activities out of my mind. And I\u2019m a man of my word.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. And if she believed that, Fletch had a whole army of flying squirrels that he could sell her. For some reason, his desire was utterly in flames again. It was as bad as when they first met.</p><p>He took his wife\u2019s arm and the only thing he wanted to do was spin her against the wall and kiss her so hard that her knees would buckle. It had to be because she looked disheveled. He never managed to get her in disarray; even when she was naked she always looked as if she were wearing an invisible corset.</p><p>The bedchamber was large with a sloping roof that slanted down over the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s cosy,\u201d the innkeeper said nervously. \u201cOur best room, Your Graces.\u201d</p><p>The sheets were snowy white and the room looked clean. That and a drink were all Fletch really cared about. \u201cWe shall require hot baths, both of us,\u201d he said, \u201cand meanwhile bring me a brandy, if you would. And a glass of wine for Her Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d Poppy said, looking up from the notes she had taken in the museum.</p> <p>\u201cWine,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cAnd a bath.\u201d</p><p>The innkeeper left and Poppy focused on him. \u201cHadn\u2019t you better leave? That is, if you\u2019ll allow me to have the first bath.\u201d</p><p>Fletch had just managed to wrench off his boots and in reply he walked over to the bed and fell onto it like timber crashing in the forest. \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d he said from among the mounds of featherbed that popped around his face. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted, Poppy. We\u2019ve been in the carriage for two days, and then spent seven hours in a bloody museum. I\u2019m trying to get the sour taste of dust out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Poppy wandered over to the glass. When she saw herself she gave a little scream and started poking ineffectually at her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mess,\u201d Fletch said, having managed to beat back the pillows and sit up. \u201cYou look awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said such a thing before,\u201d she said, scowling at him. She\u2019d managed to make things worse; there was a bit of that black furry stuff on her hair now.</p> <p>\u201cAh, but we were properly married then. Now it\u2019s all different. It\u2019s as if we\u2019ve been married for forty years. No interest in each other in bed. We can tell each other the truth and not worry about hurt feelings.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the mirror and started poking around again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting black all over your hair,\u201d he said a while later.</p><p>She shrieked again.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you brush it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t arranged your own hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly have. I don\u2019t like men touching my body,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always dressed myself, perhaps just a little help with my boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, women can\u2019t do that,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cI can\u2019t even tie my own side bustles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but your maid is not here. Can you get your own clothing off?\u201d he said, thanking God that the quilt was concealing the rise in his breeches.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, why don\u2019t you?\u201d Fletch was starting to enjoy himself. \u201cBecause,\u201d he added in his most reasonable voice, \u201cthis room really isn\u2019t large enough for those baskets you\u2019re wearing on your hips. And frankly, I don\u2019t think the innkeeper is going to be happy with the way you\u2019re spreading that furry stuff on everything you touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFurry stuff?\u201d She twisted around to look over her shoulder and started screaming again. In truth, it was rather disgusting. Lord knows where those smudges came from, probably down in the basement.</p><p>\u201cIf you take off the bustles, you\u2019ll deflate,\u201d he said, grinning. He sat up just long enough to strip off his coat and waistcoat, and pull open his cuffs.</p><p>She eyed him and then said, \u201cDon\u2019t watch.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back and closed his eyes. \u201cI put all that behind me, remember? Besides, I have never had fantasies about women covered with dirt.\u201d</p><p>Then he watched her from under his lashes because frankly, he was having his first fantasy about a woman covered with dirt. Poppy\u2019s skirts were huge; she kept pulling them up and losing track of her underskirts. Finally she managed to get all the material bunched up in her fists.</p><p>Fletch had to take a deep breath when she pulled up her skirts. She had the sweetest turn of ankle he\u2019d ever seen. He couldn\u2019t see much higher than the back of her knee because she was wearing so much wire bracketry around her body. She was feeling around like a blind possum in the night, to use one of her own nature metaphors. She was never going to get that thing untied.</p><p>\u201cDo you need some help?\u201d he asked finally.</p><p>She whipped her head around and he grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cYou had your eyes open!\u201d she accused.</p><p>He swung his legs out of bed and she let her skirts fall again. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get all that clothing undone, Poppy. I\u2019ve seen you naked, remember? What\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>She muttered something about privacy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taken off your clothes and laid down entirely naked on the bed in front of me,\u201d he said, pulling up her skirts. \u201cWhat are you afraid of? We\u2019re an old married couple, remember? I\u2019ll probably start breaking wind in front of you after every meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and if we\u2019re at a formal supper, I\u2019ll blame you,\u201d Fletch said, struggling with the tapes holding up her side bustle. \u201cI\u2019ll jog you on the elbow and say very loudly, Don\u2019tworry, darling, I\u2019ll say it was I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Poppy said with certain resolution in her voice.</p><p>\u201cJust how would you do that?\u201d He turned her to the other side so he could untie the other string. He had to keep her talking because otherwise she might notice how his fingers were trembling. It was utterly ludicrous that he was so wild with lust now, when she was clothed, when he could have had her anytime in the year before she moved out, and had declined to do so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a purge.\u201d</p><p>She was grinning at him with a wicked twinkle in her eye. Instead of untying, he managed to yank the knot tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a purge,\u201d she continued gleefully, \u201cand then I\u2019ll drill a hole in your chamber pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoathsome wrench. How the hell does your maid usually get this off you?\u201d</p><p>She craned a glance over her shoulder. \u201cThey untie, obviously.

Instead he threw her skirts over his left arm and started wrenching the string apart.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a disgusting little idea you had about my chamber pot,\u201d he said, trying not to look at the curve of her bottom, perfectly visible through her sheer chemise.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2014\u201d she said and suddenly stopped.</p><p>\u201cI find it hard to imagine your mother attacking a chamber pot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe might surprise you.\u201d</p><p>The second bustle fell to the floor in a jostling of wires. He kicked it out of the way to Poppy\u2019s little shriek. \u201cBe careful with that! It\u2019s delicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your own hips better,\u201d he said, going back to the bed and lying down quickly so that she didn\u2019t see the front of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to hear that from you of all people. After all, panniers are in fashion and surely that is of foremost concern for the Duke of Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone a bit far in that direction,\u201d he said, propping himself up against the wall. \u201cI was trying to get you to notice me, you know.\u201d</p> <p>She turned away from the window, her mouth open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to notice me. But now I\u2019ve accepted that you\u2019ll never desire me, so I don\u2019t have to try so hard.\u201d</p><p>Instead of looking gratified, she suddenly looked as if she were going to cry. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad, Fletch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone past that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the mirror and started fussing with her hair again, but what ever she was doing just made it worse.</p><p>\u201cYou know, is there any chance that black stuff is tar?\u201d he said, after a while. \u201cBecause it\u2019s spread over quite a bit of your hair in back now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTar? What\u2019s tar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack, sticky stuff that doesn\u2019t come off,\u201d he said, getting out of bed again.</p><p>She had started out the day with a delightful hair arrangement involving one long feather, three shorter feathers, and a bunch of ribbons in the back. Plus a huge amount of curled, looped hair, naturally, a frizzed part on the top, and what must have been a full box of hair powder.</p><p>Now the feathers were bent and her hair...He put a finger to the black stuff. \u201cDefinitely tar,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan you brush it off?\u201d Poppy asked. She tried to look over her shoulder at the glass again. \u201cI can see there\u2019s something black there, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst we have to get all these feathers and bows out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cDo you think Luce will be found soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you know how to take down your own hair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s different for men than women, you know!\u201d She turned around and snapped at him, hands on her hips, and she looked so adorable he almost lost his head and kissed her. \u201cAll a man has to do is swat on a bit of powder\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tie your hair back. I could do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you, sometimes?\u201d</p><p>She started laughing. \u201cGo outside with my hair tied back like a five-year-old girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you could do it in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do it, if I were you. This looks heavy and it smells awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hair doesn\u2019t smell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it smelled dirty. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s so much lavender powder in here that I can\u2019t smell you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a smell,\u201d she said, setting that little jaw of hers and glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He sniffed his own armpit. \u201cI wonder when that bath is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are disgusting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d he protested. \u201cI rather like the smell of my sweat. I\u2019d like yours, too.\u201d</p><p>A knock on the door signaled the entry of the innkeeper carrying a tin bathtub, followed by three men carrying buckets of hot water. He plunked it down by the window and turned to face them. \u201cWe\u2019ve located your servants, Your Graces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lovely!\u201d Poppy said. \u201cIs my maid on the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, their carriage turned over in a ditch. As I understand it, the men outside jumped clear. But Your Graces\u2019 manservant and maid were inside the coach. Your valet was knocked clean out and only came to himself an hour or so ago. And your maid has broken her arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!Poor Luce!\u201d Poppy cried. \u201cI must go to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right and tight back at the Fox and Hummingbird, Your Grace. My man said that she had a posset to take off the pain, and she was sleeping as sweetly as a babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my valet there as well?\u201d Fletch put in.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both safe as bugs in a bed,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve thought about the duchess\u2019s situation, and I thought that Elsie here, from the kitchen, would be able to help you with your women\u2019s things.\u201d He moved to the side, and a great, strapping lass with hairier arms than Fletch entered. She grinned, showing that she had only three teeth to her name.</p><p>Fletch cast a look at Poppy and said, \u201cMy wife and I will quite relish the rustic pleasures of being without personal help for the night. Don\u2019t think about it twice; I wouldn\u2019t want to take Elsie away from her work in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Poppy opened her mouth, but Fletch had the innkeeper and his men out of that room before she could do more than splutter at him.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>Charlotte pulled out her Bible and sat down, trying to conceal the fact that she was rather anxiously trying to figure out whether Villiers looked closer to death than he had when she last saw him. The very thought made her heart knock against her chest, which was stupid because she hardly knew the man. She had only paid him a matter of four visits.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m unchanged,\u201d he said, guessing her thoughts. \u201cJust as pestilent, as resistant to Christian advice, and generally ill-tempered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought my Bible again,\u201d she said primly. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be a great consolation to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you read me the bits about David watching Bathsheba? That was always my favorite when I was a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m going to read you from Luke.\u201d And she began to read the lovely old story of Christ\u2019s birth. He surprised her and didn\u2019t complain as she began, \u201cThere was in the days of Herod, King of Judea...\u201d</p><p>At some point his man brought in a glass of water and Villiers sipped at it. \u201cThe Christmas story,\u201d he said, his voice as wry as ever. \u201cDo you think I need to hear of miracles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt you. Christmas is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to love the holiday,\u201d he said, handing the glass back to his man, who refilled it and quietly left the room. \u201cWishes, you know. Wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you wish for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo fly. I always wanted to fly. But I would have accepted the gift of speaking with animals. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were never encouraged to wish, at least not in connection with Christmas. But I have very fond memories of the holiday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou seem more starchy today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the way I always am.

He was dying. She knew it in the pit of her stomach. So why was she being so prudish with him, when she could tell that it made him miserable?</p><p>She put the book down again. After a bit he opened his eyes\u2014he really did have the longest eyelashes\u2014and said, \u201cWell, do keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d heard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know how the story ends.\u201d And then he started laughing at the expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to drink the rest of your water.\u201d</p> <p>He picked up the glass and she cudgeled her brains for something to say that would make the spark come back into his eyes. \u201cWhy did you want to fly?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t? To have wings at your back, and the sky at your mercy...to drift on the belly of the wind the way hawks do, and perch on a tree to chatter to friends. I am persuaded that conversations that take place on the branches of a tree are far more interesting than those that take place in London town houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have wished for something,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a true Englishman in the world who hasn\u2019t wished that he won the bean in his slice of cake and became King of the Bean, or wished that his horrid little sister would lose at snapdragon, and perhaps even singe a finger on a burning raisin.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte thought of meaningless answers and then said the truth. \u201cI never wished for much until I turned sixteen.\u201d</p><p>He raised his heavy eyes. \u201cYou fell in love?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I just wanted a man to fall in love with me. I was sure I could adapt my emotions to whomever presented himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Charlotte,\u201d he said, and his voice sounded less bored. She was right; he needed to think of someone other than himself. \u201cDid no man ever fall in love with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought one did, once. Lord Barnabe Reeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReeve was the Barnabe who brought you to my side? I never knew his first name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe danced all night long once,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought...but he left London within days and went mad, or so they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to dispel your sweet memories of first love, but in my view it\u2019s better to have no spouse than one who\u2019s cracked. And I know many who would agree with me.\u201d</p><p>His hands lay on the counterpane, looking strangely still. The sight of them made her hurry into speech. \u201cDoubtless, you\u2019re right. After a while I stopped wishing for someone to fall in love with me and just wished for someone blind enough to mistake me for someone he might fall in love with.\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly. \u201cYou\u2019re not an antidote. Particularly when you flare up and snap at me. I imagine that\u2019s what Elijah sees in you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElijah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuke of Beaumont. I suppose I could marry you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with some horror. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d She stopped. He was dying, but how to say so?</p><p>\u201cDying, dying, dying, how it gets in the way of my social life,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cTo be but half-dead is as bad as being half-witted, like Reeve. Neither makes a man fit company for his betters nor a good consort for a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to marry me,\u201d Charlotte said, recovering herself. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re far too high in the instep and grand for me to marry. I wouldn\u2019t have dared wish for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought women liked to marry their betters. It does such nice things for one\u2019s offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you pointed out, I have no offspring,\u201d Charlotte pointed out. \u201cWhy should I worry about their future titles under those circumstances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose this will shock you, but I was thinking last night that I should have bothered to create a few children, and then I remembered that I had already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIllegitimate ones,\u201d he said. \u201cAs sometimes happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d she said tartly.</p><p>\u201cWomen on the whole are better at keeping track of their children.\u201d</p><p>He looked rather feverish again, so she said, \u201cI think I\u2019d better go back to the Bible, though it\u2019s likely too late for your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I might redeem my soul if I found a husband for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would do better to see to the welfare of your poor children,\u201d she said. And then, hearing the fascinated horror in her own voice: \u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as many as would fill a choir,\u201d he said, \u201cnor yet as few as to sing a solo. Can you sing, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a very nice lad in need of a wife but he loves song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good at things of that nature,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an enthusiast. But you like to talk. We know that. And you have good ideas for Beaumont\u2019s speech...what about a promising young politician? Plenty of those about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want someone with a large dowry,\u201d she said dispassionately.</p><p>\u201cYou could have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give it to you.\u201d He opened his eyes very wide and looked at her. They were a deep black.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you. And dying men have their foibles, their foolishnesses...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you for it.\u201d But she added, a little sadly: \u201cIt would be distasteful, don\u2019t you think, to buy a husband, even with a duke\u2019s largesse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he wouldn\u2019t know that. A better dress and you must put a bit of color on your cheeks now and then. And your hair!\u201d He peered at her. \u201cWorse than I remembered.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t tell him that she had dressed her own hair with trembling fingers that morning, afraid he was dead, or nearly so, and then rushed out of the house with May calling behind her. \u201cI will still be just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once I\u2019ve transformed you. But I don\u2019t think that a politician would be right. Too hard, too grasping. You\u2019re correct: there\u2019s a chance the man would marry you thinking of money and political influence. They all have those distasteful propensities. I think you need an intellectual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA philosopher. Reeve was a thinker. I remember him madly talking about this and that. He was never boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Charlotte agreed.</p><p>\u201cIs it almost Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is St. Nicholas\u2019s day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He whispered it. \u201cIt seems like yesterday that I fought that duel and it\u2019s\u2014it can\u2019t have been months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really won\u2019t survive then, will I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re too unpleasant to die,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, I\u2019ll marry you while you\u2019re in a fever and then take all your money.\u201d</p><p>He stopped looking so dismal and laughed a bit, though it made him wheeze. \u201cWhat the hell would you do with money?

I never fail at what I put my hand to. I\u2019ll find the perfect man. I\u2019d like to see you refuse him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I take him, you\u2019ll have to do something for me in return.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? In return for finding you your heart\u2019s desire, I have to do you a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll keep you alive long enough to do it,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re like to tumble into the grave merely because your doctor told you to do it.

What decent man would want to marry a woman he met in your presence\u2014in your bedchamber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re saying that I should get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI always thought that generals should be female.\u201d He seemed to go to sleep, and she put her Bible back in her knotting bag, thinking to steal out. But he opened his eyes again and said, \u201cA Christmas house party, that\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking all weedy again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we were invited to a house party you could read me the entire Old Testament and no one would have the faintest idea that we were in such promiscuous contact. I\u2019ll deal with it tomorrow,\u201d he said, his eyes closing again. \u201cDo you know, I\u2019m tired. But it\u2019s not the fever-tired. Maybe you\u2019re the miracle, Miss Charlotte What ever your name is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d she said, just to leave him with something to think about.</p><p>Finchley was hovering in the hallway and she smiled at him. \u201cI think that\u2019s a healthy sleep,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have that feverish look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lord be praised,\u201d Finchley said, and looked as if he might cry. \u201cYour hackney is waiting, Miss Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>\u201cJust what do you intend to do now?\u201d Poppy was in-censed as she watched the door shut behind Elsie. \u201cHow am I supposed to ready myself for bed, let alone bathe? I can\u2019t sleep with all this powder in my hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wash the powder out every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought women slept with their heads upright so as not to disturb their curls. You never took your hair down when I visited your bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why not?\u201d He came up behind her and started tweaking her hair. \u201cEven when I saw you in a nightgown your hair was always up; I thought you always left it so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took another bath after your visits, naturally, so my maid would take down my hair then. What are you doing?\u201d Poppy asked. She was starting to feel very peculiar. Even though Fletch wasn\u2019t interested in bedding her anymore...well, they were alone.Really alone. No maid waiting to bathe her. No maid at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking all the pins out of your hair, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat young woman would have done perfectly well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was wearing an apron, Poppy. Did you see that apron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe works in the kitchen. Why shouldn\u2019t she wear an apron? I sometimes wear an apron when doing house hold things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice that the apron was bloody?\u201d he enquired. \u201cBecause I did. It looked as if gentle Elsie had been twisting the heads off chickens with her bare hands.\u201d</p><p>Poppy had to admit that she was somewhat reluctant to be bathed by a chicken killer. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get this feather to come out. The long one in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t just pull!\u201d But when Poppy put her hands up and tried to help out, he batted her away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got quite a few pins out,\u201d he said a minute later. \u201cBut this black stuff isn\u2019t coming out, Poppy. And the feather doesn\u2019t budge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will wash out,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you leave now I\u2019ll wash it out in the tub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how are you going to do that yourself?\u201d</p><p>She turned around and glared at him. A feather thwacked her in the eye and she brushed it out of the way.</p><p>\u201cThose feathers are glued into your hair. Did you know that, Poppy? Your maid must be gluing them in and then cutting them out later.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known that, but there was a great deal she didn\u2019t know about hair dressing. That\u2019s why she paid Luce so much.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that we don\u2019t have a pair of scissors around here,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose I can ask the innkeeper.\u201d He opened the door and bellowed down the hall before she thought to answer.</p><p>A moment later he waved a pair of scissors at her. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to cut out all that black stuff and the feathers. You\u2019d better stay very still.\u201d</p><p>She backed away. \u201cAre you jesting? You\u2019re not cutting my hair. I\u2019ll wash out the tar. And the glue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, folding his arms. Poppy really hated the fact that he looked...well...so male. That was it. He was a big male, with a lot of muscles, and it naturally made her nervous. Actually, it made her want to run her hand up his arm, the part where the muscle was straining against the linen of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll scrub it out,\u201d she repeated. \u201cSo if you wouldn\u2019t mind leaving, Fletch, I\u2019ll get it done in a jiffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I to go? You want me to go down and ogle the King of Beggars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t care where you go but you can\u2019t stay here while I bathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ve seen you naked, Poppy. Hell, I\u2019ve kissed you all over naked. We\u2019ve been married four years, remember? That side of our marital life is over. I think you need help.\u201d He picked up a strand of Poppy\u2019s hair and looked at it with a distasteful expression on his face. \u201cHave you ever bathed yourself?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was something in his voice that sounded critical. \u201cNo, I have not,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cBut neither has any other woman of my acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just offering to help.\u201d</p><p>Now he\u2019d made her feel guilty for snapping at him. After all, what difference did it make? He\u2019d seen her naked more times than she could count. And she could see tar clumping her hair powder. The itch was beginning to drive her mad. \u201cAll right. But I\u2019m going to bathe in my chemise.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI like to be really clean myself but I know many ladies aren\u2019t like that. One only has to walk into a ballroom in July to realize it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am clean!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYour choice,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t matter to me what you wear in the bath. I might as well say it again, but that part of our marriage is over.\u201d</p><p>It was all quite embarrassing. Poppy started trying to untie her gown and realized that she couldn\u2019t unhook her sash by herself so it was just as well Fletch was there. He was working at the little hooks when she remembered what Jemma had said and started giggling.</p><p>\u201cThinking happy thoughts about Loudan again?\u201d</p><p>He sounded rather unfriendly. \u201cJemma told me that men could come in quite handy on carriage trips,\u201d she said, feeling the laughter bubble up inside her again. \u201cShe was right.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled her dress backward, off her shoulders and arms, and she stepped out of it. This par ticular dress had three separate petticoats sewn into it and it weighed quite a lot. Her stays laced behind, so Fletch started working on them and cursing a little under his breath. He certainly wasn\u2019t very handy. Poppy started thinking about the possum in the Ashmolean again.</p><p>\u201cThose opposable thumbs are very important,\u201d she told him.</p><p>There was a ripping noise and her stays fell away. She spun around to find him holding up bits of lacing.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t come apart,\u201d he said with a silly grin.</p><p>Poppy put her hands on her hips. \u201cNow what am I going to do without laces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t wear that gown again anyway.\u201d He turned it over with his toe and Poppy could see black marks on the sides. When she raised her eyes, Fletch was staring right at her chest. She looked down too and realized that she was wearing a chemise so light that the line of her breast could be seen through it. She even saw the pink tip of one of her nipples.</p> <p>But before she could wrap her arms around her chest, his eyes slid away as if there was nothing interesting there and he said, \u201cYou get in the bath, and I\u2019ll try to wash out that tar.\u201d</p><p>Of course he wasn\u2019t attracted to her body anymore. After all, he\u2019d had four years to sate himself on her, and that was more than enough. Plus, Poppy knew quite well that many women had really large bosoms compared to hers.</p><p>She lifted the hem of her chemise and stepped into the bath. She cast a quick glance at Fletch, but he was over on the other side of the room, looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s snowing,\u201d he said. \u201cA proper snowfall.\u201d</p><p>She could just see a blur of white over his shoulder. It made the room seem even smaller and more private.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like snow for Christmas,\u201d she said. She sat down in the water, thinking about what would happen to her chemise when it got wet.</p><p>Not that it would matter to him, anyway.</p><p>The wet cloth looked as fine as netting where it clung to her legs. She tugged it over her knees, but where it fell between her legs she could even see golden hair through the tissue-thin cloth. Quickly she brought her knees up to her chest, splashing water on the floor.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he said from the window.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d If she wrapped her arms around her chest and kept her knees up, she was covered. Not decent, but covered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>Jemma and her husband were nearing the end of their game. If Jemma had to bet on it, she would say that she was winning, hands down. Beaumont had played the first game in this match with a fiery intensity, as if every move would determine the change of government.</p><p>But this game he kept moving carelessly and then talking of Fox\u2019s India bill, the French trade treaty, the brandy tax, the situation of Scottish peers in the House of Lords. Almost as if he wanted her opinion. And she would lay out the board for another game (for they had fallen into the habit of playing a side game, as they called it), and if she felt he was truly spouting nonsense, she would point it out.</p><p>She\u2019d actually started reading the Morning Chronicle and the Morning Post, though she was careful not to let him know. There was no point in letting one\u2019s husband think that he was interesting; it would only end in disaster.</p><p>This night Jemma looked at the board and knew she had him. There would be three more days, because of the one-move-a-day rule, but the game was over. \u201cYou didn\u2019t play this game seriously,\u201d she said, moving her queen to King\u2019s Four and taking his only remaining castle.</p><p>He moved a pawn in a hopeless gesture of solidarity toward his threatened queen. \u201cTrue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t want you to think that I want any less to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s competition that spurs you to play,\u201d she said. \u201cLast game, Villiers was your competition, not myself. Without Villiers playing a parallel game, you can\u2019t bring yourself to play your best.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say the obvious: that if her assessment were correct, he didn\u2019t really care to win. And given that she herself was the purported prize for winning the match...well, there was nothing there that she hadn\u2019t known for years, was there?</p><p>\u201cFox\u2019s India Bill will be voted on any day,\u201d he said. \u201cShall we go to the country soon? My mother writes that she will remain in Scotland.\u201d There was no need to explain that comment: the dowager duchess was known far and wide as a harridan.</p><p>\u201cWe are having a house party,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI\u2019ve just sent out invitations.\u201d</p><p>He was putting the pieces back in place and his hands paused for a moment and then continued. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cA excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt nettled that he didn\u2019t show more reaction. \u201cShall I invite Miss Tatlock?\u201d</p><p>The question hung in the air. She was deliberately baiting him, and why? Why?</p><p>\u201cI would enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>So there was the answer to that question.</p><p>\u201cNot her sister, though. I can\u2019t stand her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe dithers,\u201d he said, agreeing with her.</p><p>\u201cPoppy and Fletch, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not her mother,\u201d he said this time. \u201cI can\u2019t stand her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Flora is not fluffy,\u201d Jemma said feelingly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s feral.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cI\u2019ll invite that nice Dr. Loudan from the Royal Society,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will keep Fletch on his toes.\u201d Elijah looked amused once she explained. \u201cJemma the Matchmaker,\u201d he said. \u201cIt boggles the mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir marriage doesn\u2019t have to be over. They love each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if their intimate life is as terrible as you say\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOurs wasn\u2019t much better.\u201d</p><p>Too late she realized that she\u2019d walked into a trap. \u201cOur marriage,\u201d he said thoughtfully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jemma leaped from her chair. \u201cTime to dress!\u201d</p><p>He rose. \u201cPerhaps...we could invite Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers?

How different his body was from hers. He didn\u2019t wait for her to come up with a clever riposte. He simply bent his head and kissed her breathless.</p><p>\u201cPossession,\u201d he repeated, his voice a little deeper than normal.</p><p>And left the room.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>Fletch was afraid to turn around. It felt as if a spell had been cast over the room, a sweet, sleepy spell of privacy. The snow was like the brambles that grew around the princess\u2019s palace\u2014the one who slept for one hundred years. If only they had one hundred years, without servants, without Poppy\u2019s mother, without all the Your Gracing and My Gracing.</p><p>The windows were steaming over as snow began to twirl and fly on the other side of the window. Perhaps the storm would prove bramble-like and keep them trapped in a snug bed together.</p><p>He could just see the gold of Poppy\u2019s hair reflected in the window, and the curve of one shoulder. She\u2019d sat down with her back to him, of course. Her hair fell in lumpy coils, black mixed with the gold, and two feathers jutting out behind. It fell below her waist in the back.</p> <p>The innkeeper had left some liquid soap, but Fletch couldn\u2019t imagine that it would work on that tar. Still, he picked up a basin and scooped some water out of the remaining bucket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pour this over your head.\u201d</p><p>Poppy clasped her arms tighter around her chest and nodded.</p><p>He let it fall down slowly. Artistically. He poured a little to the right so that her chemise flattened against her shoulder blade, and then ran down her back. Moved to the left so that he could see the delicate pink of her skin through her chemise. She started shivering.</p><p>\u201cThe chemise will make you colder,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not clear to me how you can wash through cloth.\u201d</p><p>She just bent her head and said, \u201cWill you wash my hair now, please?\u201d</p><p>He got some more water but there was a lot of hair. The smell of lavender powder was starting to nauseate him so he sloshed on more water. Then he poured out the liquid soap and began rubbing it into her hair. She stayed quiet for a moment, but then she started protesting, and giving advice, and directions.</p><p>\u201cPoppy!\u201d</p><p>She shut up for a moment.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever washed anyone\u2019s hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve washed my own, and I\u2019m doing yours exactly the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it hurts,\u201d Poppy said. She had stopped covering her breasts and was holding onto the sides of the tub instead. \u201cThis tub is going to tip!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to put some muscle into it,\u201d he said. \u201cYour hair is a mess.\u201d He picked up a part that seemed all matted together. \u201cUg! Should I just cut it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she squealed. \u201cDon\u2019t! I can get out the snarl. I\u2019m sure I can get it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always wear a wig while it grew out,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cI think it would be easier to wear a wig. You can\u2019t tell me that your maid bathes all of this out of your hair every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she does. Sometimes it takes some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually not over a couple of hours,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of hours!\u201d Fletch stopped trying to get his fingers through snarls of hair. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting a couple of hours every night on this? And what about the nights when I came to your bed\u2014you would stay up for two more hours washing your hair?\u201d</p><p>Poppy blinked up at him. Wet rat tails hung over her eyes. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m very tired, I almost fall asleep, but I cannot sleep with powder in my hair. It starts to itch horribly after a day. On a bad day I can be absolutely crazed by supper time. It\u2019s hard to sit still.\u201d</p><p>Fletch stared down at her. \u201cPoppy,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cwould you say that your head was itching when we were making love?\u201d</p><p>She went still for a second and then, \u201cOnly sometimes.\u201d She sounded like a guilty little girl. He stared down at her head feeling as if dawn had just broken over his head. Maybe...\u201cYou\u2019re shivering. You need to take that wet chemise off. You\u2019re liable to freeze.\u201d He walked over to the fireplace and put on another log. \u201cI\u2019m not watching. Take it off, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>He heard the sound of a wet cloth slap the ground. He poked at the fire again, thinking hard. He had to go slow. Very slow. Pray for snow. Tell her that he had no interest in her body. Make her trust him.</p><p>Which meant no sex to night. Every muscle in his body, including his favorite, protested.</p><p>He had to make this work, because it had to be permanent. He was slowly starting to realize that he didn\u2019t even know his wife. How could he not have known that she was waiting through those hours he lavished on her body, desperate to wash her hair?</p><p>He remembered trying to touch her hair and she always protested. He had given in, of course, because everyone knew that ladies\u2019 hair took hours to arrange. The bucket of water next to the fire was still warm; he picked up the dipper and poured it over her again. She squealed. He saw her peeking to see whether he was looking at her naked self.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t, because if he actually looked at all that pink skin sitting before him like the most delectable sugarplum of his life, he\u2019d fall on her like a ravening animal.</p><p>Instead he walked behind her, like a man who has no interest in marital beds. He poured more soap into her hair, grabbed the comb, and started trying to get out the tar in earnest. Fifteen minutes later he was getting worried. \u201cIt won\u2019t come out. I\u2019m going to have to cut some of it, Poppy. Especially this long part.\u201d He picked up a long rat tail that fell down her back. It was tangled up with the feather and the tar and God knows what else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy looked up at him and to his horror, he saw a tear slide down her cheek. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Look.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the matted snarl and a few more tears fell down.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You can wear a wig. Why do you need all this hair anyway? It makes you itch. You\u2019re better off without it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut then\u2014\u201d she sniffed adorably, so he got her his handkerchief. She buried her face and said something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be so ugly,\u201d she burst out, looking up at him with her bottom lip quivering. \u201cAnd unfashionable. You hate unfashionable women!\u201d</p><p>If only she knew. If only\u2014he kept his eyes above her collarbone. \u201cThat\u2019s irrelevant, Poppy.\u201d He said it in his most friendly voice. \u201cYour mother told you the truth about men: we don\u2019t stay attracted to one woman very long. I love you, and I want you to be comfortable. I don\u2019t care about your hair!\u201d</p><p>She sniffed again and wiped away a few more tears.</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound as if you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do.\u201d He grabbed the scissors. \u201cI would love you even if your hair was as short as that possum\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He could see a few more tears on her cheeks, but she bent her head and didn\u2019t say anything, so he started cutting.</p><p>After a bit he said, \u201cPoppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her voice was muffled because she\u2019d drawn up her knees and hidden her face in them.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that there are snarls in your hair, next to your scalp?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He cut one out and showed it to her. \u201cSee? It\u2019s all matted up in there. I don\u2019t think your maid was actually combing your hair all the way through in the back.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered and started to cry again, loudly this time. \u201cJust cut it off,\u201d she cried. \u201cGo ahead. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>So Fletch did. He clipped here and snipped there. He tried to save the parts that he could get a comb through, but all the tar had to go.</p><p>\u201cI think the problem is that she\u2019s been gluing feathers into your hair in back. And then I suppose she would cut them out if they wouldn\u2019t wash out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so disgusting,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finding the tips of quills,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a menagerie in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like an aviary,\u201d she said sourly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised. I always wondered how women managed to get their hair up in the air and have it be three times their height. Now I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes Luce puts a cushion inside,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cHow else can she make the plumes stay up? The plumes I wear for formal occasions are sixteen inches long. And I\u2019ve been thinking that it\u2019s not really her fault. Most women leave their hair up between stylings, even with the feathers attached, but I always insisted on washing it, every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found a hair pin,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cLook\u2014it has a diamond head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only from yesterday,\u201d Poppy said crossly. \u201cYou\u2019re making me feel hideously unclean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the shoe fits,\u201d Fletch retorted. But she looked so mortified that he relented and said, \u201cAt least you never smell, Poppy. I can\u2019t bear the way women smell like hog\u2019s grease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe powder sticks to grease too much and make me itch; I use tallow instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTallow!\u201d That explained a lot. Fletch ruthlessly cut out a few more pieces of hair matted with candle wax.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find another maid,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI never liked Luce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why on earth did you keep her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother found her. She\u2019s French. And she does the most wonderful frizzes on my hair. Remember Lady Salisbury\u2019s ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair was as high as a Babylonian tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Fletch cut out a few more chunks and they fell over Poppy\u2019s shoulder. She picked them up with a shudder and dropped them on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why you never noticed what your maid was doing. Or not doing, to be more exact.\u201d</p><p>Poppy sounded cross as the dickens. \u201cLadies don\u2019t brush their own hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies don\u2019t do this, ladies don\u2019t do that. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were a man,\u201d Poppy said, \u201cI would go to CambridgeUniversity and became a famous naturalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Poppy, the world\u2019s expert on dog possums,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cThere, I think I\u2019m finished.\u201d He pulled a comb through the hair that was left.</p><p>\u201cI still need to take a bath,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cThis water has grown quite unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>Fletch picked up her gown and threw it strategically over the mirror in the corner. Then he grabbed a toweling cloth and handed it to her.</p><p>She looked at the small cloth and then at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were asking a question, but he forced himself to smile. \u201cI\u2019ll go downstairs and tell the innkeeper that we need this bath emptied and fresh hot water.\u201d</p><p>He was so hard it actually hurt to go down the stairs. That had to be a first.</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>Fletch stayed downstairs while Poppy took her second bath, which gave her time to pull her gown off the mirror, burst into tears again at the sight of her shorn, hacked-off locks, then climb into a steaming tub of fresh water and get clean. Really clean because she washed her hair herself: ran her fingers through every strand, rather than sitting there passively while her maid did it for her.</p><p>Never again, she vowed to herself.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she was toweling herself by the fire that she realized that never applied to lavender hair powder as well. There was no point in making herself look perfect every day. Her husband didn\u2019t desire her.</p><p>Oddly enough, the knowledge stung. \u201cDog in the manger,\u201d she muttered to herself, shaking out her hair and throwing it back over her shoulders. It weighed almost nothing, which was a delicious feeling. The steely truth was that she may not want him\u2014at least to make love to her\u2014but she wanted him to desire her.</p><p>Her heart ached, which was idiotic. She had lain there for years suffering agonies of embarrassment\u2014and yes, itching\u2014and generally just waiting for it to be over. Why, why, why would she want him to do that again?</p><p>She didn\u2019t, of course.</p><p>It was just that this room was so small, and he seemed so large. She hadn\u2019t been able to stop looking at his chest. He\u2019d got wet washing her hair, and his shirt had clung to him. He was warm and hard and muscled in all the places where she had no muscles.</p><p>That was probably it. After all, she was a naturalist. His body was as different from hers as if he were a flying squirrel. His hair was silky and glossy whereas hers\u2014she shuddered. How could she not know the state of her hair?</p><p>No wonder he didn\u2019t desire her.</p><p>She would never desire anyone who had disgusting matted bits in his hair. Of course, Fletch\u2019s hair was the kind of hair you could brush against your body and it would feel like satin.</p><p>Her skin was red from the scrubbing she\u2019d given it, and her scalp felt clean and free. No more powder. No more tallow. No more feathers. No more frizzed hair. No more French maid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a noise at the door and she hastily leaped under the covers. Fletch poked his head around, raised an eyebrow, and then ushered in a footman with an empty bathtub.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in shock down below,\u201d he said, once the old tub had been removed by weary men. \u201cI don\u2019t think the kitchen has ever heated this much water, not if it was bath day for the whole parish. They\u2019ll be sending up a few covered plates for our supper, since our trunks are back at the Fox and Hummingbird, and we can\u2019t dress for the meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m clean,\u201d Poppy said. She should feel humiliated but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Fletch started to pull his shirt out of his breeches. \u201cIt won\u2019t bother you if I bathe, will it?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She shook her head as he undid the buckles at his knees.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen me naked enough and you never turned a hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Poppy said, averting her eyes as he pulled his shirt over his head. \u201cWhen we first married, I thought I would throw up from pure nervous ness every time you came to my room.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her, his hands caught in his waistband about to pull down his breeches. Poppy felt herself redden. This was all so intimate. She\u2019d never seen him undress. He came to her room sedately clothed in a dressing gown, ushered through the door by her maid. Somehow it felt different when she saw the way his chest expanded from the waist of his breeches. And he had a dusting of black hair on his chest, but it didn\u2019t hide the muscles. They bulged under his skin in...</p><p>\u201cYou felt as if you were going to throw up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mother threw up the first time,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s hot in here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She flapped her hand in front of her face.</p><p>\u201cYour mother vomited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Many women do, you know,\u201d Poppy said, chattering to cover up the fact that it was\u2014he was making her feel quite peculiar.</p><p>\u201cThey vomit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just such a shock. And so\u2014well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnpleasant,\u201d he said, his mouth tight now. He pulled off his breeches in one smooth gesture.</p> <p>Poppy felt the most peculiar sensation in her stomach. Fletch\u2019s legs were long and golden-colored. His flank was a smooth curve. Everything about Fletch was beautiful. He had his side to her so she couldn\u2019t see his privates. That wasn\u2019t beautiful, of course, as her mother had pointed out long ago.</p><p>Fletch lowered himself into the bath and threw his head back. His hair slid backwards like black embroidery floss, just the way that Poppy\u2019s was going to do from now on. He was so beautiful that she felt her mouth go dry. The sweep of muscle, golden skin, and there\u2014between his legs\u2014</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine how he kept it from being visible all the time, the way it stood out from his body like that. He must have to keep it penned in, the way her stays trapped her breasts. He had his eyes closed, so she leaned back against the pillows and looked.</p><p>He looked, well, elegant. Powerful.</p><p>The whole sight made Poppy start shivering a little, because it made her think about how he used to come over her and say, \u201cPoppy, are you ready?\u201d And she always nodded because she was desperate to get it over with. And then he would rub there, against her, and sometimes...</p><p>The memory of it made her feel feverish between her legs and she turned her head away.</p><p>Fletch, meanwhile, closed his eyes more tightly and smiled to himself. Things were going along quite well. A tiny sprig of hope was blossoming in his chest.</p><p>\u201cWill you wash my hair?\u201d he said, leaning his knees against the sides of the tub so that his wife could have her fill of looking, if she wanted. \u201cYou could pull on my shirt.\u201d</p> <p>She could hardly say no, so she came behind him and started washing. He arched his back into her hands, and gave a little stifled groan.</p><p>Her hands froze. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>He thought she sounded breathless. \u201cIt feels so good,\u201d he said hoarsely, laying it on as thick as he dared.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d she said, rubbing his head harder.</p><p>By the time she had finished, he\u2019d thought up another scheme. \u201cPoppy, would you mind washing my legs? I\u2019m so large that I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll turn this tub over.\u201d He rocked it a little to illustrate and water splashed onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want those footmen up here again. They already think that we\u2019re half-cracked.\u201d</p><p>He reached out a long leg. \u201cWould you mind?\u201d If he said so himself, his legs were fine, though his crown jewels were what he really wanted her to inspect. She looked as pink as an Easter cake as she rubbed a cloth over his ankles. He bent his knee so that she could reach his thighs more easily.</p><p>She kept stealing looks at him, so finally he did her a favor and threw back his head (he was starting to get a neck cramp) and closed his eyes again. \u201cThanks, sugarplum,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The cloth was inching up his thigh. He didn\u2019t dare even take a peek from under his lashes because if she looked interested he would have to throw the tub to the side and leap on her. That wasn\u2019t in his plan.</p><p>He let her get close to the crown jewels, but not close enough to touch. \u201cWould you mind doing the other one?\u201d he murmured, pulling his right leg back.</p><p>But instead of a slow caress of his ankle, a cloth rubbed him so fast and hard that he probably lost half his leg hair. Two seconds later she was tossing a towel in his direction and he was wondering what went wrong.</p><p>Probably it had to do with the jewels themselves.</p><p>Damn it, if most women threw up\u2014and he\u2019d never heard that before, but what did he know?\u2014perhaps she was feeling a little nauseated. He knew damn well that he was a lot bigger than most men.</p><p>Not that it had ever done him any good, he thought morosely.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we wear for nightclothes?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>While he was standing in front of the fire, drying himself, she had tucked herself into the bed. She had her eyes rigidly on the far wall, the better not to see him, he supposed.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get something,\u201d he said, pulling on his breeches and shirt. It took some rearranging to fit everything into its proper place, since certain parts of his body didn\u2019t seem to have recognized that the game was up, for the night at least.</p><p>All the way down the stairs he told himself that he didn\u2019t desire her. OK, that he did desire her, but that nothing was going to happen. Nothing.Nothing. He was as neutered...as neutered. Think St. Albans, he told himself. You think St. Albans walks around in this state?</p><p>The thought was certainly dampening, though his body paid no attention.</p><p>What was a bit more dampening was the vision of himself and Poppy dressed in the landlord\u2019s night clothing. The man had offered a nightrail owned by Elsie, but Fletch thought cleanliness might be an issue. So when the landlord offered two clean nightshirts, he grabbed them.</p><p>In the end it wasn\u2019t so hard to rein in his inner de vil. Once they had eaten, and were back in bed, Poppy told him the idea she\u2019d had about the possum and its strange thumb. And then he started to tell her about his talk, and she liked it so much that he actually got up and gave it. Without notes.Striding back and forth in front of the fire, the landlord\u2019s nightshirt flapping around his knees.</p><p>At first Poppy kept breaking into giggles, but he saw exactly when she started listening. And he saw when the spell was broken and mentally dropped the next two paragraphs and swept into a conclusion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She clapped and he felt so proud that he was grinning like a maniac. \u201cThere can\u2019t be a lord in the house to disagree with you!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just because of some advice from Beaumont,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, it\u2019s all about telling a story, rather than actually parsing out the arguments. And then you pointed out that it would be better to be clear and simple\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she was giggling again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your\u2014your thing,\u201d she said, covering up her mouth, \u201cwhen you don\u2019t have it trapped in your breeches, it\u2019s so hopelessly odd-looking, Fletch! You have to forgive me, but\u2014\u201d and she broke into peals of laughter.</p><p>Fletch looked down and there it was, proudly tenting the front of the blasted nightshirt. Well, he couldn\u2019t expect any different. Poppy was drowned in acres of fabric, but her hair was curling in adorable ringlets, and she was the prettiest, sweetest, most delicious thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a man\u2019s curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Poppy said, sobering. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t laugh. After all, you never laugh at my breasts, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said with absolute truth.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet they\u2019re just as odd in their own way. I mean, if I ever have children they\u2019ll leak milk and even now they bobble all around, and once in a while they actually fall out of my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery odd,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cOdd. Very odd.\u201d And then because he couldn\u2019t think of another thing to say that didn\u2019t involve close contact with those breasts, he suggested they go to sleep.</p><p>So he snuffed the candle and climbed back into the featherbed. The snow had stopped a while ago; to Fletch\u2019s regret it seemed likely that they would be able to leave in the morning. This storm wouldn\u2019t keep them in the bed for a hundred years.</p><p>He was lying on his back, staring up into the darkness of the rafters when a small hand crept into his. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that you came to Oxford with me,\u201d Poppy whispered.</p><p>He was too. But he was afraid to tell her why in case he ruined it all.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re my responsibility,\u201d he said, a bit roughly. \u201cI\u2019ll always look out for you, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>He thought she sounded a little disappointed, but maybe it was just wishful thinking.</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>It was only as Charlotte climbed out of the hackney the next day that she realized that she\u2019d forgotten to put her Bible in her bag. Not that it really mattered, but she had convinced May (who thought her visits were scandalous) that she was succoring the dying by reading biblical passages.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worried his immortal soul is lost,\u201d she had explained.</p><p>May dithered, torn between distrust and an innate wish to help. \u201cI just wish there was someone else who could do the succoring,\u201d she had said over and over, wringing her hands. \u201cWhy must you be the one to read aloud the Bible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will think anything of it, if they learn of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey certainly will!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if he dies,\u201d Charlotte had said.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d May had said. \u201cIt seems so...\u201d</p><p>But Charlotte had stayed up half the night thinking about it. \u201cI don\u2019t see how Villiers can possibly survive. He\u2019s had a fever for months now. He\u2019s thin as a rail and stretched...you can see it. It\u2019s a terribly cruel way to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d May said.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do, I shall.\u201d</p><p>May wrung her hands again but they both knew Charlotte had no choice. Yet for all Charlotte talked of death, she had a plan. Villiers perked up when she sparred with him. He needed that. When he wasn\u2019t fighting, he lay quietly in his gray and sleepy room. He let himself slip away. But when she insulted him and fought with him, he woke up.</p><p>It probably wouldn\u2019t work. But it was the only thing she could think of.</p><p>She walked into his bedchamber, ready to insult him, and stopped. Villiers wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Propped against the window on the far side of the bed was a lean man with a rugged face. His eyes were black as midnight, with great circles under them, as if he\u2019d had no sleep. Even tired, there was no mistaking those sharp-cut cheekbones; she looked from Villiers to the stranger and back again.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d the man drawled, not bothering to come to a standing position. \u201cYour churchifier has shown up and damned if she doesn\u2019t see a resemblance between the fanciest man in the ton and myself.\u201d</p><p>Villiers had been lying with his eyes shut. His skin looked translucent to Charlotte, drawn tightly over his cheekbones. He opened them now and looked\u2014with the same eyes as his relative\u2014at Charlotte. \u201cThere you are, Miss Tatlock,\u201d he said. He smiled too, that sweet smile that came so rarely.</p><p>She walked over to the bed and looked down at him. \u201cI came to read you the rest of that story I began, but I forgot my Bible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell,\u201d the man by the window said. \"\u2018The Song of Songs,\u2019 Villiers?\u201d</p><p>She would have thought he was horrible except there was something strained in his voice, as if he too were trying to wake Villiers up, make him answer by taunting him.</p><p>\u201cThe story of Jesus\u2019s birth,\u201d she said. \u201cHis Grace was quite curious to find out how it ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBadly,\u201d came the voice from the bed. \u201cIt ends badly, like so much else in life. My dear Miss Tatlock, I find I am hideously tired today.\u201d</p><p>She tried to think of something to say.</p><p>A thin hand waved. \u201cMy cousin. You see, I do have family. Someone has to be duke after me. It\u2019s taken months, but my solicitor just managed to track down the man himself.\u201d</p><p>The future duke grinned at Charlotte, his teeth white against his bronzed skin. \u201cIt\u2019s killing him to admit that such a shaggy type as I will take over the title.\u201d It was true that he wasn\u2019t very elegant. His coat was rumpled and hung open. He was wearing a cravat, of a sort, but it looked nothing like the gorgeous pieces of linen that dukes tied around their necks.</p><p>\u201cCruel,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cHanding over my exquisite house, not to mention my collection of walking sticks, to this sad excuse for a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name, sir?\u201dCharlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cMiles Dautry. I wouldn\u2019t want to be rude, Miss Tatlock, but I think that the duke should preserve his strength at the moment.\u201d</p><p>He was evicting her. But she couldn\u2019t do that before she tried to rouse Villiers. \u201cHow can His Grace possibly relax when the dukedom is going to one such as you?\u201d she asked, sitting down as if Dautry hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cThe very name Villiers is known for exquisite judgment, style, taste...no wonder the duke cannot rest.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of stunned silence in the room. Then Villiers started chuckling. It was weak, but a chuckle. And he opened his eyes and and peered at his cousin.</p><p>\u201cA mess, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019m so pleased that you agree with me, Miss Tatlock. I should have taken him on while I was still on my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late,\u201d Charlotte said quickly. \u201cYou could teach him all the ways of being a duke. How to dress.\u201d</p><p>Dautry snorted but he didn\u2019t say anything, which meant that he saw her plan. He raised an eyebrow at her and she gave him a quick frown, willing him to fall in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Villiers waved his hand again. \u201cToo late. I think the man has never polished his nails. He probably only owns one pair of stockings\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d Dautry said. \u201cI have several.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly all worsted,\u201d Villiers said with a sigh. \u201cAnd his coat...just look at his coat, Miss Tatlock. I may be sick unto death, but even I noticed when that coat entered the room. My only pleasure is that I get to flee this cruel world before a man wearing that coat becomes duke.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte looked. Dautry was singularly broad in the shoulders, wearing a black coat that had nothing to distinguish it but the fact it was made of linsey-woolsey. And it was rumpled.</p> <p>\u201cI rode all night after I got the message,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI see just what you mean, Your Grace,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. A disgrace to the name.\u201d</p><p>Dautry\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat about you, Miss Tatlock? After all, you are surely here hoping to become a duchess?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cI know your type,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re hanging out for a title and merely pretending to do a bit of good works. I expect you hoped Villiers would rally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI was planning to snare the heir. That means you...if I hadn\u2019t had a look at you first! Now I shall have to reformulate all my plans.\u201d</p><p>Villiers started laughing weakly. \u201cHelp me up, Dautry. She\u2019s got you there. No decent woman will marry you when you look more like a dock-worker than a duke. And then what will happen to my poor estate? Handed from man to man without a woman\u2019s intervention?\u201d</p><p>Dautry looked around the bedroom and curled his lip. He still hadn\u2019t unfolded his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t want to insult you, but the house shows signs of a woman\u2019s hand, though you never bothered to marry one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing manly about being a sartorial disgrace,\u201d Villiers said, looking truly awake now. \u201cDautry, you\u2019ll have to submit to my tailor. Dying man\u2019s last wish.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte couldn\u2019t grinning. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the barber,\u201d she said, her voice as sweet as syrup. \u201cNo woman would marry a man who looked like a shag-bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should do the same for Miss Tatlock,\u201d the future duke said, his eyes narrowed. \u201cLook at her gown. I\u2019m surprised that you can tolerate being in the same room with it. Plain serge and tucked in the style of two years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI\u2019m planning to find her a husband. What Miss Tatlock needs is a philosopher. I don\u2019t suppose you know any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a lucky little hymn-singer,\u201d Dautry said, his eyes flicking over her plain gown. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that philosophers rarely venture to sea. We prefer men who do rather than just think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must wear colors,\u201d Villiers said dreamily. \u201cBrilliant colors, jewel colors.\u201d He seemed to be turning a little pink and the words tumbled out in a manner that Charlotte recognized.</p><p>She bit her lip and looked to Dautry. He came over to put a hand on Villiers\u2019s forehead. \u201cA cool cloth, if you please,\u201d he called to the footman outside the door.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s eyes closed again.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tatlock,\u201d Dautry said.</p><p>It was time for her to leave.</p><p>\u201cStrawberries...embroidered taffeta,\u201d Villiers murmured.</p> <p>She could feel Dautry\u2019s eyes on her as she picked up her knotting bag. Then, just as she was leaving, he said: \u201cI trust that you were not indeed hoping to make yourself a duchess, Miss Tatlock?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand him. She didn\u2019t want to turn around, because her eyes were shining with tears, but she did. \u201cI don\u2019t even know him, sir. He gave my name to the valet by accident whilst in a fever, I believe. So, no. But I wished that reading the Bible would keep him alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would agree with you there,\u201d he said with a rueful twist of his lips.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been ill for months,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you here? He\u2019s so alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea he was indisposed. I met him once, at seven years of age. I scarcely recall the event, and I certainly had no idea he\u2019d fought a duel. Fool, at his age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not so old!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut velvet,\u201d the duke suddenly said. \u201cWith roses.\u201d His cheeks were stained with color.</p><p>\u201cToo old to be fighting duels,\u201d Dautry said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you before at any event.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the window and crossed his arms again. \u201cSo you\u2019re not just a good Samaritan happened off the street, but a member of the so-called ton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens by birth and you, sir, are in the same dire predicament,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cActually, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a future duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unlikely duke, and I never spent much time thinking about it. I only inherit due to a younger son two generations back who fell in love with the daughter of a sailor and went to sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sailor!\u201d Of course it all made sense now. He had a windswept look about him, and there were crinkles at the corners of his eyes, for all he couldn\u2019t be more than thirty. A duke\u2019s son turning sailor. What a scandal that must have been! Charlotte couldn\u2019t help grinning. \u201cDid she run away to sea with him?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cCelebration from a dulcet young lady of the ton?\u201d</p><p>She picked up her knotting bag again and slipped through the door. He followed, but stopped in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever stand straight up?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI like to know where the nearest solid support is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not on board ship now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him turn you into a duke too easily. You have to fight every inch of the way, do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if you don\u2019t sound like my mother,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>The words thumped to the bottom of her stomach and she felt the old maid she was. \u201cWell, goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to remake you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get to know him,\u201d she said, halfway down the stair and not turning around. \u201cHe\u2019ll forget me. He doesn\u2019t remember things well. You can take care of him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to put me in cut velvet with roses.\u201d The future duke\u2019s voice was so disgusted that she couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cIt will suit you,\u201d she said. She couldn\u2019t say what she really thought: that there probably wasn\u2019t enough time for a tailor to fashion a whole costume before Villiers slipped away. Charlotte went out the door.</p><p>May sighed with relief when she heard that a member of Villiers\u2019s family had appeared. \u201cWell, of course there had to be an heir!\u201d she trilled. \u201cTrust the man to show up only at the deathbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to be like that,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the impression that he cared much for the dukedom. I think he\u2019s a sailor and had no idea of the duke\u2019s infirmity. He only met the duke once.\u201d</p><p>May\u2019s rounded mouth was as circular as her cheeks. \u201cA sailor!A sailor as the next Duke of Villiers. That\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s\u2014 awful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d A tear rolled down her cheek.</p><p>May gave her a sharp glance. \u201cYou have to put Villiers out of your mind, Lottie.\u201d May only called her by her childhood nickname in moments of the greatest distress. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult, but life is like that. Here! Here\u2019s something that will help.\u201d With all the \u00e9clat of a conjurer with a rabbit, she pulled a franked letter from her pocket. \u201cYou remember how we thought that the Duke of Villiers\u2019s letter was from Beaumont?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaumont wrote to me?\u201d Charlotte said, more puzzled than anything.</p><p>\u201cNo, the duchess did! Perhaps she\u2019s having another dinner!\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte tore open the sheet. \u201cShe\u2019s invited me to her estate for a Christmas house party.\u201d</p><p>May gasped. \u201cChristmas at the duchy! You must go. Though it only begins just before the twenty-fifth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t clear that the Parliament will adjourn until the last minute,\u201d Charlotte explained. \u201cI thought you wanted me to stay away from the duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA house party is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p> <p>May bit her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaumont isn\u2019t attracted to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this proves it, don\u2019t you see? The letter is from the duchess. She would never invite you if the reverse were true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did tell you so,\u201d Charlotte said wearily.</p><p>\u201cYou must go.\u201d May came over and sat down next to Charlotte. \u201cVilliers is going to die soon, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded miserably.</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d May said. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>Poppy came back from Oxford looking as odd as a shorn sheep and without a maid, so Jemma sent a messenger to a brilliant young hair cutter she\u2019d heard talk of, Monsieur Olivier.</p><p>A day later Poppy looked as pretty as a peach, with soft, short curls around a bandeau. \u201cYou\u2019ll set a new style,\u201d Jemma told her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, as long as I don\u2019t have to wear that horrid powder anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of people being sensitive to powder and coming out in red blotches,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cVilliers never touches it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall be judged horribly unfashionable, but it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cI\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Jemma replied, somewhat startled. \u201cThough I never considered dress to be relevant to marital status.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always dressed with the wish to impress Fletch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dress for myself,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cSometimes I spend all day in my dressing gown. But if I do dress, I make myself ravishing because then I feel ravishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never feel ravishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are ravishing, so why ignore the evidence? Here.\u201d She handed over a piece of foolscap. \u201cWhat do you think of my house party? These are the people who\u2019ve accepted my invitation. I\u2019m composing a plan of battle for the estate butler. It\u2019s all very annoying that I\u2019ve never met the staff; I hate relying on unfamiliar help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Poppy said, eyeing the list. \u201cHow many people did you invite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI want this to be an intimate party. And besides, with Villiers ill upstairs, we can\u2019t be too celebratory. It wouldn\u2019t be proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProper? It\u2019s scandalous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never worry about scandalous,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI just worry we will all become sunk in gloom. If he is doing well, we\u2019ll have a huge Twelfth Night party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Villiers agree to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. The only thing that makes me sanguine about his improvement is that he sent me a great many detailed instructions. For one thing, he requested that Miss Tatlock be invited. Isn\u2019t that peculiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Miss Fetlock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Poppy scowled.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve reached the same conclusion I have,\u201d Jemma said, adding a note to her list. \u201cBeaumont asked Villiers to make sure his inamorata would attend. But the curious thing is that I told Beaumont myself that I would invite her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was testing him. Or myself,\u201d she added wryly. \u201cAt any rate, he said he would be very pleased if I would invite La Fetlock, so I would judge the testing a failure, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery foolish on both your parts,\u201d Poppy observed. \u201cEspecially yours.\u201d</p><p>Jemma smiled at her. \u201cA few months ago you wouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did Villiers request?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that he was worried about the state of his soul\u2014which doesn\u2019t bode well for his health, I have to admit\u2014and he wants a few philosophers from Oxford to come to the party. To debate with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t possibly be as ill as is reported if he wishes to hold debates in his bedchamber. What\u2019s more, he wants unmarried philosophers. Most peculiar. And he\u2019s bringing a tailor and a mantua-maker and may bring a bonnet-maker as well. A bonnet-maker, Poppy! Do you think that he\u2019s utterly cracked?\u201d</p><p>Poppy didn\u2019t know and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from asking the only question that really interested her. \u201cDo you think I should send a note to Fletch? I haven\u2019t seen him for two days and while, naturally, I don\u2019t really care what he is doing for Christmas, I thought he might be interested in my curiosities. Perhaps I\u2019ll bring them with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better for him not to know where you are. And that goes double for your mother. She is not invited, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d Poppy said gloomily, \u201cwishes me to pay her a visit at my earliest convenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me say again,\u201d Jemma said, looking alarmed, \u201cthat I may well cancel the house party rather than have your mother, myself and Villiers under one roof. The last time I met your mother in Paris, she told me that I was a daughter of the game. I don\u2019t think that was a compliment, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother never compliments,\u201d Poppy observed. \u201cI can translate the phrase for you, if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t. I prefer to think of it as referring to chess. I find it so wearying to be insulted.\u201d</p><p>Poppy leaned over and gave her a quick hug. \u201cYou are not nearly as degenerate as you pretend, do you realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m twice as much,\u201d Jemma said promptly. \u201cYou\u2019re just too innocent to see the truth of it. Speak to my long-suffering husband on the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHusbands live to be thwarted,\u201d Poppy said mischievously. \u201cOr so a very wise woman told me once.\u201d</p><p>Poppy stepped out of the carriage before the Duke of Fletcher\u2019s townhouse\u2014her own residence\u2014with a surprising little fillip of homesickness. There was no particu lar reason for that; Poppy had lately realized that she had only resided in the house. She had never really made it her own.</p><p>The house was, in a strange way, like her life. Sometimes she felt as if she\u2019d never lived at all, just let her mother be the puppet master.</p><p>That thought had her walking through the front door with her jaw set. As Quince ushered her into the drawing room, she saw in a moment that her mother had not merely lived in the house: she had transformed it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The walls were covered with red-flecked brocade. Huge sconces sprouted from the wall beside the fireplace, gleaming with a combination of brass and gold, candles thrusting in all directions. The fireplace itself could hardly be seen due to a screen set with an embroidery of cabbage roses and edged in a confection of frothing gold scrolls. The furniture had all been gilded to match.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d Poppy asked, smiling at the butler to dismiss him.</p><p>Her mother rose from the depths of a brocaded sofa with all the elegance of Marie Antoinette herself on a Court Reception day. A positive forest of feathers bristled above her towering hair; her shoulders were bare though it was morning, and her dress was as formal as the rest of the room. In short, she looked like the portrait of a duchess.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter,\u201d Lady Flora said, holding out her hand.</p> <p>Poppy curtsied and kissed it.</p><p>Lady Flora backed onto the sofa and sat down. In truth, she would probably only fit on the sofa, given the size of her side-panniers. Poppy sat across from her and waited.</p><p>Sure enough, there was a shriek. It wasn\u2019t a trilled exclamation of female alarm either. It was something like the full-throated bellow of alarm that Poppy had read certain monkeys uttered.</p><p>\u201cYour hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cut it.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother touched her own hair, the horror on her face transferring perhaps into some sort of dread that someone had taken a scissors to her without her notice. \u201cWhy\u2014why\u2014you stupid girl, why would you do such a thing? You look like a common shrimp seller! Don\u2019t tell me that Luce had a hand in this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI terminated Luce\u2019s employment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou terminated Luce! Luce! One of the finest French maids in En gland?\u201d</p><p>She actually gaped. Poppy suppressed a smile. \u201cShe had been gluing feathers into my hair, Mama, and then cutting them out. I couldn\u2019t allow that to continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow she achieved her effects is none of your concern! You should merely admire the effects. And Luce would faint to see you now; at least you were \u00e0 la mode when she was with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hair had to be cut off to remove the snarls.\u201d Poppy eyed the towering series of curls atop her mother\u2019s head. \u201cDo you have any idea how many snarls might be inside your hair, Mama?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound like a common street girl,\u201d her mother said, ignoring the question. \u201cAnd you look like one too. A good French hairdresser isn\u2019t found on the street corner. You\u2019re going to have to find one immediately, before anyone sees you. I did want to tell you that I am gratified by the way that you have not advertised your stay with the Duchess of Beaumont. I have managed to keep it from the majority of my acquaintances.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, her mother was not acquainted with the sort of person who attended the Royal Society lectures. \u201cYou said you wished to speak to me, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is time for you to come home. I am holding a soir\u00e9e tomorrow to celebrate your return to your rightful position. I have reformed your house\u2014and your husband. The young fool has a mistress now and should bother you no further.\u201d</p><p>The odd pinch at Poppy\u2019s heart only lasted a moment. He wouldn\u2019t lie to her. \u201cFletch doesn\u2019t have a mistress, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t insult both of us by lowering your speech to your hair,\u201d her mother said. \u201cFletch! Fletch! He sounds like the unfledged baby that he is. I have addressed him as Your Grace, and I\u2019ll warrant you that he liked it. Men always do. I summoned you, Poppy, because it is time to stop being so foolish and take over your rightful place as the Duchess of Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you were enjoying it,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>The words fell into the drawing room like small stones.</p><p>Lady Flora narrowed her eyes and for the first time she actually looked at Poppy. \u201cSo that\u2019s it, is it?\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous of your mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am not jealous of you,\u201d Poppy said. She hated that tone of voice. Any moment her mother was going to start screaming. Her brain was telling her to rush into speech, to patch over the wrong, to apologize, grovel...</p><p>Lady Flora rose to her feet. Feathers swayed above her head like a crowd of gossiping ladies. \u201cJust what did you mean by that comment?\u201d</p><p>Poppy rose as well, taking time to shake out her skirts. Then she met her mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cI thought you were enjoying living in this house. You have certainly made it more ducal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely brought it to the correct standard.\u201d</p><p>Poppy said nothing.</p><p>Lady Flora took a step toward her. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it? After I spent months of my life, decorating the house that you were too stupid and timid to change into the appropriate dwelling for a duchess, you don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>Poppy wanted to step backwards, if only because spittle hit her cheek, but she merely wiped it off.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s voice rose. \u201cYou are jealous of my beauty and my refinement! You take after your father and it is not my fault that you are such a pitiful substitute for a duchess. I did my best! I raised you to your station in life!\u201d</p><p>And then her hand flashed and she slapped Poppy across the face.</p><p>It was such a blow that Poppy\u2019s head whipped backward and she fell back a step. But in some odd way, it wasn\u2019t very painful. Since she had expected it.</p><p>Lady Flora threw herself back onto the couch and began to sob in a fashion that indicated to all who knew her\u2014and Poppy had no doubt that Fletch\u2019s staff knew her well by now\u2014that a full-fledged fit of hysterics was about to erupt.</p><p>Poppy stooped and picked up her brocaded bag. Then she said, \u201cMama.\u201d</p><p>Her mother raised her head and glared. \u201cYou are too much for me. What did I do to deserve such a fate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am leaving,\u201d Poppy told her. \u201cI love you. But I don\u2019t wish to see you again. You may stay with Fletch for a period of time, if you wish. Certainly hold your soir\u00e9e tomorrow. But then I must ask you to return to your own establishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forbid you to go back to that house of sin!\u201d her mother shrilled, suddenly forgetting her tears. \u201cThe Duchess of Beaumont is as much a disgrace to her title as you are. She\u2019s a trull, who should be walking the streets in the dark instead of poisoning the very title she holds. I heard it on the best of authority that she is paying Lord Strange a visit this Christmas\u2014at Fonthill! No one frequents that house but fornicators!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>Her hands were trembling, but she didn\u2019t stop, not even when her mother bellowed her name. She just reached out and pushed open the door to the corridor. She felt oddly detached and yet calmly triumphant.</p><p>She had done all that she could.</p><p>Quince took one look at her and began to stammer. Poppy put a hand to her cheek. It stung and was likely quite red. An appalling noise was beginning in the drawing room. \u201cDo you help my mother\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>But the front door swung open and a footman ushered in Fletch and his friend Gill.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s hand flew back to her cheek but the moment their eyes met, she knew it was foolish to try to conceal it. In one stride he was pulling away her hand.</p><p>Then it was as if all the footmen and the butler faded away, leaving no one but the two of them in the antechamber. Fletch\u2019s hair fell over his eyes and he put one arm around her and pulled her close. Without saying a word he bent to kiss her bruised cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she whispered to his chest.</p><p>He put her from him, just enough so he could look down in her face and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not all right.\u201d</p><p>Gill was sending the butler and the footmen scurrying in all directions. Then he whisked himself away into the library.</p><p>\u201cI knew what she would do,\u201d Poppy told him.</p> <p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother has a temper. I knew that if she were pressed, she would strike me. She\u2019s never been able to resist it in moments of greatest fury. I said something that made her furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill her.\u201d Fletch\u2019s face had utterly transformed. He didn\u2019t look pretty, as her mother called him, now. He looked violent, like flame and gunpowder mixed, like a man who would take on a mob with his bare fists.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Poppy said, smiling at him although the motion made her wince as her cheek was starting to swell. \u201cI caused it to happen, Fletch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it quite a bit in the past few months. I decided that I would be her daughter only if she never struck me again. Until I went to Jemma\u2019s house, you see, I never had a chance to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you not tell me!\u201d His voice was tight with rage. But not at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, she hasn\u2019t struck me since our marriage began,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAnd not for a considerable time before that. I\u2019d become very good at appeasing her, you see. As long I had behaved well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy marrying a duke.\u201d His hands fell from her shoulders.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cTrue. I married a duke. But I really thought I was in love with you, Fletch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hardly believe that you were thinking clearly on the subject.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d</p><p>Something came between them, the cold ugly truth of it. And still her mother\u2019s grating sobs echoed through the door beside them.</p><p>\u201cYour mother must leave my house,\u201d Fletch said, and the level of barely controlled violence in his voice made Poppy shiver.</p><p>\u201cShe will. I humiliated her, you see. And I told her she had to leave. I\u2019ve never given her instructions before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it. I suppose\u2014I suppose you don\u2019t wish to stay?\u201d And without giving her a chance to answer. \u201cWhy would you?\u201d He lifted his head and bellowed, \u201cQuince!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d the butler said, popping back out of the green baize door with an alacrity that suggested his ear had been pasted to the door.</p><p>\u201cMy coach waits outside. Her Grace will return to the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s house. And for God\u2019s sake, could you send someone in there to stop that caterwauling?\u201d He jerked his head toward the drawing room.</p><p>Poppy swallowed. \u201cI would think that Mother will stay two or three days, just enough to show me that my command was not important. She holds a soir\u00e9e tomorrow, and then she will leave shortly after that. I know her quite well, you see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Fletch said grimly. \u201cGo home, Poppy. I am\u2014\u201d for a moment the rage dropped from his face and he looked starkly anguished. \u201cI am just so damned sorry that my house wasn\u2019t a safe place for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t always been like this, Fletch. You are seeing my mother at her very worst.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened again. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to see her again in any form, ever, Poppy. Is that all right with you?\u201d</p><p>Guilt almost sapped her strength, but then she said, \u201cYes.\u201d And then, \u201cYes.\u201d It helped to say it twice. To live her own life, to cut free the puppet strings.</p><p>She turned and allowed the butler to wrap her in her pelisse and then walked to the carriage.</p><p>In Poppy\u2019s mind, she turned her back on her mother. She walked proudly, without a backward look.</p><p>But to any story, there\u2019s always another side. Had she looked backward, she would have seen her husband, standing with a look of absolute despair on his face. In Fletch\u2019s mind, she had forgotten to say goodbye to him, but then, why would she?</p><p>The ugliness behind their marriage had solidified into something much worse than mere lack of desire on her part.</p><p>She walked away from him as if she never cared to see him again. Which made sense. He was nothing more than the man she was forced to marry by threat of violence.</p><p>He threw open the library door and Gill jerked his head up. \u201cI\u2019m going to St. Anne\u2019s Hill, if you wish to come.\u201d</p><p>Gill rose. \u201cWhere\u2019s your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Anne\u2019s Hill? You mean Elizabeth Armistead\u2019s residence? And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to pay a visit to the courtesan I told you about, Cressida. She\u2019s charming. You\u2019ll like her.\u201d</p><p>Gill shot him a look. But a friend of the heart knows when the moment comes to hold his tongue, and there was something in Fletch\u2019s face he\u2019d never seen before, and he\u2019d just as soon never see again.</p><p>If Cressida could make that look go away, Gill would happily throw her a purse himself.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>On the way to the Duke of Beaumont\u2019s country seat December 15</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Your Grace?\u201d Finchley asked for perhaps the five hundredth time.</p><p>Villiers ground his teeth and thought about whether pulling one of the side arms out of the carriage pocket and shooting himself would answer that question. But why bother?</p><p>He was no fool. He\u2019d never felt worse in his life. Even lying flat during the whole damned carriage ride didn\u2019t make any difference. A gun wasn\u2019t really necessary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d he snarled at Finchley. \u201cHow in the bleeding hell do you think I feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrritable,\u201d Finchley rejoined. \u201cYou\u2019re not dying, Your Grace.\u201d His poor valet was one of the few who refused to accept the truth. \u201cYou\u2019re on your way to a Christmas house party, just as you always do at this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore fool me,\u201d he murmured. The fever was coming on again. He knew its calling card by now. It came in as inexorably as the tide of the ocean and swept him under. He tossed about in a red haze on the brink of succumbing, as undirected as a piece of jetsam.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Miss Tatlock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll join us at the duke\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Benjamin?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>\u201cBarnabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Barnabe?\u201d Finchley said. \u201cYour Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDautry?My cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll join us as well,\u201d Finchley said soothingly.</p><p>But he was slipping away. One of these days he\u2019d stay under, but at that moment the carriage lurched, and jolted his side. The pain was so excruciating that he woke up again with a cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace.\u201d Finchley sounded close to tears and that sobered Villiers as much as the pain. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon, I promise. Another hour or two, that\u2019s all. I shouldn\u2019t have let you do this.\u201d</p><p>It was the right thing to do, though Villiers had no energy to explain it. He\u2019d had two friends in his life, Benjamin and Elijah. Elijah had turned into the Duke of Beaumont, a pompous politician. Benjamin was gone.</p><p>He\u2019d ask for Elijah\u2019s forgiveness, politician or no. For what, he didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t remember their quarrel now. It happened so many years ago, but it took place at Beaumont\u2019s house, so it made sense to go there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Say goodbye, he thought dimly. Make it all right. And then he let himself slip away again where it didn\u2019t hurt quite as much.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wake up for hours, not til he\u2019d been slipped between linen sheets. What woke him up, finally, was the bellowing. Well, that and the fact that someone had slipped a knife under his arm pit.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he panted. \u201cChrist.\u201d He flailed a bit, tried to open his eyes, panted. Dimly thought that he expected to fade onto the red tide, not leave in a wash of icy pain. It didn\u2019t seem fair. The knife turned again. \u201cBloody hell!\u201d And he managed to pry his eyes open.</p><p>There was a big man standing over him, a kind of rustic monster with a bushy beard. With one huge paw he was holding him down and with the other he was doing...something to his shoulder. Something that was so excruciatingly painful that all Villiers could do was pant. He tried to twist away and humiliatingly, couldn\u2019t even stir under the great hand holding him down.</p> <p>\u201cHold on,\u201d the man said in a sticky Scottish brogue. \u201cI have to get this wound cleaned out or you\u2019re done for.\u201d</p><p>Villiers would have said something, would have protested, would have\u2014it wasn\u2019t a red tide this time; it was a black wash that covered his eyes and threw him off a cliff.</p><p>\u201cThank God for that,\u201d Dr. Treglown said. For the country bear was a doctor. \u201cAch, and this is a benighted mess, it is. Who in the bloody hell\u2019s been taking care of the duke, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe surgeon, Dr. Banderspit,\u201d Finchley said. \u201cIs it because I wouldn\u2019t let him bleed the duke? He kept wanting to bleed him and I wouldn\u2019t allow it. Is it all my fault?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Treglown rolled his eyes and started pouring something over the wound that smelled like acid. It even smoked a little. \u201cYou\u2019d have killed him for sure if he\u2019d been bled, so there\u2019s a happy thought for ye. With this infection in him, he must have the constitution of a bloody ox to have survived this long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Finchley whispered.</p><p>\u201cCleaning the damn thing.Disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cleaned it,\u201d Finchley said anxiously. \u201cWe did clean it with lots of brandy, just as the surgeon told us to, until it finally healed over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandy! Chaw!\u201d</p><p>Finchley wasn\u2019t sure what \u201cchaw\u201d meant, but he didn\u2019t mean to enquire. There was the master, lying as still as death. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s not gone?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe\u2019s looking\u2014bad. I can\u2019t see him breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is bad,\u201d the doctor said, turning away to wash his hands. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see what came out of that wound? It was killing him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it was all mended on top,\u201d Finchley said miserably. \u201cI didn\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason you should have,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cYer not calling yourself by the name of \u2018surgeon,\u2019 are ye?\u201d His sneer was frightful. \u201cThis time we\u2019re keeping it open, you hear? You\u2019re going to wash that wound four times a day with spirits of turpentine.\u201d He put a black bottle down on the bureau with a clink. \u201cYer duke here is going to yell like the de vil when he comes around enough to notice what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019d better prepare yerself. And I\u2019ll stop by tomorrow night. If he lives til then, he might survive. Or he might not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Finchley moaned. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Treglown said. \u201cThere\u2019s a few days still. I expect you\u2019ll know fairly soon whether he\u2019s going to blight the ceremonies by tumbling into the grave. Wash it again in six hours. You\u2019ll have to do it during the night too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Finchley said. \u201cYes, sir, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the rest of the party coming? Beaumont himself and the duchess? We\u2019ve never seen her, you know. She flit off to Paris before coming to the country. My patients are all beside themselves with excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a few days, as I understand it.\u201d</p><p>Treglown chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019ll make an unusual house party, I\u2019d say. Dying duke howling off in the rafters. It sounds like one of them women\u2019s novels to me.\u201d</p> <p>Finchley looked around at the gracious old bedchamber. The Duchess of Beaumont had sent orders ahead to put Villiers in the royal suite. He would like the irony of it, if he woke up long enough to see it.</p><p>\u201cLots of liquids, if you can get him to drink,\u201d Treglown said, taking himself out the door. \u201cI\u2019ll try to stop back later, if I can. There\u2019s babies sprouting all over the place, and the midwife\u2019s just had one of her own. I hardly have time to deal with the handiwork of asinine London surgeons!\u201d He snorted and left.</p><p>Finchley looked at his master.</p><p>He was lying on the bed, as straight as a board, as if he were ready to be measured for a coffin.</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>December 20</p><p>Beaumont\u2019s country estate was near Sturminster Newton, in Dorset, at least three days from London. As soon as they had travel rugs tucked around them and heated bricks snuggled against their toes, Poppy blurted it out. \u201cDo you think that Fletch will follow us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the fourth time you\u2019ve asked me that question since we sent his invitation,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI haven\u2019t a different answer from last time: I don\u2019t know. But I do think that repetition points to something, wouldn\u2019t you say? You\u2019re not acting like an estranged wife, happy to dance off to Paris for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you cried for months,\u201d Poppy said weakly.</p><p>\u201cI cried because I was broken-hearted. But you are an odd combination of anxious and cheerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he still loves me,\u201d Poppy said with a rush.</p><p>Jemma gave her a crooked little smile. \u201cYou see? Your marriage and mine have no similarity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough he doesn\u2019t desire me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother said that men are fickle and lose interest in a woman\u2019s body after a number of years. Fletch agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my experience,\u201d Jemma said, \u201ca man is quite happy to greet anyone who shows up ready for the business, as it were. If there\u2019s a smiling woman in his bed, he won\u2019t make a fuss about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Fletch said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t listen too carefully to what men say. Perhaps he wants you to desire him,\u201d Jemma interrupted.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not\u2014well\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked at her shrewdly. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know when you desire someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like taking his clothes off,\u201d Jemma said bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to know when you don\u2019t feel desire. For example, when you see Lord Manning, do you feel that it would be very nice to stroke his tummy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now replace that image with one of Fletch. Would you like to stroke his...tummy?\u201d</p><p>Poppy couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cYou are absurd, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen\u2019s bodies were made to be admired. That\u2019s one thing that your mother seems to have forgotten. You are lucky: you\u2019ve got a husband who seems interested in paying your body appropriate attention. Now you just have to learn how to do the same to him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel that way anymore,\u201d Poppy said, feeling a prickle of sadness.</p><p>Jemma snorted. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if he comes to the house party after the note I sent with his invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned that I was inviting naturalists and philosophers, so he would find the party remarkably tedious. By the way, a footman brought me a note this morning that Villiers has arrived before us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Beaumont told me that he\u2019d trade our marriage to have Villiers live. I was furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would I be!\u201d Poppy put in.</p><p>\u201cBut part of me agrees with him. Villiers is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met him. What is he like?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s charming, wry, fierce, arrogant and incredibly clever. And he\u2019s a chess master,\u201d she added, as if that explained everything.</p><p>On their third day of traveling it was already dark before the carriage rocked to a halt at the Ring O\u2019Roses inn. The innkeeper ran out gibbering with excitement over the visit of not one duchess, but two. \u201cYour servants have everything ready for you, Your Graces,\u201d he kept saying, rubbing his hands together.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace has already arrived as well,\u201d the innkeeper told Jemma.</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought Beaumont had a last session of Parliament. I was beginning to be afraid those men would never close down this year. He must have ridden like the wind to catch up with us.\u201d</p><p>But when they walked into the inn it was clear that the dukes had been confused, for Poppy glanced into the common room as they passed the open door\u2014and stopped. There was a tall man sitting at the back of the room, leaning against the rough wooden wall. His silky hair was tied back. He was wearing all black. He looked every inch a duke.</p> <p>As Poppy stood there, fixed to the ground, Fletch looked up and saw her. He lifted a tankard in greeting.</p><p>Suddenly her entire body melted with racing excitement. She lifted her hand and waved to him, as if she were a five-year-old again. He was sitting with his legs stretched out before him. And he wasn\u2019t quite as elegant as formerly. His coat hung open, and he wore a plain neck cloth.</p><p>It made her feel queer, so she almost ran down the narrow corridor after Jemma.</p><p>Jemma took one look at her, and said, \u201cWell, I gather Beaumont is still debating the end of the civilized world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came,\u201d Poppy whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharing your room?\u201d Jemma asked with a mischievous look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many rooms have we for the party?\u201d Jemma asked, turning to the innkeeper.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s the three of you with the best rooms in the house,\u201d he said anxiously. \u201cAnd then six more for your entourage. I hope that you\u2019ll find everything to your satisfaction, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Poppy\u2019s heart fell a bit. She dreaded making love to Fletch. So why would she want him to share a room with her?</p><p>\u201cI told you he was tired of me,\u201d she said to Jemma under her breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to his room naked and see what happens? I\u2019ll bet you my best chess set that you spend the night in his room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be so embarrassing,\u201d Poppy muttered, appalled that she was even considering it.</p><p>Jemma and Fletch teased and flirted all the way through supper, while Poppy sat there tongue-tied, feeling like a stupid younger sister.</p><p>He\u2019d brought a copy of The Tatler. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to read it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I understand that your house party is viewed with disapprobation, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>Jemma snatched the paper from his hand. \u201cLet me see that!\u201d She bent over it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about my party, but about you, Fletch. My goodness. I gather your recent speech in the House was a remarkable success.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cWhen did The Tatler begin reporting on political matters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just read it?\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt appears that the young Duke of Fletcher gave a short disquisition\u2014what on earth is a disquisition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA speech,\u201d he said, looking rather embarrassed. \u201cI gave a speech about the French trade bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to this, your speech caused the entire House of Lords to leap to their feet shouting in support. The paper maintains that any peer who dares disagree with you proves himself to be as false as he is covetous. Good work, Fletch!\u201d</p><p>Poppy leaned forward and touched his hand. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes locked for a moment.</p><p>\u201cApparently there were calls on the floor that Fletch should be made the Secretary of State on the spot,\u201d Jemma continued. \u201cAnd it says that the opposition party is shaking in their boots at the idea of the duke\u2019s rhetorical power being wielded against them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolishness,\u201d Fletch said.</p><p>Poppy just smiled at him.</p><p>Jemma turned the newspaper over. \u201cOh dear! Here\u2019s the bit about my party. It\u2019s really about my brother. They think that all duelers should be sent to France, given the Duke of Villiers\u2019s imminent demise. I\u2019m sure that includes sisters as well. For, and I quote, \u2018the crime of base vulgarity.\u2019 Vulgarity!\u201d she repeated. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m never vulgar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe word only describes the actions of other people?\u201d Fletch enquired.</p><p>\u201cNaturally. I put a whole host of words in that category.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin.\u201d</p><p>Fletch burst out laughing. He hardly even glanced at Poppy; he was so busy flirting with Jemma. And yet she couldn\u2019t take her eyes from him. He\u2019d shed that overly precious air he used to have, though his coat still fit across his broad shoulders without a wrinkle.</p><p>\u201cSurely you too have a group of words that you would never apply to yourself,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he, Poppy? Help me. Let\u2019s see...limp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly applies to other men,\u201d Fletch said promptly.</p><p>Poppy hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what they were talking about, but she smiled.</p><p>\u201cPhoenix is a good word,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cNo matter how the flames burn, it always rises again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>Jemma was giggling, but Fletch said, \u201cVulgarities,\u201d and then shut his mouth.</p><p>Her mother said that a lady should never acknowledge a vulgarity but pretend the solecism didn\u2019t exist. \u201cCould you explain it to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The serving maid let out a giggle too, which made Poppy even more curious.</p><p>\u201cYou do the honors,\u201d Jemma told Fletch.</p><p>Fletch blinked. \u201cThe phoenix in question is a man\u2019s privates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cAnd the fire is syphilis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said hastily. \u201cI\u2019ll explain the other part of the reference later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I understand it. Shakespeare talks of castles melting away, like the baseless vision of a dream. Your phoenix, I gather, doesn\u2019t melt away.\u201d</p><p>In answer to Jemma\u2019s laughter and Fletch\u2019s look of shock she said, \u201cI have been married for four years. And I spend a great deal of time working alongside beneficiaries of the Charitable Society for the Reception of Repenting Prostitutes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou alarm me,\u201d Jemma said, grinning at her.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the new print by George Townly Stubbs called His Highness in Fitz?\u201d Poppy asked.</p><p>\u201cIn Fitz?\u201d Jemma asked. \u201cDo you mean to say, in Mrs. Fitzherbert?\u201d</p><p>Poppy nodded. \u201cHe is clothed. But Mrs. Fitzherbert isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Fletch chimed in with a print he\u2019d seen of the prince called The Morning after the Marriage, and Poppy, feeling that she\u2019d proved herself less than a idiotic innocent, went back to watching her husband.</p><p>He still had the little beard, just enough to cover the dimple in his chin, but she actually liked it. He looked more manly with it. Not at all pretty, as her mother used to call him.</p><p>Fletch wasn\u2019t pretty. Not a bit. His eyes were black in the center, but with a ring of odd gray-blue color around them. With his hair pulled back, and no powder, he looked as wild as the men who roam the American forests, wrestling with alligators and catching possums.</p><p>Suddenly Poppy realized that the servant bringing their dishes was sending Fletch a kind of signal. She kept brushing her bosom against his shoulder, for example, and leaning down next to him to offer a spoonful of this or that, so that even Poppy could see straight down into her bosom.</p><p>Her breasts were much bigger than Poppy\u2019s. Huge, really. And the way she kept licking her lips was absolutely revolting.</p> <p>Finally the girl managed to pry herself away from Fletch long enough to come around to Poppy\u2019s side of the table and offer her a pyramid cream. The creams were shaped in mounds, and looked just as shaky as the girl\u2019s breasts, to Poppy.</p><p>She took another drink of her wine while she thought about it. Meanwhile the girl brushed some crumbs off Fletch\u2019s lap\u2014his lap! And Fletch didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>The girl came again to her to pour her some tea, her distaste barely concealed. And why?Because Poppy didn\u2019t immediately understand the phoenix joke? She bent down and Poppy looked straight into her enormous breasts.</p><p>It was the work of a moment to scoop up her pudding and drop the rounded thing straight down her bodice.</p><p>The girl shrieked and leaped in the air.</p><p>Poppy stood up and smiled sweetly. \u201cOh my goodness, it must have slipped right out of my hand,\u201d she cooed.</p> <p>The innkeeper came to the door, took one look and grabbed the girl by the arm. They could hear him all the way up the corridor. \u201cI\u2019ve told you and told you,\u201d he was shouting. \u201cSave those Bartholomew wares of yours for them as wants them. You\u2019ve disgraced me one too many times.\u201d</p><p>Jemma was laughing again. \u201cIt\u2019s like the phoenix, hatched out right before my eyes!\u201d</p><p>Fletch stood up and stretched. He could almost reach the ceiling. And that put his crotch level with Poppy\u2019s eyes. His breeches were tight as possible. They outlined his muscled thighs as if they\u2019d been painted on.</p><p>\u201cWife,\u201d he said lazily, \u201cyou\u2019re frightening me.\u201d</p><p>Poppy stood and tossed her hair. It felt wonderful to feel her hair move with her body. She flounced down the corridor before him until a large warm hand curled around her waist.</p><p>A deep voice said in her ear, \u201cI really should give you a scolding, Perdita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl deserved what she got!\u201d Poppy snapped, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>He laughed down at her and the blood raced recklessly through her veins. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly room in your bodice for a pudding,\u201d he observed, looking down. \u201cThough it would be interesting to use them as a plate.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze followed his. From this angle, her breasts didn\u2019t look meager. Oddly, she felt a prickling all over as if he might touch\u2014</p><p>But he took her arm and started walking down the corridor as if nothing had happened.</p><p>The one thought in Poppy\u2019s head was that she was too late. She was no fool. The depraved warmth between her thighs meant desire. And she would quite like Fletch to eat pudding from her breasts.</p><p>She\u2019d found it.</p><p>She\u2019d found that desire for her husband that Jemma talked about, and it was only her stupidity that meant she\u2019d found it four years too late.</p><p>Chapter 43</p><p>Poppy thought there was a chance\u2014all right, a remote chance, but a chance\u2014that Fletch would come to her room that night. Perhaps just to say goodnight? She took out her curiosities to show him, in case he knocked on the door.</p><p>But no.</p><p>So she lay in her bed and examined the crystalline structure of her geode again. Then she picked up the little statue of Cupid and Psyche. When she bought it, she thought only of the outspread wings of the butterfly. It was a marvel, the way an insect made of stone could look so airy, as if it were on the verge of flight.</p><p>But now she looked at Cupid, kneeling before his beloved Psyche. This was no plump, pouting Cupid as is often depicted, but a lithe youth with tumbled hair and long, lean flanks. She found herself running a finger along his naked back, over the muscles in his legs. His wings were not stone lacework, but powerfully muscled, thickly feathered, ready to carry him straight from the ground to the sky.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help thinking that in choosing the piece because of the butterfly, she had overlooked something far more interesting than a stone insect.</p><p>Even when she put the statue and the geode away, she couldn\u2019t sleep, but lay awake and had the most peculiar thoughts. It was as if she couldn\u2019t live in her own skin. Her mind kept skipping off to Fletch\u2019s room, and thinking of him without his shirt on, the way she saw him when he took a bath. And in her imagination he would stand up from the bath and shake himself, and water flew in all directions.</p><p>Poppy wiggled around in the bed, trying to get comfortable. Even thinking of Fletch made her feel most\u2014</p><p>He would stand up and water drops would slide down his chest, down, down to that private place. In truth, she rarely looked at him, not for at least the first year of their marriage, because she was so afraid that she would throw up, the way her mother assured her she would.</p><p>But after all, what was there? An odd thing, a thing that stood out like\u2014like a bar from his body. That looked pink and yet felt hard.</p><p>But remembering how it felt between her legs seemed utterly different now. It felt as if she were all melting there, and as if she would quite like Fletch to\u2014</p><p>She turned over again. What was happening to her? Even licking her lips made her feel a bit feverish. And she was all damp under the covers. She pushed back all the quilts. She still felt boiling hot, so she pulled up her nightgown.</p><p>But that was all different too. For there her body lay in the moonlight. She stared down at herself. It felt almost as if a fairy had come along and exchanged her body for another, like the old stories about baby swapping. Those were definitely her breasts. Except they looked plumper, somehow. And her nipples were a very nice color, she thought. She\u2019d seen the kitchen maid\u2019s nipples because of the way her dress hung open and they weren\u2019t nearly as nice.</p><p>Plus her legs were long and\u2014she sat up\u2014they were a nice shape, as these things go. Her mind kept skittering all over the place, and now she was remembering Fletch kissing a line up the inside of her thigh. Except when he did it her head was itching so much that she felt as if it was on fire, and all she could remember was staring down at his head and thinking, please finish, kiss faster, please kiss faster!</p><p>Now...She let her leg fall open a little bit. She wished he was kissing her right now. Her hair was all loose and she\u2019d brushed it out herself. She was developing a bit of an obsession there, and had to brush it over and over herself every night. But it wasn\u2019t bad. She liked the way her hair felt soft and silky under her fingers, not the way it used to when her maid was crimping it every day and gluing things into it, and rubbing it with tallow to make it the right shape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Fletch were kissing her now, he would kiss right up the pale part of her leg, and then higher, by her knee. She shivered a little bit, thinking about it and wrapped her arms around her chest. Which made her breasts start tingling. And then he\u2019d kiss higher, one had to think, and then...</p><p>Of course he would kiss her breasts. She touched where he would kiss her. And then...</p><p>And by the end of another hour, the night was turning itself inside out, into a velvet shell in which her body was lying as she thought of Fletch doing this, and Fletch doing that. And finally she kept thinking about one night, when her hair hadn\u2019t been so terrible, and Fletch had been kissing her\u2014there.</p><p>At the time she hadn\u2019t thought of it as kissing, but in a coarser more embarrassed sort of way. But now she remembered it as kissing, and she couldn\u2019t help remembering, again and again, what it felt like, and how she\u2019d almost moaned once.</p> <p>And then she couldn\u2019t help making little noises; after all, she was all alone and snug under the covers, in the great blackness of the inn and it felt as if she wasn\u2019t herself, not Poppy. She was some other woman, one of those women Fletch used to watch in Paris.</p><p>She had lived in Paris, after all. She knew exactly how a woman looked who wasn\u2019t a lady. The kind of purr in her voice, and the invitation in her eyes.</p><p>Poppy just never realized that she wasn\u2019t a lady either.</p><p>It made a great deal of sense to her that at the most bewilderingly lovely moment of the night, she found herself thinking in French.</p><p>Chapter 44</p> <p>Country seat of the Duke of Beaumont December 21</p><p>Charlotte was very disconcerted to find that she had arrived before her hostess. But she knew how it happened: the duchess had undoubtedly taken her time on the road, whereas Charlotte and May had found the least expensive way for her to get to the party, which involved taking the stagecoach and then hiring someone to drive her and her maid from the coaching inn to Beaumont Manor.</p><p>The butler didn\u2019t say anything, of course. He merely bowed, and mentioned that perhaps she wouldn\u2019t mind a quiet evening, as the other guests had not yet arrived. Charlotte put her chin up and swept past him, trying to pretend that it was the duchess\u2019s fault for not arriving, not hers for being early.</p><p>The seat of the Duke of Beaumont was surrounded by miles and miles of formal park, from what Charlotte had seen on the way in, and the house itself was just as grand. It was so large it resembled a cathedral from the outside, at least to Charlotte\u2019s mind. And inside the ceilings were so high one could hardly see them in the gloom and there were innumerable doors and corridors leading off here and there.</p><p>The butler was just as bad; he wore livery that was absolutely covered with red braid, and his hair rose in a stiff powdered peak above his forehead. He looked,Charlotte thought, rather like a bishop, but wearing his hair instead of a miter.</p><p>\u201cI suppose the duchess has not assigned me a room?\u201d Charlotte said meekly, half running to keep up with him. \u201cI am sorry to put the house hold out.\u201d</p> <p>The butler, Mr. Blount, unbent a little and said, \u201cHer Grace sent all her instructions ahead of time. She is most organized.\u201d</p><p>They were walking along on the second-floor corridor when suddenly there was the most awful bellowing. Charlotte squeaked and dropped her knotting bag. It sounded like an animal was in pain, except that it was definitely a man.</p><p>The butler stopped as well. \u201cI am most sorry for the disturbance, miss,\u201d he said majestically. \u201cOne of the guests is less than well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers?\u201dCharlotte said, feeling her face break into a smile. \u201cIs he here already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d the butler said, disapproval showing in every twitch of his hair.</p><p>Another shout broke out and this time she realized it was from just down the hall. It was like a call to arms: she couldn\u2019t ignore it. Before the butler could stop her, Charlotte opened the door and walked in.</p><p>A horrible sight met her eyes. Villiers was bare to the waist, and being held down by two footmen while Finchley poured something that literally smoked onto a terrible wound in his side. Finchley turned and saw her; his hand wobbled and dark liquid fell on Villiers\u2019s chest.</p><p>The duke was staring straight up at the ceiling but he snarled, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, get it over with Finchley! I can\u2019t take much more of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss Tatlock,\u201d Finchley stuttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d she demanded, snatching the bottle out of the manservant\u2019s hand. \u201cJust what do you think you\u2019re doing to him?\u201d</p><p>Finchley\u2019s mouth fell open but it was Villiers who answered her. \u201cI\u2019d love to say that he is slaying me, but he\u2019s under doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what kind of doctor would suggest this!\u201d She waved the black bottle. For some reason, she was boiling angry. She turned on the butler without a bit of the timidity she felt before. \u201cJust who is this doctor?\u201d</p><p>It took Villiers\u2019s laughter, weak but present, to make her stop interrogating the butler. And Finchley.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, you have to make me stop laughing,\u201d he said, gasping a bit. \u201cIt hurts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that much better, Miss Tatlock,\u201d Finchley said earnestly. \u201cTruly. Dr. Treglown is a miracle, he is. He opened the wound and it was all infected there, like you wouldn\u2019t believe. We\u2019ve been treating it for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might survive,\u201d Villiers remarked. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready to fall in love, Miss Tatlock.\u201d</p><p>The butler drew in an insulted breath and rose to his full height. \u201cIn love! Is that it? I wondered at the temerity of this young person, the way she burst into a man\u2019s bedchamber, the way\u2014\u201d</p><p>Villiers lifted his hand and shot him one icy look and the butler stumbled to a halt. \u201cShe\u2019s not in love with me, Blount. Nor yet will she be. But you had better prepare yourself if you\u2019re running some sort of puritan house hold here. You do realize that your mistress is the Duchess of Beaumont, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The butler drew himself up again, a strange mixture of pride and dismay struggling in his face. \u201cHer Grace is our every thought,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. This is one of Her Grace\u2019s most highly thought-of guests, Miss Tatlock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware,\u201d the butler said, bowing with a snap. \u201cIf I may, I shall take Miss Tatlock to her chambers. I was just escorting her there so that she could clean off her travel dirt.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve made an enemy, Charlotte thought. She saw Villiers\u2019s eyes on her shabby traveling costume and suddenly she realized for the first time that she was, indeed, inside a duke\u2019s bedchamber\u2014and he was unclothed.</p><p>\u201cThat mantua-maker,\u201d Villiers said suddenly. \u201cI brought her along. Miss Tatlock must see her immediately. The plan,\u201d he said to Charlotte. \u201cThe plan!\u201d</p><p>Oh lord. The butler was looking at her with positively virulent disapproval at this evidence that a young miss was allowing a duke to pay for her clothing. There could be no greater evidence of her status as the proverbial Whore of Babylon. \u201cMr. Dautry?\u201d Charlotte ventured. \u201cSurely his transformation is more important, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I\u2019m tired,\u201d Villiers murmured, closing his eyes again. \u201cI forced Dautry to see the tailor and he protested like a sheep taken for shearing. You, Miss Tatlock, will be my masterpiece. And I\u2019ve made certain there will be plenty of young men here for you to choose from.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finchley looked at her in an unmistakable signal, and she backed from the room.</p><p>The butler stalked ahead of her, every inch of his livery wiggling with indignation. Even from the back his hair could be seen cresting above his head, trembling with the shock of it.</p><p>He deposited her into a bedchamber with all the ceremony one might give a second house maid. \u201cI will request the mantua-maker to attend you, if she happens to be free at the moment,\u201d he said, staring over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat would be most kind of you,\u201d Charlotte murmured.</p> <p>Chapter 45</p><p>Fletch was in a state of repressed exuberance.</p><p>In the space of a few days he had fallen into a pit of despair, pulled himself out, decided to follow Poppy to the country even if she didn\u2019t love him, and would never love him...and now look what was happening. From the moment they got in the carriage, Poppy hadn\u2019t been able to meet his eyes. She turned pink when he touched her. In fact, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from violating his own rules and \u201caccidentally\u201d running his hand down her hip as he helped her into the carriage.</p><p>In the old days, Poppy wouldn\u2019t have noticed or, if she had, she would have thrown him an annoyed look, quickly covered over with a sweet smile. But this time she blinked and gave a little gasp. In fact, Fletch thought he\u2019d never seen anything quite as pretty as the way her cheeks turned rosy. What woman blushed these days?</p><p>So Fletch spent his time in the carriage planning the next twenty-four hours of his marriage like some sort of military campaign. Jemma, meanwhile, spent her time fretting about how long it had taken them to reach the house, due to a broken axle. \u201cAt this rate, not only my guests, but Beaumont will be there before me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cThe duke can welcome everyone.\u201d</p><p>Jemma opened her mouth but said, \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the most wonderful hostess is unavoidably late sometimes,\u201d Poppy said encouragingly. \u201cAnd you sent such detailed instructions beforehand. I\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it,\u201d Jemma said, her words hard like little acorns. \u201cI\u2019m hosting a Christmas party in a house that I\u2019ve never seen, with a staff whom I don\u2019t know from Adam. And now my secretary has left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have three maids and a personal maid,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m there, Jemma. Plus, Isidore is coming; she\u2019s likely already there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s coming,\u201d Jemma said, still looking flustered. \u201cLouise will be there already, and Harriet, of course.\u201d</p> <p>They said it at the same moment. \u201cLouise!\u201d</p><p>And then Fletch could have cut his tongue out because Poppy shrunk back in her seat and suddenly she didn\u2019t look like a rosy poppy anymore, but like a prim Englishwoman. He cursed silently, while Jemma obliviously totted up the guests who should arrive before her.</p><p>\u201cVilliers, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been there for a few days at least; they decided to go to the country immediately. I just hope that the butler has done everything I instructed him to do for his care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he has,\u201d Fletch said, feeling rather impatient.</p><p>\u201cOh, and the naturalist,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cDr. Loudan.\u201d</p><p>Fletch couldn\u2019t help scowling at that. He stole a look at Poppy and thankfully the mention of Loudan\u2019s name didn\u2019t make her start smiling or anything because he\u2019d have to stop the carriage and have a private conversation with her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take much more of this. He\u2019d been hard for around two weeks without any relief. He felt as if\u2014well\u2014as if it was time for him and Poppy to get married, though that didn\u2019t make any sense. But she blushed when he touched her. And she kept stealing looks at him. And he could smell her wherever she was in the room, and she didn\u2019t smell like lavender powder anymore, but like the most delicious sun-warmed peach he\u2019d ever eaten.</p><p>Which was precisely what he intended to do\u2014tonight. He needed Jemma\u2019s help first, though.</p> <p>He managed to catch her at the final stop to change horses before the carriage trundled the last hour or so to Beaumont Manor. He didn\u2019t bother with any sort of flummery; she was the kind of woman one didn\u2019t have to lie to, and he appreciated that.</p><p>\u201cI need you to put us in the same room,\u201d he said to Jemma.</p><p>Sure enough, the corner of her mouth curled up. \u201cI directed the butler otherwise in my letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She was grinning now. She smiled like a man; you had to love that about Jemma. \u201cAbsolutely not. If you want your wife to join you, you\u2019ll have to lure her there yourself.\u201d She gave him a slow look. \u201cI think you might be able to manage it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t in love with my wife,\u201d he said, taking in the mischief dancing in her eyes, \u201cI\u2019d be begging for scraps at your feet.\u201d</p><p>She deliberately eyed him again from basement to attics, pausing around the front door for a good ogle. \u201cAnd if you weren\u2019t married, I\u2019d probably throw you a bone. Or two.\u201d</p><p>She was so adorable that he bent down and gave her a kiss. And what made it all the more perfect was that Poppy came out of the inn at just the right moment to see it. He straightened up and waved to her, conscious that he hadn\u2019t kissed his wife in months. Not even a little peck. Nothing.</p><p>Of course, as far as she was concerned, he wasn\u2019t interested in his wife anymore. Not interested! There wasn\u2019t a man in seven counties who wouldn\u2019t be interested, especially now that her eyes had gone all soft and she kept kind of shivering and peeking looks.</p><p>To night, he promised himself.</p><p>To night.</p><p>When they finally arrived at the estate, an odd-looking fellow with hair like the crest of a whitecap came out to meet them. He turned out to be the butler. Then Beaumont himself appeared, followed by Miss Tatlock.</p><p>Fletch met Poppy\u2019s eyes when that happened and they shared one of those moments of private silent conversation, both of them wondering what Jemma thought of Miss Tatlock\u2019s early arrival.</p><p>It was just as if he and Poppy were living in the same household, Fletch thought, loving it.</p><p>The house was all draped in green stuff with berries and Fletch had to say that it smelled pretty good. Jemma didn\u2019t seem to like it when Miss Tatlock pointed out the mistletoe, perhaps due to the implication that Miss Tatlock and the duke had been investigating the properties of mistletoe, but Fletch memorized where every little white bunch was hanging.</p><p>Then he let Poppy go upstairs alone to freshen up, just as if he didn\u2019t have any interest in seeing her wash her face. Or change her clothes. Or take a bath. Or...</p><p>He swore and wandered off to stare out the window at miles of park. Snow was falling and as he stood there it started to swirl in huge curls in the air, sweeping from side to side.</p><p>Beaumont appeared at his shoulder. \u201cLooks like a proper storm,\u201d he said.</p><p>Fletch nodded. \u201cHave all your guests arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll except Mr. Dautry, due this evening, if he\u2019s not held up by the weather. By the way, my butler just told me that a quantity of mail has arrived, some of which is for you. Most of it to do with that speech you gave, I expect.\u201d</p><p>He turned and looked at Fletch. \u201cThat was a damned fine performance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m honored that you think so,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cI merely took your advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me that it was all about the story. You were right.\u201d A very pleasing memory of the majority of the House of Lords leaping to their collective feet came to mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told that bit of wisdom to many a young man and they\u2019ve paid me no mind. But you created a story that swept the House, Fletcher.\u201d He clapped him on the back. \u201cI\u2019m thinking you might be the savior of the party. And\u201d\u2014he added, leaving\u2014\u201cthat man Higgle is lucky to have you as his landlord.\u201d</p> <p>Fletch grinned out at the twilight and the snow. It was a good speech. And he already had the topic of his next one ready. It would tackle the question of the African slave trade, the dirty little secret that no one discussed and from which many profited. He saw the shape of the speech in his mind, its appeal to decency and sanity, its internal organization. Its rightness.</p><p>When he finally strolled upstairs and proceeded to read his mail in his bath, his letters were entirely satisfactory. So much so that when he wandered into the drawing room a while later he was smiling to himself. Of course, his smile might have had something to do with the drum beat in his head that kept saying to night, to night, to night.</p><p>Though that didn\u2019t stop him from noticing the way the room fell silent as he entered.</p><p>Poppy leapt to her feet and flew toward him. For a moment he thought she was coming to his arms and just stopped himself from opening his own wide.</p><p>But she stopped short, waving a sheet of foolscap in the air. \u201cFletch, something horrible has happened to my mother!\u201d</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cShe choked on her own venom and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFletch!\u201d</p><p>His beloved, far-too-kind little wife frowned at him. \u201cI\u2019m serious. Something awful has happened to my mother. I have this letter from her.\u201d She handed it to him.</p><p>Fletch took the foolscap, noticing over Poppy\u2019s shoulder that the rest of the company was chattering with all the feverish excitement of a group of actresses after the Prince of Wales comes backstage.</p><p>\u201cTo My Daughter, Duchess of Fletcher, Countess Fulke, Baroness Ryskamp &amp; etc.\u201d He raised an eyebrow and Poppy interjected.</p><p>\u201cYou know my mother, Fletch. She adores all those titles. Just read the note.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have suffered a great calamity. Though my soul is as innocent of this calumny as the purest flower, no impartial words can save me now. Truth\u2019s words, like jewels, hang in the ears of anvils. Poppy, this doesn\u2019t make any sense. An anvil is a ironmonger\u2019s block, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anvils, Fletch, but angels. Truth\u2019s words hang in the ears of angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this part about the devil\u2014oh, I see,his true foe. Who is the de vil\u2019s foe? Your mother?\u201d And here I would have thought she and de vil were close companions rather than enemies, he added to himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cRead the next paragraph. She isn\u2019t quite so excited and it makes more sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGossip is a subtle knave and like the plague strikes into the brain of truth and rageth in his entrails\u2014Um, just a guess, but could it be someone is gossiping about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse than the poison of a red-haired man. Now we\u2019re getting somewhere! A red-haired man is gossiping about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not sure what she meant by that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, Axminster\u2019s hair has a reddish tint,\u201d Fletch suggested. \u201cCourse I didn\u2019t know he was much interested in your mother since she doesn\u2019t frequent the backstage of the Lyceum Dance Hall, but perhaps he broadened his attentions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFletch, will you be serious? Look farther down the page!\u201d</p><p>Fletch squinted. \u201cIt looks to me as if she has retired to the country, if that\u2019s what she means by sanctuary and impregnable defence of oppressed virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the country, Fletch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d His heart sank a little. \u201cTruly not? She\u2019s staying in London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she went to a sanctuary. My mother has retired to a nunnery!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nunnery? We don\u2019t have any of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually there are some nunneries in Scotland I think, but she\u2019s gone to France. You see that part about the Bishop of Meaux? He always admired her. She left, Fletch. She left for France!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother left for France.\u201d Fletch felt like this sometimes after having a deep swallow of the best brandy. Kind of a sweet, hot happiness that spread right down his body. \u201cYour mother left for France.\u201d</p><p>Jemma called to them. \u201cPoppy, I have a letter about it as well!\u201d</p><p>Fletch followed Poppy back to the circle, suppressing his grin.</p><p>\u201cListen to this,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt\u2019s from Lady Smalley. I hardly know her, which means that she must have sent a copy of this to every acquaintance she has. She adds a bit in the beginning about Lady Flora\u2019s spotless name and how no one believes the rumors. We were seated in the Duke of Fletcher\u2019s drawing room\u2014 now most strangely transformed with a magnificence so extreme that Lady Cooper commented that she felt she was in a royal bordello. Lady Cooper is ever humorous, of course. \u201d</p><p>\u201cIf one has to lose one\u2019s reputation,\u201d Mrs. Patton interjected, \u201cit would be better not to do it in Lady Cooper\u2019s presence\u2014a sharp-tongued virago, if there ever was one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo keep reading,\u201d Fletch said, seating himself happily. \u201cI am all anticipation.\u201d</p><p>Poppy shot him a glance. \u201cYou are discussing my mother, Fletch. Your mother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he said. \u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>Jemma started reading again. \u201cWhen all of a sudden a young man appeared at the door.He cut a quite attractive figure, though there was something about him that wasn\u2019t quite of the gentleman. He hailed Lady Flora in the most tender of tones, seeming to not notice at first that we were there. For when he did recognize our presence, he fell silent and indicated in a hundred ways his distress and confusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a lover!\u201d Harriet gasped. And then glanced at Poppy. \u201cOf course, that is merely the way it looked. One can hardly believe it of such a stalwart character as Lady Flora. Why she has never shown the slightest hint of moral laxness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d Fletch murmured.</p><p>Poppy turned mystified eyes back to Jemma. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d she stated. \u201cI know my mother. Do read on, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just summarize it for you. The handsome young man hastily retreated, but the damage was done. Lady Flora appears to have been overtaken by a fit of nerves that rendered her incapable of logical conversation. Lady Cooper then took it upon herself to fetch smelling salts from the butler and naturally used the opportunity to question him closely.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Poppy. \u201cIt truly was very bad luck that your mother happened to invite Lady Cooper to tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Cooper is one of her best friends,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. This is\u2014quite simply\u2014impossible. Inconceivable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to Lady Cooper,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYour own butler straight away confessed that the young man had originally visited the house in order to assist your mother in some decorating schemes and as the last months passed, he had indeed noticed that they were spending more and more time together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d Poppy exclaimed.</p><p>Fletch reached forward and took her hand. \u201cAlas, the family is always the last to know, dearest.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look and he shut his mouth. Really, she had moments in which she quite resembled her mother.</p><p>\u201cDoes your correspondent have anything further to say?\u201d Poppy asked Jemma.</p> <p>\u201cOnly that the young man was indeed quite handsome and when confronted, maintained that he stood as a bulwark to protect Lady Flora\u2019s renown and chastity, and that she was his dearest patron and nothing more. That\u2019s a quote. Naturally, that simply inflamed everyone further, for there\u2019s nothing worse than a man defending a woman\u2019s honor. If the man had no relationship with your mother, Poppy, he would have said so, rather than talking about her honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Mrs. Patton said. \u201cTalk of honor is always the death knell to a woman\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><p>Poppy was shaking her head. \u201cI simply can\u2019t believe it. I just can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Fletch kept silent.</p><p>\u201cSince the dinner bell rang some time ago, I think we should go in or risk choking on a chilly cut of meat,\u201d Jemma said, coming to her feet. \u201cPoppy, I know this must be most distressing for you. Would you prefer to eat in your room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cJemma, may I read that letter myself? I simply can\u2019t believe it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember when Bussy D\u2019Ambois turned out to be having an affaire with the Countess of Montsurry,\u201d Jemma asked, \u201cwhen everyone thought he was toying with the Duchess of Guise? I assure you that the Count of Montsurry was just as surprised as you are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that ended so unpleasantly,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cDidn\u2019t the count go quite mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe murdered his wife,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cinsisting that he had to defend the honor of his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose there are those who might think that your name has been tarnished by connection with your mother,\u201d Fletch said to Poppy, who was reading Lady Smalley\u2019s letter.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>\u201cThen I suppose I needn\u2019t be as extreme as the Count of Monsurry,\u201d he said with a pang of disappointment.</p><p>Jemma gave him a sharp look.</p><p>He smiled back at her blandly. \u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well, don\u2019t you think? I feel quite certain that Lady Flora will soon rule what ever nunnery her friend the bishop places her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she will,\u201d Poppy said, handing the letter back to Jemma. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>She talked all the way to the dining room. And through most of the meal. The sad fact was that Poppy was having as hard a time getting her mind around the truth of this story as did the Count of Monsurry. Yet by the time the pear compotes and apple tarts appeared, she was reluctantly accepting the account.</p><p>\u201cFor why would your mother retire to France unless there was truth in it?\u201d Fletch kept repeating. \u201cShe would simply brazen it out.\u201d</p><p>Then it turned out that Beaumont, late in opening his mail, had been sent a similar account. Beaumont\u2019s letter described the young man falling to his knees and kissing Lady Flora\u2019s feet in anguish; they all agreed that the detail was likely embellished.</p><p>\u201cBut the truth of it stands,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cYour mother was caught by a pretty face, Poppy. She\u2019s human after all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s\u2014\u201d Poppy said, and caught herself.</p><p>\u201cHuman,\u201d Fletch said happily. \u201cNothing more than a hapless member of the human race, just like the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 46</p><p>The idea that her mother had a lover was inconceivable. Obviously, there had been some horrendous miscarriage of justice. Poppy drank a great deal of wine at supper, trying to talk herself into feeling sorry for her mother.</p><p>But certain facts kept intervening with her attempts at sorrow. One was that Lady Flora had moved to France. Had entered a nunnery. When Poppy and Fletch returned to London, there would be no sharp letters, no accidental encounters in ballrooms leading to vitriolic comments on her hair or dress, no meetings at all.</p><p>To say that her heart lightened at the thought would underestimate the truth. She felt as if she had drunk an entire case of champagne.</p><p>When supper was over, the ladies left the gentlemen with their port and returned to the drawing room. Harriet and Mrs. Patton left to visit the nursery. Jemma seated herself on a sofa with Isidore and\u2014gulp\u2014Louise. Which was distinctly humiliating, because Poppy had decided to ask for marital advice. Yet Louise already knew the worst about her marriage.</p><p>So she mentally girded her loins and marched over to Jemma. The three of them were sipping toddies, looking like a fashion plate from The Lady\u2019s Magazine. It wasn\u2019t that Poppy didn\u2019t feel fashionable: she knew quite well that her petticoat was flounced and furbelowed. She had a beautiful lace ruff, and her hair was raised on the smallest pad\u2014with no powdering whatsoever. She looked pretty. In fact, she thought the way her hair shone without powder was much more attractive than when it was powdered. But the important point was that she didn\u2019t look...</p><p>Like Louise.</p><p>Louise had a roguish sensual look about her. It wasn\u2019t just that her gown was lower cut and a bit tighter\u2014which it was\u2014it was something about the way she walked, and the color of her lips, and the way she laughed, low and deep.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling,\u201d Jemma said, looking up. \u201cAre you drinking these toddies? Because honestly, I think they may be a wee bit on the strong side. I\u2019m not sure I can stand up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had one,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cPerhaps I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely you should,\u201d Isidore said, giggling madly. Her cheeks were bright red, which looked wonderful with her jet-black hair. She looked tipsy.</p><p>Louise reached up and pulled Poppy down next to her. \u201cDo come sit with me,\u201d she said. \u201cHow lovely your hair looks. Please take my toddy. I only sniffed it, as I can\u2019t abide strong liquor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can either,\u201d Poppy said. But she sipped it and thought it was very nice, like cinnamon and wine and Christmas, all mixed together. \u201cI need help,\u201d she said bluntly.</p><p>Isidore blinked at her a bit owlishly. \u201cDo you want us to throw your husband out of the house? Jemma, you should have done better than allow that man into your party after what happened last time we were all together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited him,\u201d Poppy said quickly.</p><p>Isidore\u2019s mouth fell open in a comical fashion. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted\u2014well\u2014I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Louise wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cAbout him.\u201d</p><p>Jemma was smiling. \u201cYou\u2019ve decided that a bird in the hand is better than a naturalist in the bush, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Poppy said.</p><p>\u201cHow can we help?\u201d Isidore said, drinking some more.</p><p>Louise narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a fearful head tomorrow, Isidore. And\u2014if you don\u2019t mind my saying so\u2014your face is quite rosy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always turn red as a beet when I drink spirits,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cBut honestly, who cares? My husband is away in far off India or some such place. I could turn purple and he wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d She drank again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wart,\u201d Jemma said bluntly. \u201cIf you want to turn red, Isidore, you go right ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of these days,\u201d Isidore said, with only a little slur in her voice, \u201cI\u2019m going to do something wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Louise said briskly. \u201cWhen that times comes, we\u2019ll sober you up. It\u2019s best never to be wild while inebriated.\u201d</p><p>Poppy took a huge gulp of her toddy. In her view, it was likely easier to be wild with a little inebriation. \u201cI want to do something wild too,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Isidore said, peering at her. \u201cIs your husband going to India as well?\u201d</p><p>Louise reached over and took Isidore\u2019s cup away. \u201cYou\u2019ve had enough, darling. At this rate, you\u2019ll sleep straight through Christmas Eve and miss all the festivities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how celebratory we can be,\u201d Jemma said, looking worried. \u201cMy butler tells me that Villiers isn\u2019t doing very well at all. I stopped up to see him, but he was asleep again. I think he slept most of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Isidore said, her mouth drooping instantly. \u201cI thought perhaps I would marry him instead of my duke, but I can only do that if he survives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked Villiers,\u201d Jemma said, looking surprised.</p> <p>\u201cI hardly know him. But he\u2019s a duke. I could just scratch out my husband\u2019s name on the wedding certificate. It seems like a fair trade for the duke I don\u2019t really have. A duke in En gland is worth two off in India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich reminds me,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cSo how can we help, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>Poppy had finished her toddy and was enjoying an agreeable warmth in the pit of her stomach. \u201cFletch says that men are never interested in women after a few years of bedding them,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he\u2019s not interested in me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastardo!\u201d Isidore hissed, taking Jemma\u2019s cup out of her hand and drinking some of it.</p><p>\u201cI want to\u2014to lure him back to my bed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking as red as I am,\u201d Isidore observed.</p> <p>Jemma was grinning. \u201cA femme fatale,\u201d she said. \u201cLouise, Isidore, let\u2019s go!\u201d She grabbed Poppy\u2019s hand. \u201cUpstairs!\u201d</p><p>Fletch had just decided that Jemma\u2019s odd-looking butler was the person to tell him where his wife was sleeping when Beaumont gave an odd cough. They were playing cards. Fletch looked up to meet Beaumont\u2019s eyes, alive with laughter. He put down his cards.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Fletch asked.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Beaumont said, rising, \u201cthat this performance is likely directed at you, not me.\u201d</p><p>Fletch rose and turned around.</p><p>She was walking in the door.</p><p>At supper, her hair had been up above her head, in one of those hair styles that women liked, albeit without the powder. She\u2019d looked sweetly pretty. Now it was all different.</p><p>Walking in the door was the courtesan to a prince. She had curls atop her head, caught up with sparkling jewels, though a few fell to her shoulders. Her eyes were lavishly lined with black and they looked twice as big and four times as powerfully blue. Her lips were crimson and curled in a small mocking smile.</p> <p>Her gown was dark crimson, a color near to black. And the bodice plunged below her breasts. There was nothing but the frailest scrap of lace covering her nipples. Around her neck she wore a dramatic, exquisite necklace, with a pendant that fell just between the curves of her breasts.</p><p>The entire drawing room went silent as a stone.</p><p>Fletch walked forward, feeling as if he should fall on his knees.</p><p>Poppy stopped and her scarlet mouth curled appreciatively.</p><p>He swept into a bow. \u201cGood evening, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonsoir.\u201d Her voice was no sweet jangle of bells. It was husky, demanding, a woman\u2019s voice. It was a French woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>Jemma swept in behind them, laughing, with other women, but Fletch didn\u2019t take his eyes from Poppy.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t an ounce of hesitation in her eyes. Not even a tremor. She was, every inch, a woman who knew exactly what she wanted.</p><p>Him.</p><p>\u201cI am here only for the evening,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cVisiting?\u201d he managed.</p><p>\u201cFrom France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I get you...something, mademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlack,\u201d she said, lowering her eyelashes. They were outrageously black and so long that his loins stirred. \u201cI am no mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried, are you?\u201d he said, taking her hand and bringing it to his mouth. \u201cI am d\u00e9sol\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders rose in a little shrug. \u201cWhy should you be? I find that marriage is such an interesting state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course! Only a married woman can truly know what she wants.\u201d</p><p>Behind him Jemma laughed, but Fletch\u2019s heart was beating too hard for laughter. Every inch of him had turned to fierce prowling hunter, to the kind of primitive male who throws a female to a pallet and has his way with her. He wanted to toss Poppy over his shoulder and take her upstairs, every delectable inch of her. Her breasts were visible to the whole room; he could see one pink nipple peeking at him through the white lace.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did marriage teach you about desire?\u201d he asked, the huskiness in his own voice startling him. \u201cWhat do you want, madame?\u201d</p><p>Something changed in her eyes, went serious for a moment.</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He brought her hand to his lips again. Even touching his lips to her skin made him start shaking a bit, like a race horse waiting at the start line.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>She said it softly, and then shot him another one of those liquid dark, dangerous looks out of her beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Fletch\u2019s only explanation was that he lost his head. Right there in a drawing room full of giggling peers, at least two or three footmen, not to mention a butler with hair like the rise of the sea...</p><p>The Duke of Fletcher swept up his duchess in his arms\u2014or perhaps it was just a wild Frenchwoman paying a visit\u2014and stalked out of the room.</p><p>And up the stairs.</p><p>Chapter 47</p><p>Dying was not an easy business. Villiers pretty much thought he had reconciled himself to it but he wasn\u2019t enjoying the process. The Scottish doctor had stopped dropping turpentine in his wound, but the man\u2019s mouth drooped when he looked at him. Plus, Villiers could feel the bad news. The fever didn\u2019t wrench him this way and that as much, but the exhaustion was like an undertow, pulling him out to sea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to live much longer,\u201d he told Charlotte. She\u2019d suddenly appeared after supper and told him a story about Lady Flora and a young servant that he didn\u2019t believe for a moment. Now she was sitting beside him reading from one of Mr. Fielding\u2019s novels. Villiers hadn\u2019t listened for pages. He liked lying there and watching the way her mouth moved as she read, and the delicate bones in her hand as she turned the pages.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you down there with the philosophers?\u201d he added. \u201cI specifically requested philosophers.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte raised her eyes. \u201cThe duchess said that there are no philosophers in her circle of acquaintance. And you are going to live. The doctor feels the infection is gone from your wound.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Villiers smiled faintly. \u201cYou are the one who told me not to pay so much attention to my doctors.\u201d</p><p>He had been absolutely right about the house party. The so-called standards of polite society didn\u2019t operate here. Jemma had challenged him to a chess game and he even played a few pieces before he realized that he didn\u2019t care about chess anymore.</p><p>Then Jemma got a droopy look around her mouth and looked as if she might cry, so he closed his eyes and pretended to go to sleep. Except that closing his eyes was dangerous these days: he closed them and woke up to find that the light had moved straight across the room and it was night. Or the night was gone and most of the day as well.</p><p>No one cared if Charlotte sat with him, and she never looked droopy. Sure enough, she was scowling at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to die looking like that?\u201d she said pointedly.</p> <p>He almost laughed but it took too much breath. \u201cAppealing to my vanity won\u2019t do it. May I use your name, oh sage Miss Tatlock?\u201d</p><p>She turned up that long nose of hers. \u201cPrivate names are far too intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be intimate,\u201d he said.</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>\u201cThough I won\u2019t be around long enough to marry you,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to marry me.\u201d She picked up the book again. \u201cShall I continue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would,\u201d he said, saying it because there was no reason not to. \u201cI like you, Charlotte. I thought perhaps I could only love Jemma, but I\u2019m fairly sure I\u2019ve come to love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery foolish of you,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d But he was watching her under his lashes, and he saw a watery gleam in her eyes. He didn\u2019t mean to make her droopy. The idea made him feel panicked. \u201cSo think about that. What a shame I\u2019m dying. You could have inherited a fortune!\u201d</p><p>She rallied instantly. \u201cDon\u2019t speak too soon. I might call in a priest and marry you to night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>Now her mouth was definitely wobbling. It was a soft and pink mouth, too. Anything to do with physical intimacy was farthest from Villiers\u2019s mind, but he had noticed her mouth. She said bruising things, but with a sweet little mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes, you would!\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI would never marry you for your fortune, and don\u2019t forget it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you marry me for other reasons?\u201d He watched her from under his lashes. Of course, she would say no. He was a wreck of a man, dying, stupid, foolish, alone. She was\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd not just because you\u2019re desperate for a wedding ring?\u201d he added. He didn\u2019t have time for social niceties, not here in the very shadow of death.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said slowly. She reached out and her warm fingers curled around his.</p><p>He felt the tide of exhaustion again. He was so tired of the pain. It was all over his body now, an ache, more than one ache. \u201cWho would think that a foolish little sword wound could come to this?\u201d he said.</p><p>Her hand tightened on his. \u201cDon\u2019t die.\u201d She said it quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t think he had a choice. \u201cDo you know what I feel like, Charlotte?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA torch.Nothing more than a torch borne in the wind.\u201d</p><p>And then the blackness came quickly, before he had a chance to say another word.</p><p>Charlotte sat next to Villiers and watched him sleep. He was gaunt, his face as white as parchment. And yet she could still see that glorious scrap of life that makes up the soul. It wasn\u2019t hard to grasp how fragile the place was in which the soul resided.</p><p>Dautry came in quietly. He had just arrived, having missed supper.</p><p>It took her a moment to understand what had happened to him. He was no longer a slightly shabby sailor. He looked magnificent, clad in a coat of periwinkle blue that fit his shoulders like a glove. His shirt was of the finest linen. Only two things betrayed him: his hair still tumbled like a pirate, to his shoulders, and his feet wore the same scuffed, comfortable boots as before.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cYou look ducal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like a blasted peacock,\u201d he said, striding around the bed. He picked up his Villiers\u2019s other hand. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>There was no point in pretending that she didn\u2019t know what he meant. Everything about the duke signaled that the time was near.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cI had hoped he would be here for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may surprise you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just did,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dautry glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>A look of black rage crossed his face and then it was as expressionless as ever. \u201cDid he?\u201d he drawled. \u201cAnd did you take him up on his idea?\u201d</p><p>She stood up and shook out her skirts. \u201cYou\u2019re an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fine English gentlewoman using such a word!\u201d he said, mockingly.</p><p>\u201cAss,\u201d she repeated, loving the sound of the word on her own lips. There was something about this trip, her acquaintance with the Duke of Villiers, that was changing her. Making her more like him, perhaps: combative, fearless. She reached out and smoothed Villiers\u2019s fingers, lying on the counterpane.</p><p>Dautry strode around the bed. \u201cI can see that you are fond of him,\u201d he said.</p><p>She had to tip her head back: he was standing just beside her and he was so tall. \u201cYou are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cYou already told me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes looked at her with such disapproval that she actually felt a thrill. As if she, Charlotte Tatlock, would do something immoral. It was practically a compliment. \u201cSo you think that I would seduce a dying duke into marriage in order to become a duchess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>She loved the image of it, if only it didn\u2019t include Villiers\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Leopold, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>He looked furious again. \u201cHow did you come to meet the duke?\u201d Suddenly his hands were on her shoulders.</p><p>He\u2019s going to shake me! Charlotte thought. It was all she could do not to smile. Dautry really thought she was a fatal temptress...not just a plain old maid who lived in Gough Square.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d she said, prolonging the deliciousness of it.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t know enough about men. Or perhaps she just didn\u2019t know enough about Dautry. He didn\u2019t shake her; suddenly he bent his head and before she had any idea what was happening, his mouth was on hers.</p><p>On her mouth!</p><p>His lips were warm and firm, and she suddenly smelled him. He smelled like a sailor: like the clean wind and faintly of cloves. Stray thoughts whirled through her head, about temptresses who kissed strange men...</p><p>The idea was so delicious that she did precisely what he wanted and opened her mouth.</p><p>But then the kiss changed and she couldn\u2019t think as clearly anymore. He stopped holding her shoulders and pulled her against his body. He was warm and hard, and the spicy smell of him went to her head so she wound her arms around his neck and hung on.</p><p>They didn\u2019t stop until there was a noise on the bed. She pulled away and swung around, but Villiers was still sleeping. Her whole body was tingling. No wonder, she kept thinking. No wonder men and women... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached out and pulled up his coverlet a little, thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cHas the local doctor anything to say?\u201d Dautry said it quietly, in case Villiers was sleeping lightly.</p><p>The doctor had said no more than she had guessed for herself. \u201cIf he survives the night...but Dr. Treglown doesn\u2019t think he will. Do you?\u201d</p><p>She saw the answer in his eyes, and it echoed the truth in her own heart.</p> <p>\u201cWhat will you do when he dies?\u201d His voice sounded different. The drawl was still there, but roughened by desire.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, turning around to face him. \u201cWeep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come sit with him to night,\u201d he said, turning to the door. \u201cI need to eat. Keep me company?\u201d</p><p>She looked at Villiers but he was sleeping in that profound way he had, as if every breath were too much and he might just slip away. It was tiring, watching a man die.</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me,\u201d Dautry said, his voice a little softer. He held out his hand. \u201cYou can return later. We\u2019ll both come back later.\u201d</p> <p>Blount disapproved. He did his butlering duty, of course. He placed the couple at a snug table in the morning room. He served them himself, because he saw the lay of the land, the way Dautry smiled at Miss Tatlock, and the way his hand lingered on her shoulder. No point in allowing that Jezebel to corrupt one of the young footmen.</p><p>But he was aware of a great uneasiness. He had identified the woman as a concubine of the Duke of Villiers, and here she was with the heir. Laughing.Talking. What sort of woman was she?</p><p>He lingered as much as he could while bringing in the courses, intent on learning her secrets. The conversation didn\u2019t seem particularly salacious. They talked of India (godforsaken place, to Blount\u2019s mind), and pirates (godforsaken people), and then about whales (he had no particular opinion, but he was suspicious).</p><p>He was pouring the second bottle of wine before he discovered what made Miss Charlotte Tatlock so irresistible. It was the way she talked back to Dautry. Talked back! Inconceivable for a young woman. Yet she did. He refreshed their wine glasses during a conversation in which she was arguing in the most lively way about smugglers. Defending them, if you please!</p><p>Blount made up his mind on the spot. They got no more wine. None! Not even if the Jezebel herself rang the bell.</p><p>So it was disappointing when they sauntered back to the Duke of Villiers\u2019s bedchamber, almost as if they didn\u2019t notice that their butler had forsaken them.</p> <p>They were talking that hard.</p><p>Chapter 48</p><p>Poppy wasn\u2019t herself. She wasn\u2019t the meek, silly daughter of Lady Flora. She wasn\u2019t the kind of person who could be screamed at, or told what to do.</p><p>She was more likely to scream. And tell people what to do.</p><p>She felt powerful. She let Fletch carry her into the room because it felt good to be in his arms, to be carried about. As soon as they were in the bedchamber, she pulled free. She had to control the night.</p><p>She walked away from him slowly, leaned back against the bedpost so that her breasts arched forward. Fletch was standing next to the door and what she saw in his eyes made her heart beat even faster.</p><p>It was working.</p><p>But she had a plan, a plan that Jemma and Louise had drilled into her upstairs, and she wasn\u2019t going to deviate from it now. Not after practicing it twice, even after Isidore fell on the bed and went to sleep, complaining that no man was worth all the energy.</p> <p>So she let her lips curls into a sleepy, inviting smile. \u201cI hear,\u201d she said, \u201cthat you\u2019re tired of your spouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t let him answer. \u201cBien,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause as it seems, I am in the same position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>He sounded stunned. She lifted both hands above her head to the bedpost, feeling the deliciously free, wild sense of her breasts against the frail ruffle of her bodice. She could hear Fletch breathing. He didn\u2019t look like the sophisticated sleek duke now. His eyes were gleaming.</p><p>\u201cPoppy...\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur?\u201d</p><p>She brought one hand down to trail down her throat and then across her chest, just as Jemma had showed her. \u201cIt\u2019ll drive him mad,\u201d Jemma had said. \u201cMen love it when a woman touches her own flesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should send my husband a painting of me,\u201d Isidore had said drunkenly from the bed. \u201cDoing that.\u201d</p><p>Poppy let herself smile at Fletch, just enough to make it clear that she was in charge.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come closer?\u201d she purred.</p><p>He was before her in one bound.</p><p>\u201cNo touching!\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands. The smile in his eyes made her shiver, and she could feel herself getting warm and shivery between her legs. \u201cJen\u2019y touche pas, madame,\u201d he said.</p><p>But she had to be sure he understood, be sure that he knew. \u201cA woman like myself,\u201d she told him, \u201chas demands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He came a step closer. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She let her hand close over her breast and dropped her head back. She could feel her entire body tingling now, longing for the touch of his hand. In the days since she\u2019d made her discovery in the inn, she\u2019d explored her own body. She knew what she liked...and she knew just what she\u2019d like him to do, though the very thought made her feel as pink in the face as Isidore.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded. There was a fierce wildness in his voice that made her tremble with excitement.</p><p>It was hard to be explicit. Embarrassment momentarily strangled her, stripping away her French cover. But then she looked at Fletch, and it was Fletch, her darling Fletch, standing in front of her. The only thing she really wanted was for him to touch her. And then\u2014for her to be able to touch him.</p><p>Looking at him made her steadier. What she wanted was just what he wanted. Just like that a whole hot flush swept over her body. \u201cI want to touch you,\u201d she said. Her voice was quiet and steady, but she wasn\u2019t whispering.</p><p>Without taking his eyes from hers, he wrenched off his coat. She leaned back against the bedpost again. She felt all the power of desire making her taller, making her more beautiful, making her lips shine and her body voluptuous.</p><p>Fletch\u2019s shoulders were powerful and muscled. He pulled his shirt out of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she said. To her embarrassment it came out as a croak.</p><p>But there was a smile playing around his lips too. \u201cBut what exactly do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to take your shirt off.\u201d</p><p>His smile made her shiver. He pulled up his shirt slowly, so she saw his rippled stomach, and then the golden muscles on his shoulders. It was odd how she saw it all different now. She had always thought he was pretty before. He wasn\u2019t pretty.</p><p>He was...</p><p>She wanted to lick him. Luckily he couldn\u2019t hear that thought, though she felt her face getting even redder.</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>But she was done. She couldn\u2019t possibly ask a man to remove his breeches. Even though...she could see a bulge there and she\u2014</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He walked forward another step so they were almost touching. \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he whispered, reaching down and feathering a kiss across her cheekbone. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take my breeches off. I just want to kiss you.\u201d He was nuzzling her lips, kissing her so sweetly that her knees trembled. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTake them off!\u201d she barked, pushing him back. She couldn\u2019t be this close to him, not when he smelled so good. She was losing her focus. Losing her Frenchness. He wouldn\u2019t desire her if she turned back into her docile little self and just let him do things. She had to stay in control.</p><p>He stepped back, looking a little surprised, but then pleased too. \u201cImm\u00e9diatement!\u201d she added, just to get the message across.</p><p>He grinned at that and started playing with his waistband. Pulling it down a little. That was something she loved about him, the way his hips were so lean and there was a little hollow there. She wanted to lick it too. She didn\u2019t know how she knew about that hollow, because she never consciously looked at him, but she did. Fletch pulled his breeches down, and farther down.</p><p>Poppy felt a little faint. She\u2019d seen him a hundred times at least. Especially after he started insisting that they make love with all the candles lit, and she had to lie on top of the covers. She\u2019d seen him. She never thought he was grotesque and hairy, the way her mother had described.</p><p>But she\u2019d never looked at him and felt her whole body start to tremble either. He was large. And smooth. And he had his hands on his hips, so it looked like his whole body was just\u2014</p><p>That. There.</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d he said, his voice all deep and teasing, as if they were talking about bits of sugar.</p><p>Her mind reeled, trying to think what to say next. How could she stay French, be French, so he wasn\u2019t bored? What would a Frenchwoman do next?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him and really the only thing she wanted was for him to\u2014</p><p>That couldn\u2019t be said. It was horribly vexing. She couldn\u2019t think of anything.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d</p><p>He started to say something and his eyes were so sweet and kind that she knew she\u2019d already failed. He was looking at her and seeing stupid old Poppy, not a sensual Frenchwoman with kohl all around her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>He stopped, but he didn\u2019t look quite so happy. Poppy took a breath. She had to find herself again, find the pleasure in it. She was failing, she knew she was failing\u2014she pushed the thought away. It was probably time to go to the bed. That was what she should do.</p><p>\u201cI would like you to lie down,\u201d she said. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t have to modulate her voice: it came out all provocative and husky on its own.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like me to undress you first?\u201d</p><p>She froze for a moment. Would a Frenchwoman let a man undress her? She couldn\u2019t remember whether Jemma had said anything about it. At some point they had all been laughing so hard that she could hardly hear the advice.</p><p>\u201cA Frenchwoman always undresses herself,\u201d she stated.</p><p>He grinned so that must have been the right thing to do. Then he flung himself onto the bed, as cool as a cucumber. He propped his head on his arms and crossed his legs. But Poppy had trouble looking anywhere other than his...his waistline. She wet her lips and his hips rose just a little bit as she watched.</p><p>She did it again and he made a curious sound.</p><p>So she let her tongue play with her bottom lip. He was watching her with the sleepiest, most delicious expression she\u2019d ever seen. She was doing it right. She knew she was doing it right. A little rush of exhilaration swept through her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hot in here,\u201d she said, low and sultry. That was one of the lines Jemma told her and it sounded just right, even though Isidore screamed with laughter from the bed and said Jemma sounded like a three-penny whore.</p><p>Then she just pulled her neckline wide and eased it down over her shoulders. Fletch was sitting up now. He looked like a dying man seeing a drink of water.</p> <p>Poppy licked her lips again and then slipped the dress down a little further. And a little further...</p><p>\u201cOh darling, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d He said it with a half groan, and Poppy felt heat flash from the tips of her ears to her toes.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm,\u201d she said, pulling her sleeves a bit lower.</p><p>Her breasts were free now. He was looking, so she looked down too. They looked very nice, plump and warm. She knew what they felt like in her hands. But what she wanted was to feel his hands on her breasts.</p><p>She met his eyes and saw her own desire reflected there.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d he said, \u201ccould you please come to the bed now?\u201d He sounded hoarse. It sounded to her as if the Frenchwoman had conquered him, and she could probably let him take over now. Which was good because\u2014</p><p>That was the moment when she discovered that the neckline had gone down just as far as it was going to go\u2014to her elbows. She tried to pull out an arm and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trapped,\u201d her husband said, sounding delighted. He swung his legs off the bed.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t French to get trapped in one\u2019s clothing.</p><p>And yet\u2014</p><p>Fletch didn\u2019t even try to get her free. He just stood in front of her without touching her\u2014couldn\u2019t he tell what she wanted?\u2014and kissed her. His mouth was sweet, like sin and honey and everything she\u2019d ever wanted in life.</p><p>He didn\u2019t open his lips though, and that\u2019s what she wanted. By a moment later Poppy was feeling half-crazed. She couldn\u2019t raise her arms. But he wasn\u2019t touching her. He was just kissing her without\u2014just rubbing his lips against hers.</p><p>So she finally had to do it herself. Like the daring Frenchwoman she was, she ran her tongue along the line of his lips. He tasted sweet, like a man. A little spicy.</p><p>Kiss me, she thought. Kiss me.</p><p>His lips softened but they didn\u2019t open. There was just a gleam of humor in his eyes, and something else, something possessive and dark that made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she finally whispered. \u201cFletch\u2014\u201d</p><p>And he did it. Just like that, one hand came to the middle of her back and pulled her towards him. Her breasts came to his chest, and his mouth opened, sweeping inside hers.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he said.</p><p>She was breathing too hard to answer, pressing against him, feeling the aching tips of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t kiss her again until she said it, so she did. \u201cKiss me again, Fletch.\u201d Her voice sounded as if she was begging, and a pulse of humiliation went through her, but then he started kissing her and it didn\u2019t matter, none of it mattered...</p><p>He put his hand on her cheek and let it drift down, down to her neck and she was shrieking inside. Why didn\u2019t he touch her?</p><p>She would say it: touch me, but it was too bold. And he was kissing her. Then she realized she wanted to touch him and she couldn\u2019t because of the stupid dress, so she started struggling with it, wiggling while still kissing him.</p><p>He pulled back and stared down at her. There was something different in his eyes: slumberous and intent. He was looking at the Frenchwoman, Poppy thought with a little throb of anxiety. What would she do next?</p><p>But he took the decision out of her hands. \u201cLa libert\u00e9,\u201d he whispered. Put his hands on her neck, drew his hands down, down over her breasts. She shivered, and he cast a trail of fire down to her waist. Then with one quick wrench he ripped the delicate fabric in half and it fell to her feet.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Poppy nearly covered her breasts with one hand and her private parts with the other\u2014just in time she remembered that she wasn\u2019t herself. She was French. Instead, she stretched, all the way above her head. Her whole body was tingling, feeling pink and ready for\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Him.</p><p>He was smiling, so she just went by instinct, turned to the bed and climbed onto it. His hand brushed over her bottom and she thought she heard a little groan, like a curse. She lay down slowly and then turned over.</p><p>He was there, on the edge of the bed, his eyes dark. \u201cWhat would you like now, madame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKisses,\u201d she said, stretching again. She\u2019d discovered that if her hands were over her head her breasts looked bigger.</p><p>He crawled toward her and she couldn\u2019t take her eyes from his. She was shivering all over. He swung a leg over hers and she was trembling so hard she was afraid he would see so she put on her French smile and said, \u201cMonsieur?\u201d Which happened to be the only word she could think of.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d he said, and then his mouth came to hers. It was like a gift. They\u2019d kissed hundreds of times before, years\u2019 worth of brisk kisses and longer kisses, but never like this. Never when her desire met his, when his mouth tasted like the sweetest nectar. Never when she\u2014not he!\u2014pulled him against her body.</p><p>\u201cDo you want the candles snuffed?\u201d he whispered into her neck.</p><p>Poppy wasn\u2019t listening. She\u2019d discovered that even running her fingers over the muscles in his back made currents of desire sing in her blood.</p><p>\u201cThe candles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d she whispered. And then: \u201cKiss me again.\u201d</p><p>Finally, some time later, with a gasp: \u201cHarder!\u201d</p><p>There were so many discoveries. That laughter was part of it all, the way Fletch laughed when he was kissing the sweet slope of her breast and she thought he might make better use of his time.</p><p>\u201cYou told me that I should tell you what I want,\u201d she said, catching her breath. And then with a little moan, \u201cOh\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fear was part of it, too. Because Fletch was laughing and panting and afraid, all at once. Afraid it was some sort of a dream that had caught him waking, because the reality of it was so much better than all those dreams he\u2019d had. She twisted under his hands and sobbed a little, and even screamed, but she was so Poppy at the same time. She told him one thing, and then forgot and started her own explorations. And when he tried to push her back into place so that he could minister to her, and drive her mad with desire as he planned, she got fierce and before he knew it, he found himself flat on his back with his little wife doing her best to drive every logical thought out of his body.</p><p>\u201cI meant\u2014I want to\u2014\u201d he gasped, his body arched at the feeling of her soft lips kissing him everywhere, even biting him, tasting him, exploring him.</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d she said, and he humored her (all right, he lost his mind for a while), until finally he flipped her over and didn\u2019t entertain any more objections. Just feasted himself on her sweet apples of breasts, memorizing the way she squealed when he used his teeth, just a little bit, the way she tasted when he kissed his way down her body.</p><p>Until neither one of them could stand it any more, when she was sobbing for his possession, and fire was raging in his legs\u2014and yet he was afraid, afraid it wouldn\u2019t be right, she wouldn\u2019t like it\u2014</p><p>Afraid\u2014</p><p>She pulled him down onto her curvy velvet little body and said in her fiercest tone, \u201cFletch, if you don\u2019t make love to me right now\u2014\u201d But then she arched against him and seemed to lose track of her threat.</p><p>And just like that, he forgot his idiotic worries. By some miracle, some Christmas miracle, he had their wedding night back. It was their first time.</p><p>He rubbed against her, teasing her, kissing her.</p><p>She started scolding him again, his sweet little shrewish wife, and so he finally took her face in his and kissed her while he sank into her...the first time, the best time, the only time.</p><p>Poppy looked up at him and to her horror, felt tears coming to her eyes. French seductresses didn\u2019t cry while they were making love. She knew that. She sniffed and tried to think French thoughts, but then her own Fletch kissed the tears away and drove into her again and then she stopped worrying about tears and Gallic attitudes. It was all she could do to catch the rhythm and join the dance.</p> <p>At first it felt like some sort of frustrating game in which she was behind on the count. Fletch was moving, deep and strong and steady, and she was twisting under him, trying to get that pressure, the pressure she wanted\u2014</p><p>When suddenly she realized that she was doing it again. She was letting him lead the dance, bring everything to the table. A little arch in her back and a surge back at him and, oh God, the pressure was there, it was delicious, it was building. He made a low sound in his throat and his head fell back.</p><p>It was Fletch and Poppy. Not just Fletch, and not just her.</p><p>The tears came in earnest this time, because how could she not? Their bodies were moving in unison, hard and sweaty and real. Fletch was saying things about love too. They were hoarse, and breathless, but real.</p><p>She was moving faster, closer to him, tears in her mouth when he was kissing her no, they were kissing each other\u2014and then faster, until she couldn\u2019t think, until with a shuddering cry, she let go and flew into perfect, perfect pieces. Sweaty, messy, dirty pieces.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Chapter 49</p><p>The next night</p><p>\u201cChristmas Eve night,\u201d Villiers said. He could hardly hear his own voice, it was so low. He didn\u2019t bother to think about what that meant: he knew. Every exhausted bone in his aching body knew. And accepted it. \u201cWill you read me that story again?\u201d</p><p>Somehow this slight girl with the long nose, this intelligent, wrathful old maid of a virgin had become the only person he wanted to see at his bedside. Earlier that day Benjamin\u2019s widow, Harriet, had sat with him and he couldn\u2019t remember what he wanted to say. Until he finally said he was sorry.</p><p>Harriet cried, but he didn\u2019t know why and couldn\u2019t summon up the strength to care.</p><p>Charlotte insulted him, and shouted at him, and looked as if she might cry, but she never did. \u201cDid I tell you that I\u2019m marrying you?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her smile was so faint that he could hardly see it. \u201cIf you survive I might take you at your word, and marry you out of revenge. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll back away once you come to your senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can sue for breach of promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you think I\u2019ll get?\u201d</p><p>It was hard to think, like swimming in treacle, but so much fun to have a conversation with a joke to it, that he made himself concentrate. \u201cI\u2019m rich. I wouldn\u2019t settle for less than thirty-six thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much?\u201d</p><p>He felt a flash of pride. \u201cSee? You should rethink your foolishness and marry me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo old for me,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd look at you. Thin as a twig.\u201d</p><p>He could make a lewd joke, but he couldn\u2019t seem to think of one. They never told you that desire fled at the shadow of death. There was a lot no one told you. \u201cWill you read me that story again?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s His birthday to night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a magical night,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cMy grandmother used to tell me all sorts of stories about it. To night is the one time all year that the animals can talk to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShakespeare said the same,\u201d Villiers observed. And then found the words in his head, like some sort of benediction: \u201cThe bird of dawning singeth all night long, And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad.\u201d He paused. \u201cSomething else there, I think. And then \u2018 No fairy takes, no witch has power to charm, so hallowed and so gracious is the time.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like the Gospel of Luke again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cJust the part about the inn, and the angels. And will you hold my hand?\u201d</p><p>So she began, with her clear intelligent voice, and he hung on to the dear old words like a lifeline, from this world to the next. \u201cAnd in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto Galilee...\u201d</p><p>Chapter 50</p> <p>It was twilight, Christmas Eve night. The snow wasn\u2019t howling around the house anymore, but it was still falling. Poppy drifted away from the party and to the window. If she stood just next to the glass, in the well of the deep window, she could peer out at the garden in the twilight. Where before had been the bare outlines of hedges in the enormous formal gardens that surrounded the house, now all was transformed into a soft and mysterious landscape of snow and shadow. Where the light fell, the snow glittered like midnight diamonds. Where the light faded, the snow looked soft, like lumpy velvet.</p><p>Somehow she knew he was standing up before he did so. It was as if they were connected by a thin, tingling wire. She knew he was walking toward her.</p><p>He stepped behind her and slipped his arms around her, dipped his head to her neck.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, husky and low, her Frenchwoman\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d was all he said. But then he bumped her from behind, and the feeling of him, hard and urgent, went through her like a lightning shock.</p> <p>\u201cI love it when you don\u2019t wear panniers, but now we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he murmured into her hair. \u201cI can\u2019t turn around and shock everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>He held her tight against him. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a cut-away coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing would shock Jemma,\u201d Poppy pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to drive her mad with lust,\u201d he said, a thread of laughter in his voice.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cShe\u2019s seen your like before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it,\u201d he boasted.</p><p>She let her head fall back on his shoulder, even though he was a hopelessly vain and foolish creature: a male by definition, Jemma would say. He had a strong arm around her waist, so she curled her fingers around his wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop that,\u201d she said a little while later. Her voice came out with a dark edge.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure people can see you!\u201d</p><p>His hand didn\u2019t stop. \u201cI drew the curtains behind us, not that anyone was interested.\u201d</p><p>Poppy glanced back, over his shoulder, and saw that he had indeed drawn the thick velvet panels. Now they stood in a tiny room, framed by glass on one side, with the black world of snow outside, and a wall of crimson velvet on the other. She suddenly realized that the voices of the party were muffled, almost as if they came through a veil of snow as well.</p><p>\u201cAnyone could open that curtain at any moment!\u201d she gasped.</p> <p>His hand was cupping her breast, a thumb roughly caressing her nipple until she twisted in his arms, unable to stop herself.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not fools.\u201d His voice was dark as the night. He started nipping her, tiny little bites at the bottom of her ear, at her neck, at the curve of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like an animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like an animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorses nip each other while mating, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never examined the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read it in a book,\u201d she said, twisting again.</p><p>His other hand settled between her thighs, rubbing soft fabric over her delicate folds so that she was panting, gasping a little.</p><p>Suddenly she focused not on the dark outside the glass, but on their reflections. She, with her head thrown back on his shoulder, his dark hair falling over his cheek as he kissed her neck, his strong hands caressing her body as if it were a musical instrument by which he created a song from her gasps, her moans...He was rubbing a little harder and she was helpless, thrusting her hips forward, sobbing a little.</p><p>He turned her body just enough so he could take her mouth, but he didn\u2019t stop touching her.</p><p>\u201cFletch,\u201d she said. It was a whisper, a prayer. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d The words choked in her mouth. Her body was singing a tune she was still only coming to recognize. \u201cPeople\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. They\u2019ve gone to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, she realized that the muffled sound of laughter was gone, and the only sound she could hear was the pant of her own breath.</p><p>He was pulling up her skirts now, her pale legs reflected in the glass until she turned all the way away from her pale image in the window, and slid her hands under his jacket, pulled out his shirt. Remembered that she was not a rag doll.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThis is my turn.\u201d</p><p>He did something with his hand and she sobbed a minute, had to catch her breath and then said, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t undress in here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re making me undress!\u201d He had her gown up around her waist, and then he pushed her back against the glass. It was chilly and unexpectedly sensuous against her bottom: she felt cold and hot at the same time.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even listening to her, just licking her neck and then kissing her chin and her cheek and the bottom of her cheekbone, and then finally taking her mouth. He was savage and soft at the same time, taking and giving, his hand keeping a rhythm that had her twisting against the cold glass, sobbing into his mouth.</p><p>Feeling the sparks fly higher and higher, until her heart was beating to a dance that no one could follow except his fingers as they drove her faster and higher, and then she was sobbing against him. He swallowed her shudders, her little scream, the way she trembled and shook in his arms.</p><p>When it was over she turned into his shoulder. \u201cHow loud was I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His voice sounded strained and rough.</p><p>She started to smile. \u201cWas that my turn or yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo when is it my turn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 51</p><p>Fletch was still a little red in the face, and he seemed slightly short-tempered to Poppy. She was feeling blissfully happy and couldn\u2019t stop smiling, whereas he was definitely irritable. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to go upstairs now?\u201d he asked. \u201cSince it\u2019s your turn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she said, smiling at him. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like...\u201d She stopped and licked her lips, and then thrust out her bottom lip because she wanted to see that flare in his eyes. It was a French thing to do. \u201cI\u2019d like to go outside,\u201d she decided.</p><p>His face went suddenly bleak. \u201cOutside?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe can always go to bed later, Fletch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that you could call me by my real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFle\u2014What is your real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know your own husband\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it for a moment and refused to feel a pang of guilt. \u201cMy mother was scandalized by the mere fact that I addressed you as Fletch rather than Fletcher. If I had started calling you by your Christian name she would have fainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate your mother.\u201d He said it flatly.</p><p>\u201cMy mother said that I shouldn\u2019t return until you had a mistress,\u201d she observed. \u201cSo I wasn\u2019t forced to ser vice you all the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed her so fast that she didn\u2019t even see him move. \u201cForget that ugliness.

And\u2014\u201d He said it into her hair, and at first she didn\u2019t understand and then her heart bounded.</p><p>But there was something she had to say. \u201cI can\u2019t be French all the time, Fletch. I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to lose interest.\u201d</p> <p>He looked down at her, eyes burning. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Her lips were trembling but she still wanted to say it all. Because perhaps, at the end, they could stay friends and if she didn\u2019t have that, her heart would break. That was the worst of it, the thing she realized only when she saw her own reflection in the glass. She looked\u2014she was\u2014a woman in love. The kind of love that you never got over, that was like an illness until death. \u201cBut I just want to say that if it happens, if we could stay friends, Fletch, I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Fletch!\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat is your name, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It was such a simple, solid, respectable name. It seemed to have nothing to do with her exotically fashionable husband.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ever say it in public.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him. His hair was rumpled from the way she clutched him, behind the curtain. But his coat fell in perfect seamless folds. His cravat somehow managed to make rumpled look fashionable. He looked like the most exquisite sprig of fashion in the ton.</p><p>\u201cYour name is John?\u201d</p><p>He looked so furious that she couldn\u2019t stop laughing.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you wanted to take your turn now?\u201d He definitely sounded grumpy.</p> <p>It was perfect for him, of course. John was the man she fell in love with: a solid, thoughtful, powerful prince of a man who loved loyally and truly. Whose exotic exterior had little do with a solid English interior.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn.\u201d She touched his cheek.</p><p>His smile was a little crooked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go outside. For a walk.\u201d</p><p>She had trouble getting him to stop kissing her but finally he followed her.</p><p>A man whose name is John doesn\u2019t stop loving his wife because she isn\u2019t the most beautiful in the room. Or the youngest.Or the least well-read.</p><p>A man named John loves you forever.</p><p>Chapter 52</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go outside. It\u2019s cold. It\u2019s Christmas Eve and it\u2019s snowing. Everyone will think we\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>From the look on the footmen\u2019s faces, they were already certain of that fact. But Poppy, wrapping a woolen scarf around her neck and over her head, said, \u201cYou just want your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I meant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been allowed outside in a snowstorm,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe voice of reason,\u201d he groaned, accepting a pair of fur-lined gloves from the butler.</p><p>\u201cPlease do not lose yourself in the snow,\u201d the butler observed, handing Fletch a little lantern.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cWe could be at risk! Lost in the snow and never recovered until the spring thaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s scarcely snowing now,\u201d Poppy said, taking a lantern for herself and nodding to a footman, who pulled open the great front door.</p><p>Light spilled from the doorway, revealing a world turned into piles of soft cakes covered with spun sugar.</p><p>Poppy danced through the door and Fletch followed.</p><p>\u201cIf Your Graces do not return in an hour, I\u2019ll send the footmen after you,\u201d the butler announced.</p><p>Fletch had the sudden idea that perhaps they could find a warm barn and test Miss Tatlock\u2019s idea that animals could talk on Christmas Eve. And a few other things he had in mind. His turn, for example.</p><p>\u201cTwo hours,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>He felt ravenous. Obsessed.Absolutely mad. What he wanted to do was drag Poppy back upstairs, throw her on the bed and plunge into her. The thought made him so hard that he hardly felt the sting of cold outside. Naturally, Poppy had pranced directly into the snow and was tracking around the side of the house.</p><p>\u201cWait for me,\u201d he bellowed, and then started after her, walking in her footsteps. Snow had to be up to her knees. Courtesy demanded that he break a trail, but if she were so eager that she wanted to plow through drifts, he\u2019d allow her to be the man.</p><p>She was a fast little thing, so he tramped along in her wake, not thinking about much other than her thighs. How soft they were, and white. And how she whimpered last night when he started putting little bites there. And then when he got up a little higher, she stopped whimpering and started...</p><p>Well, what was it? How could it be the same woman he\u2019d made love to for years? What happened to her?</p><p>It made him feel uneasy, as if the ground had shifted under his feet. Only last year she would lie before him like a chilled piece of molded butter, and now she was melting and shrieking. And it wasn\u2019t anything he did, either.</p><p>If he\u2019d tried some new technique, he could have explained it to himself. He started walking slowly, thinking about it. Poppy was already around the corner of the house. He kept thinking that someone must have taught her\u2014but he knew that wasn\u2019t true. There was no other man, except for that puny Dr. Loudan and she didn\u2019t like him that way. She liked to order the poor man about and send him fussy letters about squirrel toes and the like.</p><p>So if she wasn\u2019t melting because of another man, what was it?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t his beauty, though it was embarrassing to think of it that way, because she\u2019d seen plenty of that in the years since they married.</p><p>Just then he heard a little shriek and sped up. He turned the corner fast to find his wife poking under a huge fir tree.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>It was so quiet that his voice seemed swallowed up by snow. But oddly, it wasn\u2019t all that cold. The huge house reared behind them, golden light spilling out of all its windows. No one else was foolish enough to tramp around in the dark.</p><p>\u201cLook at this,\u201d Poppy said, waving her lantern at him. \u201cI believe some animals are living here, under the tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake, it\u2019s probably a bear,\u201d he groaned, plowing through the snow over to her. It was well over the top of his boots. She must be frozen, dragging skirts that had to be lined with ice.</p><p>\u201cThe tracks are much smaller than that. Look!\u201d</p><p>He caught up with her and in a spar of light falling from his lantern, he saw the little footprints. Two tiny ones in front and two longer ones in back.</p><p>He gave a bark of laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s no bear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s an English possum,\u201d Poppy said, giggling. Her eyes were shining. Once he started laughing he could hardly stop.</p><p>\u201cFor a naturalist,\u201d he spluttered, \u201cyou\u2019re pretty slow, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him and then looked back at the tracks. At the way the little ones were spaced, there weren\u2019t too many and...</p><p>\u201cRabbits!\u201d she breathed. \u201cThere\u2019s a rabbit hole under this fir tree.\u201d And without a second\u2019s hesitation, she dropped to her knees and pushed her way right under the huge skirt of branches that jutted above the snow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fletch\u2019s mouth dropped open. For Christ\u2019s sake. \u201cPoppy, get back out here!\u201d he bellowed, leaning down.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Suddenly he thought that rabbits make a good meal for a bear\u2014who might well live under a tree. He dropped to his knees and thrashed his way under the tree so fast that he bumped right into Poppy.</p><p>She was sitting, hugging her knees, as if she were in her own bedchamber. \u201cFletch!\u201d Poppy said, sounding as delighted as if he\u2019d decided to join her for a cup of tea.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d he growled, setting his lantern to the side. The light wavered and went out, leaving only Poppy\u2019s thin flame.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a little room,\u201d she said. \u201cWait a minute, Fletch. Your eyes will get accustomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there any bears in here?\u201d</p><p>But he took a breath.</p><p>\u201cNo rabbits and no bears. But it\u2019s a little house.\u201d</p> <p>A minute later he saw what she meant. The snow had scoured around the fir tree, building little walls that came up to meet the bottom layer of fir. The ground was actually a soft mat of dried needles. The snow filtered light, somehow, so that it was a pearly gray under the tree, except for the shower of yellow light around her lantern. His head just brushed the bottom layer of fir branches.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Poppy. Your skirts must be soaked through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cold,\u201d Poppy said. She was curled up against the fir tree, smiling at him. Her hair was escaping from a thick red wool hat the butler had given her. It was a world away from the elegant little bonnets she used to wear, tipped just so on top of elaborate nests of curls. She looked like a little girl.</p><p>Well, perhaps not so little. Not with that deep sensual lip and the way her eyes were watching him. She wasn\u2019t wearing all the face paint of last night but she didn\u2019t need it. Her lips were the dark plum color of ripe fruit.</p><p>Even as he watched her tongue stole out and wet her lips, and then she rolled out her bottom lip in that way she had and he was harder than the tree trunk.</p><p>There was hardly any room under there, so he crawled forward a bit. \u201cPoppy,\u201d he said slowly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll catch your death. We can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s warm in here,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cThis is a snow cave. I read about them in Gentleman\u2019s Magazine. When Captain Sybil went to the mountains of Peru, they dug snow caves and described them as quite warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not warm,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cMy knees are wet. And my feet are frozen.\u201d He crawled forward again and stopped with his mouth just an inch from her lips. \u201cI want my turn in a proper bed.\u201d</p><p>But she reached out one little red-mittened hand, and before he knew it, he was on his back in a soft bed of needles. She was lying on top of him, and through layers of coat he could feel the soft curves of her body. Plus, she was kissing him. Rather clumsily, it was true. She kept clicking their teeth together.</p><p>But to Fletch\u2019s mind, enthusiasm made up for everything. And when he managed to get his hands under her coat and started to rub her all over (for warmth, naturally), he found that he liked her kissing more and more.</p><p>She was kissing him and snuffling him, and licking his eyebrow and his eyelashes and then swooping down on his mouth whenever he said anything and kissing him into silence. He protested a bit when she started pulling his clothing apart, but by then they\u2019d heated up the little cave. As she kissed her way down his chest, murmuring things about his turn, he felt his temperature go higher and higher.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d he gasped at one point, \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She was playing, letting snow drift from her fingers onto his nipples and his more sensitive parts and then replacing the brief chill with her warm mouth. Being a naturalist, she accompanied her little experiments with a stream of commentary.</p><p>Fletch had never been very noisy in bed. He preferred to devote himself to his partner\u2019s pleasure...but now he found himself helpless in Poppy\u2019s curious hands, helpless under the ministrations of her sweet lips. Strange hoarse noises came from his lips as she played her games, laughing at him, licking him, finally driving him close to mindless pleasure\u2014but not quite close enough.</p><p>Finally he managed to snatch her, wordlessly, wrench up her gown and hold her protesting, an inch from his body for a moment before letting her go. Her sweet wet warmth enveloped him.</p><p>She stopped protesting. Their clothes bunched up between them. He pulled his fur coat around both of them. Snow kept filtering down onto his face like a dusting of sugar...</p><p>It all faded away when he found the way home. The way to her.</p><p>He pulled her closer and closer until there was nothing, no end to her and no start to him, or that\u2019s how it felt.</p><p>Then he arched up, and she cried out. So he did it again, and again, and there in that perfect little room, Poppy found her voice and cried again and again.</p><p>Then she pulled back, sat up so that her head brushed the branches and sent snow all over them, but it melted the moment it struck their bodies.</p><p>She was a natural. Found a rhythm that drove him mad, too slow, too fast, he didn\u2019t know. All he knew was that pressure was building, and the pleasure was like pain, the way she kept slipping, sleek and tight and soft away from him and then coming back when the only thing he wanted was to grab her.</p><p>So finally he did that: grabbed her hips and held her where she had to be, and with a huge roar arched into her. Again and again, as fierce and as hard as he could.</p><p>She was panting and crying out, and he could feel the tension gathering in her body as if it were his own body.</p><p>And when the storm finally broke, it was the same moment for them, a shared moment, a shared tempest, a shared joy.</p><p>Chapter 53</p><p>When Villiers woke up, the bedroom was lit only by one candle. Charlotte was sleeping in a chair next to his bed. The Bible had fallen from her hand and lay half off his bed. He watched her for a bit. Dautry was sleeping in his chair, head awkwardly leaning against the wall.</p><p>It was later than he thought, because far away on the wind, he heard a jangle of church bells. They sounded like wild music, like the fairies that come in the night and steal souls, or children, or whoever it is that they steal.</p><p>The ringing meant that it was Christmas.</p><p>Another Christmas.</p><p>She woke up just then, like a cat from her sleep, and blinked at him.</p><p>He smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cLeopold?\u201d She pushed hair out of her eyes. \u201cOh my God, did I sleep here last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ruined,\u201d he said, hearing the cheer in his own voice. \u201cOf course, no one in Jemma\u2019s house hold will have noticed. I can still sue you for breach of promise if I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreach of promise?\u201d She sat up and stretched and then stopped. Stared at him.Froze.</p><p>He felt as weak as a kitten, but he managed to push up on his pillows.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that I put too much credence in the opinions of my doctors,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cTreglown said that if I survived the night, I was going to live. Do you think I shouldn\u2019t believe him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live to prove the man wrong. Merry Christmas, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuture duchess,\u201d he observed.</p><p>She leapt from her chair. \u201cI\u2019ll be off to my own chamber now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.

Prepare your breach of promise suit, Your Grace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said, half under his breath. She whisked through the door and he reached out for his water glass.

She walked to the window to find that at some point during the night it must have sleeted, because the soft mounds of snow had transformed into a shining, sharp world of icy crystals. Light skittered along the curve of icy-looking snowbanks. Ice coated every twig of the hawthorne and fell in great icicles from the eves of the south wing.</p> <p>Christmas morning.</p><p>Ever since Poppy was small, she had always welcomed Christmas. Her mother rarely lost her temper on Christmas; it was a quiet but celebratory day. They would sit about and her mother would let her skip her three hours of harpsichord practice, and the hour with the song master and the hours dancing. She even watched as Poppy played spillikins, though she always refused to play herself. And they would have gilt-topped gingerbread men to eat, a trip to church with warm bricks at their feet, and finally a roasted peacock for dinner.</p><p>There was a sound of feet and then warm arms wrapped around her waist from behind. \u201cCome back to bed,\u201d said a sleepy voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He was nuzzling her neck, which was very sweet.</p><p>\u201cChristmas is\u2014Christmas is special,\u201d she said, pulling away.</p> <p>\u201cYou are special.\u201d He reached out for her again.</p><p>\u201cFletch, it\u2019s morning.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>She wiggled away. \u201cIt\u2019s not only morning\u2014it\u2019s Christmas morning. All of that\u201d\u2014she waved at the bed\u2014\u201cit isn\u2019t seemly for the morning.\u201d</p><p>His expression darkened a bit. \u201cWhat do you mean by seemly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She stopped. It almost sounded as if she\u2019d heard herself say this before. Her mind skipped back to herself, lecturing Fletch on the inappropriateness of openmouthed kisses on a Christmas some years ago.</p><p>He folded his arms and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be French all the time,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t always feel like making love under a tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even behind the curtains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He was grinning now. \u201cI can live with that. Because there\u2019s always the bed. Look at me, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>She met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014look at me.\u201d</p><p>She started to blush. \u201cIt\u2019s morning, Fletch! My maid will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll either knock first or learn to,\u201d he said. \u201cNow look at me, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>She started chewing on her lower lip, but she let her eyes fall below his neck. He wasn\u2019t wearing drawers. His legs were long and very strong. It was those legs that plowed through the snow last night once he decided to carry her home. And his arms...she loved the way the muscles bulged in his forearms. He\u2019d carried her all the way home as if she weighed no more than a feather. Poppy had nestled against his chest, her whole body boneless and soft and whispered things to him that she was fairly sure he couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Plus, she liked the way his chest came down into a hard little series of valleys. There was a little arrow of hair. And there it was. Not that it could make her blush anymore. Still, her glance lingered in an affectionate sort of way. And even looking made her feel that melting surge of heat again.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said briskly, to cover up the fact that her knees felt a little weak, \u201cI looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for compliments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She turned up her nose. \u201cYou look like a perfectly healthy male in your twenties.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cDon\u2019t I look like the person you love?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes caught, but it was time for the truth. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, yes, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike someone you married not just because your mother wanted you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u201d\u2014her voice caught\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t think she had anything to do with it. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike someone who will be there, beside you, every day for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>She managed a wobbly smile at that one.</p><p>\u201cPoppy, what did you think that Christmas was for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNibbling on gingerbread men?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your Christmas gingerbread man,\u201d he said, just a quirk at the corner of his mouth betraying the fact he was laughing.</p><p>Poppy gathered herself together. \u201cAre you saying that making love to one\u2019s spouse on Christmas is seemly?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her as if she\u2019d won the village archery contest. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you saying that making love in the morning is also seemly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If not vitally important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u201d\u2014and she had to say this one slowly, because it was so important\u2014\u201cthat you won\u2019t lose interest in making love to me if I don\u2019t act like a Frenchwoman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to have to drag you out under a tree all the time either.\u201d He tilted up her face. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Poppy? I love you. I loved you enough to give up sex because you didn\u2019t like it. Now that you do like it...well, I\u2019d like to do it anytime you\u2019ll let me. Under a tree, sure.With a French accent, mais oui. But snuggling in the bed with my oh-so-English wife, after she gives me a lecture on flying squirrels\u2019 toes, always.And for our whole life. So will you, please, come back to bed now?\u201d</p><p>There were tears in her eyes. \u201cI think,\u201d she said softly, \u201cthat I would like to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are married to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI married a duke,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to marry you. My John, who happens to be a duke.\u201d</p><p>He swept her up in his arms. \u201cPerdita, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s seal our engagement.\u201d He swept her off toward the bed and then said, \u201cAre you going to protest?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He deepened his voice to a silly imitation of a preacher. \u201cIt\u2019s most unseemly for unmarried people to make love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kissed his shoulder.

Her voice sounded husky and seductive, except now she knew that it wasn\u2019t French but just desire. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it happened, how I was so lucky. Because it\u2019s true that had you been some other man, some other duke, my mother would have forced me to marry you and I was such a stupid little creature that I would have.

I could feel her disgust\u2014never you, Fletch. Because if I\u2019d really felt you, if I\u2019d really known you, it would have been different. From the very first night together. I just didn\u2019t know you were my husband, not really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was always your husband,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anyone for me since I saw you the first time, Poppy. Never. When you left me, I felt as if my soul had left the house. I kept walking about and pretending to be a normal person, but I was missing this vital part, this soul part\u2014does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this kiss,\u201d she whispered, her lips against his, \u201cI give you my soul.

And I like the squire over there, the one dressed as Henry VIII.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know Henry VIII had a large stomach,\u201d Fletch observed. \u201cBut I think Lord Pladget took liberties in his interpretation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wife told me that he tied the hearth rug around his middle with twine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I thought that Lady Isidore was quite sedate when I first met her,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cBut look at her now!\u201d</p><p>Isidore danced by, dressed as Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra. Her skirt was made of gold tissue and embroidered all over with peacock tails; her bodice wasn\u2019t worth mentioning because there was so little to it.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Poppy moaned. \u201cThat\u2019s Lord Beesby she\u2019s dancing with, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a silly old codger,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cAlways votes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Poppy said. \u201cJust look at the way he\u2019s staring into Isidore\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn love,\u201d Fletch said. \u201cHopeless case, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs he married?\u201d Poppy hissed.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed and they continued dancing down the length of the room, narrowly avoiding a collision with a boisterous peer dressed, rather improbably, as the Pope. His face had turned a ripe purple and he was swaying like the sail of a tall ship. All the talk of costumes made Poppy remember something she\u2019d been meaning to ask.</p><p>\u201cFletch, who was that young man you hired?\u201d she asked.</p><p>But Fletch didn\u2019t hear; he was laughing at the way the Pope stumbled to the floor, bringing a sailor dancing with the Queen of Sheba with him.</p><p>The Queen of Sheba wasn\u2019t quite as amused. Charlotte untangled herself from the Pope\u2019s feet. Dautry pulled her to her feet as if she were a feather, and a moment later they were dancing down the floor again.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth did you learn to dance?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSailors dance,\u201d Dautry said. \u201cBesides, believe it or not, Miss Tatlock, there is civilization outside the ballrooms of the ton.\u201d</p><p>She who had been so snappy and witty with Villiers couldn\u2019t think of anything to say at the moment. It was as if a magic curtain had evaporated and she had returned to being a lumpy old maid. Except that...the old maid was dancing with a flamboyantly masculine man, the kind whom all the women in the room were watching.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to marry him?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to marry Villiers? And don\u2019t\u201d\u2014he added\u2014\u201cthink that I am worried about inheriting the title. My father left me what is often called a shipping fortune. I could buy half London and sell it again, if I wished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally, you must feel some anxiety\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>He pulled her off the ballroom floor and into a small curtained alcove, and with no finesse about it either.</p><p>Suddenly she felt herself a little breathless. \u201cAre you going to marry him?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Her mouth opened but no words came out.</p><p>He bent his head. His mouth wasn\u2019t soft and forgiving: it demanded and took, asked a question she wasn\u2019t ready to answer.</p><p>So she\u2014old maid Charlotte\u2014stepped away from him and put her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He looked a little dazed. At least she wasn\u2019t alone feeling that wild heat when they kissed. \u201cYou\u2019re not sure of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure who I shall marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas a choice been offered?\u201d</p><p>She grinned, knowing that her sister May wouldn\u2019t even have recognized her. She was the Queen of Sheba to night, a woman who commanded men\u2019s hearts. \u201cVilliers is threatening me with a breach of promise suit if I don\u2019t marry him.\u201d</p><p>Dautry snorted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love him.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened.</p><p>She danced one step closer to him. \u201cBut then there\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>The idiot.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that only leaves me the duke, then. You can practice calling me Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were fierce, but softened when he looked to the bottom of her soul, and saw a woman who wanted to stand before the wind and feel salt on her lips.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d he said.</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cI\u2019ll decide next week. Between your proposal and his. Because you did make one, didn\u2019t you? You may have forgotten to say it out loud; I have noticed a certain reticence in your nature.\u201d</p><p>There was a spark of laughter in those black eyes of his. A spark of laughter\u2014and something else, something that made her feel a bit weak behind the knees, and as if there wasn\u2019t enough air in the room.</p><p>Which there wasn\u2019t once he started kissing her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Fletch said.</p><p>\u201cThe young man you hired,\u201d Poppy repeated. \u201cWhere did you find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich young man?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe one who pretended to be in love with my mother.\u201d</p><p>His face went utterly still. \u201cOh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cThat young man.The one who defended my mother\u2019s reputation so bravely. He obviously had a certain amount of dramatic talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather picture your mother\u2019s affection for a handsome young lad?\u201d</p> <p>Fletch smiled winningly, but Poppy just shook her head. \u201cIs he here to night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, no,\u201d Fletch said, giving in. \u201cHe was, how shall I put it, a gentleman of the night. A night-walker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentleman of the\u2014\u201d Poppy\u2019s eyes went round. \u201cReally! Where on earth did you find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply asked a woman who knows about that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cAnd what woman might that be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA young relative of Mrs. Armistead, Fox\u2019s consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even aware you were acquainted with Mrs. Armistead.\u201d</p><p>He swept her off the dance floor and then looked down at his own sweet wife. \u201cYou do realize how much I love you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re jealous. Her name is Cressida, and she is very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not jealous,\u201d she said instantly, wrinkling her nose at him. \u201cSo you have been consorting with night-walkers and day-walkers and Fox-walkers\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery clever,\u201d he said, reprehensibly kissing her right in the ballroom.</p><p>But Poppy had the sense that the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s Twelfth Night Ball would be the subject of gossip for years, and a marital kiss or two wouldn\u2019t receive much attention.</p><p>Naturally, now that the Duke of Villiers was on the mend, the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s chess matches\u2014with her husband, with Villiers\u2014had flared into a wild source of gossip again.</p><p>\u201cDid you beat him?\u201d Mrs. Patton asked, pausing for a moment in the ladies\u2019 retiring room.</p><p>Jemma threw her a lazy wink. \u201cDo you doubt it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after the way you have thrashed me in the last few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took a very nice game off me last night,\u201d Jemma pointed out. \u201cThat was a very cunning move with your castle. You utterly foxed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rare victory,\u201d Mrs. Patton said. \u201cBut none the less enjoyed for that! So you won the game with your husband...and finished the game with Villiers as well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlas,\u201d Jemma said, frowning at herself.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sacrificed and sacrificed, a whole battlefield of them. Brilliant, ruthless and cunning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo both matches continue to a third and final game,\u201d Mrs. Patton said. \u201cFascinating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the final games are to be played blindfolded,\u201d Jemma said, rubbing a bit of ruby color on her lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014or so I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Mrs. Patton said, pausing delicately.</p><p>\u201cIn bed,\u201d Jemma confirmed.</p><p>\u201cIn bed with the Duke of Villiers,\u201d Mrs. Patton said, rather dreamily. \u201cThere\u2019s not a married woman in En gland who wouldn\u2019t consider sacrificing her queen for the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers refuses to play the game until he is fully recovered. He says six months.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Patton laughed. \u201cWill you play your husband immediately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jemma said, tucking in an errant curl. \u201cI won our game a while ago and we haven\u2019t had time to discuss the topic. That\u2019s a decision for another day...\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>The Nursery, the Fletcher Estate Seven years later December 25</p><p>It was Christmas, and a small girl was singing rather tunelessly, the way untalented but cheerful children do: \u201cI saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>Her father joined her, his deep smooth voice sliding like chocolate below her piping high one. \u201cI saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas Day in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Then she squealed. People do that when they find themselves suddenly sailing through the air and landing on someone\u2019s shoulders. Even if they are small people, who should be used to this kind of mishandling.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d Clementina said, clutching the Duke of Fletcher\u2019s hair. \u201cYou must stop doing that. Grandm\u00e8re told me that I shouldn\u2019t shriek because I\u2019m a young lady. But you made me shriek. It wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>Her father obligingly dipped her upside down until she screamed even more loudly, so much so that they attracted attention from the other person in the room.</p><p>Before Fletch realized what was happening, plump little arms wrapped around his legs and a set of five sharp teeth, two on the top and three on the bottom, clamped together. \u201cYou let Clemmie go!\u201d screamed a voice only slightly obscured by a mouthful of silk stocking. \u201cYou let Clemmie go, bad Papa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my stockings, Alexander,\u201d Fletch said, putting Clementina down on the ground so fast that her hair flew up around her shoulders like corn silk. \u201cOh dash it,\u201d he groaned, unwinding his son from his leg, \u201cthat\u2019s the death knell for another pair of stockings. Now what will poor Morton say?\u201d</p><p>Alexander had no sympathy for the duke\u2019s valet. He was too busy correcting the duke himself. \u201cYou\u2019s not nice to Clemmie,\u201d he said. Then: \u201cAssander, up!\u201d</p><p>Fletch swung his son up on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Papa,\u201d Clementina said, tugging his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend we see three ships!\u201d</p><p>She danced her way over to the window, dragging him behind. \u201cI saw three ships come sailing in...\u201d she started over. This time he let her sing it alone, standing there with her warm little hand clutching his, and Alexander\u2019s plump knees next to his ears. Clementina swayed back and forth, obviously seeing tall sailing ships glide over the snowy lawn.</p><p>Then he turned around, because somehow he always knew when his wife was in a room. Their daughter kept singing, wildly off-key, so Fletch just smiled rather than interrupt her. Alexander made a cooing sound and started bouncing in a way that indicated either a wish to learn to fly\u2014or a wish to be in his mother\u2019s arms.</p><p>Poppy\u2019s smile was so beautiful that Fletch felt his heart almost break from the joy of it all as he tucked her under his arm. Alexander put a hand on his mother\u2019s curls and they all looked out the window as Clementina sang on. \u201cOn Christmas day in the morning!\u201d she carrolled, coming to a stop.</p><p>Poppy looked as if she might move, so Fletch put his son down and snatched his wife into his arms instead. \u201cHello,\u201d he said. She was as lovely as the moment he first saw her in Paris, and as delicious as the first time they made love under a fir tree.</p><p>The children were so used to their parents embracing that Alexander toddled away and Clementina picked up her doll and began crooning to her, a special rendition of\u2014yes!\u2014\u201cThree Ships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas,\u201d Fletch said, dusting Poppy\u2019s lips with a kiss. And then another one because she tasted good, and she smelled good, and she was his. \u201cDo you remember when I first kissed you like this, on the tower of Saint Germain d\u00e9s Pres?\u201d He gave her a kiss to illustrate, a deep, possessive kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she said a little breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019ll smack you with my muff.\u201d</p><p>Fletch let his hands slide over his wife\u2019s derri\u00e8re. \u201cI love these new fashions,\u201d he said dreamily. \u201cI never want to see a pannier again in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas,\u201d she said, brushing a lock of hair out of his eyes, \u201cis my favorite day of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour day...\u201d he said, leaning closer, \u201cto nibble gingerbread men.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what the chef made this year?\u201d she asked, eyes wide and innocent.</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGingerbread ladies!Covered with gold and quite, quite edible.\u201d</p><p>Fletch grinned. \u201cAre you saying that it\u2019s my turn?\u201d</p><p>Poppy leaned in and gave him a kiss that suddenly turned into something sweeter and deeper, the way things did on Christmas Day. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to fight for it,\u201d she whispered, some time later.</p> <p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Fletch asked, having lost track of the situation. \u201cPoppy, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>She craned her neck instantly. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Alexander was their darede vil, but no, he was busily banging a toy carriage against the brick hearth in a manner guaranteed to destroy its wheels.</p><p>\u201cNot Alexander,\u201d Fletch said, catching her face in his hands. \u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t a dream?\u201d</p><p>Never mind the fact that women all over London sighed when they caught a glimpse of Fletch. Nor the fact that his party in the House of Lords turned as one man to the Duke of Fletcher when they needed a brilliant speech\u2014and a clear victory. And finally the fact that his wife gave every sign of being tremendously happy in bed and out...her own darling husband never quite believed that he was worth it.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d she said, a grin curling her mouth. \u201cDid you know that last night was Christmas Eve and that meant that donkeys were able to speak in human voices?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cIs this something my wife the naturalist has noticed? Have you written a letter to poor Loudan? Maybe this fact will be the one that finally gets him the university professorship he would never deserve without all your editing of his work. Although I\u2019m sure the university would rather hire a certain P.F., author of a recent treatise on possums.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou may not have noticed,\u201d she said lovingly, \u201cbut I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a donkey in the room now and he\u2019s not speaking English anymore. It almost sounds as if...as if he didn\u2019t hear all those things I said last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the Duchess of Fletcher just called her husband an ass,\u201d he observed. \u201cI knew you took after your mother!\u201d Then he ducked when she swatted at him.</p><p>\u201cThose things I said last night...\u201d She could feel herself getting a little pink, even all these years into their marriage. \u201cLast night,\u201d she whispered, \u201cafter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter supper?\u201d His eyes were laughing at her.</p><p>Despite their years together, Poppy wasn\u2019t very good at saying things out loud, though she\u2019d become very good indeed at doing them in private. So instead she just pulled his head down and kissed him with all her heart, with the joy that comes from being truly loved, and truly loving.</p><p>With the joy that comes from knowing one\u2019s children are utterly convinced they are lovable, and never fear a harsh word or a blow.</p><p>With the joy that comes from having a secret.</p><p>But after a while she remembered that her secret was meant to be a Christmas present, so she whispered, \u201cMerry Christmas, John,\u201d and took his hand in hers.</p> <p>There was no more than a graceful curve under Fletch\u2019s hand. \u201cA baby?\u201d he said, incredulous. \u201cA baby?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, tears prickling her eyes. \u201cAnother baby.\u201d</p><p>And then Fletch was swinging her around and around in a great laughing circle that swept Alexander into her arms, and Clementina wiggled between them, all of them shrieking and laughing and saying it over and over, \u201cA baby! A baby!\u201d</p><p>Which made sense. As it was a Baby\u2019s birthday, after all. </p> </body></html>"]
